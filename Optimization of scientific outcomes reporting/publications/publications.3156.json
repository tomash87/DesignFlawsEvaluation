Due to the extremely long length of such routes, delivery times and costs per cargo unit are extremely important. Delays in various types of transport and in the case of cargo transshipment are associated not only with the growth of cargo flows but also with the inconsistency of vehicle schedules. The purpose of this study is to improve the previously developed methodology for optimizing multimodal cargo transportation, taking into account the need for its application to transnational transport corridors. The content of the formulated network problem is reduced to a modification of the traveling salesman problem with an unknown number of transport points the route should pass through. Such a problem is NP-hard due to the time complexity of the algorithms. A modified algorithm has been developed, according to which the general problem with the number of N points is divided into several subproblems. Transport points are grouped into consecutive subsets that are related by only one non-alternative way of transportation. This way can be any “bottleneck” of the transport network or an artificially created one. Such a decomposition of the problem gives a set of partial solutions, which were combined into the final optimal solution. The obtained solution to the routing problem of multimodal routes takes into account the cyclical schedules of the transport operation and gives a guaranteed exact optimum for calculations performed within the permissible time. In addition to determining the optimal route, the algorithm makes it possible to determine the required number of vehicles and their work schedules depending on the total cargo flow on the route."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943823","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65fac6ee4097074a181f2059","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"8f07a009-9650-4034-9e60-ce79a869849b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"157-170","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://transportproblems.polsl.pl/pl/Archiwum/2024/zeszyt1/2024t19z1_13.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba60fdbe833174261a0a","name":"Aliya","lastName":"Toktamyssova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5b401c5-bc6a-4208-8b00-3bfe8b94eef9"},{"objectId":"6839ba60fdbe833174261a09","name":"Guldana","lastName":"Bikhimova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05d0e615-8ed4-41a7-848f-b1a6990a51b5"},{"objectId":"6839ba60fdbe833174261a08","name":"Vitor","lastName":"Danchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"566ae280-faa6-4369-9389-1da55532c330"},{"objectId":"6839ba60fdbe833174261a07","name":"Myroslav","lastName":"Oliskevych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61a5bfb3-5b08-4e99-9441-a47767f9ffb7"},{"objectId":"6839ba60fdbe833174261a06","name":"Zakira","lastName":"Tursymbekova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b6d6d9b-ff67-4b25-9430-1f181e118141"},{"objectId":"67da3a38ece39867be099472","name":"Ihor","lastName":"Taran","uuid":"FB445DA2102ECEEEC2BE5180BF31EE15611D4C1E15F70B3D5423658EAB81B29250ED0E00225BB7A40D54CBB1B8890CD6E07A58F4CC90AEB773DB74189A9B6441","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d06d7fee-bb7e-43bd-aac8-4973bd190e1f"}],"doi":"10.20858/tp.2024.19.1.13"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["deflection","sterilization","implants","3D printing"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

However, in order not to lose its importance, it must meet the challenge of modern civilization. The safety, reliability, and efficiency of railway transport, to a large degree, depend on using highly integrated electronics, which are very sensitive to various disturbances generated in the electric traction system and train or coming from the environment. One of the sources of electromagnetic disturbances are high-voltage (HV) power lines running close to the railway infrastructure. The purpose was to assess the electromagnetic impact of overhead HV transmission lines on buried signaling cables of the railway traffic control system crossbreeding with them. The levels of voltage induced in the cable under steady state and the earth fault in the HV line at various soil resistivity were estimated. A software tool based on a hybrid numerical method that combines circuit theory and electromagnetic field theory was used for computations. It was found that very high voltages may be induced in the signaling cables during earth faults in the HV lines, which may lead to serious interference or damage to the equipment. The results provide useful knowledge for implementing modern railway traffic control systems and protection measures."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943825","journalIssue":{"objectId":"665046ec4097072d86567935","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"04521305-940e-4808-a908-af95274230e5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/11/2554","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9e9fdbe833174261702","name":"Renata","lastName":"Markowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2d8a9a0-8470-4a04-b16f-2c8ad4a117ab"},{"objectId":"6839b9e9fdbe833174261701","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ebf1cc47-ab09-4b0b-ad5b-c1b971bda91b"},{"objectId":"6839b9e9fdbe833174261700","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Mielnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24277c0e-b005-4c9d-879f-31c5972d589f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5d0","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ziemba","uuid":"92318D5993FADD48EECB99C25BF68B95D1583F973C0A2FFCECE3470947458DD98B2AD5DF51FC7E388931C9D24B68F9C0451F1B6522792C3691FE2317A9FC78C2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2743-1153","documentHash":"a762c94b-bfb8-4604-bac8-8d43b6b6c6b4"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17112554"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["emission","CO2","vehicles","pollution","CNG","artificial intelligence","chassis dynamometer","PEMS"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The amount of wood flour and preliminary processing parameters were determined on the basis of preliminary tests. The aim of the optimization was to find the configuration of important parameters of the injection process to obtain molded pieces of good quality, in terms of aesthetics, dimensions, and mechanical properties. The products tested for quality were dog bone specimens. The biocomposite was produced using a single-screw extruder, whereas molded pieces were made using an injection molding process. The Taguchi method was applied to optimize the injection molding parameters, which determine the products quality. Control factors were selected at three levels. The L27 orthogonal plan was used. For each set of input parameters from this plan, four processing tests were performed. The sample weight, shrinkage, elongation at break, tensile strength, and Young’s modulus were selected to assess the quality of the molded parts. As a result of the research, the processing parameters of the tested biocomposite were determined, enabling the production of good-quality molded pieces. No common parameter configuration was found for different optimization criteria. Further research should focus on finding a different range of technological parameters. At the same time, it was found that the range of processing parameters of the produced biocomposite, especially processing temperature, made it possible to use it in the Wood Polymer Composites segment."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943827","journalIssue":{"objectId":"666945b34097074fa1a3b58c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"12","doi":null,"documentHash":"19bd9e30-c50b-40d8-ad3e-73210c440e98"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/12/2955","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba79fdbe833174261ac4","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Szawara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f8eeffe-8e07-4472-aad8-3ed19317a713"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e7092c5878c28a04739c5a2","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"C91A5294B62067B92F5597F01629ACBE5DAE79FB0A78F75EF14DAAF61866D8CF9F70E56076BD9F459758BFA7E215CDE9555E6C8506F90BDBFEFBB405C8F566AB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9765-637X","documentHash":"50ba8ef4-394d-4958-8c16-d4ddb222fa8b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c448","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bąk","uuid":"EB5F84BFD3D3723D5BF11F34CEA4F64CC6D72908B86519720FB025B682332A9552F8899BCB664DAFF8FE6C71F5331608A9C352084CDB1C9E1D019D1F196BDD60","orcidId":"0000-0001-8164-3160","documentHash":"2f5471e2-3e3b-47e9-9f19-968cbed38120"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739521d","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Frącz","uuid":"A12F4710061BE1A084076A586D6D9F2482CEE0FDB43CB0E118BA549A57C266F7C259F169A8F8E6B82A41DADA81F73D1E6B4F31B783A892E4AFF0492A732281FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2079-359X","documentHash":"c14600ef-2c7b-4dea-8336-c2e702e0ed90"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17122955"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["trigonometric model","polynomial-trigonometric model","traffic flow","regression","Prediction","Random Forest model","smart city"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The dynamically changing production environment and sudden changes in customer expectations force us to take precise and well-thought-out development steps. Furthermore, it is important to anticipate favourable product changes to prepare for market changes over time. This is still an open problem. The aim of this study was to develop a method to predict the quality of potential product prototypes resulting from the proposed modifications of the product features. This methodology takes into account current customer expectations. The method was created based on the principles of creating Quality Function Deployment (QFD) in the context of taking into account current and future customer expectations regarding product features. This is a new approach to analysing product quality within the principles of the traditional QFD method. The originality of the study is the technique used in the method to estimate the expected values of product features and their importance (weights), taking into account current customer expectations. Its originality is also manifested in drawing conclusions supporting the decision-making process of product improvement, because it involves ensuring the pro-quality modification of selected features of current products in the order that is most advantageous from the customer’s point of view. The use of the proposed method allows for the analysis of the impact of modifying the current value of a product feature. The method is illustrated with an example of a vacuum cleaner for home use.

Większa gęstość odpadu, niższe koszty transportu oraz zmniejszenie poziomu wilgotności wpływają na wzrost cen sprzedażowych brykietu metalowego. Ponadto zbrykietowany materiał mniej poddaje się wpływowi warunków atmosferycznych – zmniejsza się jego utlenianie. Skutkuje to wzrostem jakości materiału w fazie stopionej. Dodatkową zaletą jest możliwość łatwego załadowania i umieszczenia brykietu bezpośrednio w piecu topielnym, co eliminuje konieczność przeprowadzania procesów usuwania pozostałości chłodziw obróbkowych.

In many cases, chip briquetting is a solution with many advantages: it reduces their volume by up to 50%, is more efficient in terms of their management and transport, enables the recovery of oils and coolants, and also generates low energy and volume losses during melting in the steelworks. Higher waste density, lower transport costs and reduced humidity levels increase the sales prices of metal briquettes. Moreover, the briquetted material is less susceptible to the influence of weather conditions – its oxidation is reduced. This results in an increase in the quality of the material in the molten phase. An additional advantage is the ability to easily load and place the briquettes directly in the melting furnace, which eliminates the need to remove residual machining coolants. In the article, the authors undertook research related to the consolidation of chips in order to obtain their moisture content below 3%."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943831","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b90afdbe8331742610c2","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":null,"number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"f6d9e052-d5a3-46c1-8622-f26e089850b3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"34-38","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mechanik.media.pl/artykuly/the-process-of-dynamic-selection-of-metallic-materials-and-their-consolidation.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b90afdbe8331742610c6","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Kiełbasa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e9f25014-6613-4793-b794-05ba84b9c3fa"},{"objectId":"6839b90afdbe8331742610c5","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Szęszoł","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9870e5e2-be80-4e3f-8742-bc3312193032"},{"objectId":"6839b90afdbe8331742610c4","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kloc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4412527e-d149-497b-9dda-80ce4ff8d895"},{"objectId":"6839b90afdbe8331742610c3","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bałon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd29aa50-d4df-4706-8c01-8dc50ccc533a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395210","name":"Edward","lastName":"Rejman","uuid":"04BA8742343788322CC9388E4527FD96FBC4E0A51F8D15F31556209BC5350386CD2B36D29A7BBB4C857C310259CFD335B52A8E87648E065D85F1C56F67C333B2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4716-7513","documentHash":"8a38ef87-6480-4832-aef8-5ca04d54f18a"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f2","name":"Robert","lastName":"Smusz","uuid":"FE66FF6ECC09BF4BF380BF8B84DE5C51FEDDB376EEDA3882B75D955C736E7DEE934A1EB1C532443C00D39522BC88CF03DCC0D806647FBEFC4DE700D518D64887","orcidId":"0000-0001-7369-1162","documentHash":"df9f331b-0d30-44e2-bd21-767a67b39101"}],"doi":"10.17814/mechanik.2024.4.7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["foresight","management","tourism destination","scenario","destination management organisation"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","uid":"bFitDBcx4YvxolIt7JKxDiw","uuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","parentUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","rootUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Gdańsku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709298878c28a047398b66"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Applying the concept of foresight method for building tourism destination management scenarios","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479cfd","mniswId":"2928","title":"Bulletin of Geography.

Boride coatings were deposited on alloyed structural steels grades(PN/EN 10084standard): 16MnCr5, 18CrNiMo7-6, 41CrAlMo742CrMo4. Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 30 mm and a height of 30 mm were boronized in powder at 1000oC for 2, 4and 6hours in an argon atmosphere. The process was carried out in an industrial CVD Bernex BPX 325S device. The microstructurewas analyzedusing scanning electron microscope Phenom XL equipped with EDS spectrometer.

Additionally, these elements are utilized in a wide range of products manufactured by tech companies, including smartphones, aerospace components, and microelectronics. This paper aims to investigate the interplay between rare earth element prices (REMX), clean energy innovations (NEX), and the market of tech companies (PSE) from February 2018 to February 2023. To analyze the interdependencies between these markets, the study employs the cross-quantilogram (CQ) and wavelet local multiple correlation (WLMC) techniques. The findings of the investigation reveal a positive correlation between rare earth elements and the clean energy market, but only when both markets are in their respective extreme quantiles (10th and 90th). However, when the clean energy market is in a lower quantile and REMX is in a higher one for an extended period, there is either no significant interdependence or a negative relationship. Furthermore, the study identifies a positive co-movement between PSE and REMX in the short, intermediate, and extremely long-term. However, this relationship turns negative in the long run. The values of the coefficients fluctuate over time, particularly at larger scale periods of 8–16 when using the WLMC procedure. These findings have notable implications for stakeholders, including investors, managers, and policymakers, who are linked to the field of mineral resources and industries reliant on rare earth element-based technologies."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943835","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a147f84097071121a96b7c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"89","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"0bafda36-31cf-4620-86b6-3140e32bfe8f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301420723013260?via=ihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b75bfdbe83317426040f","name":"Md.

Based on annually-updated accident statistics made available by the police, as well as the new pedestrian traffic regulations in force, detailed work was undertaken to assess the level of visibility of pedestrians by drivers in pedestrian crossing areas. The research was carried out by analyzing several characteristic cases of pedestrian crossings occurring in Poland, in which there was only dedicated lighting for crossings, only street lighting, and a variant of coexistence of both of the above lighting solutions. Illuminance measurements were made in the horizontal and vertical planes of pedestrian crossings, and the results were confronted with the relevant guidelines. The next step involved a complementary measurement of the luminance distribution of the vertical plane containing the pedestrian and a portion of the sub- and super-horizontal background. Visibility pedestrians was considered in positive and negative contrast variants, and was then related to the obtained results of the illumination distribution. The analysis of the results of the study indicated the possibility of limited visibility of pedestrians at the crossings despite the satisfactory results obtained from measurements of the illuminance distribution within the crossings."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943835","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65fc12154097075721b6ad3c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"73","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"8bf9faf9-567a-4aab-9681-b9de4c24377f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"145-164","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/148862/edition/130559/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b87dfdbe833174260c97","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Różowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af56ebb2-7e3a-4f4a-b3c6-6b8f55360476"},{"objectId":"6839b87dfdbe833174260c96","name":"Ľubomír","lastName":"Beňa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7135d71a-7b9c-4e09-9621-4de1c7c66527"},{"objectId":"6839b87dfdbe833174260c95","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Różowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55bcbe62-0d11-43cb-b3e2-7b2bc6807bb2"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d565","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Leśko","uuid":"4AFB9D25B8B7B8C779E558E84E75CCCC699E160099F1C50C5CA0070D8B4435CFFFAC6B984161BC407837E8BBFA9CA343859D2D3D9D0556D9955FA9A8ED26D914","orcidId":"0000-0001-6008-2931","documentHash":"ffe2c85d-9f67-4306-9dc4-ef6a427659e2"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d555","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Baran","uuid":"2E596C541F0EEF80C90A475F004AA567B05DEF03F4C632D9F85A9D2E0522A5603C61BCC980DAF88DA36092742EAEFFBE013027693B890150129B470F81BA1468","orcidId":"0000-0001-6150-0461","documentHash":"b465ce01-8ae8-4aa1-841d-b6f5f80a4fa1"}],"doi":"10.24425/aee.2024.148862"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pollution","Microplastic","Leaching","Modeling","Phthalates"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Utilizing a Fractional Factorial Central Composite Experimental Plan, this study seeks to develop precise predictive statistical models that enable forecasting the quantity of pollutants generated during the degradation of microplastics under various environmental conditions. This tool was applied to model changes in DOC (dissolved organic carbon) and DEHP (bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate) values during the degradation of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems.

This study employs various advanced econometric tests and methodologies for analytical purposes, utilizing quarterly data from 1990 to 2020. The results reveal the asymmetric effects of ICT on the energy transition across the sampled economies. For instance, the energy transition process benefits from increased ICT installation in the cases of Canada, France, Italy, Japan, and the UK while looking at lower to higher quantiles. However, in the cases of China, Germany, Spain, and the USA, ICT enhances and hinders green energy production across different quantiles. Conversely, India consistently experiences adverse effects of ICT on its energy transition throughout all quantiles. Additionally, a continuous wavelet transformation causality test is applied to validate the reliability of the quantile-quantile regression (QQR) estimates. The causality test results suggest a significant causal link between ICT and renewable energy (RE) in all cases, underscoring the robustness and reliability of these findings for informing policy recommendations. Consequently, based on these findings, the study puts forth several noteworthy policy recommendations for the relevant authorities."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943837","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a28f524097071218b4e62c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"221","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"5d7df5a7-dedb-4ba3-8e8e-ff2fb03d90ff"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148123016695","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b70dfdbe8331742601fb","name":"Muhammad Zubair","lastName":"Chishti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f6037d2d-dc48-407f-9f17-dd514202b8c2"},{"objectId":"6839b70dfdbe8331742601fa","name":"Luo","lastName":"Shunjun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"720d5803-8044-418d-ae6b-7b762f713a34"},{"objectId":"6839b70dfdbe8331742601f9","name":"Xie","lastName":"Peijun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b32989f-e94a-4d27-980d-860e03bfe423"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0897","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szetela","uuid":"5EAC6E4D29CEBB2435E967921E580EE6621742559BAE3820D0A768F20B29EDD4E13875A40E5BFD94E6E5C6A4C8D5E2489E18E8E5CC253C4A1313112C6C1683B6","orcidId":"0000-0002-7421-2378","documentHash":"6c4620b1-7c56-4978-90a1-b8a1e758cf71"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.renene.2023.119754"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7934-736-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The standard Bridgman method produced blade castings with clusters of equiaxed grains in platform areas above the root corners containing long freckle chains. The mechanism proposed considers the curvature of the liquidus isotherm and suggests that isolated dendrite fragments move upward from the freckle channel to the melt of the platform area. The floating surviving grains settle at the columnar dendrite tips, where they continue to grow into large equiaxed grains that block the development of the single-crystal structure in the platform area located above the root corners. To eliminate these defects from the platform, a new approach is proposed, which involves introducing inner radiation baffles (IRBs) along the mold height to control the liquidus isotherm curvature in the blade. This stops the movement of small dendritic fragments from the root corner to the platform area, resulting in a significant reduction of freckles at the root and obtaining a typical single-crystal structure free of equiaxed grains in the platform."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943838","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b70bfdbe8331742601e8","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"26","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"c1ccf7b0-f45c-4829-8bb8-acc3bcb098e5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adem.202301161","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d57f","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Szeliga","uuid":"78BBAF7DB281CDAF16234879DEAA583EC016E35F0D93EFEC7543747AD75EF4D66B427B7E2E41E1FEA940690C70848907A599D5D0426065ECE91166B998D595DE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4092-4550","documentHash":"f1a27403-4fa7-4004-ba6b-0d4baea58d42"}],"doi":"10.1002/adem.202301161"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["shorted turns","induction machine","correlation","diagnostic methods","wavelet packet analysis","vibrations"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a9878c28a0473ae96d","5e70934f878c28a0473a6fd7","63520429752340623bbf0129"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analysis of the correlation between vibrations and the number of shorted turns in the stator winding of a squirrel‑cage induction machine","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c3e","mniswId":"1664","title":"Archives of Electrical Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"1427-4221","eissn":"2300-2506","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"9516688e-b374-4395-91e9-3918e3eaf83e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839b60cfdbe833174260065","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63520429752340623bbf0129","5e7093a9878c28a0473ae96d","5e70934f878c28a0473a6fd7"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a method of diagnosing a squirrel-cage induction motor based on the results of machine vibration analysis.

Regarding the processing methods, chemical surface treatment contributed to reducing Ra and Rz parameters by about 80% for both analyzed printing methods, while mechanical surface treatment resulted in a reduction of approximately 40% for SLS samples and 30% for MJF samples. On the other hand, dyeing and applying an antibacterial coating did not significantly affect the Ra and Rz parameter values. Considering the obtained results, the recommended manufacturing method for orthosis is the MJF method, and the finishing process should include mechanical treatment followed by dyeing."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943840","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b874fdbe833174260c4f","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"238","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"78fdcf5f-db5d-449d-b40f-ca5e395fc289"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1694-1708","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09544054231202423","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b874fdbe833174260c50","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Zakrecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3170cf39-e0fb-4c64-be42-c93b25de8689"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b089a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Turek","uuid":"184E127E4FB99D54AA64869AC593073FCF0CDC80CBDA06041D5261F813F2E7957340952D9226A38CC18CC1899D01D28C58F7ADF099EB94C708E805CD6D92EB97","orcidId":"0000-0002-5926-4815","documentHash":"4947f918-0aaa-4212-a107-b57f9be44a9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d590","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bazan","uuid":"967FA371E29ED24ABF925F07CF6105EBD710EFFB90D7C575C0B3F590212E5F0CCB7B0DF7314061152A17200174064F63FFA47AA54CA7A33B2DCED033D81E5ABB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3958","documentHash":"2774275d-15c9-4ad4-9054-26be33ad88fb"}],"doi":"10.1177/09544054231202423"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cross-correlation","Prediction","business cycle","industry","Germany"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The machining with a milling cutter with a higher blade angle was shown to cause an increase in the temperature in the cutting zone. However, during machining with a sharper blade of cutting tool, a decrease of cutting forces was not observed.

Additionally, a model was created allowing us to determine whether the pro-environmental approach is associated with other purchase determinants identified in the factor analysis. (2) Methods: Verification of the objective was carried out using, i.a., a survey method, Delphi and factor analysis, econometric modeling, and the Kruskal–Wallis test. (3) Results: The most significant factors declared by respondents from Generation Z of the V4 countries influencing pro-quality and pro-environmental purchasing decisions from this industry were product price (3.959), previous personal experience with the product (3.959), expected product life (durability) (3.809), and individual customer needs (3.615). The least important determinants were the period for which the product was on the market (2.843) then, surprisingly, product packaging (2.902), and ecolabel (2.921). (4) Conclusions: Interpreting the resulting model, it can be concluded that as the assessment of knowledge and experience as well as the assessment of the brand and image increased, the assessment of the importance of pro-ecological factors also increased. Branding and image are more linked to environmental activities."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943844","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c9f27940970762634a1497","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"16","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"76bc2897-2232-4ee6-8ac5-f481a5909abe"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/4/1560","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b7effdbe833174260877","name":"Iveta","lastName":"Vozňáková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b7460c44-7455-44c6-9a45-7df862f3cd71"},{"objectId":"6839b7effdbe833174260876","name":"Beáta","lastName":"Gavurová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"888e304b-6436-4021-9afb-9279a71cf756"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d614","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Hajduk-Stelmachowicz","uuid":"570EED2206481807EE1C98B9D8E05831536496E66472F987997FAC4E71B7E2D17CA6E058AE624F8A77CFC173E59013C9F5FB99DD6ED255BB9F41B9BBD50EC6FE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4945-7207","documentHash":"735e9246-e8f9-4261-8b08-cd24874bc0c7"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c40e","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Bełch","uuid":"411D27C3734C178EACC74DC430DB3DF215CDC3E85475FCE5EEAC8F1AF947C3CC25AA96B39C8E56BFE079154D6AF9B5AEA71363A5A4C75501F8E5D907B4B9B32D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6877-2870","documentHash":"61d8d6f6-9d93-4c68-9590-6c03cbfc1220"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395250","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Chudy-Laskowska","uuid":"735E70402C9B0C7983261628D22B6169C79EFC91CA7B3789D517A8914BEADF1226458E338AB4F307265B1FCC5C81242D02A278047EE0892D686511CD1DA395B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7797-2858","documentHash":"a4cc7ca7-ff20-41a6-9258-a558f395ecdd"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16041560"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Although there has been research on the analysis of the environmental impact of batteries during their life cycle (LCA), there is still a lack of comparative analyses focusing on the first phase, i.e., the extraction and processing of materials. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to perform a detailed comparative analysis of popular electric vehicle batteries. The research method was based on the analysis of environmental burdens regarding the ecological footprint of the extraction and processing of materials in the life cycle of batteries for electric vehicles. Popular batteries were analyzed: lithium-ion (Li-Ion), lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), and three-component lithium nickel cobalt manganese (NCM). The ecological footprint criteria were carbon dioxide emissions, land use (including modernization and land development) and nuclear energy emissions. This research was based on data from the GREET model and data from the Ecoinvent database in the OpenLCA programme. The results of the analysis showed that considering the environmental loads for the ecological footprint, the most advantageous from the environmental point of view in the extraction and processing of materials turned out to be a lithium iron phosphate battery. At the same time, key environmental loads occurring in the first phase of the LCA of these batteries were identified, e.g., the production of electricity using hard coal, the production of quicklime, the enrichment of phosphate rocks (wet), the production of phosphoric acid, and the uranium mine operation process. To reduce these environmental burdens, improvement actions are proposed, resulting from a synthesized review of the literature. The results of the analysis may be useful in the design stages of new batteries for electric vehicles and may constitute the basis for undertaking pro-environmental improvement actions toward the sustainable development of batteries already present on the market."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943845","journalIssue":{"objectId":"60535ec02467f04a40ff32c8","year":"2020","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"12","doi":"10.3390/su12166438","documentHash":"b8ecad9e-f3cb-454c-82af-df0647aac3d5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/12/5005","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e7092c5878c28a04739c5a2","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"C91A5294B62067B92F5597F01629ACBE5DAE79FB0A78F75EF14DAAF61866D8CF9F70E56076BD9F459758BFA7E215CDE9555E6C8506F90BDBFEFBB405C8F566AB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9765-637X","documentHash":"50ba8ef4-394d-4958-8c16-d4ddb222fa8b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c448","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bąk","uuid":"EB5F84BFD3D3723D5BF11F34CEA4F64CC6D72908B86519720FB025B682332A9552F8899BCB664DAFF8FE6C71F5331608A9C352084CDB1C9E1D019D1F196BDD60","orcidId":"0000-0001-8164-3160","documentHash":"2f5471e2-3e3b-47e9-9f19-968cbed38120"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739521d","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Frącz","uuid":"A12F4710061BE1A084076A586D6D9F2482CEE0FDB43CB0E118BA549A57C266F7C259F169A8F8E6B82A41DADA81F73D1E6B4F31B783A892E4AFF0492A732281FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2079-359X","documentHash":"c14600ef-2c7b-4dea-8336-c2e702e0ed90"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16125005"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["AC/DC step-up converters","performance maps","bridgeless boost rectifiers","energy harvesting","tri-stable electromagnetic converter"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b5878c28a04739b2a1","5e709210878c28a04738f61a","5e70920f878c28a04738f4fc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Study of power and voltage maps of a tri‑stable electromagnetic energy harvester connected to a step‑up converter","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c3e","mniswId":"1664","title":"Archives of Electrical Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"1427-4221","eissn":"2300-2506","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"9516688e-b374-4395-91e9-3918e3eaf83e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2025-03-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839a525fdbe833174255741","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b5878c28a04739b2a1","5e70920f878c28a04738f4fc","5e709210878c28a04738f61a"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to the specific operation and complex structure of the energy harvesting system, comprising a tri-stable nonlinear vibration energy harvester and a step-up converter, its performance can hardly be represented by a family of curves. For this reason, this paper presents its performance maps determined experimentally. Various converter parameters and loading resistances are used to assess the influence of excitation acceleration on output voltage and power. This study reveals that the system achieves a maximum power of 30.25 mW and a maximum output voltage of 5.32 V at an excitation acceleration of 10 m/s² under optimal conditions. The analysis identifies operating regions restricted by the converter parameters where the system attains a minimum applicable voltage between 1.8 and 3.3 V alongside the acceptable output power.

These distortions depend on the temporal context and introduce additional intraclass variability. To address this issue, a new approach is proposed that extracts segments from the image sequence corresponding to undistorted parts of gestures. This should simplify the task by reducing it to the easier problem of isolated gestures recognition. The proposed approach uses deep reinforcement learning for segmentation and a novel image sequence processing scheme to extract gradient changes over time. A dataset recorded by deaf people and annotated according to the proposed approach, was prepared to evaluate the method. The proposed deep learning architectures achieved leave-one-subject-out recognition accuracies in the range of 0.70 to 0.76. Considering the inability to compare with other works, the authors also proposed other evaluation protocols to thoroughly examine the employed approach. This work will be developed, and the main aspiration of the authors will be to create an integrated framework that converts the raw form of RGB video into a string of words representing the Sign Language user’s intentions."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943847","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b2519d4097071977945ec1","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"131","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"9837f84d-9d06-4911-9c8c-d097d37b2cca"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095219762400037X?dgcid=author","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f81891a085dcb410a25ecde","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Kalandyk","uuid":"1525D5A2E8901B027FE84823E1D9F46409F9F55C77AD9F4C9675453BC901414A2D803B258ECA5C81174F0D44F96F81134E02332AC78975291F47CDEDC7BB9C98","orcidId":"0000-0002-7317-5499","documentHash":"d3b9165c-3936-4a19-a260-8d9976909f93"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951aa","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kapuściński","uuid":"4A2A194D0B1A1095A8696BF67BF0D7F2D48EED40CFEC05F343F9ED2AD4B553475D56DF84D38BEEAF7BD8BBEB52D9B40955385FB94535D88FA2E591D595423FC3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4084-8113","documentHash":"1f857c77-d7f2-4e09-a30c-bbd16eca2c4c"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.engappai.2024.107879"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["water quality","heavy metals","water stability","drinking water"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

During monitoring, the physical, chemical, and biological stability of water was assessed, which is the main determinant ensuring the appropriate quality of water for consumers. The physicochemical and microbiological quality of water was analyzed for two distribution systems (DSs), including the analysis of heavy metals (Zn, Fe, Mn, Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb). The tests carried out showed that in both distribution systems, the water supplied to consumers met the guidelines for water intended for human consumption. It can be considered that the risk of uncontrolled changes in water quality in DSs with an average water production of <10,000 m3/d and the length of water pipelines < 150 km is very low. The water introduced into the system differed in the place of water intake and water purification technology, which influenced the final water quality. In DS(II), higher values were recorded for hardness, conductivity, calcium, alkalinity, nitrates, and DOC. It was found that the content of heavy metals during water transport to the consumer increased in the case of DS(I) for Zn, Ni, Cu, Cd, and Pb, and in the case of DS(II) for Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu, Cd, and Pb. The observed differences resulted from the different quality of the intake water as well as from different materials used to build internal installations and their age and technical condition. The analyzed tap water was characterized by physical and chemical stability. However, the water did not meet the guidelines for water biostability due to the increased content of biogenic substances."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943849","journalIssue":{"objectId":"663cc1194097071b758709b9","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"5df42273-caf0-4180-87f2-d45fdce5fe2d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/16/9/1221","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b95cfdbe833174261313","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Wojtaś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9814968a-5cee-4a70-b778-8adbd203fa2b"},{"objectId":"6839b95cfdbe833174261312","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51575402-7e15-4ccb-9ac0-7e729445ed7e"},{"objectId":"6839b95cfdbe833174261311","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Kamińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"552eebb0-cac6-4764-9ffc-f1464d59045d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6c4","name":"Andżelika","lastName":"Domoń","uuid":"1BD2CDA92AE4593863FD3FD5676B94BFC04AAE95DA16C7737233AF3B9B613CF3DDBFF3AF3078797FE47DF6F90DA1F46214653219A3ED8319F91346FEC7BD84C9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2633-9419","documentHash":"f952a053-a74e-417e-8ef0-21857fc4bcfe"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395178","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Papciak","uuid":"424CC240B9598145C59FA010063BE7B67946AB41C68AD0570BBC027FDD8577A2DE23BC9CCB989D2C40F1466393E957FF9FBCF585B46F9509E4779639F79CC73E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5744-5292","documentHash":"dea8c024-6966-4687-9bf2-cf93702c3ecb"}],"doi":"10.3390/w16091221"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","pro-ecological practices","Visegrad Group","electromechanical industry","V4","SMEs"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This applies not only to improving product quality, but also to ensuring environmentally friendly products. The key players in the development of the economy are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are also the driving force of development in the Visegrad Group countries (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic). However, there is a lack of research in the area of pro-environmental activities undertaken in SMEs in these countries. Therefore, the aim of the article was to analyze the possibility of implementing pro-ecological practices in enterprises belonging to SMEs in the electrical machinery industry from the V4 countries. The research method was a survey in which 383 SME entrepreneurs were surveyed (in the period from February to October 2023). The research was conducted among SME entrepreneurs from the electromechanical industry from the Visegrad Group countries. The survey results were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA statistical test with a significance level of α = 0.05. The results showed, e.g., that SMEs from the V4 countries: are interested in environmental problems and have awareness and up-to-date knowledge of the company's impact on the environment. They undertake pro-ecological practices mainly due to applicable laws (penalties), the need to care for the well-being of future generations and awareness of pollution and the state of the environment.

It commences with a discussion of the remarkable proliferation of internet-connected devices, ranging from personal computers to mobile devices, and now to the era of IoT and IoE. The paper illuminates the impact of IoT on network addresses, leading to the depletion of IPv4 addresses and the necessity for address translation services. Subsequently, the article delves into the risks confronted by IoT systems, encompassing physical and digital assaults, unauthorized access, system failures, as well as diverse forms of malicious software.

In this work, a biocomposite, based on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) with short hemp fibers, was obtained and repeatedly processed, which is a continuation of the research undertaken by the team in the field of this type of biocomposites. After subsequent stages of processing, the selected mechanical, processing and functional properties of the products were assessed. For this purpose, microscopic tests were carried out, mechanical properties were tested in static tensile and impact tests, viscosity curves were determined after subsequent processing cycles and changes in plastic pressure in the mold cavity were determined directly during processing. The results of the presented research confirm only a slight decrease in the mechanical properties of the produced type of biocomposite, even after it has been reprocessed five times, which gives extra weight to arguments for its commercialization as a substitute for petrochemical-based plastics. No significant changes were found in the used parameters and processing properties with the stages of processing, which allows for a predictable and stable manufacturing process using, for example, the injection molding process."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943851","journalIssue":{"objectId":"658b1e50409707046d7a676e","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"766f0423-3dd1-4be2-a231-14d43a24c3ac"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/1/55","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e7092c5878c28a04739c5a2","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"C91A5294B62067B92F5597F01629ACBE5DAE79FB0A78F75EF14DAAF61866D8CF9F70E56076BD9F459758BFA7E215CDE9555E6C8506F90BDBFEFBB405C8F566AB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9765-637X","documentHash":"50ba8ef4-394d-4958-8c16-d4ddb222fa8b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c448","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bąk","uuid":"EB5F84BFD3D3723D5BF11F34CEA4F64CC6D72908B86519720FB025B682332A9552F8899BCB664DAFF8FE6C71F5331608A9C352084CDB1C9E1D019D1F196BDD60","orcidId":"0000-0001-8164-3160","documentHash":"2f5471e2-3e3b-47e9-9f19-968cbed38120"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739521d","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Frącz","uuid":"A12F4710061BE1A084076A586D6D9F2482CEE0FDB43CB0E118BA549A57C266F7C259F169A8F8E6B82A41DADA81F73D1E6B4F31B783A892E4AFF0492A732281FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2079-359X","documentHash":"c14600ef-2c7b-4dea-8336-c2e702e0ed90"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17010055"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Attraction–repulsion operator","Global optimization","Population-based algorithms","Attraction–repulsion optimization algorithm (AROA)","Meta-heuristics"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Since many algorithms aim to achieve well-balanced exploitation–exploration stages with often unsatisfactory results, in the approach introduced in this paper, Attraction–Repulsion Optimization Algorithm (AROA), the balance associated with attraction–repulsion phenomena that occur in nature is mimicked. AROA introduces a search strategy in which a candidate solution is moved in the search space depending on the quality of solutions in its neighborhood, as well as the best candidate. The candidates are managed by local search operators based on modified Brownian motion, trigonometric functions, randomly selected solutions, and a form of memory. Consequently, AROA exhibits a satisfactory exploitation–exploration balance exhibited by highly competitive performance. The introduced algorithm is experimentally compared with the state-ofthe-art meta-heuristics on the CEC 2014, 2017, and 2020 test suites. The obtained results reveal the advantages of AROA over related algorithms and its suitability in solving complex real-world problems."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943853","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b73bfdbe833174260320","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"84","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"06e18625-8530-4070-9515-03d7d2757258"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210650223002316?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b73bfdbe833174260321","name":"Karol","lastName":"Cymerys","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"124705b4-ebdc-4e4a-a897-afd155fe1e5b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d561","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Oszust","uuid":"2D8417BF2E59FD2F4039F0099E7788770D9A611BC16DD8A8744FDE24AD4B455B0ED315CAFAAB1E6046B9C233D8167F67D780B4BCF16599892BD8EF699FC5A4F1","orcidId":"0000-0002-5482-6313","documentHash":"1587fd77-2e72-4da6-86bb-659e0c787247"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.swevo.2023.101459"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electro-optical tracking system","extended Kalman filter","ballistic object"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e176","uid":"bu_pEE67a1BU39yobRpbYjQ","uuid":"813f25f1-a4eb-4a11-9146-4dcbb3861634","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Elektroniki (Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.Jarosława Dąbrowskiego)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a2878c28a047399ae2"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","uid":"bX41kHc85ivocrWE0ISfROw","uuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","parentUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","rootUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","name":"Politechnika Wrocławska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709450878c28a0473ba4bf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"ALGORITHM FOR ESTIMATING BALLISTIC OBJECT TRAJECTORIES USING  ELECTRO-OPTICAL TRACKING SYSTEM","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e60","mniswId":"14306","title":"Metrology and Measurement Systems","doi":null,"issn":"0860-8229","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e5fb1f61-5e07-4def-b245-11898b8ccf0b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2025-05-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68399ee6fdbe8368347ae7ea","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709450878c28a0473ba4bf","5e7092a2878c28a047399ae2"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents an estimation algorithm designed for tracking aerial ballistic objects using measurements from an electro-optical tracking system.

The new approach uses a flight dynamics model formulated in a three-dimensional coordinate system. Unlike the previously developed algorithm, the one described in this paper accurately determines the object's location within a geographically oriented horizontal reference frame. It also eliminates the need for prior knowledge of the shooting direction, which would be challenging to establish in practice, and more realistically models the influence of wind on the object's motion in three dimensions.

In response, European countries are implementing novel concepts like electrified highways for trucks and buses, bridging the gap between traditional and electric mobility. This paper centers on the management of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure within industrial zones, crucial nodes for charging networks due to their concentrated economic activity and vehicular movement. The study delves into optimal strategies for deploying charging stations in these zones, considering factors such as station placement, capacity planning, and integration with smart grids to ensure efficient and accessible EV charging. Moreover, the research extends its focus to the integration of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and grid-to-vehicle (G2V) technologies, illustrating their potential within industrial zones. In our research, we have developed algorithms tailored for the infrastructure of industrial zones, focusing on the integration of storage systems and the charging and discharging dynamics of electric vehicles (EVs). Our case study, supported by numerical simulations, illustrates the outcomes of a 24-hour timeframe, where 126 vehicles were charged, and 134 were discharged. The results provide a comprehensive view of how the grid-maintained balance throughout these operations, ensuring that industrial facilities received the required power to fulfill their operational demands."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943854","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6668240e4097074fa19a1718","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"73","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"0ff4e0db-efc5-44f2-94cc-f8414d9d63c3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"433-450","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/show-content?id=131504","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9ecfdbe833174261715","name":"Lubomir","lastName":"Bena","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1014d2bd-14ec-4317-a470-5e9dbcab1952"},{"objectId":"6839b9ecfdbe833174261714","name":"Rikin","lastName":" Tailor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b8083fb-fafb-4854-968c-ab24a43351a0"},{"objectId":"6839b9ecfdbe833174261713","name":"Dusan","lastName":"Medved","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c05b5b4-0096-42b9-93fd-e21eb05bf56f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5ec","name":"Damian","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"C5C27537D18191016B14D55E9E2D1896D662AE78E60D3836E675D56F9BE1819A7E873408D6A5CE8385FF5FA90E59DE1E9993A5DAF48BFDF0A01F35FA205DE9F1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3247-5903","documentHash":"4b2f5f74-734f-4132-9532-a901ae59718f"}],"doi":"10.24425/aee.2024.149925"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["metrology of geometrical quantities","coordinate metrology","coordinate measuring machine","controlled radius"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Computer simulations were performed for the selected dispersion of measurement points relating to nominal data of measured products. The actual coordinate measurements were conducted by using various measurement strategies. The created method takes into account the analysis of flattening of a considered curve, for which the measurement characteristic CR is determined. The analysis was conducted based on linear regression. The advantage of the presented method is the possibility of its implementation in software of a CMM and, consequently, the use of the above-mentioned method in industry.

Objectives Major aim of this work was to perform metabolomic profling of human bladder cancer and adjacent normal tissue and to evaluate cancer biomarkers. Methods This study utilized nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and high-resolution nanoparticle-based laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) methods to investigate polar metabolite profles in tissue samples from 99 bladder cancer patients. Results Through NMR spectroscopy, six tissue metabolites were identifed and quantifed as potential indicators of bladder cancer, while LDI-MS allowed detection of 34 compounds which distinguished cancer tissue samples from adjacent normal tissue. Thirteen characteristic tissue metabolites were also found to diferentiate bladder cancer tumor grades and thirteen metabolites were correlated with tumor stages. Receiver-operating characteristics analysis showed high predictive power for all three types of metabolomics data, with area under the curve (AUC) values greater than 0.853. Conclusion To date, this is the frst study in which bladder human normal tissues adjacent to cancerous tissues are analyzed using both NMR and MS method. These fndings suggest that the metabolite markers identifed in this study may be useful for the detection and monitoring of bladder cancer stages and grades."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943856","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b7c4fdbe83317426072a","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"20","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f74b552b-e83e-4fe4-8e37-52e3f7bb010b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-023-02076-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b7c4fdbe83317426072f","name":"Valerie","lastName":"Copie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c37cf8ec-6304-4225-a983-6ae2e1df76d9"},{"objectId":"6839b7c4fdbe83317426072e","name":"Brian

Single-lap joints made of S235JR steel sheets joined with Araldite 2014-2 epoxy adhesive were tested. Comparative tests of static strength in the shear test as well as high-cycle fatigue strength tests were carried out. Joints with three holes with a diameter of 3 mm filled with adhesive and notches 3 mm wide and 4 mm long also filled with adhesive were tested and compared with reference joints, i.e. without modification. The assumption was that the structural changes applied were to contribute to the reduction of the peak of peel and shear stresses that typically occur in this type of joint. Based on the static strength tests, no significant effect of the applied modifications on the strength of the connections was demonstrated. However, in the case of fatigue strength, a significant improvement in fatigue lifetime was demonstrated, which in the area of low cycle fatigue increased by 328.6 % for the joint with notches and by 640.8 % for the variant with holes. For the fatigue fracture surfaces, a topography analysis was carried out by determining the roughness parameters. Significant differences were exposed since at the leading edge, the selected parameters were significantly lower for the reference variant than for variants with notches and holes."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943858","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b741fdbe833174260350","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"129","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"de8569d3-d25a-4d03-a6bf-e0f19a411c11"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143749623002762","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b741fdbe833174260352","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Macek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e1641f5d-d81a-4f32-9ff4-e1444a50a5ef"},{"objectId":"6839b741fdbe833174260351","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Szawara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d67d33d1-e29e-43ec-b001-7c58915d8453"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c47c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Myśliwiec","uuid":"1D5F1F4AD9F3B82035E86039831333B2E929DAB5E17418D4CAC7BF55A4FDB2A1A3A459AC410ADC770363EB46CF05E8DC207EC7851EC078F6093E79A3E68FECBE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9073-2082","documentHash":"37b3aa31-eb8d-46fb-863b-f5fae282ebba"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739522b","name":"Władysław","lastName":"Zielecki","uuid":"E87A51DD5B727EC27F7974A765E5A0C940D11AA49E4590084477986CCEDF90FA5043117BDF585DBAD19BD9D0517D63876775AC01C3E27CB3A069C1A99C335C32","orcidId":"0000-0002-7864-5525","documentHash":"3a30ad59-262d-46a7-8b70-e42a773a4572"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijadhadh.2023.103596"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["leaching test","galvanic sludge","heavy metal","geopolymers"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Among the methods of utilisation of this type of waste, the methods of stabilisation and solidification deserve attention, which enable the transformation of hazardous waste and the heavy metals it contains into an environmentally safe form, that is, immobilised. This paper proposes a method to stabilize and solidify galvanic sludge using geopolymerization reactions. The surface morphology was studied, and the chemical composition was analyzed using the SEM-EDS method. The presence of characteristic functional groups on the surface of the galvanic sludge and the geopolymer obtained on its basis was determined by FTIR spectroscopic analysis. Moreover, we evaluated of the recovery of selected heavy metals were performed on the basis of leaching tests. It was found that, as a consequence of geopolymerization of galvanic sludge, this hazardous waste is transformed in such a way that the heavy metals it contains, which occur in the form of soluble compounds are immobilised. In relation to the metals analyzed, reduction in solubility were obtained at a practical level of 100% for Zn and Mn, for the remaining metals, respectively, 94% for Cu and in the range of 40 to 90% for Pb. Analysis of the FTIR spectra showed that the ions of the metals studied were permanently immobilised in the aluminosilicate structure of the geopolymers obtained. This shows, that galvanic sewage sludge, as hazardous waste, is chemically transformed into inert waste that may be deposited in landfills"}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943859","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65fbff904097075721b54630","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"25","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"80265e02-00a7-4819-8d09-5877265a5057"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"305-313","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.jeeng.net/Utilization-of-Galvanic-Sewage-Sludge-to-Produce-Alkali-Activated-Materials,185295,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5c3","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Sitarz-Palczak","uuid":"DEEFA47026D915CFE7675673CEFE7D218CF4297118E7B5F244347B22032C4BFB8B89E6A5042460B114B03FF34511D6747E42849A081E7DB391A3E52C071C78BF","orcidId":"0000-0001-9927-0518","documentHash":"76b1d2cb-649a-4a91-b29c-853543876a29"}],"doi":"10.12911/22998993/185295"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Composting","Circular economy","Agriculture","Waste","Optimization","Fertilizers"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The growth of the population has led to increased production of solid municipal waste and a higher demand for food. Food production is inherently related to agriculture and, to achieve higher yields, it is necessary to replenish the soil with essential minerals. A synergistic approach that addresses both problems is the implementation of the composting process, which aligns with the principles of a circular economy. Food waste, green waste, paper waste, cardboard waste, and animal manure are promising feedstock materials for the extraction of valuable compounds. This review discusses key factors that influence the composting process and compares them with the input materials' parameters. It also considers methods for optimizing the process, such as the use of biochar and inoculation, which result in the production of the final product in a significantly shorter time and at lower financial costs. The applications of composts produced from various materials are described along with associated risks. In addition, innovative composting technologies are presented."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943860","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6569ce464097077c0478cf1c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"912","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f9527c44-d2f4-4f2a-a909-de3ee6b21f76"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723078518?dgcid=author","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"633b9aaa7523402e340ef580","name":"Rebeka","lastName":"Pajura","uuid":"762C21F60FB18012B76A7F249F8A145B52D7C08647DD1D41E17003BE53EFE470C31B5838EC73A04B3026DD82D91A901DE97E094D5254D85140349243D2904A9F","orcidId":"0000-0002-4959-8803","documentHash":"417e8aa9-7864-4548-b7b6-373b5cf6d8ed"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169221"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["key agreement","STAKE","authenticated key exchange","secure protocol","wireless sensor network"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Currently, the problem of pharmaceuticals in water and sewage is common, especially in highly urbanized countries. Laboratory-scale experiments were carried out using an adsorbent—granulated activated carbon (WD-extra)—to remove acetaminophen (ACT) from water. The initial concentration of acetaminophen was 20 mg ACT/dm3. The adsorption kinetics, influence of the pH on adsorption and dose of the used adsorbent were determined under batch conditions. The adsorption of ACT on activated carbon was more efficient when the water solution was acidic (at pH 2, it was the most effective). The highest percentage of removal (99%) was obtained for the WD-extra dose of 10.0 g/dm3. The time taken to establish the dynamic equilibrium of the system was 60 min. The effectiveness of adsorption was determined based on the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms.

Usually, to rationally use the absorbed solar radiation, traditional configurations are not equipped with an insulating layer in the massive structure, and this feature could be in contrast with rules that impose the achievement of limited thermal transmittances. Alternative modifications such as the Thermo-Diode Trombe Wall, partially transparent and with appreciable insulation properties, can overcome this issue. This study proposed the validation of a multi-physics model of such an innovative solution through data provided by an experimental setup properly monitored. A parametric study was then conducted to investigate how important geometrical and physical properties affect the thermal performances of the proposed solution. Results confirm that air temperatures over 35 ◦C can be achieved in the upper part of the solar space maintaining air velocity below 0.2 m/s and allowing for transferring significant thermal loads to the adjacent room. Simulations identified 24 cm as the optimum solar space thickness, whereas insulation layers over 12 cm do not improve thermal performances significantly but increase the system encumbrance. If the thermal conductivity of the separating wall is doubled, a percentage increase of 24% of the transferred peak heating load was detected reaching a value of 28 W/m2 . Results confirm the proposed system as a feasible solution to meet energy-saving purposes and regulation constraints in the building design."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943862","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b83bfdbe833174260a9d","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"86","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c382e716-57fd-4d49-82f6-3513c3ff91b0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710224004832?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b83bfdbe833174260aa0","name":"Sebastiano","lastName":"Gallo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"09c744d4-2fbe-46b5-be37-60343b7180de"},{"objectId":"6839b83bfdbe833174260a9f","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Bruno","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65ebea3b-d095-4bf3-97b4-503fd7b33ec8"},{"objectId":"6839b83bfdbe833174260a9e","name":"Piero","lastName":"Bevilacqua","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85ca11d5-8607-4322-aa87-c7c8e893c5f6"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d515","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Szyszka","uuid":"AAF8400CC3EE5585AD6FC86701F7E5E86AC9EE508D9493065F4D6A0CE8D57525577EDCA859BF2A4E9E42F0A1D6510066A22D9E254882EED0F18B4029A826CE34","orcidId":"0000-0002-3898-7491","documentHash":"fe5c1f89-d0a3-4ec5-9893-e10c3a58f8a6"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jobe.2024.108915"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["measure of noncompactness","Darbo- and Sadovskii-type fixed point theorem","convex-power mappings"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Lightweight construction is becoming increasingly important for economic and ecological reasons. This can be seen in the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as in civil engineering, where curved structures are often required. In order to reduce the weight of the aircraft, the aviation industry often uses spatial truss structures with bent elements. The challenge is to meet all of the stringent requirements regarding design, safety, structure, size, cost, etc., without compromising a structure's stiffness. Profiles with complicated cross-sections and so-called tailored tubes are increasingly used in the production of automotive and aircraft structures (General Aviation). Pipe and profile bending technologies are constantly being improved upon to meet the growing expectations of customers and ensure greater process efficiency. Currently, efforts are being made to increase the level of automation in this area by combining the functionality of modern bending machines with the capabilities of industrial robots. CNC bending machines currently dominate the industrial pipe bending process. A technologically advanced bending machine allows for the production of increasingly complex shapes and profiles."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943864","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b1fddbfdbe837cbff87353","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"16963ae7-ce5e-4943-b8e5-cfe1b187bb92"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"333-342","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/The-Process-of-Bending-Pipes-for-Components-of-Aircraft-Frames-and-Trusses,186745,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b94cfdbe8331742612a9","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Szeliga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f75922a9-07ff-4997-bbab-f8199ef2c0d1"},{"objectId":"6839b94cfdbe8331742612a8","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bałon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6f91634-55a5-4ae2-8bc3-2c83f09112c1"},{"objectId":"6839b94cfdbe8331742612a7","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Kiełbasa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"78f07514-602d-4c8b-a86e-e9383de8214f"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395210","name":"Edward","lastName":"Rejman","uuid":"04BA8742343788322CC9388E4527FD96FBC4E0A51F8D15F31556209BC5350386CD2B36D29A7BBB4C857C310259CFD335B52A8E87648E065D85F1C56F67C333B2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4716-7513","documentHash":"8a38ef87-6480-4832-aef8-5ca04d54f18a"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f2","name":"Robert","lastName":"Smusz","uuid":"FE66FF6ECC09BF4BF380BF8B84DE5C51FEDDB376EEDA3882B75D955C736E7DEE934A1EB1C532443C00D39522BC88CF03DCC0D806647FBEFC4DE700D518D64887","orcidId":"0000-0001-7369-1162","documentHash":"df9f331b-0d30-44e2-bd21-767a67b39101"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/186745"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In these circumstances it is crucial to protect humans from exposure to this radiation and develop shielding materials. There are many well-known materials that could be employed for this purpose, unfortunately these materials exhibit many features that make their use difficult (high density, toxicity, etc.). Therefore, intensification of research on the widely understood nanotechnology has brought a huge step in the field of nanomaterials, and this kind of materials could be applied to manufacture shielding materials free from disadvantages of metals. In the era of ecological crisis, focused on the use of nuclear energy, it is even more desirable. This review paper is an attempt to summarize and systematize knowledge in the field of employing nanomaterials in X and gamma shielding.

This research analyses the impacts of nominal pressure, kinematic viscosity of lubricant, and lubricant pressure on the coefficient of friction and average roughness of DC05 deep-drawing steel sheets. The strip drawing test was used to determine the coefficient of friction.

A Shapley decision plot exhibits the coefficient of friction prediction models via cumulative SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) data.

The paper also introduces a novel batch processing approach for efficient and automated crack detection across multiple images. The trade-offs between detection accuracy and processing speed are analyzed for the Morphological Top-hat filter and Canny edge filter methods. The Top-hat method, with thresholding after filtering, excelled in crack detection, with no false positives in tested images. The Canny edge filter, while efficient with adjusted parameters, needs further optimization for reducing false positives. In conclusion, the Top-hat method offers an efficient approach for crack detection during MPI.

Utilizing a modified computational fluid dynamics method, simulations of polypropylene friction stir welding are conducted to elucidate material flow and thermal history in relation to revolution pitch. The study investigates the impact of revolution pitch on internal defects, hardness, and tensile strength of the polypropylene joint. Simulation results reveal that revolution pitch influences polypropylene strain rate and viscosity, leading to variations in internal voids within the stir zone. A higher revolution pitch results in vertical mixing, while a lower revolution pitch causes horizontal lamellar mixing in the stir zone. Controlling revolution pitch is crucial for producing robust joints, as a very low revolution pitch increases the risk of over-stirring and air tapping, while a very high revolution pitch hinders proper joint formation. The optimal heat range for robust joint formation is identified between ~175 (revolution pitch = 0.0410) and ~210 °C. (at revolution pitch = 0.0107). The study demonstrates that consistent polypropylene joint properties can be achieved with similar revolution pitch, even at different friction stir welding tool velocities."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943867","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b745fdbe833174260375","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"130","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"01cc2af3-8e87-4cfb-a6a5-efc01d5f20ca"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1421-1437","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-023-12831-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b745fdbe833174260376","name":"Hamed Aghajani","lastName":"Derazkola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2b4c043-c91f-40eb-9cba-950dc755cd71"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00170-023-12831-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["chrześcijańska idea wojny sprawiedliwej","bezpieczeństwo","wojna","katolicyzm","religia","pokój"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Jaki stosunek do wojny (jako takiej) powinni mieć chrześcijanie? Metody: Ze względu na charakter artykułu zastosowano metodę analityczno-syntetyczną. Analiza treści badanych problemów pozwoliła rozłożyć elementy składowe na części i badanie każdego z nich oddzielnie. Natomiast synteza połączyła te elementy w nową całość, stanowiąc ujęcie holistyczne. W rezultacie pozwoliło to na sformułowanie wniosków ogólnych na podstawie uznanych twierdzeń cząstkowych. Wyniki: Refleksja nad podjętą problematyką wskazuje na to, że węzłowym zagadnieniem współczesnego świata jest problem realnego niebezpieczeństwa wojny i dążenie do zachowania pokoju. Nauka chrześcijańska wyraźnie głosi, że należy podejmować wszelkie możliwe wysiłki zmierzające do położenia kresu wojnom. Pomimo, że idea wojny sprawiedliwej i prawo do legalnej obrony są niezmienne, nie może to zwalniać z obowiązku działania na rzecz pokoju. To jest niezwykle trudne, ponieważ wojny nie da się uniknąć samymi pragnieniami. Obowiązkiem chrześcijanina powinno być zdecydowane protestowanie przeciwko tendencjom prowadzącym do wojny. Należy także szukać i znaleźć nowy pokojowy sposób rozwiązywania międzynarodowych sporów. Zakończenie: Zjawisko wojny i pokoju jest rozważane w większości publikacji odnoszących się do problemów, charakteru i przyszłości współczesnej cywilizacji. Znajduje ono również miejsce w refleksji polemologicznej. Jak dotąd w obszarze współczesnej myśli polemologicznej na wyróżnienie zasługuje refleksja katolicka. Ma ona największy udział w analizie kwestii wojny i pokoju, szczególnie od czasu II Soboru Watykańskiego i pontyfikatu Jana XXIII. Zdaniem chrześcijan, wojna jest przejawem zamętu istniejącego w świecie. Chrześcijanie są przekonani, że w obliczu wojny nie mogą być obojętni i powinni reagować na niesprawiedliwość i cierpienie dotykające przede wszystkim ludności cywilnej. Obecnie katolicy stanowczo odrzucają wojnę jako sposób rozwiązywania jakichkolwiek problemów międzynarodowych.

The correlation between increased traverse speed and heightened average axial forces acting upon the tool underscores the direct interplay between speed and the mechanical forces involved. Conversely, a deliberate reduction in traverse speed facilitates the creation of superior material mixing and the formation of intricate wavy interlocks at the interface of the base metals, thereby accentuating the crucial influence of process parameters on joint microstructure. Furthermore, the study unveils the pivotal protective role played by the Alclad coating in thwarting the development of bulky intermetallic compounds that can imperil joint integrity. The culmination of these findings is the identification of the optimal joint configuration, realized at 1500 rpm and a traverse speed of 50 mm/min. This specific configuration outshines the others, achieving an impressive tensile strength surpassing the steel base metal by more than 100.5%."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943869","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b7c9fdbe833174260757","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"38","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"0dea1afd-26f3-4b65-9b54-c5d1debad916"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352492824001478","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b7c9fdbe83317426075a","name":"Ján","lastName":"Slota","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"085bd926-a903-4c1f-a79b-5c79750d071e"},{"objectId":"6839b7c9fdbe833174260759","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Szawara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68e4e741-e74f-462d-b127-1136a09c1c88"},{"objectId":"6839b7c9fdbe833174260758","name":"Hamed Aghajani","lastName":"Derazkola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"20bc6828-91d2-484e-b38b-c24fcf95e178"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c47c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Myśliwiec","uuid":"1D5F1F4AD9F3B82035E86039831333B2E929DAB5E17418D4CAC7BF55A4FDB2A1A3A459AC410ADC770363EB46CF05E8DC207EC7851EC078F6093E79A3E68FECBE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9073-2082","documentHash":"37b3aa31-eb8d-46fb-863b-f5fae282ebba"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.mtcomm.2024.108167"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Finite-temperature properties of monolayer \n<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>MoS</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math>\n: Role of electron-electron interactions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479265","mniswId":"16088","title":"PHYSICAL REVIEW B","doi":null,"issn":"2469-9950","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"5a352506-8371-4c9d-b6fc-94ea443b1ef2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839b622fdbe8368347c9a65","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6839b622fdbe8368347c9a66","6839b622fdbe8368347c9a67","6839b622fdbe8368347c9a68"]},"issue":"15","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646943871","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6821b0fdfdbe8356e5785591","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"111","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"ccaf00ab-b416-4d6b-90fd-dd52b3e17647"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"111","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.111.155415","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b622fdbe8368347c9a68","name":"Le","lastName":"Van Tan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f4f5ac8-e46c-45ab-bd81-c08dacbed1fa"},{"objectId":"6839b622fdbe8368347c9a67","name":"Le Tri","lastName":"Dat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da2fb33a-150e-45d7-8a5a-64b61f226740"},{"objectId":"6839b622fdbe8368347c9a66","name":"Nguyen Truong","lastName":"Co","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"20380504-0ee0-428d-a510-89f98477119c"}],"doi":"10.1103/physrevb.111.155415"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["discrete system simulation","GPenSIM","traffic lights","colored Petri nets"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In this paper, TiO2 nanoparticles in volume percentages of 5 wt. % were added to the AA2024 alloy using the stir casting method. Using a novel powder injection system, TiO2 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 30 ± 5 nm was added to the matrix. The influence of TiO2 content on the fatigue life before and after heat treatment was studied. The results showed the fatigue properties of AA2024 with TiO2 nanoparticles increased after heat treatment. The optimum improvement in fatigue properties was obtained at 5 wt. % TiO2 after heat treatment, with an improving fatigue life in 14.71% compared with sample based. This is due to an increased number of fine precipitates besides its uniformly distributed after heat treatment. The fatigue life of the composite materials with added nanoparticles was investigated using a finite element-based ANSYS workbench. There was a good match between what happened in the experiments and what happened to the numerical fatigue strength. For the composite materials, the difference between the experimental and numerical values of fatigue strength was not greater than 4% for the matrix.

Design/methodology/approach: The research was survey. The survey research was carried out in traditional (paper) and electronic form (MS FORMS). The survey was directed at electronic industries (machinery processing) belonging to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) from V4 countries. The results presented in the article refer to sample size of 379 SMEs, obtained between March and September 2023. Results were analysed in statistical way, i.e.: ANOVA test and Mann Whitney U test by significance level equal to α = 0.05. Findings: SMEs in V4 countries have a similar approach to pro-environmental improving of products. It was shown that pro-environmental activities of SMEs from the V4 countries, the lowest consistency of assessments occurs in the following countries: Poland and Slovakia, Poland and Hungary, Slovakia and Hungary. Practical implications: The research results may contribute to more effective and coherent development activities of SMEs in the V4 countries as part of their sustainable development, and also to take appropriate actions that will be supporting qualitative and environmental products. Social implications: The results can help SME entrepreneurs improve their products to protect the natural environment. In addition, they can be the basis for the development of SMEs from the V4 countries and their unidirectional development, which includes not only improving the quality of products, but also caring for the environment. Originality/value: The originality of the research is the determination of the current pro-environmental approach to product improvement in SMEs in the V4 countries. The novelty is the provision of current data on the importance of improving pro-environmental products in SMEs from the V4 countries and their comparison between companies in the electrical machinery industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943874","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638a12d4097076e57a67c0b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"194","doi":null,"documentHash":"54e9fe1f-d605-48d5-882f-6ed29d5fdc7d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"375-386","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/194-Pacana-Siwiec-Molnar.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b986fdbe83317426142c","name":"László","lastName":"Molnár","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"50207aa7-94bf-40ad-a822-59faa5afbd70"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.194.22"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["model 3D","pomiary sytuacyjno-wysokościowe","BSP"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The model system consisted of an C18 column packed with 1.7-µm particles (i.e., a UHPLC column) and the solute was 1,3,5-tri‑tert-butylbenzene eluted with a mobile phase composed of 85/15 (v/v) acetonitrile/water. Two thermal modes were considered, and the solute was eluted at the very high inlet pressures necessary to achieve a highly efficient and rapid chromatographic process, as provided by using columns packed with small particles. However, the high inlet pressure and high linear velocity of the mobile phase caused the production of a significant amount of heat, and consequently, the formation of axial and radial temperature gradients. Due to these gradients, the retention and the mobile phase velocity were no longer constant. Thus, simple mathematical models consisting only of the mass balance equations are unsuitable to properly model the elution profiles. Here, the elution concentration profiles were predicted using a combined two-dimensional heat and mass transfer model, also including the calculation of the mobile phase velocity distribution. The isotherm adsorption model was the bi-Langmuir isotherm model with Henry constants that depended on the local temperature and pressure in the column. These adjustments allowed us to precisely account for changes in the shape and retention of the overloaded concentration profiles in the mobile phase. The proposed model provided accurate predictions of the overloaded concentration profiles, demonstrating good agreement with experimental profiles eluted under severe pressure and temperature gradients in the column even in the most extreme cases where the pressure drops reached 846 bar and the temperature gradients equaled 0.15 K mm−1 and 0.95 K mm−1 in the axial and the radial directions, respectively. In such cases 36 % decrease of the retention factor was observed along the column and 2 % increase in radial direction. These changes, combined with the velocity distribution, shifted the overloaded elution profile's shock towards the center of the column, advancing approximately 3 mm from its initial position close to the column wall. Ultimately, this resulted in the broadening of the elution band."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943876","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b8c5fdbe833174260e9e","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"1718","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"276e406b-d5d4-4e29-9cab-f7942e14b948"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967324000773?via=ihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b8c5fdbe833174260ea1","name":"Jorgen","lastName":"Samuelsson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a3971a09-4e5b-4d88-abc5-0428e69619a4"},{"objectId":"6839b8c5fdbe833174260ea0","name":"Marek","lastName":"Leśko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71e65635-697c-4534-b41d-b00040315827"},{"objectId":"6839b8c5fdbe833174260e9f","name":"Torgny","lastName":"Fornstedt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b60d3270-8c22-4d6b-a8d3-025ae9b4c312"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395198","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kaczmarski","uuid":"F20C344B514883916A2963C7DC3F1536A382A8CC42B899361577940491B480FAC31507884217CED22DC77A7C7B8272890D21B86A942414C8D266EC23CFD6C63A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9209-1418","documentHash":"4c772c34-ddca-49ed-8fed-02392c05618a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.chroma.2024.464704"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7934-753-7","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The conceptual design of the shelter includes a complex of 100 residential units intended for 500 refugees, service buildings, and public spaces. The proposed urban layout can be expanded multiple times. At an architectural scale, the concept includes several variants of residential units. To implement this project, it is proposed to use an innovative, environmentally friendly 3D printing technology employing quartz sand and using solar energy. The implementation of this technology in the construction of shelters for refugees in sandy desert areas will solve many problems related to logistics, availability of building materials, and energy costs.

In this paper, the variety of surface topographies from machined composite and ceramic workpieces was studied with a special emphasis on the measurement results. Surfaces were subjected to the ground diamond, honing and milling processes. Measurement results were analysed in terms of the application of the procedure for the removal of the high-frequency noise. Bandwidth characteristics were supported by the studies of autocorrelation and power spectral functions. It was found, that examination of noisy data, especially its isotropic properties, is crucial in the enhancement of the noise-removal methods. The proposed procedure was validated through direction and profile characterisation. The spline filtering technique with a 7.5 μm cut-off was encouraged against other generally used filtering techniques for the reduction of high-frequency measurement noise considering the study based on the power spectral, autocorrelation and direction functions. The proposed methodology was validated by comparing it to the averaged results of 3 time repeated measurements of the composite and ceramic surfaces after machining. The main advantage of the proposal is reducing the time of data processing due to the fast and easy-to-implement usage of general surface topography analysis functions, available in the commercial software of the measuring instrument."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943880","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b9c8fdbe8331742615ff","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"121","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"8c2bdfd1-e3bc-440c-8520-9897f96f5dd0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"150-171","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S152661252400495X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9c8fdbe833174261603","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Macek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"10d6c8d2-b0b7-47cd-afa1-52661277074f"},{"objectId":"6839b9c8fdbe833174261602","name":"Kinkar","lastName":"Chandra Das","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"afdf7945-016a-41cd-9183-e84d9ced7e07"},{"objectId":"6839b9c8fdbe833174261601","name":"Mirosław ","lastName":"Szala","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ae5a6e7-24e3-4f35-9ff6-7a9c36e8e98f"},{"objectId":"6839b9c8fdbe833174261600","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Królczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb8b0db9-2ee6-42ad-a74f-2bd7ff65c19c"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae182","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Podulka","uuid":"D91C653017CC2DD9A53B763900F2D752C1930B793C083D34700F36DD57C4D53DB8DD7F72955235F525E54D975B7A998A9FD49F0011BF1D49C5E5B0E928BA4FF2","orcidId":"0000-0002-1699-3137","documentHash":"f2f1029a-6544-4584-b3dd-0226d9fb6387"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jmapro.2024.05.032"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["acoustic screens","FEM analysis","turbine blades","composite structures","saving energy","structural behavior"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The possibility of constructing road noise barrier panels from components obtained from turbine blades was conceptually examined, and the geometry and construction of wind turbine blades were evaluated for their suitability as filler components for panels. The tensile strength parameters of two types of composites made from windmill blades—a solid composite and a sandwich type—were established based on material tests. The strength of the composite elements cut from a windmill propeller was analyzed, and a three-dimensional numerical model was created using the finite element method. The strength values of the composite used to construct the noise barriers were compared with the stresses resulting from loads operating on the road noise barriers, as determined in compliance with current standards. It was discovered that acoustic screens composed of composite materials derived from wind turbine blades may withstand loads associated with wind pressure and vehicle traffic with sufficient resistance. In order to evaluate the environmental benefits resulting from the use of composite material made from wind turbine blades to make noise barriers, this study presents the values of the embodied energy and embodied carbon for several types of road noise barriers using life cycle assessment."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943881","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6628b47e40970762632fef73","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"84142126-a013-48f5-94a5-abf9aa9c1573"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/9/2048","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b95ffdbe833174261328","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Broniewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4ec7d1e-13df-4a3d-b23f-c0225079a7f1"},{"objectId":"6839b95ffdbe833174261327","name":"Anna","lastName":"Halicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c466067-c0fb-4d1d-a4b8-cc477d54b860"},{"objectId":"6839b95ffdbe833174261326","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Jabłoński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"753eeb4c-ff1e-42a7-b14a-c5b9198fd806"},{"objectId":"6839b95ffdbe833174261325","name":"Filip","lastName":"Broniewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0928d40a-451a-4f70-819a-7549aa5d4568"},{"objectId":"5fc534ed085dcb1e6ae0ba73","name":"Damian","lastName":"Nykiel","uuid":"AF5020CE7A9503D8783F2988DEB5526D001A40EC51E5373F357D149EFB6726BA2DEFFF5E646BB9575D542AE635CF6F2FD5A2FF0F956EB6841248B424A4A55AF4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2259-5917","documentHash":"0bea2117-f8e3-436d-a64c-236a48dfd011"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5b1","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Buda-Ożóg","uuid":"86ADC1C8416360BBA1507134F28FA713B965B9037C43799839833B9E1FDEDAA07966B690BA69748609F56A7567F3D5CBDC268D94B996B55F036B547665FDA28F","orcidId":"0000-0002-1205-1345","documentHash":"c45b98a8-4881-4d70-8eae-6d91ba0bd17a"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17092048"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fatigue life","Safe life method","Rehabilitation","Riveted truss bridge","Eurocodes","Miner's cumulative damage theory"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Therefore, fatigue assessment is always the most important part of the complex evaluation of existing steel railway bridges. Additionally, a reliable fatigue assessment is often decisive in estimating the remaining service life of a bridge. The purpose of the presented research is to assess the fatigue of a 100-year-old riveted truss railway bridge. The assessment was carried out to decide whether the existing truss superstructure is still suitable for rehabilitation in the context of the ongoing modernisation of the railway line. The fatigue assessment procedure is based on the safe life method in the convention of nominal stresses. The Miner linear cumulative damage theory and the S-N curves according to the relevant European recommendations were also applied. Bridge evaluation revealed that the fatigue life of the steel superstructure was almost exhausted and that its remaining service life is too short to be considered for rehabilitation. It was also confirmed by the presence of fatigue cracks in the deck joints, detected during bridge inspection. Taking into account the assessment results, it was revealed that the existing riveted truss superstructure was not suitable for further use, which was intended to extend the bridge service life by the next 50 years after the modernisation of the railway line"}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943882","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b8d2fdbe833174260eff","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"217","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d933f513-a4e5-4e42-956a-b872d4793541"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143974X24002128","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6ac","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Rajchel","uuid":"EE730FBDCEDC9A1F8120599A1277B211EAA195844B27D8FA7902BCC1B0E84438F816417C8D549AD106487C313949E5D0C10BA96E4ED0FA13321177BE593A2709","orcidId":"0000-0003-4930-3443","documentHash":"d16384c6-f94d-4c2a-944a-71d8146116dc"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395160","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Siwowski","uuid":"60E8AE045DE688D769347355C56C8ACF612FC404CCB43774DF91B6FB20CB70B23B67D3647BC155D695119572CBE4E944782E8D58B9D096B9ABC47EF17FDFF467","orcidId":"0000-0002-2003-000X","documentHash":"ce87cefc-d930-4bec-971d-b5a30ea41ab0"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jcsr.2024.108662"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Groundwater potentiality","GIS","Vertical electrical sounding","Eastern desert","RS","Transient electromagnetic","Wadi Dara"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

As a result, this study used the innovative integration of remote sensing (RS), geographic information system (GIS), watershed modeling system (WMS), geophysical survey, and water mass balance equation to identify potential groundwater areas in the W. Dara, Eastern Desert, Egypt. A weighted spatial probability model (WSPM) of groundwater potential based on eight regulatory factors was implemented within ArcGIS software. Drainage density (DD), precipitation (P), net groundwater recharge (NGR), terrain slope (TS), lineament density (LD), lithologic group (LG), water quality (TDS), and depth to groundwater level (DGW) are the aspects considered. The Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method was used to assign weights to these parameters, and their accuracy was estimated using the consistency ratio (CR). The resulting groundwater potential map classified W. Dara study area into five categories, ranging from very low to very high potential. A geophysical survey, in the form of Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) and Transient Electromagnetic (TEM), was conducted along W. Dara to validate the results of the WSPM, which identified areas of high groundwater potential. The 1D inversion of VES/TEM shows that the central and western parts of W. Dara are considered the most promising areas for groundwater occurrence, and are located in areas of high and very high potential classes derived from WSPM. Moreover, the results of VES and TEM surveys showed that the proposed aquifers (Nubian Sandstone, Miocene, and Quaternary) in the study area are horizontally and vertically connected through a set of normal faults traversing NW-SE. Ten sites have been proposed for drilling additional exploitative wells in W. Dara area based on the WSPM and geophysical survey with the aim of sustainable development. Thus, the integrated techniques applied in this study proved effective in accurately determining the development strategy for arid and semi-arid coastal areas, especially those that suffer from scarcity of rainfall and increased agricultural reclamation requirements in remote areas."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943883","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839ba3bfdbe833174261915","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"363","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"4ba8ae1d-5110-47e1-9c99-a681073a5ff8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479724012295?dgcid=author","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba3bfdbe83317426191d","name":"Elsayed","lastName":"Ramadan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b934e315-1206-4c67-b61d-2b7e88bd034f"},{"objectId":"6839ba3bfdbe83317426191c","name":"Hazem","lastName":"Habib","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30a5bf18-f21e-4c03-bd25-f520db29794d"},{"objectId":"6839ba3bfdbe83317426191b","name":"Amin","lastName":"Ibrahim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b5feeba9-a021-4941-b172-6704c7a5a672"},{"objectId":"6839ba3bfdbe83317426191a","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Nosair","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef124748-b82d-4692-9cf3-bbaabb6ad29c"},{"objectId":"6839ba3bfdbe833174261919","name":"Hossam","lastName":"Elewa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9d5f4f6-8ac8-4412-aabc-5de43ee2cfa8"},{"objectId":"6839ba3bfdbe833174261918","name":"Martina","lastName":"Zelenakova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aaed8172-c663-4948-98b4-39df4d108456"},{"objectId":"6839ba3bfdbe833174261917","name":"Nermeen","lastName":"Abdel Moneam","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39f1ff3b-fab8-4053-8154-d9bf276b0e03"},{"objectId":"6839ba3bfdbe833174261916","name":"Rania","lastName":"Ragab","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"521dba57-4428-418f-9075-b8f4fe246e70"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d544","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pietrucha-Urbanik","uuid":"DFC9DAC77D8097EBE201B0B34C091D77E9A5D6EA793E18C56806CF09F352AE474828F0A81BEEFA6E4734FC68088215E52A35255D68502DD41E008719B555B6A3","orcidId":"0000-0003-1160-9009","documentHash":"de30c622-ee97-4ddf-9061-4093b2d60239"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121243"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cobalt oxide","Cobalt hydroxide","Cobalt oxyhydroxide","Electrochemistry","Oxidation"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Consequently, there has been increasing interest towards the development of new methods that maximize critical metals recovery from industrial hydrometallurgical solutions. In the current study, direct anodic oxidation of cobalt species from cobalt chloride solutions was studied as one alternative future strategy for cobalt recovery. Electrochemical methods were used (cyclic voltammetry, potentiostatic anodic deposition) and the effect of pH, temperature, and the concentration of cobalt and chloride ions on cobalt precipitation were investigated. The increase of pH and temperature was shown to stabilize the electrochemical oxidation of cobalt, while a decrease in cobalt concentration had a negative effect on precipitation. Scanning Electron Microscope, Atomic Force Microscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy were exploited to evaluate the morphology, structure, and composition of obtained anodic product.

The influence of the Alclad layer on the final joint properties is assessed. Internal flow analysis reveals a concentration of the Alclad layer at the corners of the stir zone for an increased plunge depth. Notably, the sample using a plunge depth of 1.55 mm exhibits a 32 % increase in pure shear strength compared to the sample executed with a plunge depth of 1.9 mm, emphasizing the significance of the plunge depth for achieving superior mechanical performance. SEM analysis of the fracture surface highlights deformation and dimples in the g = 1.55 mm sample, while EDS confirms the Alclad layer's presence, indicating its positive influence on mechanical resilience. Additionally, peel tests demonstrate a 41 % strength increase for the g = 1.9 mm sample. Low and high cycle fatigue tests reveal superior fatigue performance in the g = 1.55 mm sample, supported by SEM analysis illustrating crack initiation and fracture mechanisms. These findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of the interaction between plunge depth, Alclad ldistribution and resulting mechanical and fatigue properties."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943885","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839ba12fdbe83317426181c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"185","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d47932ea-4881-43aa-8613-b67aad010b5f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014211232400166X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba12fdbe83317426181e","name":"Koen","lastName":"Faes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6cffeb30-fe85-41f6-86ef-fb50abfd9b6e"},{"objectId":"6839ba12fdbe83317426181d","name":"Hamed Aghajani","lastName":"Derazkola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e14f7868-c23c-4ca0-a986-51f8a85e5e84"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijfatigue.2024.108308"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["iluminacje architektoniczne","wizualizacje komputerowe","rozkład luminancji","odbicia wielokrotne promieni świetlnych"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The objective is to enhance thermal comfort and reduce long-term energy consumption. A comprehensive examination of the interaction between heated surfaces and forced air heating reveals that excess energy generated can be redirected for more efficient heat distribution. Various scenarios were tested, indicating that the power necessary for maintaining consistent surface temperature could be significantly reduced. A noteworthy approach involves utilizing heat from pellet smoke to maximize heat recovery efficiency from pellet combustion. This, however, raises issues related to smoke introduction into heated spaces. Despite challenges, this approach provides a means to minimize the delivery of overheated air and accumulate energy within room partitions, thereby enhancing system efficiency. The study concludes that while the stand-alone flat surface heating system is better suited as a supplementary heating source within buildings, it offers a compelling alternative within traditional construction, aligning with historical systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943889","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d88e5b4097071e546d408e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"07341add-7883-436a-8e12-aba8ad2cdf95"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/5/1252","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5af","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Rabczak","uuid":"E569F0DB14F2D141D8CBDF481680CB181659E684AB3C63500550FC96B61D0E2634D90EB97DC32B2B1D0BE9FDD382DC816D5A22EF55BF15076027358751BCD0AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-8694-5480","documentHash":"9d6171d2-4478-4f4a-b2b0-100f9ce5d2a2"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d549","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"DFAB3D4824CBB52955935204B3B692769BDE5685DF1841E9158E49122FCE12C17F015062F21CD1702B7E35F176F2DF99D85849DA7687E1DE9871AA508706DA47","orcidId":"0000-0002-7460-6270","documentHash":"934317fb-e037-4048-87c4-41cb4d9f748c"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17051252"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"683995c1fdbe83683479efa6","doi":null,"title":"Trendy w teorii i praktyce zarządzania - przeszłość, teraźniejszość i przyszłość","year":2025,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67153-83-6","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://bg.pcz.pl/apisnb/book/71734/Trendy-w-teorii-i-praktyce-zarzadzania-przeszlosc-terazniejszosc-i-przyszlosc","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"873cbb97-bd72-491f-ab84-8bbfa14cd8dd","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8d0","mniswId":"55800","name":"Towarzystwo Naukowe Organizacji i Kierownictwa.

To explore the Moghra aquifer’s potential, where a large-scale rural community is being established, a finite element groundwater flow (i.e., FEFLOW®) model was invoked. The developed model was calibrated against the observed water levels. GRACE-based groundwater storage was incorporated into the tuning procedure of the developed model. Eight abstraction rates from 1000 wells, changing from 800 to 1500 m3/day/well, were simulated for a 100-year test period. The maximum resulting drawdown values, respectively, ranged from 59 to 112 m equating to about 20–40% of the aquifer’s saturated thickness. The implications of the climate change from gradual sea level rise and an increase in crop consumptive water use were investigated. Extending seawater invasion into the aquifer caused a slight increase in the piezometric levels within a narrow strip along the seaside. Applying a chronologically increasing withdrawal rate to meet the projected increment in crop water requirements raised the maximum resulting drawdown by about 7.5%. The sustainable exploitation regime was defined as a time-increasing withdrawal rate adequate to reclaim 85,715 acres (34,688 ha). The recommended development scheme is compatible with the withdrawal rationing rule, aiming to maintain that the resulting drawdown does not exceed one meter a year."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943892","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839ba03fdbe8331742617b6","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"16","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"04fc7a3c-fd0b-4aaa-9fd7-6bfcd9a6ea30"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/16/11/1562","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba03fdbe8331742617ba","name":"Abdelazim","lastName":"Negm","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf220425-b3ec-4c1d-ae37-0c681580d76b"},{"objectId":"6839ba03fdbe8331742617b9","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Shalby","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a7a456a-6fd6-4d06-a81e-bd964e4bd84a"},{"objectId":"6839ba03fdbe8331742617b8","name":"Asaad","lastName":"Armanuos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"66497925-cbb7-4637-8a54-4c1ed3c2fe84"},{"objectId":"6839ba03fdbe8331742617b7","name":"Bakenaz","lastName":"Zeidan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2af1b797-3ff3-4a25-9e18-1b66a89c13e6"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d544","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pietrucha-Urbanik","uuid":"DFC9DAC77D8097EBE201B0B34C091D77E9A5D6EA793E18C56806CF09F352AE474828F0A81BEEFA6E4734FC68088215E52A35255D68502DD41E008719B555B6A3","orcidId":"0000-0003-1160-9009","documentHash":"de30c622-ee97-4ddf-9061-4093b2d60239"}],"doi":"10.3390/w16111562"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MNC","space of continuous and bounded functions","IS of IEs","asymptotic stability","fixed point theorem"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

However, the available characteristics of this type of device are often insufficient and consider only a few selected parameters of water and greywater, which results in the need to look for tools enabling the determination of the effectiveness of GHEs in various operating conditions with incomplete input data. The aim of this paper was to determine the usefulness of artificial neural networks (ANNs). For this purpose, comprehensive experimental tests were carried out on the effectiveness of the horizontal heat exchanger, taking into account a wide range of water and greywater flow rates and temperatures of these media, as well as the linear bottom slope of the unit, which allowed for the creation of a database of 32,175 results. Then, the feasibility of implementing the full research plan was assessed using ANNs. The analysis showed that the impact of the media temperatures on the heat exchanger effectiveness values obtained using ANNs is limited, which makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of necessary experiments. Adopting only three temperature values of at least one medium allowed the generation of ANN models with coefficient values R2 = 0.748–0.999 and RMSE = 0.077–1.872. In the case of the tested GHE, the slope and the flow rate of the mixed water are of key importance. However, even in the case of parameters of significant importance, it is possible to reduce the research plan without compromising the final results. Assuming five different values for each of the four input parameters (a total of 625 combinations) made it possible to generate an ANN model (R2 = 0.993 and RMSE = 0.311) with high generalization ability on the full research plan covering 32,175 cases. Therefore, the conducted analysis confirmed the usefulness of ANNs in assessing the effectiveness of GHEs in various operating conditions. The approach described in this paper is important for both environmental and economic reasons, as it allows for reducing the consumption of water and energy, which are necessary to carry out such scientific research."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943896","journalIssue":{"objectId":"660276214097071d5ba04d9d","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"7","doi":"","documentHash":"3aae6095-1af9-44d2-8d30-6785d48dfb4f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/7/2790","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c38","name":"Beata","lastName":"Piotrowska","uuid":"59279A4488B188E53568D9792058B610E1FA6810E2992E7D1B5100B576772DD4C1FD148DF59378B71D89C3A28E5C0FB491CC13DC05CE895C7E2F54096E3CA84B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5166-9084","documentHash":"ffaef93f-b341-46a8-95f0-b9d37386fe90"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6c6","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Starzec","uuid":"5F1B2792387DE491149D420216AB10735B936C18A3A8C332F21F25B733343559B25233EC4C3106C7998B2E6B00FF4BFA1E73E8F891A4A946D0E0CD6D00A32ACB","orcidId":"0000-0002-5817-7517","documentHash":"8bdfb453-029d-402b-bf38-2a1efacd3044"},{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b6a0","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Kordana-Obuch","uuid":"5AB38391BB0A4C88F568AF283463BAED2DD8C7E2D50726E967D36490BE6A2744A98A6B9EE3C7198CA7AC9CF11CC4B0316FCF5D045EC481BFCF05D3E1B070E871","orcidId":"0000-0001-6951-1317","documentHash":"ff489fbf-b50a-4039-8bbe-68ece3ed97b5"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16072790"},{"mainLanguageName":"czeski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"ces","keywords":["E-FMEA","odpadové hospodárstvo","5 Whys","nástroje kvality","metóda 5S"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["E-FMEA","5Whys","5S method","quality tools","waste management"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The considerations are based on quasi-steady-state hypothesis and using elements of graph theory. The mathematical basis of the method used was developed by Lazman and Yablonsky [1], further considerations are presented in Yablonski et al. [2], Marin et al. [3]. The exemplary derivations of kinetic equations without simplifcations are presented in the aforementioned works. The lack of assumptions allows consideration of all possible interactions between the reagents and the surface species, which is a pro of the method. However, the equation obtained usually has a complex form. Some of the parameters that result from theoretical considerations are simply insignifcant for the real-world process. To eliminate this problem, the original procedure, based on statistical and process analysis, was employed. The previously determined kinetic equation, which does not have additional assumptions, was simplifed. Statistical analysis helps to fnd and justify possible simplifcations of the kinetic equation by eliminating insignifcant parameters present in the kinetic equation and provides strong evidence for the correctness of the approach. The resulting kinetic equation indicates that the new proposed mechanism for the propene hydrogenation process that accepts reactions between adsorbed propene and gaseous hydrogen corresponds to the experiment. The residual sum of squares is signifcantly lower than those for the equations presented in the literature. The statistical test (the Akaike criterion) also indicates that the new model is better than the others. The results obtained indicate that the commonly applied approach based on the rate-determining step concept has become obsolete, apart from obvious cases. The application of the more advanced mathematical approach gives better results, as was presented."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943898","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b80efdbe83317426094d","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"67","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"fb77bf8b-c9f8-4158-9458-70668d1d306b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"530-538","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11244-024-01918-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602e43f69543c7410626efc3","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Szałek","uuid":"8FB03AFF74E49EEBD3CD3CCF0089257EC86D91A9DE23A4498AE047BC58DE2EACFCC690D8EA3581BDA1F7F6198D6E10EA913AD481C3148F7B5627DB9EB9DEB306","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7416f6e3-e086-4ca7-8663-54eb542152fe"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395190","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Chmiel-Szukiewicz","uuid":"71492D06EC649F345FF322F9158F894AD61AD35A6349D02F9176C14E05D3A4E85D7D39C7BB9BEA7EC8356D773CE0916804B72EB59389FC2264C8EE8270BC7773","orcidId":"0000-0002-5000-2296","documentHash":"196969e6-54f3-4a91-a9ae-2b990035cba4"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e438","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Szukiewicz","uuid":"9C4013F682B5BD22DE97F87391D51C4D2E38758ED71E7A8F6B9B28B05BBA6B3FD302F3F8AC868B0FEDF957668A8C2C09637627AB53E814292A7A9D7AA98E26A1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9136-4907","documentHash":"bbc941c6-6df9-448e-9fa5-7588a31c8f5b"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11244-024-01918-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cleaning","magnetic field","vibration machine","change of water properties","cavitation"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

A method and construction of a vibrating machine for changing the properties of water and cleaning is proposed. Thanks to its reciprocating movement, and in the pulsation chamber and the nozzle, appropriate reactions take place. At certain oscillation frequencies, a cavitation cavity appears in the nozzle and the pulsation chamber, in which the process of splitting water molecules into active radicals takes place. At the same time, during the reciprocating movement of water through a non-magnetic nozzle, which is covered by permanent magnets, an additional effect of a variable magnetic field direction is exerted on water, which strengthens the breaking of hydrogen bonds in water molecules. Visualization of the hydrocavitation process during operation of a vibrating machine with a transparent nozzle was studied. During the experiment, changes in water parameters were studied, i.e. changes in pH, changes in the oxidation-reduction potential of treatment ORP and the total content of mineralization according to the TDS index with treatment time. The total concentration of dissolved salts decreases from 400 to 300 units, which also indicates an improvement in water quality. The rational frequency limits of the vibration drive of the machine are in the range from 18 to 23 Hz with an amplitude of oscillations of 0.002 m, and the ratio of its design parameters is determined: with a piston diameter of 0.1 m, it is recommended to use a diameter of the hole in the piston from 0.006 to 0.008 m"}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943900","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b1fddbfdbe837cbff87353","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"16963ae7-ce5e-4943-b8e5-cfe1b187bb92"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"234-245","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/pdf-186545-109294?filename=Study%20of%20the%20Influence%20of.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b938fdbe833174261219","name":"Nazar","lastName":"Kostiuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc20f4ff-ff5a-4993-af99-7a195c80177b"},{"objectId":"6839b938fdbe833174261218","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Hanzyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e10a3ba-4eec-4388-a615-ecf5956f13c6"},{"objectId":"6839b938fdbe833174261217","name":"Anatoly","lastName":"Hordieiev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dcf55468-ff52-45f3-b789-bc74915dedc0"},{"objectId":"6839b938fdbe833174261216","name":"Mykhaylo","lastName":"Pashechko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f434455-eecf-4c8e-8770-d1d468bd967c"},{"objectId":"6839b938fdbe833174261215","name":"Vitaliy","lastName":"Tkachuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70a6e9a5-5bf5-4076-ab8f-6a1c81294882"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739517e","name":"Galyna","lastName":"Kalda","uuid":"90DDBEF6AE8ABFA57674435F9D94C71669AF5E522B3EA03660824A440606BEC5254B2FC0AAAF750AC027A05342E6D03B5A0612BE786ACBA41765EDF93B81A7EA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5142-0473","documentHash":"3a6aa1d9-b25b-44ee-a772-940e51703e23"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/186545"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Digital image correlation (DIC)","Damage detection","FRP composites"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Thanks to their lightweight, high strength, and ease of shaping are very attractive materials. The main disadvantage of FRP composites is the possibility of defects in their structures which influence on proper work of the material. These defects can appear in the production phase as well as be caused by impact. Especially sensitive to defects/damages are the responsible structures such as those used in the aerospace industry. In this paper, the application of digital image correlation (DIC) to tracking the development of strain fields in FRP composites with different types of fibres is proposed. Thanks to the use of the DIC the finding of areas where the strain distribution (caused by loads) is different than in surroundings is possible. The presented measurement technique is vision-based, non-contact, and enables full-field measurements without disturbing structure behaviour by any additional mass. This method, in combination with other non-destructive testing is potentially applicable in damage detection of the aircraft sheathing parts. However, further research in order to its application to online monitoring is required, especially considering the minimisation of equipment, supply of energy and wireless data transmission."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943902","journalIssue":{"objectId":"660206fe4097070f89f37017","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"7f6eaa0f-3324-4770-9fb1-0c709a578ab4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43452-024-00859-z","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d536","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Ziaja","uuid":"17FF1AB376DAC3E877173FB0990441304F30F0BBE41B04B4459893A0392E7FBC0C4E1C5B3E73B7EBFF239E2EE530DCC97D8CD1A7B1B5E183E6BC97B1921C4830","orcidId":"0000-0002-8016-5504","documentHash":"43d3fac7-0d23-46ea-9bfc-8d34fd030647"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d535","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kulpa","uuid":"790D759C417F50A6620906E9A13EC3DFC8B19327848731DC4677A87F2585D690A7D8EF4F552C30710DEA51241C7D3588B2770060CD19C6E73838497AAA0C3B9A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8550-7382","documentHash":"eb8b0b8b-00f6-4656-b102-e3c2345c36b4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d534","name":"Michał","lastName":"Jurek","uuid":"B9BFF547672B05057554120999E0334B252EA90015111EA50552F19B6C9102F8A0CB14F5B0422B81F38D56AE0A5A1EAB4FB15035A71960769C0C707D7CBEF648","orcidId":"0000-0003-2645-7220","documentHash":"2fdeb626-0aca-4606-bc58-12b08811adc8"},{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b69b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wiater","uuid":"D4F0F349E81477E00DE0DE97418DE33024B64E7F4F33FEF1A9AC8A52B3C227455513CB8C0CCB6A98C4CFE71DD22F9B949AF30178C6EC1A9428A715C0A797CFE5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5559-3841","documentHash":"79de45d2-5f93-4e42-8213-0b705e18606c"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395220","name":"Romana","lastName":"Śliwa","uuid":"F3191859CFA4D74943EA62CE9917A8A8CB05E61CA1B2468DDB3340D9715FB2AE0F24A80D855441A6A391D6B62C142B0CA328417A5DBFE66D3D08EDF3B8CBF970","orcidId":"0000-0002-3380-8423","documentHash":"5beb35f9-2538-4b25-9798-71f5807bbe04"}],"doi":"10.1007/s43452-024-00859-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["innovations","enterprise","financial benefits"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

With the development of high-temperature superalloy materials, efforts are still being made to improve the turbine entry temperature (TET), which will ultimately raise the efficiency of gas turbines. In this research, a second-generation single-crystal superalloy CMSX-4 based on nickel was prepared. The surface was coated by thermal barrier coating (TBC) with a bond coat of NiCoCrAlY with vacuum plasma spray (VPS) and a top coat with Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) by Electron Beam Physical Vapor Deposition (EB-PVD) with a minimal current of 2.3 A with two sources compared to the conventional high-current that has been currently employed. These CMSX-4 specimens, both the as-cast and TBC coated, were used to test the effects of cyclic oxidation and hot corrosion at 1000 °C, simulating an aircraft engine. Also, a hot corrosion test using salt compositions (Wt%) of 60Na2SO4 - 40NaCl was performed simulating an aviation engine environmental condition. A FE-SEM/EDS analysis was used to examine the surface and cross-section microstructures of oxidized, hot-corroded as-cast, and hot-corroded TBC-coated CMSX-4 and its corrosion products. Using the XRD technique, the phases that were found in the oxidized and hot-corroded samples were identified. The outcome demonstrated that the EB-PVD TBC-coating on CMSX-4 with beam switching technique and a lower electron beam current has adequate protection without any damage to the coatings at 1000 °C."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943905","journalIssue":{"objectId":"668bc933fdbe8315e753193d","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"485","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"87508dfd-7554-4173-8f5f-356fe05f527b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0257897224005164","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9a8fdbe833174261514","name":"Arivarasu","lastName":"Moganraj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c12f01c-80b5-4ada-9b16-7d42b8b0e7c3"},{"objectId":"6839b9a8fdbe833174261513","name":"Santhosh Kumar","lastName":"Vaiyapuri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2caa9271-9c1e-4777-a906-e747de94cf64"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951ed","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Nowotnik","uuid":"6F575B0F7905127D0F4BF80F6D6E879F6C7999C7ADFE682A61BD20657A2011B5F4357E3E89E6E5EC472C79DDC4233694EDA36016C94E8A3B4A982DC5375B821E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7620-776X","documentHash":"83ac1527-75f8-4729-aae8-f27ba90ee7d1"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951ec","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Mrówka-Nowotnik","uuid":"05BD9682BAD6F8940D109217A71DF9E0FD76D83CB765FA9F2EA572F2A62A53C322F23EBDB547493EE6D9011511FBC23FE887736431814BA9A7D89C08426AC5D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-1594-2610","documentHash":"7c6b55d0-53a5-4ba9-8df2-09e8876bffef"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.surfcoat.2024.130885"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["matrix generator","independent sets","Fibonacci numbers","Leonardo numbers"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Unmeasured signals are estimated by using an adaptive approach. For this purpose, a filtering equation with a continuously modified gain vector is used. Its value is determined by an incremental method, and the amount of correction depends on the current difference between the generated signal and its measured counterpart. In addition, the study takes into account the aging process of measurements and their random absence. The application of the proposed approach can be realized for any objects with a suitable mathematical description. A biochemically polluted river with an appropriate transformation of the notation of partial differential equations was chosen as an object. The results of numerical experiments are promising, and the process of obtaining them involves little computational necessity, so the approach is aimed at the needs of control implemented online."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943909","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b969fdbe833174261371","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"72","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"04b006ef-5ea2-48b8-a1aa-edef629a1a96"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/150111/edition/130877/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b99afdbe8331742614b0","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Hawro","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7c85427-b7cb-4442-a4f5-b2e141ca806b"},{"objectId":"6839b99afdbe8331742614af","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Kwater","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb3f06a5-4dc2-4f74-95e6-719f55406ca0"},{"objectId":"6839b99afdbe8331742614ae","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krutys","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8e15b5e3-5f3e-4130-b1c2-8c4910438b81"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5e7","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gołębiowski","uuid":"F1C9483492AEA8F85A549D8C471DC669F71ABE8820C9BAD7172A69D770DD3D0B58633C00C93E7B2258B5E311B63051303D0B6727CCB4CCA28FB008FAF418FBD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1924-254X","documentHash":"d4cc6a2e-8f92-4797-a5aa-6bc38bd8cb69"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047392f34","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Drałus","uuid":"6F81AD42DC594F5A6A8F3370A9063A79ED27DFB3E3ED87EBB529D19D102296DC418D58CF31CCE1074B91B44418CE658334CE67676A81B8779B487C1B6E590A18","orcidId":"0000-0001-7963-8602","documentHash":"0a288a2c-4647-4e32-905c-539288293da4"}],"doi":"10.24425/bpasts.2024.150111"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["frequency-dependent behavior","reflection","absorption","electromagnetic interference","construction materials","shielding effectiveness"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Building materials are, therefore, natural shielding for us. Many studies describe the shielding effect of non-building materials. This study evaluates the shielding effectiveness (SE) of electromagnetic fields for various building materials over a frequency range of 1 GHz to 9 GHz. Measurements of SE, reflection (R), and calculated absorption (A) were conducted to determine the shielding properties of mineral wool (MW), hardened polystyrene (PT), extruded polystyrene (PE), polyurethane board (PUR), brick wall (BW), brick wall filled with mineral wool (BW-MW), and concrete wall. The results demonstrate that MW, PT, PE, and PUR exhibit low SE and R, indicating minimal shielding capabilities, with absorption values that do not significantly deviate from the level of measurement uncertainty. Conversely, BW, BW-MW, and concrete wall materials exhibit high SE, with notably increased absorption at higher frequencies, highlighting their potential for effective EMI shielding. Particularly, the concrete wall presents the highest absorption values, making it a superior choice for shielding applications. Reflection trends revealed a plateau for BW in the 6 GHz to 9 GHz range, indicating a frequency-dependent behavior of shielding mechanisms.

The most robust validation indicators were exhibited by an artificial intelligence method, specifically neural networks. Within this framework, two predictive models for EV energy consumption were developed for winter and summer conditions, based on actual driving cycles. These models hold particular significance for microscale road analyses. The resultant model, for test data in summer conditions, demonstrates validation indicators of an R2 of 86% and an MSE of 1.4, while, for winter conditions, its values are 89% and 2.8, respectively, confirming its high precision. The paper also presents exemplary applications of the developed models, utilizing both real and simulated microscale data. The results obtained and the presented methodology can be especially advantageous for decision makers in the management of city roads and infrastructure planners, aiding both cognitive understanding and the better planning of charging infrastructure networks."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943912","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d88e5b4097071e546d408e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"07341add-7883-436a-8e12-aba8ad2cdf95"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/5/1148","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c478","name":"Maksymilian","lastName":"Mądziel","uuid":"D0D9ACBEC38E6B6F30464D84A61138751DAE4EE50BC4079F9038E346E6BA07D2B57D57D635DDAF889D8E201707A8160D8D855832C1E45C9A391840A6FD405181","orcidId":"0000-0002-3957-8294","documentHash":"ae9ec52f-e3af-4211-81f9-1faf88e143a1"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17051148"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","quality of products","Visegrad Group","environmental impact","production engineering"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This poses a particular challenge for SMEs from developing countries. Therefore, the objective of the investigation was to analyse the qualitative-environmental aspects of the improvement of the products in SMEs from the countries of the Visegrad Group (V4). The results analysed constituted a research sample of 379 companies in the electrical machinery industry (machine processing industry), which were obtained in the period from March to September 2023 through a targeted survey. The area of analysis included, e.g.: (i) environmental issues of selected areas of activity, (ii) measures of environmental activity, and (iii) selected qualitative-environmental aspects. Analyses of the research results were carried out using quantitative and qualitative analyses, including comparative analyses, e.g. regarding the implementation status of ISO 14001, EMAS, and ISO 9001. These techniques were used: word cloud, ANOVA test and Mann Whitney U test at the significance level of α=0.05. It has been shown that SMEs in V4 countries focus their activities on improving products to improve their quality rather than limiting their negative environmental impact. Originality of the research is the identification of significant differences in the qualitative-environmental aspects undertaken when SMEs from V4 countries. Research results may contribute to the development activities more effective and coherent in the V4 countries, to achieve a stable and competitive advantage on the market as part of the qualitative and environmental improvement of the products. The research results and the conclusions drawn from them can be used by scientists and practitioners to shape the target states of enterprises in the period of increasing involvement in proecological ideas."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943914","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b824fdbe8331742609e2","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"30","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"0ae59f6e-d847-49ae-97a8-cf5d54096451"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"75-85","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.30657/pea.2024.30.7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b824fdbe8331742609e5","name":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Ključnikov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11b0d690-8e73-4146-b26b-d523aa731d96"},{"objectId":"6839b824fdbe8331742609e4","name":"Beáta","lastName":"Gavurová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b86605ba-8687-4437-b31d-88fd16309284"},{"objectId":"6839b824fdbe8331742609e3","name":"Szabolcs","lastName":"Nagy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c7e39831-d902-4576-96ae-23a394b59db5"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.30657/pea.2024.30.7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["microbiological stability","post-fermentation leachate","hygienization","sanitary risk"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Leachate from anaerobic treatment of sewage sludge contains valuable elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium, which can improve soil properties. The production of liquid fertilizer minimizes the negative impact of leachate on the main biological stream in the WWTP and improves the energy efficiency of the entire wastewater treatment system. This transfers into the operating costs of the facility. When thinking about the agricultural use of digestion leachate and its introduction into the environment, a very important issue is its microbiological contamination. The purpose of the conducted research was to determine the microbiological quality of digestion leachates from municipal wastewater treatment plants and to determine the parameters of their hygienization. The number of bacteria in raw leachate is indicative of a sanitary risk in the case they are used in agriculture as fertiliser. Heating the leachate at 60°C for 15 minutes produces an effect comparable to that achieved by heating the leachate to 70°C. The sonication process itself did not affect the better temperature effect. Heating the leachate for 20 minutes after prior sonication for 20 minutes does not result in the complete elimination of microflora."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943916","journalIssue":{"objectId":"660149e54097070f89e47fb1","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"88","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"a83af7a6-65a7-4ba3-b6b3-02cdb0136809"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.34659/eis.2024.88.1.597","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d53f","name":"Adam","lastName":"Masłoń","uuid":"06FF9840E341EBD8B3650382D903BE49BF7507D04995A9B7059C6E21E49B8FA5037F623E70B2AF30F8DB15194593537A2B493DE14C99CA8722B4345B462252E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-3676-0031","documentHash":"17701faf-256e-4063-b842-031d03db71c7"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d532","name":"Monika","lastName":"Zdeb","uuid":"5A2291391BA21FC98E7B248A942DEC565044DF24BB103656BD3DE4136F2BA9B219031CAC3D5137807643759ED8F81A4A72D708A362DC24E1AFA1ADCF4FBCA0F6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3565-080X","documentHash":"84f9811e-87f1-4898-82d0-969b39191a17"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6c4","name":"Andżelika","lastName":"Domoń","uuid":"1BD2CDA92AE4593863FD3FD5676B94BFC04AAE95DA16C7737233AF3B9B613CF3DDBFF3AF3078797FE47DF6F90DA1F46214653219A3ED8319F91346FEC7BD84C9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2633-9419","documentHash":"f952a053-a74e-417e-8ef0-21857fc4bcfe"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739517c","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Zamorska","uuid":"DF74F624DA359DD35F3DE53C8825E217D3EA2E4D3A22D17B2A13458343096F932FFA10DBE8DE1C5E9975E54E1B125F07E10E965633C323E740E26160B0D25421","orcidId":"0000-0003-0569-9394","documentHash":"4a6db8fe-acc2-431b-8c3c-58d728a0fbfe"}],"doi":"10.34659/eis.2024.88.1.597"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["instance selection","nearest neighbors","clustering","random forest","machine learning","feature selection"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Motivated by the necessity to enhance the strength and ductility of welded joints, the impacts of varying the tool rotational speed (rpm) and blind hole diameter on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the joints are investigated. Experimental characterization techniques including SEM, optical microscopy, microhardness, and tensile tests were employed to analyze the welded joints produced under different processing parameters (tool rotational speeds of 910, 1280, and 1700 rpm, and blind hole diameters of 0, 1, 1.5, and 2 mm). Comparative analyses were conducted against base metal properties and joints without reinforcement powder. It was found that the addition of nanopowder resulted in a decrease in the maximum generated heat during FSP, while also reducing the stir zone size compared to samples without nanopowder. Moreover, enhancements in both the strength and ductility of the joints were observed with the incorporation of Al2O3 nanoparticles. The optimal combination of welding conditions, observed at 1280 rpm rotational speed and 1.5 mm hole diameter, yielded a remarkable ultimate tensile strength of 567 MPa, accompanied by a hardness of 45 HV. These results underscore the potential of nano-Al2O3 reinforcement in significantly improving the mechanical properties of the produced nanocomposite, with implications for advancing the performance of welded structures in various engineering applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943919","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839ba15fdbe83317426182e","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"8","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"c3f1a083-a856-4be1-9038-24865d6652af"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4494/8/2/58","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba15fdbe833174261832","name":"Moustafa M.","lastName":"Mohammed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a7536f43-bcb8-4fdd-b694-49513e41020e"},{"objectId":"6839ba15fdbe833174261831","name":"Mahmoud E.","lastName":"Abdullah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"702e77e4-0aa0-4df9-aaa4-f5645296b121"},{"objectId":"6839ba15fdbe833174261830","name":"M.

Design/methodology/approach: An in-depth comparative analysis of pro-quality and proenvironmental approaches to product improvement was carried out in SMEs from V4 countries. Based on previous research (survey research conducted from March to September 2023 including 379 SMEs from V4 countries), two benchmarks for these approaches were developed and further analysed. Statistical analyses were used, i.e. Box-and-whisker chart and Wilcoxon paired test in STATISTICA 13.3. on the level of significance p<0.05. Findings: It was shown that SME entrepreneurs from V4 countries have a relatively similar approach to the improvement of pro-quality and pro-environmental products. The pro-quality approach is more important than pro-environmental in case of product improvement. Practical implications: Research results can be the basis for defining more precise directions for the development of SMEs in V4 countries and increasing cooperation between consortium regions in the development of product production in line with the idea of sustainable development and current customer expectations. Social implications: The results can have a positive impact on public attitudes, mainly entrepreneurs from SMEs, but not only in making further efforts to improve the quality of products while reducing the negative impact on the environment. This behavior may contribute to increased customer satisfaction with purchased products, but also to the development of the economies of the V4 countries and to meeting the requirements of sustainable development. Originality/value: Originality of the research includes determining the current approach of SMEs in the electrical machinery industry in V4 countries to meeting customer expectations regarding product quality, while striving to achieve environmentally friendly products."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943921","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638a12d4097076e57a67c0b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"194","doi":null,"documentHash":"54e9fe1f-d605-48d5-882f-6ed29d5fdc7d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"461-473","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/194-Siwiec-Pacana.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.194.27"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electric field distribution","lightning discharge","drone’s immunity","surge voltage generator"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

It is used to test objects an order of magnitude smaller, e.g.: unmanned aerial vehicles and determine the influence of the electrical component on the resulting surges in the circuits of these devices. The theoretical field distribution for an ideal capacitor is uniform, but for a real one, it can deviate significantly from the assumptions. This is affected by a number of factors, including conductive objects in the immediate vicinity, electrical wiring in walls, or water pipes. This is because each real capacitor has a different distribution of the electric field inside as well as near the ends of its covers. The uniformity of this distribution is therefore significantly altered, and it is necessary to determine in which cross-sectional area it is constant and provides the right conditions for reliable measurements. To determine these parameters, time-varying signals of low (a sinusoidal waveform with a frequency of 50 Hz) and medium frequency (a lightning surge pulse with rise/fall times of 6.4/69 µs) were used.

BDAC is represented through two dimensions of big data technological capabilities (BDTC) and big data personal capabilities (BDPC). Moreover, the relationships between BDTC and BDPC with sustainable supply chain performance through the mediation effect of supply chain innovation capabilities are examined. Design/methodology/approach The study used a quantitative research approach. A survey of 400 Jordanian manufacturing companies was carried out to conduct this research. However, the responses of 207 managers were valid to be used in the analysis. In this study, the SmartPLS software was used to perform structural equation modeling using a partial least squares approach (PLS-SEM) and to examine the measurement and structural model's validity and reliability. Findings According to the results of this study, BDPC has a significant positive impact on supply chain innovation capabilities. Furthermore, the findings indicate that supply chain innovation capabilities are the most influential predictor of sustainable supply chain performance and act as a positive significant mediator in the relationship between BDPC and firm sustainable performance. Surprisingly, the study found that BDTC had no significant effect on supply chain innovation capabilities. Besides that, no significant relationship exists between BDTC and firm sustainable performance via the mediation effect of supply chain innovation capabilities. Originality/value This study provides an integrated research model that incorporates BDAC, supply chain innovation capabilities, and sustainable supply chain performance in order to analyze supply chain innovation and sustainable supply chain performance. This suggests that the scope of the study is broader in terms of predicting sustainable supply chain performance. As a result, the study intends to fill a gap in the literature by explaining how BDAC affects supply chain innovation capabilities and firms sustainable performance.

The detailed kinetics study and electrochemical experiments of the catalytic complex in these solvents reveal the opportunities and limitations of their use in controlled radical polymerization. Both solvents produce precisely controlled polymers using supplemental activator and reducing agent (SARA) ATRP. They offer an efficient reaction medium for crafting well-defined branched architectures from naturally derived cores such as riboflavin, β-cyclodextrin, and troxerutin, thereby significantly expanding the application scope of these solvents. Notably, Cygnet 0.0 significantly reduces side reactions between the solvent and the catalyst compared to Cyrene, allowing the catalyst complex to be used at a reduced concentration down to 75 ppm. The effective mass yield values achieved in Cyrene and Cygnet 0.0 underscore a substantial advantage of these solvents over DMF in generating processes that adhere to the principles of green chemistry.

The most basic and cheapest way to reduce friction is to use lubricants, which should ensure the highest lubrication efficiency and at the same time be environmentally friendly. Due to the trend towards sustainable production, vegetable oils have been used in research as an alternative to petroleum-based lubricants. The analysis of friction in sheet metal forming requires an appropriate tribotester simulating the friction conditions in a specific area of the sheet metal being formed. Research has used a special strip drawing tribometer, enabling the determination the value of the coefficient of friction in the blankholder zone in the deep drawing process. Quantitative analysis of the friction phenomenon is necessary at the stage of designing the technological process and selecting technological parameters, including blankholder pressure. This article presents the results of friction testing of 1.0338 (DC04) steel sheets using a strip drawing test. The experimental tests involved pulling a strip of sheet metal between two countersamples with a rounded surface. The tests were carried out on countersamples with different levels of roughness for the range of contact pressures occurring in the blankholder zone in the deep drawing process (1.7–5 MPa). The values of the coefficient of friction determined under dry friction conditions were compared with the results for edible (corn, sunflower and rapeseed) and non-edible (Moringa, Karanja) vegetable lubricants. The tested oils are the most commonly used vegetable-based biolubricants in metal forming operations. Multi-layer artificial neural networks were used to determine the relationship between the value of the contact pressure, the roughness of the countersamples, the oil viscosity and density, and the value of the coefficient of friction. Rapeseed oil provided the best lubrication efficiency during friction testing for all of the tested samples, with an average surface roughness of Sa 0.44–1.34 μm. At the same time, as the roughness of the countersamples increased, a decrease in lubrication efficiency was observed. The lowest root mean squared error value was observed for the MLP-4-8-1 network trained with the quasi-Newton algorithm. Most of the analysed networks with different architectures trained using the various algorithms showed that the kinematic viscosity of the oil was the most important aspect in assessing the friction of the sheets tested. The influence of kinematic viscosity on the value of the coefficient of friction is strongly dependent on the surface roughness of the countersamples."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943928","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cdcf6040970762636d733b","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"6ef368a7-260c-48f3-9314-dd3abc319a58"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/4/908","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17040908"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["graphene oxide","powder coatings","anti-corrosion properties"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The magnetic (M) part of the composite was commercially available magnetite. The samples used for the dielectric and magnetoelectric measurements were cold-pressed and made in the form of a circular tablet. The measuring electrodes were made of silver-based conductive paste and were attached to the sample. We measured the temperature dependencies of selected electrical parameters (e.g., dielectric permittivity, electrical capacity, and loss angle tangent). We used the dynamic lock-in method to check whether magnetoelectric coupling existed between the E and M phases. In this paper, we present the dielectric properties of pure monocrystalline TGS as a reference sample and compare the results for TGS powder, TGS + carbon powder, and TGS + Fe3O4 powder. The magnetoelectric coupling presumably appeared for the composite TGS + 10 wt. % Fe3O4 , as evidenced by the shift in the phase transition temperature in the TGS. Moreover, the theoretical interpretation of the effect is proposed."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943932","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65f307a140970775cd351764","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"29","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"281fc3e7-9098-45f0-8ed2-8c01a27809d9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/6/1378","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b903fdbe83317426108f","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Jartych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7983f5b2-5f4a-4690-bce1-fdd98127c748"},{"objectId":"624e4ca87523402df09dacec","name":"Levan","lastName":"Chotorlishvili","uuid":"CCFDFBB23332A7106F1B11437770516BB3A59268C0F7245C777F445A0F79A79AD83FE4BBDE3566E7AC5CF3CF055762F937EA7ADD9A73D48764B7090F7DA36D68","orcidId":"0000-0001-7042-9273","documentHash":"1cf6052d-0011-41d1-ba5f-2238528fd6f2"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5ee","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Trybus","uuid":"451FF0E10FDC33831337C0C7D066DFA3503ECD43BA7E6067A919960AF8B51447B96D48B4E6C0ECF28A9B12D9BB178E353808F915D5E472AE32B192602BA6386E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7110-4769","documentHash":"f241057b-b8a1-4d58-b442-112585488e36"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules29061378"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BEV","mechanical engineering","GRA","ICEV","LCA","production engineering","quality","vehicle"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

However, a research gap is the lack of a developed model that allows for the simultaneous analysis of quality and environmental criteria in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) for the selection of materials in newly designed products. Therefore, the objective of the research was to develop a model that supports the prediction of the environmental impact and expected quality of materials and products made from them according to the design solution scenarios considering their LCA. The model implements the GRA method and environmental impact analysis according to the LCA based on ISO 14040. The model test was carried out for light passenger vehicles of BEV with a lithium-ion battery (LiFePO4) and for ICEV. The results indicated a relatively comparable level of quality, but in the case of the environmental impact throughout the life-cycle, the predominant amount of CO2 emissions in the use phase for combustion vehicles. The originality of the developed model to create scenarios of design solutions is created according to which the optimal direction of their development in terms of quality and environment throughout LCA can be predicted."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943934","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cdcf6040970762636d733b","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"6ef368a7-260c-48f3-9314-dd3abc319a58"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/4/951","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17040951"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0ODY0Njk0MzkzNA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
