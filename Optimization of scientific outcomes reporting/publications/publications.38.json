The lack of antiviral drugs and/or effective vaccines renders early and reliable diagnosis the basis of viral disease management, underlining the importance of point-of-care (POC) diagnostics. A novel POC diagnostic device utilizing photonic integrated circuits (PICs), microfluidics, and information and communication technologies for the detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza A (SIV) was validated using spiked and clinical oral fluid samples. Metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated to assess the performance of the device. For PRRSV, the device achieved a sensitivity of 83.5%, specificity of 77.8%, and DOR values of 17.66, whereas the values for SIV were 81.8%, 82.2%, and 20.81, respectively. The POC device and PICs can be used for the detection of PRRSV and SIV in the field, paving the way for the introduction of novel technologies in the field of animal POC diagnostics to further optimize livestock biosecurity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128208","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"988","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/5/988","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3776","name":"Ioannis","lastName":"Bossis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99467773-66b9-45cb-a186-4b46cee2fe9e"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3775","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Giusti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0646b734-d98e-409f-998b-18b316472632"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3774","name":"Amadeu","lastName":"Griol","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caff0598-87d5-4188-a8d4-8d264cbe6b95"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3773","name":"Carlos","lastName":"Sanchez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d9dd071-5e08-4303-ab22-688687f88db0"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3772","name":"Sara","lastName":"Recuero","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b97c7ce-6db1-47ec-a0ea-5f420c454fa9"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3771","name":"Clare","lastName":"Squires","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e2aa28d4-bb6a-4fc7-ba11-a072b5ab92d9"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3770","name":"Athanasios","lastName":"Gelasakis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb45db5c-8ec7-413d-a294-9e099cb64df7"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a376f","name":"Balka","lastName":"Gyula","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18bcb28c-d19b-45a5-a3cc-1ae43bb43342"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a376e","name":"Lilla","lastName":"Denes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac3fb764-0b24-4e5d-881c-75121f77f636"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a376d","name":"Martina","lastName":"Benedetti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8fdf78bd-473b-4976-8501-96ab6489ca83"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a376c","name":"Lapo","lastName":"Nannucci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0da7c46a-f89b-4438-bf44-86ca71ab1913"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3769","name":"Georgios","lastName":"Manessis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb84b746-5dba-4a27-9404-5a06ae3f4902"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d6b","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Woźniakowski","uuid":"6D282CFCD3A7758B6F62BC672552908C0AA3BFA7E8AEA251B82246AFAA5A380A7601C034C662EDB06D1DAC96FEDDFDEE170F3BCD44E519D0E60AD2F0542F38F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-1333-4275","documentHash":"207a7d5b-ae39-4599-8ff4-03f9d039e209"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["interpreters' style","explicitating style","explicitation","European Parliament","corpus study"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709274878c28a04739605e","5e7092eb878c28a04739f2ae"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Interpreters’ explicitating styles : a corpus study of material from the European Parliament","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478348","mniswId":"9599","title":"Interpreting","doi":null,"issn":"1384-6647","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"ca395200-b9de-4b44-8b31-d1c44bbf23a9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6299e8b74097072c2b7b6dce","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709274878c28a04739605e","5e7092eb878c28a04739f2ae"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article investigates explicitation as an indicator of individual interpreters’ style in the outputs of professional interpreters working for the European Parliament. The material used for the study is a sub-corpus of target texts by 12 interpreters extracted from a larger bi-directional parallel corpus of plenary contributions with the aid of voice recognition software. Interpretations from English into Polish and vice versa have been annotated manually for various explicitating shifts, ranging from cohesion-related additions and specifications to more extensive pragmatically oriented amplifications. Our initial hypothesis holds that interpreters working for the Polish Language Unit, who regularly cooperate and as a result acquire similar linguistic habits, are expected to display limited variety in their explicitating styles. The results do not confirm this assumption. The interpreters in our sample differ substantially in their explicitating styles, especially regarding frequency and consistency. This finding precludes any convergence due to their status as members of the same community of practice."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128211","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62a2f73e4097075196bee3b7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"08004189-2c26-4f8b-866b-b26b5bddfa98"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"163–191","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://benjamins.com/catalog/intp.00081.gum","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f2ae","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bartłomiejczyk","uuid":"D19A629EEE696F8DBAF018269B3234A14B18EF5516A6CCFE2B1DD9FEA9101AC3659B9A58461C5B550EC1B3B71E2E25788BA7588DD422A6AF4EAA087C857F03C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6645-1849","documentHash":"94bcba91-e32d-4b92-a07a-b8a4d6b32e20"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a04739605e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Gumul","uuid":"AFE2FB3D8702DAFFE591D79D108AACCD290D30A26DA057CD4141656C468B64BD44F8433EC9B935029DB11A1B18BCEEF848022CB2703DAD543B495FAC8FEF40C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-0859-6067","documentHash":"2a6db68a-18df-4ec9-98f1-edddfad9af16"}],"doi":"10.1075/intp.00081.gum"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","uid":"bIPOz_WiDWR0kK88nqXox3A","uuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","parentUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","rootUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","name":"Instytut Podstaw Informatyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709344878c28a0473a5f77"]},{"id":"5e709198878c28a04737fe23","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Dalhousie University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709344878c28a0473a5f77","629741f640970702be51bfd5"]},{"id":"5e7091dc878c28a04738d68e","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Ottawa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629741f640970702be51bfd3"]},{"id":"629741f640970702be51bfcf","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Montreal","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629741f640970702be51bfd6","629741f640970702be51bfd0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"deepSimDEF: deep neural embeddings of gene products and gene ontology terms for functional analysis of genes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477338","mniswId":"2421","title":"BIOINFORMATICS","doi":null,"issn":"1367-4803","eissn":"1460-2059","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"769e39e6-5bb2-4d80-a77b-ce0c5049483a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629741f640970702be51bfcb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629741f640970702be51bfd0","5e709344878c28a0473a5f77","629741f640970702be51bfd3","629741f640970702be51bfd4","629741f640970702be51bfd5","629741f640970702be51bfd6"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Motivation\nThere is a plethora of measures to evaluate functional similarity (FS) of genes based on their co-expression, protein–protein interactions and sequence similarity. These measures are typically derived from hand-engineered and application-specific metrics to quantify the degree of shared information between two genes using their Gene Ontology (GO) annotations.\n\nResults\nWe introduce deepSimDEF, a deep learning method to automatically learn FS estimation of gene pairs given a set of genes and their GO annotations. deepSimDEF’s key novelty is its ability to learn low-dimensional embedding vector representations of GO terms and gene products and then calculate FS using these learned vectors. We show that deepSimDEF can predict the FS of new genes using their annotations: it outperformed all other FS measures by >5–10% on yeast and human reference datasets on protein–protein interactions, gene co-expression and sequence homology tasks. Thus, deepSimDEF offers a powerful and adaptable deep neural architecture that can benefit a wide range of problems in genomics and proteomics, and its architecture is flexible enough to support its extension to any organism.\n\nAvailability and implementation\nSource code and data are available at https://github.com/ahmadpgh/deepSimDEF\n\nSupplementary information\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online:\nhttps://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/bioinformatics/38/11/10.1093_bioinformatics_btac304/1/btac304_supplementary_data.zip?Expires=1656620290&Signature=P1NQrXX~z0NdWuReSslhCqMEohi7aNyr~YYCNxJ0-qvoYOBZgq2IEzsHgvCAcZh84W8uQulG8CP1bHSwQK6wNyTHUfDZUw7qa0mFM7STA0cEneZQIDUczyma7yq-R3wkpAGfUa-x7X8qzdFda-woR4tSAZ6cEuEJbOX6vCSX1Bn-MO2OjpjChz1n-tJLH2tM05QeKSvCYYJmlD9ABy~DkK-r6xg49mbsLbGCnlEov~uIkAZffPS1D9wvl4DlQJn5NO5PWrFIJVXATPclQBMxvYxPUJSNdFbYGSzP~QwrTREOAq1Lbj82njk~fclScTTbdYSPzURNF8AS5B1fGQeVwA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128212","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6297427840970702be51c569","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"38","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"e17e7f6c-2901-4fc8-9067-0f8ab856c40d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"3051-3061","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac304/43692568/btac304.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629741f640970702be51bfd6","name":"Julie","lastName":"Hussin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4295-3339","documentHash":"d5876a34-ed5c-4dfa-a021-9d20e7561395"},{"objectId":"629741f640970702be51bfd5","name":"Robert G","lastName":"Beiko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55c44a52-9c6c-4c9a-83bb-6cd7f34b061a"},{"objectId":"629741f640970702be51bfd4","name":"Jean-Christophe","lastName":"Grenier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82387760-540a-4c0e-8a88-67a87cc19fb2"},{"objectId":"629741f640970702be51bfd3","name":"Marina","lastName":"Sokolova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"587fb861-ee5a-45d3-be60-e0331a87917c"},{"objectId":"629741f640970702be51bfd0","name":"Ahmad","lastName":"Pesaranghader","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5afb3c1e-c2e2-4ae1-b2e0-b6edaaf203d5"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5f77","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Matwin","uuid":"0A766745E1F9F7DDBCDCAE3FA91ED5EE107CA1A64D4FEDF9ED0C09F9C9FBC3BFA3E57ACCA3E158753B818C49CB598ED54C86CC510725CFAF5A42C8A7F5BA58A1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07f9075f-604b-40b5-9de2-85c9b5e714da"}],"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btac304"},{"mainLanguageName":"hiszpański","keywords":[{"languageCode":"spa","keywords":["Epigrama","Mario Martín Gijón","poesía española del siglo XXI","tradición clásica","ruptura"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Epigram","Mario Martín Gijón","Spanish Twenty-First-Century Poetry","Classical Tradition","Rupture"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f33e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"De mu(d/t)ación.

Afghanistan emerges as an example of a fragile state which can be explained through the concept of system approach. The article also looks at the concept of system approach and method takes the case study of Afghanistan to demonstrate the perils of a fragile state since 2014 following international military drawdown. Besides, it also looks at how the EU is responding to these challenges as part of its security and development strategy towards Afghanistan.

The stratigraphy is based on reports of co-occurring trilobite \nassemblages. The relatively diversified fauna pre-dates the Taghanic event and is dominated in terms of diversi\u0002ty by atrypides and rhynchonellides (11 species each); other frequent species include Poloniproductus varians, \nAulacella prisca, Tyersella tetragona, Schizophoria schnuri, Athyris ex gr. concentrica, Yeothyris? sinuata, and \nThomasaria simplex. Spinatrypa ennigaldinannae Halamski and Baliński sp. nov. from the upper Eifelian is char\u0002acterised by a transverse shell, typically 16–18 mm wide with 19–22 ribs. Prodavidsonia ebbigahuseni Halamski \nand Baliński sp. nov. differs from other representatives of the genus in having nearly flat shells. Eressella coronata\nHalamski and Baliński, nom. nov. is proposed as a replacement name for the permanently invalid Rhynchonella \ncoronata Kayser, 1871 (non R. coronata Moore, 1861). Thomasaria simplex is documented as being a particularly \nvariable species (costation, tongue, interarea position), so its broad taxonomic treatment is favoured.

The representativeness of the results for the domestic and world practice of further operation of such structures is ensured by the typical technical and technological approaches to the construction, materials, and conditions of their work. Dams are built of soil materials and operated over significant time periods while their standard service life has been exhausted, which increases the environmental and technical danger of their further operation. Visual surveys were conducted and the technical condition was instrumentally diagnosed by the geophysical method of the earth's natural pulsed electromagnetic field (ENPEMF); observational data were mathematically treated. The possibility of arranging areas of increased water filtration through the SHS body was substantiated, as well as watering, loosening, and suffusion; potentially dangerous zones prone to landslides, cracks, and collapse were determined. The probability of risk of an accident on dams was estimated at their cascading arrangement as a result of filtration deformations of the body and the base of the structure. Under current operating conditions, the possibility of letting the normative and excess (forced) water volumes through water discharge facilities due to precipitation or a breakthrough of the structure located upstream was estimated.

The study was conducted for one garbage truck. To achieve the maximum efficiency of the algorithm, it has been assumed that the points of discharge of collected waste by a garbage truck could be arranged along the way between the proposed clusters of garbage collection points. The optimization of the built routes has been proven, taking into consideration the above assumptions. The study's results could be used to reduce the budget expenditures by territorial community authorities for the collection and disposal of waste. The reported solutions could significantly shorten the garbage collection time, which would improve the environmental and aesthetic situation within the study area. The use of a new algorithm makes it possible to display the results both in quantitative and qualitative forms.\n\nAn improved k-means algorithm with a maximum cluster size was selected for clustering. Each cluster was built on the basis of the maximal value of garbage truck tonnage. That means that the size of the cluster would be determined by the value of the maximum amount of waste that can be removed by a garbage truck in one run.\n\nA task of the traveling salesman was applied to find the shortest path between representatives of one cluster (garbage collection points) calling at all its points and to establish the optimal path between all the clusters formed for a territorial community.\n\nThe issue related to efficient waste disposal in local communities tends to aggravate rapidly while the task to optimize garbage collection and removal is becoming increasingly acute. This is because at present, along with the increase in the global population, all types of production are increasing their volumes, which, in turn, leads to an increase in the amount of waste, in particular, household."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128232","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623381152467f0713d57a05b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"3 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"116578f7-1be1-4c2e-8b84-c3840f84a655"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"24-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252001/250764","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62344ef32467f00ffe948007","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Lytvyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9676-0180","documentHash":"567e316c-63e2-4f50-a62f-d65a80ea1ad2"},{"objectId":"62344ef32467f00ffe948006","name":"Roman","lastName":"Bihun","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4363-4532","documentHash":"7e1305ec-4532-4571-b7c1-dc46c80735d3"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252001"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62307b702467f034a5d5fe7c","doi":null,"title":"Caritas Christi urget nos : księga jubileuszowa dedykowana Ojcu Profesorowi Piotrowi Liszce CMF","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788366545328","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://integro.bs.katowice.pl/33306295320/ksiazka/caritas-christi-urget-nos?bibFilter=3","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"0a52a572-074a-412a-9bfb-791df95b112e","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb88b","mniswId":"46700","name":"Papieski Wydział Teologiczny we Wrocławiu","documentHash":"ad9378a1-1798-46b7-beca-86b85e58d775"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","uid":"b-QhPpCcUJetk1AqkjBdSkQ","uuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","parentUuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","rootUuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","name":"Uniwersytet Papieski Jana Pawła II w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b1317"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Kościół sakramentem królestwa Bożego w Jezusie Chrystusie","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62307bdf2467f034a5d5ff81","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b1317"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058128235","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"93-105","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://integro.bs.katowice.pl/33306295320/ksiazka/caritas-christi-urget-nos?bibFilter=3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b1317","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Królikowski","uuid":"AC18D17F2977F42739B04AF1D66AF9DCCC39257FE3953683593A1C03483AB1D895B467EFAC8D10F7E7E4B20C29B07F6CEC9A59CB172BEC96F838707FE3D473D8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3929-6008","documentHash":"9d99103b-444a-43b8-838f-4322f4e03d3d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["deep learning","natural language processing","content analysis","Big Data","text classification"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","uid":"brSLXPVso2IWE01FTmuoK5g","uuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","parentUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","rootUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","name":"Collegium Civitas w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b123"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"How to prepare data for the automatic classification of politically related beliefs expressed on Twitter?

The article raises the question about how researchers’ subjective decisions affect the performance of supervised deep learning models. The aim is to deliver practical advice for researchers concerning: (1) whether it is more efficient to monitor coders’ work to ensure a high quality training dataset or have every document coded once and obtain a larger dataset instead; (2) whether lemmatisation improves model performance; (3) if it is better to apply passive learning or active learning approaches; and (4) if the answers are dependent on the models’ classification tasks. The models were trained to detect if a tweet is about current affairs or political issues, the tweet’s subject matter and the tweet author’s stance on this. The study uses a sample of 200,000 manually coded tweets published by Polish political opinion leaders in 2019. The consequences of decisions under different conditions were checked by simulating 52,800 results using the fastText algorithm (DV: F1-score). Linear regression analysis suggests that the researchers’ choices not only strongly affect model performance but may also lead, in the worst-case scenario, to a waste of funds."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128237","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"57","pagesFromTo":"301 - 321","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11135-022-01372-2","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b123","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Matuszewski","uuid":"5E14B4F1B96CB6C65ACEEEE4E0F74C0896740CD309143ABDE6AABA8458D629505E3721F0E3DACCE335AC3DF3B7BC73C1ED459EBC0E49CF68352ACBE6878D1928","orcidId":"0000-0003-0069-157X","documentHash":"a49a93d0-8111-4951-a84d-a04384e0bd70"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11135-022-01372-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["prawo podatkowe","podatki i opłaty lokalne","opłata od posiadania psów","sąd administracyjny","zwolnienia od opłat","naruszenie prawa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tax law","local taxes and charges","dog tax","administrative court","tax exemption","violation of law"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b99d9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zwolnienie przedmiotowe w podatkach i opłatach lokalnych na przykładzie opłaty od posiadania psa.

Consequently, all the most important  structural elements of a tax must be specified in a statute. Article 217 of the Constitution specifies which elements must be included in statutes, but this catalogue does not include object-related exemptions, which, according to the Constitution, may be regulated in legal acts of a lower level. However, it appears that determining what type of exemption we are dealing with is by no means simple. This commentary analyses a judgment of the Provincial Administrative Court in Olsztyn, examining what type of exemption the Court faced. The author disagrees with the Court's decision and claims that the Działdowo City Council applied an object-related exemption, which can hypothetically be used by any person, so the resolution should not be held invalid."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128238","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621383632467f012be922d73","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"80b28fce-513f-443a-80c2-eed35bfebb64"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"166-180","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Object-Related Exemptions in Local Taxes and Charges on the Example of Dog Tax.

It can couple changes in the intracellular redox state to the development, especially the defense responses, of plants. Several studies have focused on measuring glutathione levels in virus infected plants, but have not provided complete information. Therefore, we analyzed, for the first time, the content of glutathione as well as its ultrastructural distribution related to susceptible and hypersensitive potato–Potato virus Y NTN (PVYNTN) interaction, with an aim of providing new insight into interactive responses to PVYNTN stress. Our findings reported that the inoculation of PVYNTN caused a dynamic increase in the content of glutathione, not only in resistance but also in susceptible reaction, especially at the first steps of plant–virus interaction. Moreover, the increase in hypersensitive response was much more dynamic, and accompanied by a significant reduction in the content of PVYNTN. By contrast, in susceptible potato Irys, the content of glutathione decreased between 7 and 21 days after virus inoculation, which led to a significant increase in PVYNTN concentration. Additionally, our findings clearly indicated the steady induction of two selected potato glutathione S-transferase StGSTF1 and StGSTF2 genes after PVYNTN inoculation, regardless of the interaction type. However, the relative expression level of StGSTF1 did not significantly differ between resistant and susceptible plants, whereas the relative expression levels of StGSTF2 differed between susceptible and resistant reactions. Therefore, we proposed that StGSTF2 can act as a marker of the type of response to PVYNTN. Our observations indicated that glutathione is an important component of signaling as well as the regulatory network in the PVYNTN–potato pathosystem. In resistance responses to PVYNTN, this metabolite activates plant defenses by reducing potential damage to the host plant cell, causing a reduction in virus concentration, while it can also be involved in the development of PVYNTN elicited symptoms, as well as limiting oxidative stress, leading to systemic infection in susceptible potato plants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128244","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/7/3797","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc079","name":"Edmund","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":"B32B9360C750C53EDA1E2C49B8C7474E63D0D2FEE3796A5A81DA22AB394EF94F84753C931F7FAC77BECDCF106F549A69075B69867D4987E9C38AAEB64E121968","orcidId":"0000-0001-6646-1254","documentHash":"0ffda1e4-6b2a-4254-a86f-809beb1efaad"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc076","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Ciąćka","uuid":"C3CE312096B41548C5305664D583045066325F895A320310BD64481A5C3D1FD12685F0D712A96B924E20038BA6E6AAC7E96FF181B3B3121044BA2E3DDA4B7B08","orcidId":"0000-0003-1485-2901","documentHash":"2e1ae3e9-602d-4c9b-bceb-f595a2252123"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4ce9","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Przewodowska(Barnyk)","uuid":"553219683D45394C693CF7C588F39019180D3D5E2AD43FCC14CD2B7C47C69395212A5754955FA3B714A271B2C0C7F710BE53AE29B4A9BCA39DC2472428A14F13","orcidId":"0000-0002-4645-3772","documentHash":"db8bb07b-a870-4950-9c3c-f0ae79dd3080"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b48a7","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Przewodowski","uuid":"429B6C5E4F3FFCEF3E41A953203B36BE2CA9322FC5FA3CE93BEB326FA1936CBE1BFA7D2157859D7F0CEA0771E7AD954D405419882838DEFA4E326FD9762C1205","orcidId":"0000-0002-4456-4727","documentHash":"1dc85d07-9497-4dde-bebe-ddfcfea0d46d"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a04739413e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Otulak-Kozieł","uuid":"CABBF7600704D184645D8A52C47946DC12973B09F1CF46D1463A95F0D663C698ED0D809C4F0694E022A7B06D769DB2404AB536A320A6EBEBDF6BB3BB34607517","orcidId":"0000-0001-9424-1662","documentHash":"5ee98adf-e778-4032-9790-f1aaac8f9922"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23073797"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Special Issue on Application of Instrumental Methods for Food and Food By-Products Analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d09014097070cd34d8b24","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a0473921fc"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The application of various analytical procedures and methods determining the proper-\r\nties and safety of food and food constituents is a particularly important topic when dealing\r\nwith food and food by-product analyses.

Both of them are seeds with tremendous nutritional value; compared to other cereals, they contain much more fat. The aim of the study was to present the parameters characterizing thermal properties of amaranth and quinoa oils, such as: oxidation induction time, oxidation kinetic parameters, and melting profile. In isolated oils, the peroxide value, oxidative stability by the Rancimat test (in 120 °C) and the pressure differential scanning calorimetry (PDSC) method (at 100, 110, 120, 130, 140 °C), fatty acids composition, and their distribution between the triacylglycerol positions were determined. The kinetic parameters of the oxidation process (activation energy, pre-exponential factor, and reaction rate constants) were calculated using the Ozawa–Flynn–Wall method and the Arrhenius equation. To measure the melting profile, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method was used. Both types of seeds are a good source of unsaturated fatty acids. Induction time of oxidation suggests that amaranth oil may have better resistance to oxidation than quinoa oil. The melting characteristics of the oils show the presence of low-melting triacylglycerol fractions, mainly containing unsaturated fatty acids, which means that a small amount of energy is required to melt the fats."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128259","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/4/2166","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cfa554097070cd34d62e3","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Bryś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"04252f91-8b6c-45a0-9998-daf9408ce60f"},{"objectId":"629cfa554097070cd34d62e2","name":"Agata","lastName":"Górska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3976f554-b826-47ca-846f-5c1db9464da0"},{"objectId":"629cfa554097070cd34d62e1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wirkowska-Wojdyła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c75e9a9-7e09-44d2-beb8-b42d0263ab72"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392222","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ostrowska-Ligęza","uuid":"5A3FF75CD93D0A8E531C9B92941DE1C6D223FDE980C5E4BCCF6B32FF8B322B7661E950E14BCB67C4F5BB7D27C38D0CF2A9B1B6FF47C88552FFE6566786B39D32","orcidId":"0000-0002-8387-8462","documentHash":"7c7785b2-b43f-4e13-8b1b-5f16417a4905"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12042166"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["soil carbon","soil enzymes","soil respiration","manure microflora","plant production"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cattle Manure Fermented with Biochar and Humic Substances Improve the Crop Biomass, Microbiological Properties and Nutrient Status of Soil","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2073-4395","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ecde59b8-e697-42b5-b3f5-ad846db663c6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd348089a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70933a878c28a0473a53fe","629c98ef4097070cd348089f","629c98ef4097070cd34808a0","629c98ef4097070cd34808a1","629c98ef4097070cd34808a2","629c98ef4097070cd34808a3","629c98ef4097070cd34808a4","629c98ef4097070cd34808a5","629c98ef4097070cd34808a6","629c98ef4097070cd34808a7"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Co-composting of raw manure with other organic sources has recently gained the attention of the scientific community. In the present study, raw manure and manures enriched with humic substances (Humac) or biochar were co-composted to improve their physico-chemical properties. We conducted an experiment including variants consisting of soil amended with manure (M), manure + Humac (M + H), manure + biochar (M + B), and unamended (control). Soil physico-chemical, biological, and plant properties were assessed altogether. All matured manures differed from each other physico-chemically (nutrient content) and in microbial composition, and hence their effects on the observed parameters. Compared to control, the soil respiration and enzyme activities related to N and P mineralization were enhanced due to the amendment of either manure or enriched manures. The M + H treatment resulted in higher pH of the manures as compared to other treatments, whereas the M + B and M treatments revealed the highest Corg contents of the final product, which was negatively correlated with HA:FA. In the same manner, M + H and M + B were the most prominent treatments, causing higher variations in basal soil respiration. The same treatments resulted in the highest percent increase values of soil enzymes related to C, N, and P, which further show the potential of manure modification as a viable option to boost soil fertility and health.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128262","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/2/368","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd34808a7","name":"Martin","lastName":"Brtnicky","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"470b7a62-ac8a-4ae5-902a-26d0c7747b06"},{"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd34808a6","name":"Oldrich","lastName":"Latal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bcb5cdab-f8ce-4929-ac52-c71c0fd33b3a"},{"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd34808a5","name":"Tivadar","lastName":"Baltazar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51c44705-1029-4211-9a1a-b178045af1e4"},{"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd34808a4","name":"Antonin","lastName":"Kintl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34a5fb84-b6f0-47c9-b811-42ea9058a9a5"},{"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd34808a3","name":"Adnan","lastName":"Mustafa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38639970-9198-46fd-98a9-fe69a5f5cb3e"},{"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd34808a2","name":"Jiri","lastName":"Kucerik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf51f280-ec35-4f7d-a725-9bff75dc463a"},{"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd34808a1","name":"Tereza","lastName":"Hammerschmiedt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2cdfd3fd-34a0-443a-a60c-23b33035d9af"},{"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd34808a0","name":"Lucie","lastName":"Bielska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4f5b4bc-0aba-478f-ac75-f19b63ed77e4"},{"objectId":"629c98ef4097070cd348089f","name":"Jiri","lastName":"Holatko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24a2bd27-fa92-4f33-9832-d2f3c2f4e5c2"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a53fe","name":"Maja","lastName":"Radziemska","uuid":"F16909B2F0C594C5EA5AB2C145BE90CFEEA14A48CA90D9D4824051912FC2B3FC4FC9E7D2A3266C8A1BD64306A603FDBCAFD3EA7B0AD12A270B5018F1BD77B2DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3526-5944","documentHash":"c1e899af-a37d-4ddc-8151-8234dcce63ce"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12020368"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mindfulness","marital satisfaction","relationship quality","conflict resolution strategies"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e6878c28a04739eeb8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mindfulness, relationship quality, and conflict resolution strategies used by partners \nin close relationships","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479d62","mniswId":"4713","title":"Current Issues in Personality Psychology","doi":null,"issn":"2353-4192","eissn":"2353-561X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"528adfa0-a450-4c81-be3c-e52ddc723ff4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2022-01-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62971c2440970702be4f4b42","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e6878c28a04739eeb8","62971c2440970702be4f4b45"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: Mindfulness is a specific state of attention which involves a constant focus on what is happening at the present time in a way that is neither judgmental nor evaluative. The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of mindfulness for relationship quality and conflict resolution strategies in close relationships. Five components of mindfulness were examined: observing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging, and nonreactivity. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE: The study included 153 participants (79 women, 74 men; aged 19-60 years). 39.2% of the respondents were married, 20.9% were engaged, 39.9 were in romantic relationships. The mean duration of the close relationship was 6.25 years. The following measures were used: the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, the Patterns of Problem Solving Questionnaire, and the Dyadic Adaptation Scale. RESULTS: Acting with awareness, dialogue and avoiding conflict escalation strategy were predictors of relationship quality. The relationship status (marriage and engagement) was also a predictor of relationship quality. Gender, age, and duration of the relationship were not predictors of relationship quality. The results showed correlation between mindfulness and relationship quality (r = .28). There was a positive correlation between nonjudging and satisfaction in the relationship and between describing and emotional expression. Also, there was a negative correlation between nonreactivity and compatibility. Mindfulness was positively correlated with dialogue and negatively correlated with escalation of and withdrawal from a conflict. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness is important to the relationship’s quality and conflict resolution strategies. Among the components of mindfulness, especially acting with awareness is important to relationship quality"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128264","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62971c2440970702be4f4b47","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"bc9bff87-9ba6-4a9d-9675-cda17425bd6e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"135-146","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Mindfulness-relationship-quality-and-conflict-resolution-strategies-used-by-partners-r-nin-close-relationships,75,45933,1,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62971c2440970702be4f4b45","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Lip","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1d020b7-a761-4195-bc8d-9c2948f2ee38"},{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739eeb8","name":"Eugenia","lastName":"Mandal","uuid":"0DCAC80C1B0B0A5CA526475D4B00D9E4DA09C648154BFAB5F4134F94EABEFFE5B61B3B3F682CE3DD099312571B45924438BBA02A1AC3FA63C4235FAB86366E66","orcidId":"0000-0003-1125-1756","documentHash":"0a238736-7a78-4f35-9b11-1b84525920f1"}],"doi":"10.5114/cipp.2021.111981"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["prześladowania chrześcijan, Irak, Syria, Chrześcijanie na Bliskim Wschodzie"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6295d4974097072fefb896c3","doi":null,"title":"W służbie społeczeństwu.

In the country this mistletoe has northern\nborder of distribution range. The previous literature data suggested that the subspecies has\nonly few localities in the Silesian Foothils and in northern part of the Silesian Beskid Mts\n(southern Poland) and in addition, some of them were not confirmed. Mistletoe Viscum album subsp. abietis has been reported to increase its range and abundance in Europe recently therefore authors decided to update the distribution data of the subspecies the aforementioned area. The data about distribution of host tree silver fir Picea abies was taken from forest database and from personal communication with foresters. The area was search to find\nlocalities of the individuals on trees. In case of the single specimens on fir trees binoculars\nwere used. In total 39 localities were given including more than 30 new localities when compared to literature data from 20th century. In Silesian Foothils there are 20 localities and\n19 stands in the Silesian Beskid Mts. On the localities the abundance of individuals ranged\nfrom single plants on one tree to massive infestation of several dozen of fir trees.\nThe common fir mistletoe distribution seems to be an underestimated in the southern part\nof the Silesian Voivodeship, it is highly probable that its next localities will be found in nearest\nfuture. Despite the category endangered “EN” in the Red Book of Plants of the Silesian Voivodship the species is not threatened anymore. On the contrary it becomes to pose a serious\nthreat to silver fir because it can contribute to decline of trees. During the massive infestation\nof firs by mistletoe, fir trees often die gradually. The obtained new information will allow for\na better recognition of the current species distribution and a possible revision of the threat\ncategory of common fir mistletoe in the territory of Silesian Voivodeship. For a more detailed\nanalysis of the degree of expansion of this species, it would be advisable to examine the\nnumber of individuals and study the development of mistletoe over time on the host on randomly selected trees."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128285","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6666d66940970767cfbbaf4b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3 (23)","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"2d119cdd-cd50-4f4a-832b-1a3ffd65a44c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3(23)","pagesFromTo":"21-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pjmee.ath.eu/site/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-Beczala-i-inni-vol-323-21-27.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629887f9409707571438bb90","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Jonderko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5fae9c17-99aa-40c5-aaa8-3194e721e72c"},{"objectId":"629887f9409707571438bb8f","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Beczała","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7239fb1c-9c36-4e8e-a85e-12232c33fbc9"},{"objectId":"5e7091fd878c28a04738e383","name":"Damian","lastName":"Chmura","uuid":"40D57366F77EBE6B8A6B9FA079F5BDDFB81A0DE2A090DF464A85057A85B4AD63166B4C85D53A5378F9856A3F70169E98CDC9F5D548B5061F626FB952872E8B84","orcidId":"0000-0002-0242-8962","documentHash":"eb66a521-8719-43f9-9d7d-1cd07573c2bd"}],"doi":"10.53052/pjmee.2022.3.03"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["tlenek węgla","pierwsza pomoc","YouTube","media społecznościowe","weryfikacja","trucizny"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["carbon monoxide","first aid","YouTube","social media","verification","poisons"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","uid":"bbhWY-GzmS7IoRMQpyKKYhw","uuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","parentUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","rootUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","name":"Uniwersytet Bielsko-Bialski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709204878c28a04738eb46"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"YouTube as a source of information on carbon monoxide poisoning : a content-quality analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478278","mniswId":"9200","title":"International Journal of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health","doi":null,"issn":"1232-1087","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"bb4f7625-2e07-426f-a817-a1618eef0003"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-02-03","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622f13da2467f016697be127","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937c878c28a0473aad05","60c3346f9543c723365440d8","658ecba24097076c145d3442","658ecba24097076c145d3443","658ecba24097076c145d3444","5e709204878c28a04738eb46","5e709407878c28a0473b5122"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives: The variety of clinical presentation on the topic of carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication ranges from slight headache to coma or death. YouTube allows patients to search not only for entertainment but also medical advice. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the content and quality of YouTube videos concerning CO poisoning as a source of knowledge for non-medical audience. Material and Methods: On the December 8, 2020 a YouTube search was conducted for the following phrases: “carbon monoxide poisoning,” “carbon monoxide symptoms,” “CO poisoning,” “carbon monoxide asphyxiation,” “carbon monoxide intoxication” using the “incognito mode” and without attachment to Google Account. The search results were set as: “default” in the YouTube browser. The first 50 results were taken into consideration. Two raters, a specialist in emergency medicine and a specialist in clinical toxicology rated videos with Quality Criteria for Consumer Health Information (DISCERN), Global Quality Score (GQS) and Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). “VidIQ Vision for YouTube” plug-in was used. Results: Ninety-five videos were included. The interclass coefficient for DISCERN, GQS and JAMA scores were: 0.8, 0.74 and 0.62 reaching good and moderate reliability. The mean DISCERN/GQS/JAMA was 28.1 (SD 7.9), 2.5 (SD 0.8) and 1.1 (SD 0.7) respectively. Higher DISCERN/GQS/JAMA had videos providing information on: exposure time, treatment options, hyperbaric chamber indications as well as physician speaker (p < 0.05).

Videos providing misleading information had a higher like ratio. Conclusions: The overall video quality was poor indicating inappropriate educational and informative value for patients who search information about carbon monoxide poisoning."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128293","journalIssue":{"objectId":"624aec362467f01ec7fe3196","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"35","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"c74c5660-4db9-42bd-bd4a-5fc9c03a8faa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"285-295","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35119057/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658ecba24097076c145d3444","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Racisz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"50e1170a-21c9-4c2e-a79e-e30ef7052837"},{"objectId":"658ecba24097076c145d3443","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krakowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"392b17ae-83d3-48e5-b45c-319f6632f9f7"},{"objectId":"658ecba24097076c145d3442","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Rak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b768a50a-db6f-42b1-9aaa-a08681f56b7f"},{"objectId":"60c3346f9543c723365440d8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Krakowiak","uuid":"F2C11B28D121EB87A1AA94421AD89DAF177561C9D7627CEB08E4AF2E052BFEEAF19EC26358833CB140DBCF3C9914315E5C9B1F8162BBBB9CD844B38FE0A942B9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad943272-728a-42a6-ae9d-688293a24db0"},{"objectId":"5e709407878c28a0473b5122","name":"Anna","lastName":"Krakowiak","uuid":"2AF0DCB02D7CB493311C860ECD84C03EE55A496F4D09030B810DE38409AD2B9D5D118B45B0F7446C78F061404C427ACE0F3B74003AC2E82C206750CC89925F05","orcidId":"0000-0002-2832-8302","documentHash":"99460c9a-caa4-4d0a-a218-43eaa2406ae1"},{"objectId":"5e70937c878c28a0473aad05","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Słoniewski","uuid":"D906B2044FEA41860BDB71553C886E945044C2BA1E27999FBC1125CB1C49748ED45F07B098FC17288F322E63A02A2D373F18D18AC4AD180DCDD2F1F35C798BD5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8295-2336","documentHash":"304cf0e1-5e0b-48e4-abb0-74cf002682cc"},{"objectId":"5e709204878c28a04738eb46","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ilczak","uuid":"5247358ED207965C6CB5524912CD72565E563C60B0D06EC30947A4DE0CB8DC132850F6CA8DD1D6042650D6E6E9AE4A7A791C005FE5299CDC6CBF62C091A2C673","orcidId":"0000-0003-2478-9045","documentHash":"10b0f88c-174f-4e00-b9a4-e36b14d4530f"}],"doi":"10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01882"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["L-arginine","arginine deiminase","biosensor","conductometric transducer","quality control"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fbec"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Novel highly sensitive conductometric biosensor based on arginine deiminase from Mycoplasma hominis for determination of arginine","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796ff","mniswId":"18385","title":"Sensors and Actuators, B: Chemical","doi":null,"issn":"0925-4005","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d256893c-2544-4e0a-a61a-54f55cdd2f39"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62985d5c409707571437214b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62985d5c409707571437214d","62985d5c409707571437214e","62985d5c409707571437214f","62985d5c4097075714372150","62985d5c4097075714372151","5e709217878c28a04738fbec"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Herein, a novel arginine-sensitive conductometric biosensor based on a recombinant arginine deiminase (ADI) from Mycoplasma hominis, which was produced in E. coli, was developed for the detection of L-arginine. To develop the biosensor, ADI was immobilized by crosslinking with glutaraldehyde on the sensitive surface of the interdigitated electrodes of the conductometric transducer. In this work, the optimal conditions of enzyme immobilization (enzyme concentration and time of immobilization) were determined. The influence of solution parameters (pH, ionic strength and buffer capacity) on the biosensor sensitivity was studied. The biosensor showed high selectivity in the presence of non-target compounds. The main analytical characteristics of the developed biosensor were as follows: linear range – 20–750 μM, limit of detection – 2 µM, response time – 1–1.5 min. The biosensor demonstrated high stability at different storage conditions and was more stable when stored dry at − 18 ºC. Finally, the developed biosensor was used for quantification of arginine in dietary supplements; the results obtained were in good correlation with the results of ion chromatography."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128295","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62985d5c4097075714372154","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"367","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"1d253e5e-3ad5-4dd9-b2ea-c6c3fad38f2b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"367","pagesFromTo":"132023","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0925400522006657?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62985d5c4097075714372151","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Soldatkin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b2173fa-ab38-4172-9e26-50359027023e"},{"objectId":"62985d5c4097075714372150","name":"Sergei","lastName":"Dzyadevych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f812d831-9402-4252-8887-299fcc61b34d"},{"objectId":"62985d5c409707571437214f","name":"Lyubov","lastName":"Fayura","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"098b892e-712b-4103-a167-0d607c867327"},{"objectId":"62985d5c409707571437214e","name":"Olga","lastName":"Saiapina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6a58f89c-670b-4cb1-b57b-d3e34d716cbe"},{"objectId":"62985d5c409707571437214d","name":"Kseniia","lastName":"Berketa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29ca74ea-29f8-4426-a7c6-19daa1fce53d"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fbec","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Sybirnyy","uuid":"43D27114CF4DD18D7A47284231A6012CF7F89EFCEE8BFC3EDDBFB0EDC0A9D171C3E5A601A93CD33FADF606B0E3A998614BCEC9E2687342E6A3842AD099AC8A04","orcidId":"0000-0001-8579-1566","documentHash":"09c3818e-5b92-4b9c-b7b6-62cc2e46d344"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.snb.2022.132023"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MTP2","Gaussian distribution","multitest","desparsified glasso"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A multitest procedure for testing MTP2 for Gaussian distributions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477745","mniswId":"4098","title":"Communications in Statistics - Theory and Methods","doi":null,"issn":"0361-0926","eissn":"1532-415X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7aa316c1-6839-4553-a109-35a3c979588d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629c5b024097070cd347e051","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709257878c28a04739417a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a new test for MTP2 for Gaussian distributions.

In the course of pedological studies, a significant modification of the structure of soil profiles caused by the murshing process was found. The TC/TN values (11.1–17.3) obtained in the study, as well as slight acidification (pHKCl 5.42–6.15) indicate the eutrophy of the studied soil environment, high biological activity and a significant degree of organic matter processing as a result of the processes of mineralization and humification. In addition, the upper levels covered by the process of murshing, compared to peat, are characterized by a lower carbon content and, most often, a similar nitrogen content. In the studied soils, humic substances are mostly represented by the fraction of humic acids. As a consequence, we note high values of the quotient expressing quantitative relations between soil humus fractions (HAs/FAs). For all profiles, the highest share of fulvic acids was recorded in turf murshic levels (M1). The occurrence of the most mature humic acids was found in peat levels not covered by secondary transformation processes after

technologically significant parameters of the influence on the process of reproduction of AR elements when pointing a phone or tablet camera at a special marker image. The main problem of the study is the lack of information regarding the technological process of creating AR products and a large number of parameters that should be taken into account when choosing a particular technological operation, since changes in these factors greatly affect the correct reproduction of AR elements and further use of such products.\n\nThe study determined that in recent years, research has shifted from the field of science to printing and entertainment. This is due to the capabilities of the technology, namely wow effect, content expression, ease of creation, etc., development of digital technologies and competition with digital products.\n\nAlso, a low level of research was revealed in the area of products with unstable usage conditions such as clothing, packaging, etc. This can be explained by the development of printing technologies and opportunities in this area only recently, the increase in the popularity of such products only in recent years and, as a result, insufficient knowledge in this area. However, such products are much more popular in the market, which is emphasized by a significant drop in the production of books, magazines, etc.\n\nThe results of studying the significance of factors in the marker reproduction processes made it possible to identify the most significant ones (marker parameters, material characteristics, usage conditions, etc.). A systematic and integrated approach to the influence factors of this study allows the development of methods for normalizing the process of creating AR products with unstable usage conditions, which makes it possible to produce workable and reliable products in any conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128320","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623456c22467f00ffe94c7ec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"4 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"939ff66d-3a56-48aa-bc6e-8015b54df435"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"51-65","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/251225/250719","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6234679e2467f00ffe953b35","name":"Kateryna","lastName":"Zolotukhina","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6915-0651","documentHash":"45f7a131-0234-4571-bbdd-1ba0a7b5c141"},{"objectId":"6234679e2467f00ffe953b34","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Rozum","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1837-1080","documentHash":"761d9926-6e95-42f8-8a1e-70e4c0c162fa"},{"objectId":"6234679e2467f00ffe953b33","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Skyba","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4534-1960","documentHash":"446b5b6b-93a9-4199-a59e-f99dae05de58"},{"objectId":"6234679e2467f00ffe953b32","name":"Daryna","lastName":"Baranova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6335-6026","documentHash":"a4eb04ff-5df0-4d44-a82f-33910ce831fb"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.251225"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4b","uid":"bbnwounKOU-G0A35qUoTjRg","uuid":"f3b17ba6-8d96-4eee-a245-737a6775d82d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4b","parentUuid":"f3b17ba6-8d96-4eee-a245-737a6775d82d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4b","rootUuid":"f3b17ba6-8d96-4eee-a245-737a6775d82d","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

drzewna to zrównoważony rodzaj paliwa, który jest sprzedawany bezpośrednio jako drewno opałowe lub poddany wstępnej obróbce przez mielenie, suszenie i prasowanie. Paliwa z biomasy zagęszczonej zapewniają korzyści w transporcie, przechowywaniu i przeładunku, a w szczególności pelety drzewne są jednym z najbardziej atrakcyjnych produktów komercyjnych. Mając to na uwadze, celem prezentowanych badań była ocena jakości różnych wypluwek uzyskanych z różnych części drzew pięciu gatunków (i różnym wieku): Eucalyptus spp., Fagus sylavtica L., Pinus eldarica Medw., Pinus radiata D .Don i Robinia pseudoakacjaL. We wszystkich analizowanych przypadkach materiał drzewny pozyskiwano według systemu całego drzewiastego (WTS), z jego gałęziami i liśćmi. Próbki rozdrobniono, rafinowano na niszczarce i osuszono. Granulowanie zostało ostatecznie przeprowadzone przy użyciu granulatora 4 kW linii Bianco (Cuneo, Włochy). Przeprowadzono analizy fizyczne i chemiczne w celu określenia jakości peletów jako źródła energii. Wyniki tej klasyfikacji wykazały, że najlepsze pellety, głównie ze względu na lepsze właściwości mechaniczne, pochodziły z plantacji drzew Eucalyptus spp. (6- i 3-latki) oraz z trzebieży Fagus sylavtica L. (70-latka), natomiast najmniej atrakcyjne odmiany wytworzono z 18-letniego zagajnika Eucalyptus spp. i 3-letnia Robinia pseudoakacjaL. Jeśli chodzi o klasyfikację opracowaną w ramach tego badania, stwierdzono, że wszystkie rodzaje peletów są możliwe do zaklasyfikowania, ponieważ żaden z nich nie przekroczył limitu zawartości substancji toksycznych. Pod względem wpływu gatunku, systemu zarządzania i wieku łodygi na jakość peletek, badanie to wykazało istnienie związku między czasem trwania cyklu a jakością peletek, przy czym wzrost wieku łodygi skutkuje lepszymi właściwościami peletek."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128339","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6253eae62467f02e69a1f384","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"c4dc61e0-0f21-4903-8235-719529ce7e64"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"502","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/4/502/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"},{"objectId":"629919b340970757143f54b6","name":"Rachele","lastName":"Venanzi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a0a5c3d-de03-49b7-ac3f-16309652a4fe"},{"objectId":"629919b340970757143f54b5","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Karaszewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d28d46a7-6aa9-4cdc-9168-cfed89143b4a"},{"objectId":"629919b340970757143f54b4","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Picchio","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9375-7795","documentHash":"a06e4e83-673d-434d-8ff8-74090658a9d6"},{"objectId":"629919b340970757143f54b3","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Walkowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"00c1b0b6-4b57-4927-a23f-36d31ed7137a"},{"objectId":"629919b340970757143f54b2","name":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Civitarese","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6405-6001","documentHash":"adf1e054-876f-4833-8a67-e5686a663b21"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a6358","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Mederski","uuid":"F9858F1D6621F4FE5850C0B301898527A30B67840104DCAFF264F4D9880BF9E12EA510ABBBAD777FBC38368736BB91A4590DC581C4569813BBAA8D6DDED19709","orcidId":"0000-0003-3060-4422","documentHash":"859beab8-29b6-4f14-b147-2014099b8cf7"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a6200","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Bembenek","uuid":"3119442CE47AFD15F136D18415DD8B88C66230D3CE276106F397612E8A48A63FC20FBA4CA38223EECA4C6803B1E3C766FA420A3DB58466B3B2CD766E52B9A621","orcidId":"0000-0002-9437-8439","documentHash":"15506070-81e8-4446-9495-5640d4e69b66"}],"doi":"10.3390/f13040502"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PI-controller","adaptation of parameters","tabular control","stability margin","fuzzy logic"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a5e6992467f0269e7917c1","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Technical University of Ukraine «Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute»","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629648da4097072fefbdf317","629648da4097072fefbdf316","629648da4097072fefbdf319","629648da4097072fefbdf318"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Selecting a method for the parametric adaptation of pi-controller in the control systems of boiler assemblies at thermal power stations with supercritical parameters","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629648da4097072fefbdf314","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629648da4097072fefbdf316","629648da4097072fefbdf317","629648da4097072fefbdf318","629648da4097072fefbdf319"]},"issue":"2 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the context of the growing share of renewable energy sources, the role of thermal power plants (TPPs) as means of balancing the daily power demand curve is increasing. During the day, the load on working units varies widely. Boiler assemblies of these power units undergo changes in their dynamic characteristics when the load changes. Control systems must, regardless of the mode of operation, meet requirements for the quality of operation. This paper has analyzed the latest research and advancements in the field of synthesis of adaptive and robust control systems for inertial contours of direct-flow boiler assemblies. It reports a model of the section of a water-steam flow path, which takes into consideration changes in the dynamic characteristics of the section when changing the load of the power unit. A model of the temperature control system for a boiler assembly has been built involving a tabular method for adjusting the PI-controller parameters. Alternative methods for the adaptation of parameters were proposed. The resulting expressions demonstrate a piecewise-linear approximation of parameter changes depending on the load. In addition, an adaptation unit based on fuzzy logic were suggested. Static characteristics of the adaptation units for PI-controller parameters depending on the load of the power unit were defined. Based on computer modeling, a comparative analysis of the quality indicators of the functioning of the designed control systems was carried out. A method for estimating the stability of systems with adaptation of adjustment parameters was proposed. Based on the static characteristics of the pairs of settings of the PI-controller and the parameters of the control object for each load value at the predefined discreteness, stability reserves were calculated for gain and phase. The results reported here indicate the advantages of a control system with the adaptation of controller parameters based on piecewise-linear dependences"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128341","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629632974097072fefbd1feb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"2

is a burgeoning interest in the development of geopolymers as sustainable construction materials and incombustible inorganic polymers. However, geopolymers show quasi-brittle behavior. To overcome this weakness, hundreds of researchers have focused on the development, characterization, and implementation of geopolymer-reinforced fibers for a wide range of applications for light geopolymers concrete. This paper discusses the rapidly developing geopolymer-reinforced fibers, focusing on material and geometrical properties, numerical simulation, and the effect of fibers on the geopolymers. In the section on the effect of fibers on the geopolymers, a comparison between single and hybrid fibers will show the compressive strength and toughness of each type of fiber. It is proposed that interfacial bonding between matrix and fibers is important to obtain better results, and interfacial bonding between matrix and fiber depends on the type of material surface contact area, such as being hydrophobic or hydrophilic, as well as the softness or roughness of the surface."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128350","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62175ff02467f05a132d3aca","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"5ca059e4-8ebd-4dad-b56e-2d15ebb44ec9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1496","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735a9aafdbe830349642404","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Jeż","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c69f827c-8adc-4494-92ff-48bbf9f47111"},{"objectId":"6735a9aafdbe830349642403","name":"A.V.","lastName":"Sandu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f50131b-d5d2-452b-b3aa-ec6a718e6928"},{"objectId":"6735a9aafdbe830349642402","name":"Marwan","lastName":"Kheimi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c63acd8-6aaf-4a6b-aa0c-23736ffa70a9"},{"objectId":"6735a9aafdbe830349642401","name":"M.A.A.M","lastName":"Salleh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6dcd660a-4c4d-4e4a-bdad-1292e6214a22"},{"objectId":"6735a9aafdbe830349642400","name":"Shayfull","lastName":"Zamree Abd Rahim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"67bf51ae-095d-4ebe-a4ee-d7dbc06b2f19"},{"objectId":"6735a9aafdbe8303496423ff","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Nabiałek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1597fa77-1029-40e6-b40c-91288e733045"},{"objectId":"6735a9aafdbe8303496423fe","name":"M.M.","lastName":"Abdullah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06d68d83-9bbd-4d6b-b418-09536b370f63"},{"objectId":"6735a9aafdbe8303496423fd","name":"Meor  Ahmad","lastName":"Faris","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39d1bc33-4b68-4ed5-8485-e99a06118a9c"},{"objectId":"6735a9aafdbe8303496423fc","name":"M.H.","lastName":"Yazid ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6642d1f1-95cb-4319-b571-a258d521b5db"},{"objectId":"5e709333878c28a0473a4c9f","name":"Adam","lastName":"Rylski","uuid":"1A976757D7F2A7BFEA1B7B0B1C646B86B68E86FD79815ABE465793900CC33943F4F97A225A40921A98220C786C2B994E5AB59AD1A805253A5A4CCA5862802D29","orcidId":"0000-0003-1445-5391","documentHash":"82512520-145c-4be5-a931-6548bd2b6a89"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15041496"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Problemy w odchowie cieląt.

The main reason for this research was the fact that under the Montreal Protocol (1986), as well as Regulation No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014, the F-gases such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulphur hexafluoride, and other agents containing fluorine have to be withdrawn. This includes one of the most commonly used refrigerants—R134a—which, since 1 January 2017, has already been withdrawn. It also includes the R404A refrigerant. R1234ze and R1234yf are suggested as substitutions for R134a. The basic parameters determining the application of those agents are their global warming potential (GWP) indicator, which is below 150, and reduction in fluorinated greenhouse gases emission by a third, simply by withdrawing them (with 2010 as a reference level). The current state of knowledge enables researchers to foresee the influence of some hydrodynamic instabilities on the condensation of fluorinated refrigerants in minichannels. Therefore, an expansion of this knowledge regarding the suggested substitutes is absolutely necessary. Research concerning the condensation in minichannels under dynamic instabilities was already conducted for the refrigerants currently being withdrawn. However, the influence of those instabilities on a phase change in the suggested pro-ecologic substitutes is not known. It is known that during the condensation of refrigerants under dynamic instabilities, the propagation of instabilities occurs in a waveform. Two-phase media are particularly susceptible to this phenomenon. Propagation of instabilities in the form of acoustic wave or wave change in other parameters such as temperature, the density of mass, or heat flux plays a special role. All of them have their own characteristics, with evidently different propagation velocities. Both mechanisms include irreversible dissipation and dispersion. The dissipative effects, by their irreversibility, cause entropy generation and dump the instability propagation in a two-phase medium. The dispersive effects influence the instability propagation that is a function of the generation frequency. Besides the experimental results, the paper contains a dimensional analysis procedure based on the Π–Buckingham theorem that has allowed for the development of a regressive model for the velocities of pressure dynamic instabilities. The experimental part of this paper was conducted using tubular minichannels with an internal diameter of dID = 1.40–3.3 mm."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128361","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62303e8f2467f034a5d4cc82","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"da129243-8752-4c7a-9fb5-d6d5e55d4a91"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"2117","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/6/2117","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c311b49543c72336543bcc","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Chliszcz","uuid":"AA54712DEA7111ACDED03C2144691FA9069F480004C1207013D8EB852193270360395EF4311B23F18C776CF9AD00A4FED16B61D1F12587F945BA6E7C659DE73B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6532-1935","documentHash":"42a757bf-7343-493b-9196-d5faf2318c23"},{"objectId":"5e70943d878c28a0473b8ac1","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kruzel","uuid":"D091BD183AC156941A5DF5BAD6F23EE0ECFC246C19C039785FE63B56A7744338D7F2256585ADB0D98276BE4251A864375B6DAB4AD8DAA1C0658F5806E53AD52E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8349-1375","documentHash":"d452d99f-10be-4bbe-8fdf-3170cf572404"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af745","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kuczyński","uuid":"A739CD75FB304B71A76E44B630808AD197E6CB2E4F70E8AB232B842FDC4FEB5CC5C3EE76F56796981F2322EF4D96FCD9A1D164BF78238C86809A93179A340C7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7723-7650","documentHash":"0000c568-beab-4015-ab52-61d92707e36d"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15062117"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nanomaterial suspension","Sample setup","Agglomeration","Sedimentation","X-ray spectroscopy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

However, very often due to challenging synthesis procedures and the high cost of specimens it is difficult to obtain a sample in quantities for optimal measurement. Additionally, nanoparticles (NPs) aqueous suspensions are often not stable and undergo agglomeration and sedimentation processes that can be avoided either by sonication or sample stirring. Relatively small sample volumes and intrinsic agglomeration processes make X-ray spectroscopy measurements challenging especially when long periods are needed for the collection of high-quality data. To address both issues, we developed dedicated sample system that allows measurements down to few tens of μL of the liquid sample with capability of continuous stirring of the suspension. The X-ray spectroscopy measurements of ZnO nanoparticles suspension in water showed a stable signal for hours of acquisition time. On the other hand, in the absence of stirring, agglomeration and subsequent sedimentation processes were visible already within few minutes with maximum sedimentation rate of 2.5% of concentration loss in the beam field per minute."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128366","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622b05262467f040f243090f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"189","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"2e91b851-2e17-4443-9303-0f27fcccbe40"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"189","pagesFromTo":"106367","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0584854722000118","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fcee9543c723365434a5","name":" Rafał ","lastName":"Fanselow","uuid":"4D51A209DA6D43BBA6F6435B5050F3022EE662F4D05C4C8621F431712C7EFC8A1A4EA55A14C15DF50FF8E2FE97728721F34E4D8E327A6B7CE390CABAB6847024","orcidId":"0000-0002-0939-4590","documentHash":"2f505fb0-4044-4b5a-ac14-a2d51096e351"},{"objectId":"5e7094c6878c28a0473c3772","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Błachucki","uuid":"5C0FF965DD7A9BFD6AE966177BEB06D90EA5DE12ECC3766F10D17DE12F8F19392304D2B38EBBA7A5B616E257D9D3B0DFC1598E860E98FFD54B3AFA699ABA3341","orcidId":"0000-0003-4457-2345","documentHash":"8f6f28af-4f26-4bdd-8fe2-d0bb5484c07b"},{"objectId":"5e70946f878c28a0473bcf64","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wach","uuid":"6F6CC0E4004BE5A361CED54596DCCDB7179B8D01B706ABE86E2691EA636D4BA7D785037AF2D8D8F229DD3EE472E579165DBB580FE26EFFF1A5A272616D1BD179","orcidId":"0000-0003-3112-2759","documentHash":"a06ec661-c768-4556-9ef4-25282f7595b6"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397c2c","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Szlachetko","uuid":"CBFD946E3064E9CAB5B0BB644F9088EBA6EB3459C542F749E49A1FD2BD86309841B9142F0C36A9756815B6083DA6493CBA7429E06A1FA1D104F34C818976B453","orcidId":"0000-0002-7526-3097","documentHash":"7d3289a8-2522-46b8-b8df-d75984555f4f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.sab.2022.106367"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Security","organization","information strategy","Industry 4.0","ICTs"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Implications of Industry 4.0 for Security in Contemporary Organizations – Perspective of Information Strategies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1108-2976","eissn":"1108-2976","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ee72860c-86eb-4a56-a31b-70fc70a07123"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6231ffb82467f0518535daef","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a19d","5e709285878c28a0473973a9"]},"issue":"Issue 1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) contributes\nto many organizational and functional changes in modern organizations.

Activation of the ABA signaling cascade allows the induction of an appropriate physiological response. The basic components of the ABA signaling pathway have been recognized and characterized in recent years. Pyrabactin resistance, pyrabactin resistance-like, and the regulatory component of ABA receptors (PYR/PYL/RCAR) are the major components responsible for the regulation of the ABA signaling pathway. Here, we review recent findings concerning the PYR/PYL/RCAR receptor structure, function, and interaction with other components of the ABA signaling pathway as well as the termination mechanism of ABA signals in plant cells. Since ABA is one of the basic elements related to abiotic stress, which is increasingly common in the era of climate changes, understanding the perception and transduction of the signal related to this phytohormone is of paramount importance in further increasing crop tolerance to various stress factors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128369","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/8/1352","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cdfee4097070cd348c59c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Rybarczyk-Płońska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7cece9fa-8722-4b23-8b8d-91121ba31656"},{"objectId":"629cdfee4097070cd348c59b","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Graska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7087f741-d3a1-4350-8c76-5dfae25ba447"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc099","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Labudda","uuid":"4266844EC904F058199B59092E395013AFE294D9A217D10B8F21C41E285D4A806B198BF32D9B26F365F28FD772BAD3FD416023271E1154672431A12E0E96FAD6","orcidId":"0000-0001-8014-1644","documentHash":"419ca4a7-5fda-433d-9607-7371ba76b5cd"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc072","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Fidler","uuid":"C9A38ACCCF1C08DBB55A0C919C762C213EEAA4BE65EFA918757C370A63A0A986115844BDB9219D556DF9826A2A375FAC267083E04718B873C80429248E596D38","orcidId":"0000-0002-2474-1888","documentHash":"c48028df-e617-4959-aba2-394cb5201206"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9e0d","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Muszyńska-Sadłowska","uuid":"5A20A3CCE92B41CA72548CB6BD430601A812434307982F9E175D2DEC20CFA808BF001E4CBDE3CBD53B83E300623CDCBA0E3EA8B4DC8C84F89BC02A3911F81560","orcidId":"0000-0003-0419-4597","documentHash":"7b9d801d-d8a1-4026-88cc-4d9fe4aa8f12"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abf91","name":"Marta","lastName":"Gietler","uuid":"979C22B3F460E92A1FD5943B412CE4DC2983FD5A568C4608542052BA48E1C20983C8F9AD5461A7576AEA6D2D906566A107A0833AE8F9CE0BAB3E5C475D747E65","orcidId":"0000-0001-9414-9436","documentHash":"f31805b5-a58d-4576-9dd6-d477f756d5ed"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a639a","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Morkunas","uuid":"BED12881F77FE386A5A8E7B7C462C644FA8D6D6AEC435CB695B7D4EB8AD97695DFF43599C249300071E7D0A98D643C238C913A915FBEEC28ED1E336ECC1AE4FE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4186-0202","documentHash":"46c02a67-f2c3-4618-b88e-4bda679557a1"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941b2","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Nykiel","uuid":"9460AA5C7DCA16FFB8F0D501DAA6B1FCC17D7D408B6FD6834568ECFD0C122A482013DD2CFF30EA3BF19AACF9A1E075634C9354B3D3736BC9E51169CED997651C","orcidId":"0000-0003-0688-1964","documentHash":"e6a8c7ec-c0c7-4545-8524-dcecc700eea4"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a047394144","name":"Beata","lastName":"Prabucka","uuid":"CE0E916B0611BA2BC59DD09B80E9D66F75F6F16A81830EC1AB1242CE7EAB88E36622DB3144DA098D78F5D8D4F6850B47FD79E0FD545CE8BC1DED383D8E627DDA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8429-5114","documentHash":"d9b5b2f8-84ef-4b16-9ad6-80b74561aa7e"}],"doi":"10.3390/cells11081352"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Role

Open digital archive of journal articles on biomedical and biological sciences of the National Institutes of Health (USA), developed by the National Center for Biotechnological Information of the National Medical Library (USA) – PubMed, Google Academy and Academic Journals.\n\nResults. The development of thyroid diseases in SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with various mechanisms of its damage, including an excessive immune response, infection-induced immunodeficiency, or direct cell damage due to significant tissue tropism and high affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to thyroid tissue. Possible mechanisms of formation of post-vaccination dysfunction of the thyroid gland are proposed.\n\nConclusions. Thyroid hormone deficiency is associated with an increased risk of adverse events and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 and depended on the age of the patient. The severe course of Covid-19 is characterized by an increase in the prevalence of TT secondary to destructive or inflammatory thyroiditis. Thyroid-related thyrotoxicosis exacerbates the clinical course of comorbidities and long-term consequences, such as autoimmune hypothyroidism, which occurs in patients of all ages and with any severity of COVID-19.\n\nThe prevalence of TD in patients with COVID-19 varies from 13 to 64 %. 2.

This profile is nearly parallel to the western Polish coast, halfway between Poland and the Danish island of Bornholm. The data acquisition was conducted with 15 ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) and 2 land stations. We applied the trial-and-error iterative ray-tracing technique using all identified seismic phases to derive crustal models by minimizing misfit between calculated and observed P-wave travel-times for individual layers. Final velocity model was further verified by forward potential field modelling, testing various P-wave velocity (Vp) to density relationships. The Moho boundary was inferred at 33–38 km depth, deepening towards the EEC, with the local ~3 km rise in a 40-km-wide zone north of the Caledonian Deformation Front, corresponding to the elevated middle-crust velocities Vp > 6.5 km/s. The lower and middle crust are mostly continuous along the BalTec profile with only minor perturbations between the EEC and WEP. Nevertheless, the thickness of these crustal layers is poorly constrained by seismic data along the SW section of the profile. In contrast, the upper crust and sedimentary cover can be subdivided into three domains, corresponding, from the NE to SW, to the EEC, TTZ and WEP, respectively. The EEC is characterised by the flat top of the basement, uniformly inclined towards the SW. The TTZ shows rapid thinning of cratonic upper crust and thickening of sedimentary layer. The WEP reveals, despite limited seismic coverage, a 13-km thick sedimentary overburden. The lateral changes of seismic structure within the upper crust and sedimentary cover along the BalTec profile can be attributed to protracted phases of late Palaeozoic-Mesozoic extension punctuated by the Carboniferous and Late Cretaceous inversion phases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128381","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6231c9842467f05185351acb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"828","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"36c1696f-eda0-49ea-a2f2-d5f822673b14"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"828","pagesFromTo":"229271","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0040195122000658?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6231c9842467f05185351ac9","name":"Christian","lastName":"Hübscher","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23b371ca-706c-4cc2-afb9-5b222139bc5b"},{"objectId":"6231c9842467f05185351ac7","name":"Tymon","lastName":"Skrzynik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83e1d36c-a553-408c-82ed-b7ead110eae5"},{"objectId":"6231c9842467f05185351ac6","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a3b4b4f-e0d4-49ae-983c-31c783ce6fc7"},{"objectId":"6231c9842467f05185351ac5","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Ponikowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b7ee87c-4715-4fac-983b-78b925b11b65"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b875d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"EE02BD7EB3B5C00771B1C3CFAB36AE04859683CFAFE1C88F73DF3A8938A90E701BA090D8456BDE22DC1520959498EE2F3AB06BD3F63662033AD1DAA20AC11428","orcidId":"0000-0002-5915-9740","documentHash":"4f253406-a100-4d3d-803b-e6715062f991"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4806","name":"Michał","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"E022BA94789D74D23E41FED253EBD1E58BB96F3392CDEC6D0E204CD5AD5BB297E9ACB8770CC1CF4EBC30E32E3D816EE170453CA93CA7EA60A329F728C6E29B7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7190-3683","documentHash":"350c51a6-178b-45f0-ba79-d8fde881460e"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac926","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"5C9D83C0E9FBA5FF364439407DA30B417EFBFC678AACE106213987A693B2D43CB887873F1B80AE494952B52CCFC60426F6FB8B846DD3094F25F6C41C4B132A0E","orcidId":"0000-0001-5212-4169","documentHash":"66fa8a6d-462a-477d-9122-742a8701e9b3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.tecto.2022.229271"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FGF21","insulin sensitivity","appetite","blood glucose","triglycerides","NAFLD"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d5878c28a0473b194c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"FGF21: A Novel Regulator of Glucose and Lipid Metabolism and\n                    Whole-Body Energy Balance","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f41","mniswId":"7715","title":"HORMONE AND METABOLIC RESEARCH","doi":null,"issn":"0018-5043","eissn":"1439-4286","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d1779189-3c47-4cc7-89ab-7152117aada5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6295f0ce4097072fefb9b367","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6295f0ce4097072fefb9b369","5e7093d5878c28a0473b194c"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 is a recently recognized metabolic regulator that evokes interest due to its beneficial action of maintaining whole-body energy balance and protecting the liver from excessive triglyceride production and storage. Together with FGF19 and FGF23, FGF21 belongs to the FGF family with hormone-like activity. Serum FGF21 is generated primarily in the liver under nutritional stress stimuli like prolonged fasting or the lipotoxic diet, but also during increased mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress. FGF21 exerts its endocrine action in the central nervous system and adipose tissue. Acting in the ventromedial hypothalamus, FGF21 diminishes simple sugar intake. In adipose tissue, FGF21 promotes glucose utilization and increases energy expenditure by enhancing adipose tissue insulin sensitivity and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Therefore, FGF21 favors glucose consumption for heat production instead of energy storage. Furthermore, FGF21 specifically acts in the liver, where it protects hepatocytes from metabolic stress caused by lipid overload. FGF21 stimulates hepatic fatty acid oxidation and reduces lipid flux into the liver by increasing peripheral lipoprotein catabolism and reducing adipocyte lipolysis. Paradoxically, and despite its beneficial action, FGF21 is elevated in insulin resistance states, that is, fatty liver, obesity, and type 2 diabetes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128387","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6295f0ce4097072fefb9b36c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"54","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"3e28b3bb-a580-4383-854b-543a297832d3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"203-211","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/a-1778-4159.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6295f0ce4097072fefb9b369","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Szczepańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6755-4460","documentHash":"ecae4984-2216-44c3-be67-85a6f9ad013a"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b194c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gietka-Czernel","uuid":"CEC9935DDD6891A26C38C9224264D7BCA2C8036EC1BFC5121CB9D13A342552286887B2E9291CD232E5164B48C411940306B99A35214FC3115883E740EE62E056","orcidId":"0000-0001-9737-6140","documentHash":"2919c21e-6903-4925-a964-fe998ca72c86"}],"doi":"10.1055/a-1778-4159"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Validity and reliability of the Polish version of the Self-Compassion Scale and its correlates","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","doi":null,"issn":"1932-6203","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"45cf93d6-1d2d-4b95-93ed-f1e3f136e1c7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62971eb840970702be4f87c9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65f2e1084097076263daacbc","65f2e1084097076263daacbd","5e709404878c28a0473b4d81"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study adapts the Self-Compassion Scale into Polish and tests the validity, reliability and factor structure of its measures.

The aim of Study I is to analyse the factor structure of the Polish adaptation of the Self-Compassion Scale. The results of analyses using structural equation modelling and exploratory structural equation modelling confirm the six-component structure of the Self-Compassion Scale and the possibility of distinguishing a single primary factor. The results of these analyses indicate that self-compassion is conceptually distinctive from personality traits and self-judgement. In the second phase of the study (Study II), 688 respondents were assessed and the findings show that self-compassion is a predictor of depressive symptoms, trait anxiety, and satisfaction with life, and is also linked to emotional intelligence.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperform other deep learning architectures in the application of object identification and recognition when compared to other machine learning methods. Speech recognition, pattern analysis, and image identification, all benefit from deep neural networks. When performing image operations on noisy images, such as fog removal or low light enhancement, image processing methods such as filtering or image enhancement are required. The study shows the effect of using Multi-scale deep learning Context Aggregation Network CAN on Bilateral Filtering Approximation (BFA) for de-noising noisy CCTV images. Data-store is used tomanage our dataset, which is an object or collection of data that are huge to enter in memory, it allows to read, manage, and process data located in multiple files as a single entity. The CAN architecture provides integral deep learning layers such as input, convolution, back normalization, and Leaky ReLu layers to construct multi-scale. It is also possible to add custom layers like adaptor normalization (µ) and adaptive normalization (Lambda) to the network. The performance of the developed CAN approximation operator on the bilateral filtering noisy image is proven when improving both the noisy reference image and a CCTV foggy image. The three image evaluation metrics (SSIM, NIQE, and PSNR) evaluate the developed CAN approximation visually and quantitatively when comparing the created de-noised image over the reference image.Compared with the input noisy image, these evaluation metrics for the developed CAN de-noised image were (0.92673/0.76253, 6.18105/12.1865, and 26.786/20.3254) respectively"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128395","journalIssue":{"objectId":"627538654097075854f9fd16","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"9 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"6d0fbd7b-0fdd-48ef-aa38-791b135c9936"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"14-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/255789/252911","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62976ae840970702be53d610","name":"Zinah R.","lastName":"Hussein","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3678-5084","documentHash":"8e80f0ea-4c3a-4f7f-a47f-9be6f358e3c0"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.255789"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["obesity","bariatric surgery","single anastomosis sleeve ileal","single anastomosis","sleeve ileal bypass"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709444878c28a0473b9419","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae4c6","5e70932e878c28a0473a473d","5e709322878c28a0473a368b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Single anastomosis sleeve ileal bypass (SASI): a single-center initial report","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a72","mniswId":"20126","title":"Videosurgery and Other Miniinvasive Techniques","doi":null,"issn":"1895-4588","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"6ac0bd40-48d6-408a-9118-c6928accf196"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2022-03-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629878a74097075714381c4a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629878a74097075714381c4c","5e709444878c28a0473b9419","629878a74097075714381c4e","629878a74097075714381c4f","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae4c6","5e709322878c28a0473a368b","5e70932e878c28a0473a473d"]},"issue":"(2)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Single anastomosis sleeve ileal (SASI) bypass is a recently introduced bariatric procedure that combines the advantages of restrictive and malabsorptive operations, at the same time reducing the risk of nutrient deficiencies by maintaining passage through all the alimentary tract.\nAim: To present the outcomes of the first group of patients that underwent the SASI bypass in our clinic and assess the safety and efficiency of the procedure.\nMaterial and methods: We analyzed patients qualified for SASI bypass between January 2020 and February 2021. Retrospective analysis was performed and outpatient treatment results were evaluated.\nResults: A group of nineteen patients (18 women) underwent SASI bypass. The mean preoperative body mass index was 40.3 ±3.74 kg/m2, mean age: 43.3 ±7.83. The mean excess weight loss (% EWL) after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of follow-up was 43%, 56%, 72.5%, 88.83% respectively. Remission of obesity related diseases was as followed: hypertension in 8 patients (80%, p < 0.05), type II diabetes in 6 patients (100%, p < 0.05), pre-diabetes in 4 patients (50%, p = 0.13). Complications occurred in 4 cases: hematemesis, dysphagia, diarrhea, short bowel syndrome. A patient who developed symptoms of short bowel syndrome was reoperated on and gastrointestinal anastomosis was disconnected. Postoperatively, unwanted symptoms resolved and a good bariatric effect was preserved.\nConclusions: Our first experience is consistent with that reported in previous studies: very good EWL and a rapid resolution of obesity related diseases after SASI bypass as well as safety of the procedure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128402","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ff56564097075fba756593","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"c37c187b-fcd0-4293-9f3f-d9d53ef50254"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"365-371","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/doi_ft/10.5114/wiitm.2022.114943","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629878a74097075714381c4f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Kudlicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c61c683b-cbe3-4c64-b70a-506ecbd903ec"},{"objectId":"629878a74097075714381c4e","name":"Artur","lastName":"Binda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1cc5f72e-0183-48fb-9751-33ed03ac7a32"},{"objectId":"629878a74097075714381c4c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Barski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c115f62-3b6b-463c-befb-0468c7168a9c"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b9419","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":"B4778E9C37B39F22645470E77E1FFA0226C6CB1771ABCFA03509847C015D465AF844ACCA2EBE1474C4373416E2D0AEDCB87EA893C2D7FC5D64E0DC5A3D221CC9","orcidId":"0000-0001-5648-5332","documentHash":"d69dc2d4-d396-4d7c-bb37-fd8aeadb3eb5"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae4c6","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wąsowski","uuid":"FD75B9514ABC94EF202258D88156A1F11FBE29FD8762B7D0F9A72AA3DF8AFC79748B730874F0C375510CADBAFCEED517CFBBA4ABF48E1DA215FFC01553BC82C2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3707-0419","documentHash":"4c11d959-ed50-453c-aa4a-c2a41a67296e"},{"objectId":"5e70932e878c28a0473a473d","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Tarnowski","uuid":"1DB924825D480ED6A8B1BF29C5ECC3EF26C282209E608A956C885A4CE56E4E2746374B55A9437EEBBECB29B1A30472114081D3E60DB40247A01E7EC64B098ADA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2533d88a-c116-4f8d-9e34-8bf0d9af1fd5"},{"objectId":"5e709322878c28a0473a368b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jankowski","uuid":"ACCC8F734AB5123B527198C4D7996A4B373986F1777060C150EE830B4694FAA2DF997189AA96D162D686AC734266CA79A3A14A412C71A7E03A7FA0EDAA0131F3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ecaf8a0-3781-4c18-946c-8fa1036f8244"}],"doi":"10.5114/wiitm.2022.114943"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["information

necessity of digitalization of project management processes is shown, in particular, for the creation and use of the information standard of project management (ISPM). A model of using the information standard of project management to determine the planned parameters of projects has been developed. The principles and tasks of digitalization are formulated, the solution of which will allow to create such a standard. The analysis of existing theoretical and practical developments in this field is carried out. It is shown that the issue of creating an information standard of project management is still open. It is established that traditional software or databases are not suitable to meet the formulated requirements. This is due to the fact that they do not provide the necessary level of system and documentary support in the process of forming the information standard of project management. Therefore, it is proposed to use the information management system of enterprises and projects PrimaDoc to create such a standard. The concept of construction and use of the information standard of project management on the basis of the information management system PrimaDoc is offered. The structure of information technology for the formation of ISPM project-oriented company has been developed. The approach and tools for adjusting the environment of the PrimaDoc information management system to the technology of forming the ISPM of a project-oriented company are proposed.\n\nExperimental research has been conducted, which showed a 65 % reduction in labor costs in the formation of ISPM. Practical approbation of ISPM information technology formation of project-oriented company on the basis of PrimaDoc system is executed. PJSC Tutkovsky (Ukraine) created an information standard of project management, which included more than 10,000 documents. The results of experiments and practical testing indicate the effectiveness of the developed concept and information technology of formation and use of information standard of project management."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128404","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623381152467f0713d57a05b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"3 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"116578f7-1be1-4c2e-8b84-c3840f84a655"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"53-65","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253299/250767","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe949988","name":"Tatiana","lastName":"Latysheva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6349-5715","documentHash":"bd29888a-b809-4220-baaa-e24d80d47792"},{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe949987","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Khlevnyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8942-6670","documentHash":"c570c876-90cb-4bc2-a382-6083203d7651"},{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe949986","name":"Ihor","lastName":"Ohirko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1651-3612","documentHash":"5cb13cf5-cead-4b86-b84c-fde737dfae8d"},{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe949985","name":"Ihor","lastName":"Chastokolenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9323-2684","documentHash":"891e3273-f78a-4bee-a624-46f603cc1472"},{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe949984","name":"Vitalii","lastName":"Veretelnyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5684-7361","documentHash":"e3110da1-e542-408b-af59-81c14ccaf26b"},{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe949983","name":"Yevheniia","lastName":"Kataieva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9668-4739","documentHash":"e99ec29c-4b52-4b1c-84e6-a14f0ecd525c"},{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe949982","name":"Iulia","lastName":"Khlevna","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1874-1961","documentHash":"54f23b86-3301-4462-8082-2541dd2bf963"},{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe949981","name":"Oleksii","lastName":"Yehorchenkov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1390-5311","documentHash":"244d398a-bd83-4ba1-a7a6-410810eaac27"},{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe949980","name":"Nataliia","lastName":"Yehorchenkova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5970-0958","documentHash":"5ea4cc3c-6929-4f88-be96-5e5b3eaaa9ec"},{"objectId":"623452d02467f00ffe94997f","name":"Iurii","lastName":"Teslia","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5185-6947","documentHash":"45acd5ac-6aee-4ae6-9b1f-6cadcb29c6c4"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253299"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ascomycota","Basidiomycota","fungal biota","ecological disturbance","windfall"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Contribution to the Knowledge of Fungi of the Kampinos National Park (Central Poland): Part 5 – With Particular Emphasis on the Species Occurring on Windthrown Trees","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b79","mniswId":"20648","title":"Acta Mycologica","doi":null,"issn":"0001-625X","eissn":"2353-074X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"2f399894-21e3-4250-9304-03a58230bed5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cd49d4097070cd3482930","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f3878c28a04738da13","629cd49d4097070cd3482933","629cd49d4097070cd3482934","629cd49d4097070cd3482935"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents eleven species of fungi new to the Kampinos National Park.

products (eternit) were a commonly used roofing material for residential and farm buildings. Due to the harmfulness of this product, in 1997 its production and use was banned in Poland. In 2002 the Polish government adopted a program aimed at the complete removal of these materials from buildings by 2032. Despite the possibility of obtaining funding for the removal of asbestos, the process is slow. Inhabitants of small communes often dismantle asbestos products in an inappropriate way on their own, which has a negative impact on the environment and poses a threat to human health. The article presents the results of the CAWI (Computer Assisted Web Interview) survey, identifying the methods of developing asbestos roofing over the last twenty-four years in five selected towns of the Kłobuck poviat. An „in situ” visual assessment of the identification of products in these localities was performed and indicators showing changes in the manner of their management were estimated. Moreover, the respondents also specified the future intention to neutralize the asbestos panels still on the buildings. It was found that in the analysed period, there was an increase in disassembly works carried out by companies specialised in the disposal of asbestos cement to the level of 72%, with a simultaneous decrease in the share of negative practices by 65%. Unfortunately, over 55% of farm buildings in the analysed area are still covered with eternit. Low environmental awareness and high costs of changing the roof covering make it impossible to solve this problem quickly."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128417","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"65-72","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.scientific.net/CTA.2.65","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709443878c28a0473b92a8","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Brycht","uuid":"8A1ACBCDEDC9CBAA0B95922289C1E6386F539A7A9E48D134F36848E8E537E3005A7E3550703F49C5B32FC69A11862189FA08091FE584E77A595A467035E4E3EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-7492","documentHash":"5489e5f0-9fd0-4cd5-9979-97522f3fa3f2"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e843","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Ulewicz","uuid":"04CDF34A3632A0BBCBD199EA64FEFBE6492C363735BA23AB83C83B35EA92FD0B0E80F2B834863D74F5B35A1BA27B05A2AACFBEDD1F9CAD7BCBC1B54F24A10B85","orcidId":"0000-0001-8766-8393","documentHash":"14021c63-ffff-4d06-afd3-e1f39a45fcdd"}],"doi":"10.4028/p-hz8h6t"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Does Income Inequality Explain Public Debt Change in OECD Countries?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478324","mniswId":"9530","title":"International Review of Economics and Finance","doi":null,"issn":"1059-0560","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a9139072-8d4e-4bc8-a8ec-8dee51fb5e83"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623447c22467f01c2119d094","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d4878c28a04739d9cb","5e709207878c28a04738ece3","623447c22467f01c2119d097"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058128419","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623447c22467f01c2119d097","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Tomkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"580fab5a-29b3-407a-9662-f0a8cf850714"},{"objectId":"5e7092d4878c28a04739d9cb","name":"Jakub","lastName":"BARTAK","uuid":"92B6C024A1148E69DDCC57AB7E1F696118CBB157592939FB7A23D7097F3151085C42BA016B1712D7F88D62F6D7438B8DCCC99DAF78814A7D1B14121FE8381CAF","orcidId":"0000-0001-7997-2432","documentHash":"524842a9-a33d-434a-9af9-35399f4df43a"},{"objectId":"5e709207878c28a04738ece3","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"JABŁOŃSKI","uuid":"662F128448904C091D7C13FEA4DBAB1E281D085B97881564B1315C6499EA8F3B51C419F59B127652B4670B2914D09A34DE04AB67C5B3D8F8620025F5C64D14AF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6922-0501","documentHash":"c2533d37-c6b4-4971-ad64-734c1ac13c79"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.iref.2022.02.045"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["machine learning","polynomial regression method","enhanced oil recovery","lasso regularization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"6162ce742467f002615e03b1","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"al-Farabi Kazakh National University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629649ce4097072fefbdf9d0","629649ce4097072fefbdf9cf","629649ce4097072fefbdf9d2","629649ce4097072fefbdf9d1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Implementation of regression algorithms for oil recovery prediction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629649ce4097072fefbdf9cd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629649ce4097072fefbdf9cf","629649ce4097072fefbdf9d0","629649ce4097072fefbdf9d1","629649ce4097072fefbdf9d2"]},"issue":"2 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the work of predicting oil production using machine learning methods. As a machine learning method, a multiple linear regression algorithm with polynomial properties was implemented. Regression algorithms are suitable and workable methods for predicting oil production based on a data-driven approach. The synthetic dataset was obtained using the Buckley-Leverett mathematical model, which is used to calculate hydrodynamics and determine the saturation distribution in oil production problems. Various combinations of parameters of the oil production problem were chosen, where porosity, viscosity of the oil phase and absolute permeability of the rock were taken as input parameters for machine learning. And the value of the oil recovery factor was chosen as the output parameter. More than 400 thousand synthetic data were used to test multiple regression algorithms. To estimate the quality of regression algorithms, the mean square error metrics and the coefficient of determination were used. It was found that linear regression does not cover all patterns in the data due to underfitting. Various degrees of polynomial regression were deployed and tested, and it was also found that for our synthetic data, the quadratic polynomial model trains quite well and perfectly predicts the value of the oil recovery factor. To solve the overfitting problem, L1 regularization known as the Lasso regression method was applied. For the quadratic polynomial regression model, the coefficient of determination was 0.96, which is a pretty good result for the test data. Thus, it is assumed that the data-driven machine learning methods discussed in the paper can be useful for predicting the oil recovery factor using practical data from oil fields at the stages of production"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128420","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629632974097072fefbd1feb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"2 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"66306056-c4e9-4369-b4b9-5795a1b0b49e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"69-75","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253886/252963","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629649ce4097072fefbdf9d2","name":"Beimbet","lastName":"Daribayev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1313-9004","documentHash":"031aad51-751f-4deb-9306-f0fd44f4d052"},{"objectId":"629649ce4097072fefbdf9d1","name":"Darkhan","lastName":"Akhmed-Zaki","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8100-8263","documentHash":"70e9bf13-a553-42fe-9bb7-5ae6833442ef"},{"objectId":"629649ce4097072fefbdf9d0","name":"Timur","lastName":"Imankulov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8865-3676","documentHash":"a2d531cd-eaaa-451a-bd97-d6a03ff1f7d6"},{"objectId":"629649ce4097072fefbdf9cf","name":"Yerzhan","lastName":"Kenzhebek","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6492-8292","documentHash":"d32293fd-df5d-43dd-bbd2-a8c794ee9e77"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253886"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["transport network","optimization","dummy node","difference","coefficient","simplex","decision-making"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"616529bd2467f021e68f84b6","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Pryazovskyi State Technical University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62964d044097072fefbe1050","62964d034097072fefbe104f"]},{"id":"612204f92467f07442bd0b67","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Transport University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62964d034097072fefbe104d","62964d034097072fefbe104e","62964d034097072fefbe104b","62964d034097072fefbe104c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Optimizing unbalanced freight deliveries in transportation networks","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62964d034097072fefbe1048","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62964d034097072fefbe104b","62964d034097072fefbe104c","62964d034097072fefbe104d","62964d034097072fefbe104e","62964d034097072fefbe104f","62964d044097072fefbe1050"]},"issue":"3 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper reports a comparative analysis of the known methods for reducing open transportation problems to a balanced form in order to further optimize freight traffic based on them. A series of significant shortcomings have been revealed that largely narrow the scope of their application. A new method has been proposed, termed the method of proportional redistribution of cargo transportation volumes among participants in the transportation process, devoid of the identified shortcomings.\n\nThe transportation problem is a special case of the general linear programming problem, to which one of the methods for solving it, namely the simplex one, can be applied. A procedure to construct a simplex table based on the data from the transport table has been described, as well as the algorithm of subsequent simplex transformations.\n\nA transportation problem is often stated in the form of a map of the location of transport hubs of cargo dispatch and destination. A matrix-network model has been proposed, which makes it possible to reduce the network representation to a matrix form with the subsequent finding of the optimal plan for cargo transportation.\n\nIn order to identify the priority of methods for reducing open transportation problems to a balanced form, 100 transportation problems that are unbalanced in terms of the volume of cargo transportation were solved. That was done with the help of a designed decision support system for the management of freight transport. As a criterion, the best freight transportation plan was chosen.\n\nAs a result, the simplex method proved the best in 48 cases, the coefficient method ‒ in 27, the dummy node method ‒ in 16, and the difference method ‒ in 9 cases.

In this regard, in order to use gondola cars for the transportation of cargoes with high temperatures, it is possible to arrange them in heat-resistant containers of open type – flatcars. Therefore, in this study, a structure of the flatcar with convex walls has been proposed. Such configuration of the sidewalls makes it possible to increase the usable volume of the container by 8 % compared to the prototype. As a flatcar material, a composite with heat-resistant properties is used. To justify the proposed solution, the strength of a flatcar was calculated. It has been established that the maximum equivalent stresses in the carrying structure of the flatcar are about 300 MPa and do not exceed permissible ones.\n\nTo determine the main indicators of the dynamics of the gondola car loaded with flats, its dynamic load was mathematically modeled. The calculation results showed that the accelerations that operate in the center of the mass of the load-bearing structure of a gondola car are about 1.5 m/s2. The vertical dynamics coefficient is 0.22. The estimated dynamics indicators are within the permissible values.\n\nThe study reported here could contribute to improving the efficiency of the use of gondola cars and to further advancements in the design of innovative vehicles"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128427","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62973b4740970702be51694e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"7 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"86c274e0-ae46-4b8d-bb73-12547b3a99dd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"6-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253770/252847","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62973cc340970702be5188fa","name":"Sergiy","lastName":"Sova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3380-7604","documentHash":"e1cb967f-e6a5-4acc-8972-0cc444e44597"},{"objectId":"62973cc340970702be5188f9","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Lytvynenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5182-9607","documentHash":"6e65e1f8-ec85-4995-be4b-296bc9bf8178"},{"objectId":"62973cc340970702be5188f8","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Nikolaienko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2933-0498","documentHash":"3a325b19-8ded-4329-8061-5e9372dbfded"},{"objectId":"62973cc340970702be5188f7","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Khara","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6818-7938","documentHash":"884527a0-edf7-4681-8a68-c46c96f252dd"},{"objectId":"62973cc340970702be5188f6","name":"Alyona","lastName":"Lovska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8604-1764","documentHash":"f2717b1c-d1d3-49b9-b989-c5bb3aa326a4"},{"objectId":"62973cc340970702be5188f5","name":"Oleksij","lastName":"Fomin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2387-9946","documentHash":"fe6bf317-f1f9-4ee1-ad7c-518de07b7b22"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253770"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gamma-decalactone","separation","solvent extraction","hydrodistillation","adsorption","Amberlite XAD-4"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Attempt to Develop an Effective Method for the Separation of Gamma-Decalactone from Biotransformation Medium","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cfa3a4097070cd34d61fb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a047392222","629cfa3a4097070cd34d61fd","629cfa3a4097070cd34d61fe","629cfa3a4097070cd34d61ff","629cfa3a4097070cd34d6200"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Gamma-decalactone (GDL) is a fragrance compound obtained in the process of β-oxidation of ricinoleic acid, which is derived from the hydrolysis of castor oil. The biotechnological method of the synthesis of this lactone has been improved for over two decades, but the vast majority of research results have been based only on determining the concentration of the lactone by chromatographic methods without separating it from the biotransformation medium. In this study, we attempted to separate GDL from the medium in which the lactone was synthesized by Yarrowia lipolytica from castor oil. The effectiveness of liquid–liquid extraction, hydrodistillation, and adsorption on the porous materials (zeolite, vermiculite and resin Amberlite XAD-4) was compared. The influence of the solvent on the efficiency of GDL extraction, the influence of the acidity of the medium on the amount of GDL in the distillate, and the level of lactone adsorption on the above-mentioned adsorbents were compared by calculating the initial adsorption rate. The adsorption isotherm was determined for the most effective adsorbent. Among the five solvents tested, the most effective was diethyl ether, used at the ratio of 1:1. The extraction was characterized by higher efficiency than hydrodistillation; the difference in GDL determinations by these two methods ranged from 12.8 to 22%. The purity of the distillates was much higher than that of the extracts at 88.0 ± 3.4% compared to 53.0 ± 1.8%. The acidification of the biotransformation medium increased the concentration of the lactone in both the reaction mixture and the distillate. GDL was most efficiently adsorbed on Amberlite XAD-4 resin, for which the lactone isotherm adsorption was linear. The amount of lactone adsorbed on Amberlite XAD-4 within 1 h was approx. 80% (2.45 g), of which 1.96 g was then desorbed with ethanol. In the context of industrial applications, adsorption of GDL on Amberlite XAD-4 seems to be the most appropriate method due to material costs, the ease of the process, and low environmental burden."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128429","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/4/2084","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cfa3a4097070cd34d6200","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wirkowska-Wojdyła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e677e013-6869-40cd-a544-9f2e588b9863"},{"objectId":"629cfa3a4097070cd34d61ff","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Bryś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bee4a0b5-c987-4887-9f09-4afc20d08eae"},{"objectId":"629cfa3a4097070cd34d61fe","name":"Agata","lastName":"Górska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcede992-1bde-46c8-a561-5d1c8ae1f48a"},{"objectId":"629cfa3a4097070cd34d61fd","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Małajowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e72a0266-0a23-4a73-b5b5-b0400bbcc1ae"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392222","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ostrowska-Ligęza","uuid":"5A3FF75CD93D0A8E531C9B92941DE1C6D223FDE980C5E4BCCF6B32FF8B322B7661E950E14BCB67C4F5BB7D27C38D0CF2A9B1B6FF47C88552FFE6566786B39D32","orcidId":"0000-0002-8387-8462","documentHash":"7c7785b2-b43f-4e13-8b1b-5f16417a4905"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12042084"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["warp threads","thread deformation","tension","elastic feed system","loom"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61e6d8f92467f030e8c394aa","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Azerbaijan State Economic University (UNEC)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623372fd2467f0713d57703d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Experimental method for determining the deformation of warp threads on looms","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623372fc2467f0713d57703b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623372fd2467f0713d57703d"]},"issue":"1 (115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"There is a large body of theoretical and experimental research aimed at determining the warp thread deformation and tension. Analytical solutions and mathematical models of the stressed state of the warp and weft threads in the formation of fabric were proposed. In almost all studies, the deformation of the warp thread was determined separately when shedding and beating the weft. There is an experimental method for determining the deformation of warp threads, which makes it possible to eliminate some of the shortcomings inherent in the theoretical techniques. However, that method has some drawbacks, such as the low accuracy of strain measurement and the complexity of certain measuring operations, which leads to an increase in the time spent on the experiment.\n\nThis paper reports a study that addresses those shortcomings by proposing to photograph the object being measured using a digital camera connected to a computer system to print the image. An electronic caliper that is used to measure the deformation of warp threads on printing paper takes into consideration a fraction of a millimeter when measuring.\n\nThe proposed method makes it possible to determine with sufficient accuracy and speed the deformation of warp threads in the elastic feed system of the loom, as well as allows visual control over the changes in the deformation of warp threads in the machine. The use of this method makes it possible to reduce the time of measuring the deformation of one thread from 30‒40 seconds to 5‒7 seconds, which is 5‒6 times less than that in the existing one and provides measurement accuracy to at least one dozen mm.\n\nThe results of this work could be applied to determine the warp thread deformation and tension on looms when making the main weave fabrics in order to reduce the uneven tension of the main threads, increase labor productivity, and improve the quality of the fabric."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128431","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623355402467f0713d5675a0","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"1 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"c338b7d6-75f4-4465-9dc8-c82700e22216"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"76-85","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252612/250642","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623372fd2467f0713d57703d","name":"Nigar","lastName":"Makhmudova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7839-911X","documentHash":"d0ba3f40-a34f-49ec-981a-071826fe3574"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252612"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Sortowniki wibracyjne wiszące"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f981","uid":"bViMh15nK6yQ3GeLX0jZfDA","uuid":"edec705e-e9ab-4145-9f15-6285e406250f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Centrum Papiernictwa i Poligrafii Politechniki Łódzkiej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a047395394"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sortowniki wibracyjne wiszące.

The aim of our study was to determine the effect of alcohol abuse and / or HIV infection on the morpho-functional state of the fallopian tubes in women of reproductive age.\n\nMaterial and methods. The study included sectional material, which was selected from 100 women of reproductive age (20 to 40 years), who were divided into four groups. The first group included section material from 25 women who had been laboratory confirmed for HIV. The second group included sectional material selected from 25 women suffering from chronic alcoholism.

The fourth group includes sectional material selected from HIV-negative women.\n\nResults. Gross pathological changes in the structure of the fallopian tube, due to both the impact of HIV infection and alcohol abuse was identified in each of the groups. Changes in morphometric parameters (length of the ampullary part, outer diameter of the tube at the junction of the isthmus in the ampullary part, the area of the lumen of the ampullary part) can cause severe complications of inflammation or lead to ectopic pregnancy. The study of the epithelial and muscular layer revealed destructive-sclerotic changes, which consist in reducing the height of the epithelium and increasing the proportion of connective tissue in the muscular layer of the tube.\n\nConclusions. According to the study, HIV and alcohol abuse are diseases that affect all elements of the fallopian tube.

The production of various types of products requires a certain purity and quality of fatty acids. To obtain these compounds, it is promising to use soapstocks, which are waste products of alkaline refining of oils.\n\nThe peculiarity of the work lies in determining the effect of the process parameters of soapstock decomposition with sulfuric acid on the saponification number, which is an important production characteristic of fatty acids.\n\nThe study used sunflower soapstock according to DSTU 5033 (CAS 68952-95-4) with a mass fraction of total fat of 69.5 %, fatty acids – 64.5 %. The soapstock was treated with a sulfuric acid solution at a temperature of 90 °C, the process duration was 40 min. Rational parameters of soapstock treatment were determined: concentration of sulfuric acid in the reaction mass is 80 %, concentration of an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid – 50 %. In the experiment interval, the settling duration of the reaction mass does not affect the saponification number of fatty acids. The settling time of 1 hour is effective for the isolation of fatty acids. Under these conditions, the saponification number of fatty acids was 186.4 mg KOH/g. The acids correspond to fatty acids of the first grade according to DSTU 4860 (CAS 61788-66-7): mass fraction of moisture and volatile substances – 1.2 %, mass fraction of total fat – 97.5 %, cleavage depth – 95.0 % oleic acid.\n\nThe obtained data allow rational and most efficient use of the reagent – sulfuric acid. The results of the work make it possible to reduce the duration of fatty acids obtaining from soapstocks, since the efficiency of the process with the minimum duration of mass settling has been confirmed. The improved technology of soapstock decomposition makes it possible to obtain a valuable product – high-quality fatty acids under rational conditions"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128444","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62972ed940970702be507c89","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"6 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"e5ac0b6a-49b6-4ad8-8fd8-7ddf6d1984e0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"6-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254358/252932","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afc5","name":"Olesya","lastName":"Filenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0277-6633","documentHash":"6f31ab8b-4110-4986-b393-68831931c9e9"},{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afc4","name":"Evgeny","lastName":"Semenov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9280-947X","documentHash":"2c837ce4-28fd-4d93-9e74-ba19fd0cdb0c"},{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afc3","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Ogurtsov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4870-5654","documentHash":"ad5e0727-a8c1-4ff4-a91e-b628eeca3484"},{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afc2","name":"Oleksii","lastName":"Romanov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8144-4911","documentHash":"9cfb7524-fd1f-44e9-85e8-40195e516373"},{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afc1","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Bragin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8104-4088","documentHash":"d1e56075-c94c-4bb2-8c3d-ed7492000b66"},{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afc0","name":"Oleg","lastName":"Bogatov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7342-7556","documentHash":"34ade0c6-1fb2-46a0-953f-0558b78e1a02"},{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afbf","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Hrechko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1254-8367","documentHash":"9d4b9c71-839d-41e6-9477-cf6ef2a58c3a"},{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afbe","name":"Liliia","lastName":"Myronenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7345-6450","documentHash":"54bccfe2-36bd-4db1-86f5-ce41ab256c42"},{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afbd","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Stankevych","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8300-2591","documentHash":"7595c4ee-f76f-4cc6-8132-7c1046d02240"},{"objectId":"6297320840970702be50afbc","name":"Viktoriia","lastName":"Kalyna","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3061-3313","documentHash":"0c9c25ec-4c41-4f9a-af1d-f41fe5c0d25f"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254358"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparison and Assessment of Selected Parameters of Chrome-Free and Chrome-Tanned Leather","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5f878c28514547e47b","mniswId":"24705","title":"Leather and Footwear Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1583-4433","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d36cd10f-c358-4040-b368-ba9a1ba77e7b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62986dbd4097070cd3d501e5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a8878c28a0473ae8a9","5e709207878c28a04738ece1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058128446","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.revistapielarieincaltaminte.ro/revistapielarieincaltaminteresurse/en/fisiere/full/vol22-nr1/article1_vol22_issue1.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a8878c28a0473ae8a9","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Bielak","uuid":"7FAF1264CCBE827365495C9BA8CA5905F537BEFA86E13FD84D8F2F45169CDF39C6EFD1B5DA8DC559BD3E49CF087463B743F99018C826313CE5A4CF5407449279","orcidId":"0000-0003-0904-3659","documentHash":"f084792c-93be-400a-8861-d6098649054b"},{"objectId":"5e709207878c28a04738ece1","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":"4D058DF00B95A8185FB211CF47B9A65DFCE5060BD9CD3DEFB07695424AD241CC20AFD281015C5A3CA755DA318FB412AF7373C6F483371953354A9A55A4557E98","orcidId":"0000-0003-1871-7918","documentHash":"40f74a17-d81c-436f-a7e8-550411f843b9"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Diversity of Demographic Potential and Socioeconomic Development of Urban Functional Areas -

The robot is related to the combined type robots.\n\nThe robot consists of two functional parts: a universal mobile platform (lower part) and a disinfector (upper part), which, if necessary, can be freely moved by personnel on 4 wheels. In the initial position, the upper part of the disinfection robot is at the charging station. The mobile robot drives up to the disinfector, «hooks» it (puts it on itself) and moves along the planned route. The upper part of the disinfector will have its own independent intelligent system, separate from the mobile robot, which, when a person is recognized, stops liquid disinfection: in this case, the UV lamps turn through 180°, the cylindrical body closes and ventilation of the disinfected air from the enclosed space is turned on. In addition, liquid disinfection is only enabled when detecting beds, tables and chairs.\n\nWith the spray nozzles located at a height of 400 mm, the disinfector can carry out a simultaneous combined treatment of rooms with equipment and furniture, including high-quality processing of the lower surfaces of tables, chairs and beds.\n\nTo improve the functional characteristics of robotic disinfectors and to simplify their design, a multifunctional robotic disinfector has been proposed.\n\nIt was found that the result is achieved by the fact that in a multifunctional disinfection robot containing a mobile cart with an autonomous positioning and navigation system, a disinfection platform with a disinfection liquid spraying system and UV lamps with reflectors installed on it, the disinfection platform will have its own autonomous control and power systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128453","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623355402467f0713d5675a0","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"1

In the research, the influence of heat sinks and the method of controlling the operation of the module on the cooling efficiency was assessed. The research was aimed at selecting the operating mode of the controller and choosing the arrangement of modules comparing cooling efficiency. The research showed that by selection of appropriate controlling mode, the electric power used can be reduced while keeping the cooling efficiency at the same level.

These issues have encouraged the search for replacements and substitutes for existing construction materials. Blast Furnace Slag is used in the construction industry as a mineral amendment or aggregate. Their use in Earth Construction, due to their post-industrial origin, may be associated with increased levels of potentially toxic elements (PTE) in the soil. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the immobilization potential of Blast Furnace Slag and to compare it with the addition of Blast Furnace Slag with Activated Carbon using different concentrations of these amendments. We were able to determine the concentrations of selected PTE (zinc, copper, nickel, cadmium and lead) in the soil, roots and aerial parts of Lolium perenne L., using different concentrations of Blast Furnace Slag (3%, 5% and 10%), and Blast Furnace Slag with Activated Carbon (3% and 5%) as soil amendments. Measurements were carried out with Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS). Both the addition of Blast Furnace Slag and Activated Carbon with Slag increased plant biomass. The addition of slag effectively reduced the zinc, copper, cadmium and lead content of the soil, while the addition of Activated Carbon slag significantly increased the content of selected PETs in the roots and aerial parts of plants. It was considered reasonable to use Blast Furnace Slag with the addition of Activated Carbon in supporting the processes of the assisted phytostabilization of PTE polluted soils."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128476","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/minerals/minerals-12-00478/article_deploy/minerals-12-00478.pdf?version=1649917104","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f2878c28a0473c79be","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Dzięcioł","uuid":"DAD5DCAA5DDDBE3DB178C48F70EB68ABAE473BAC00757119A3020B493C12ED7B25DF26A6872BD2F1790C653C69A2768410D09693AAF1CA40FC2583B71229BCDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-2436-9748","documentHash":"f8716cda-6b6d-4108-a7a7-8935f3de2fb9"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a53fe","name":"Maja","lastName":"Radziemska","uuid":"F16909B2F0C594C5EA5AB2C145BE90CFEEA14A48CA90D9D4824051912FC2B3FC4FC9E7D2A3266C8A1BD64306A603FDBCAFD3EA7B0AD12A270B5018F1BD77B2DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3526-5944","documentHash":"c1e899af-a37d-4ddc-8151-8234dcce63ce"}],"doi":"10.3390/min12040478"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1a","uid":"bo-gzHUCaPNoq216Hhf4uRQ","uuid":"04d8f337-6a41-4c73-b0ee-a3f1a9293995","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Informatyki i Mechaniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935e878c28a0473a83ea"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Identifying limits of ideals of points in the case of projective space","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cf9","mniswId":"13654","title":"Linear Algebra and its Applications","doi":null,"issn":"0024-3795","eissn":"1873-1856","websiteLink":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00243795","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"fe8f26d1-a023-43f4-83e0-15b82473aa11"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622e71262467f07b5ea712c1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70935e878c28a0473a83ea"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We study the closure of the locus of radical ideals in the multigraded Hilbert scheme associated with a standard graded polynomial ring and the Hilbert function of a homogeneous coordinate ring of points in general position in projective space.

The Michael-type addition reaction resulted to be chemo- and stereoselective, affording a series of novel steroidal selenides and sulfides. This is an example of a one-step, eco-friendly process that bypasses some of the main concerns connected with the bad smell and the toxicity of these seleno- and thio-reagents. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the proposed methodology offers the possibility to prepare libraries of steroids variously and selectively decorated with different organochalcogen moieties at the C1 position starting from 1,4-androstadienic skeletons and leaving unaltered the C4–C5 unsaturation. Based on the data reported in the literature the introduction of an organoselenium or an organosulfur moiety in a steroid could provide new interesting pharmaceutically active entities exerting anticancer and antimicrobial activities. In this optic, new synthetic strategies to efficiently prepare this class of compounds could be strongly desirable."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128479","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622f0fc62467f016697bcf7b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"92660f42-ba1e-4168-a349-a9efb793f49a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"3022","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/6/3022/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622f0fc62467f016697bcf79","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Santi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7698-8970","documentHash":"9e775fcd-a652-4aa4-ab56-c1c2c55d8515"},{"objectId":"622f0fc52467f016697bcf72","name":"Luca","lastName":"Sancineto","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6199-7399","documentHash":"08486931-e5fe-4a5c-8b04-04bb99dcda96"},{"objectId":"622f0fc52467f016697bcf71","name":"Luana","lastName":"Bagnoli","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0622-4561","documentHash":"b914eb39-b4b0-4afb-8631-f15477f9a62b"},{"objectId":"622f0fc52467f016697bcf70","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Wawrusiewicz-Kurylonek","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1087-8154","documentHash":"eedef20e-63a4-488b-a869-08f671fe6797"},{"objectId":"622f0fc52467f016697bcf6f","name":"Bonifacio","lastName":"Monti","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8490-7720","documentHash":"50c24496-005a-414f-a450-0d40c2b6d5b8"},{"objectId":"622f0fc52467f016697bcf6e","name":"Paweł A.","lastName":"Grześ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f79c3afa-413a-455f-ad76-2622158801d3"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a0473949c1","name":"Izabella","lastName":"Jastrzębska","uuid":"E2294561D56EBD967DB721C7B8ADFDBE6685620EB1E273B37ECC9D33EC513AEE911375399768787CEF3D436018B90B7BE7CB3EBBDB68F293A653663C56134864","orcidId":"0000-0003-3268-3515","documentHash":"2739aafc-6755-4b8f-90ac-198a26d3b67d"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23063022"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy management","knowledge about energy management","trust"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Trust in Renewable Energy as Part of Energy-Saving Knowledge","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622b07042467f040f24310a9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943c878c28a0473b897a","5e709203878c28a04738e8d4","622b07042467f040f24310ac","622b07042467f040f24310ad"]},"issue":"Iss.4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Managing the consumer’s knowledge is a factor that is difficult to measure and not easy to achieve, but it is the basis for building trust in energy sources, including alternative ones. Social and ecological attitudes, as well as the economic situation, force consumers to acquire knowledge and shape their views and knowledge about household energy management. The aim of this article was to analyze the level of knowledge of household managers and determine the level of trust in alternative energy sources. To achieve this goal, previous research and reports were analyzed, and a proprietary quantitative and qualitative research was carried out. In connection with the conducted research, it was found that a very important factor is trust, influencing the perception of energy sources, and the knowledge gained allows for proper management of household energy, thus reducing costs. Research has shown that the trust of people managing energy in households is influenced by trust in renewable energy sources, which consists of knowledge, i.e., the level of social awareness and the willingness to acquire and expand one’s knowledge in this field. In all of the countries surveyed, the degree of trust is adequate, but it is directly proportional to the amount of knowledge and readiness to learn new things in this

water separated from digested sludge may be a potential source of nutrients due to its high content. However, most often, reject water after sludge dewatering is directed to sewage lines at wastewater treatment plants, negatively affecting their operation, especially in the biological part. The activities related to sludge conditioning before dewatering have a direct impact on the quality of the reject water. The reject water of raw digested sludge is characterized by very high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen, at 1718 mgN-NH4+/dm3; phosphates, at 122.4 mgPO43−/dm3; and chemical oxygen demand (COD), at 2240 mgO2/dm3. The objective of the research was to determine the impact of selected sludge conditioning methods on the quality of reject water obtained after sludge dewatering. The following parameters were analyzed in the reject water: the chemical oxygen demand (COD), phosphates, ammonium nitrogen, and total suspended solids (TSS). It has been observed that the sludge sonification process increases the content of impurities (COD, phosphates) in reject water with an increase in the amplitude of the ultrasonic field. On the other hand, the chemical reagents cause a decrease in the concentration of the pollutants with an increase of the chemical dose.

The sedimentological study, including sand-grain morphology and micromorphology analyses, reveals the presence at Krosinko of a meandering river and of a braided river during the Eemian (MIS 5e) and Upper Pleniweichselian (MIS 2), respectively. The fluvial regime changed over time, from low-energy, through high-energy, to low-energy, as documented by the differently formed sedimentary units A–D (vertical sedimentary succession from base to top: sandy silt, sand, gravelly sand, and sand). Sedimentary unit A and the lower part of unit B were accumulated in the Eemian interglacial (MIS 5e) by the low-energy meandering river. The high-energy fluvial environment during the Weichselian is associated with long, intense sediment transport, organic remains, and flints, as confirmed by taphonomic studies on conifer cones (Picea cf. abies) and wood remains (Juniperus). The river operated under distinct environmental conditions.

Using deep Learning networks, this group of wastes may be automatically classified on the belts of a waste sorting plant. However, a basic set of connected layers may not be adequate to give satisfactory accuracy for such multi output classifier tasks. To optimize the gradient flow and enable deeper training for network design with multi label classifier, this study suggests a residual-based deep learning convolutional neural network. For network training, ten classes have been explored. The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a structure with hidden layers that have inputs, outputs, and other layers. The DAG network's residual-based architecture features shortcut connections that bypass some levels of the network, allowing gradients of network parameters to travel freely among the network output layers for deeper training. The methodology includes:\n\n1) preparing the data and creating an augmented image data store;\n\n2) defining the main serially-connected branches of the network architecture;\n\n3) defining the residual interconnections that bypass the main branch layers;\n\n4) defining layers, and finally;\n\n5) creating a residual-based deeper layer graph.\n\nThe concept is to split down the multiclass classification problem into minor binary states, where every classifier performs as an expert by concentrating on discriminating between only two labels, improving total accuracy. The results achieve (2.861 %) training error and (9.76 %) a validation error. The training results of this classifier are evaluated by finding the training error, validation error, and showing the confusion matrix of validation data"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128499","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62978fc640970702be54f7b9","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"10 (113)","doi":"","documentHash":"1061206a-c124-4553-a9d2-6891be9fc48a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"42-49","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254285/252952","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6297928640970702be551276","name":"Ahmad H.","lastName":"Sabry","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2736-5582","documentHash":"7796c9ed-7064-45fa-96b1-07d6ca40d777"},{"objectId":"6297928640970702be551275","name":"Moumena Salah","lastName":"Yassen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6270ca3b-9077-4674-91bb-c108989981e7"},{"objectId":"6297928640970702be551274","name":"Ahmad Abdullah Mohammed","lastName":"Al-Mafrji","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c054773b-46e5-4e09-b38a-1a2ea2b0330b"},{"objectId":"6297928640970702be551273","name":"Ahmed Burhan","lastName":"Mohammed","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4326-0120","documentHash":"6ee3320e-4908-444d-a5eb-9c99b604e1ea"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254285"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["positron annihilation","metals","high-speed cutting","white layer","microstructure","defects"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

The presented analysis follows a pragmatic approach. The example of good CSR practices of FDI companies (and in-kind contribution during the COVID-19 Pandemic Period) in Poland shows a clear division of activities into necessary charity activities (forced by a difficult situation) and a multitude of intangible or low-budget activities supporting / conditioning the company's business activities, even if they are directly aimed at protecting employees or customers. Most of the aid (2/3) provided directly to prevent shortages of equipment and supplies for medical institutions, school students, the elderly or counteracting other effects of the epidemic was directed from companies with foreign capital, although not from those from the list of the richest 20. There are only one activity to support human entrepreneurship, which could also be beneficial in the post-pandemic period and was initiated by young companies with foreign capital (start-ups). Basically, in the organizational behavior of companies, the postpandemic perspective is invisible, except when considering remote work. Some of the CSR practices were limited to façade activities only. Especially those related to the human environment, including environmental protection (eg zero plastic), education, recruitment and good neighborhood. Employee volunteering became even more popular during the epidemic, but most often it was done remotely."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128504","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"149-171","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360725957_CORPORATE_SOCIAL_RESPONSIBILITY_CSR_AND_SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT_GOALS_SDG_RESPONSE_OF_FOREIGN_INVESTORS_IN_POLAND_IN_A_COVID-19_PANDEMIC_TIME","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebeac057523401910f0fcf7","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Kamran","uuid":"51840F0827EA5D292B7E47EADD305560B29F7165B37CA6024CE6987B9DF83AECCEBDA961341F3C7BE0EC991FD6B94FB16138F3D8D42D99686419E04E26DE9E6C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5154-0504","documentHash":"8a3d90d6-713c-41d9-bd96-e84ea0407f1a"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a791f","name":"Izabella","lastName":"Łęcka","uuid":"982E0D73950A0DB45ED2017FB25CF155663DBC0D5724BEDFAF3CB5986E52E50B2D0116C354558AF23A33D72E43CEB58893205EA3CF31CF86C0C6E19DC6E62FE9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7837-0667","documentHash":"b0f3336d-2c48-4b4a-8ae9-5e68ae827da8"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["air filter; tracked vehicle; return cyclone with tangential inlet; cyclone design modifications; separation efficiency; pressure drop; experimental studies"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b5878c28a047385c19","uid":"bzPZmmp8S2zN3FIBGmhP2-A","uuid":"2f4b58f0-ff22-4767-bf70-4a4950ffa081","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Instytut Pojazdów i Transportu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a04739948d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Experimental Investigation of Possibilities to Improve Filtration Efficiency of Tangential Inlet Return Cyclones by Modification of Their Design","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6295ea124097072fefb977e8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a04739948d"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It has been shown that tangential inlet return cyclones are commonly used for inlet air filtration of off-road vehicle engines. The wear of the engine elements, and thus their durability, is determined by the efficiency and accuracy of the inlet air filtration. It has been shown that the possibilities of increasing the separation efficiency or decreasing the pressure drop of a cyclone by changing the main dimensions of the cyclone are limited, because any arbitrary change in one of the dimensions of an already operating cyclone may cause the opposite effect. A literature analysis of the possibility of increasing the filtration efficiency of cyclones by modifying the design of selected cyclone components was conducted. In this paper, three modifications of the cyclone design with a tangential inlet of the inlet air filter of a military tracked vehicle were proposed and performed. The symmetrical inlet of the cyclone was replaced with an asymmetrical inlet. The cylindrical outlet tube was replaced with a conical tube, and the edges of the inlet opening were given an additional streamlined shape. The modification process was carried out on three specimens of the reversible cyclone with a tangential inlet. After each modification, an experimental evaluation of the modifications was carried out. The influence of the modifications on the cyclone’s efficiency characteristics and pressure drop was examined. Subsequent modifications of the cyclone were performed on the same specimen without removing the previous modifications. Tests were performed in the air flow range QG = 5–30 m3/h. Polydisperse “fine” test dust with grain size dpmax = 80 µm was used for testing. The dust concentration at the cyclone inlet was set at 1 g/m2. The performed modifications caused a slight (about 1%) increase in separation efficiency in the range of small (up to QG = 22 m3/h) flux values and about 30% decrease in pressure drop in the whole range of the QG flux, which positively influences the increase in engine filling and its power.

order of the polynomial multiplier, which can serve as an operating unit for high-speed encryption and decryption of data by hardware implementation of cryptosystems based on a non-positional polynomial notation. The functional diagram of the pipeline and the structure of its logical blocks, as well as an example of performing the operation of multiplying polynomials modulo, are given. The correct functioning of the developed circuit was checked by modeling in the Vivado Design Suite computer-aided design for the implementation of the multiplication device on the development/evaluation kit Artix-7 based on the Spartan 6 field-programmable gate array series by Xilinx. The effectiveness of the proposed hardware pipeline multiplier in modulo is confirmed by the Verilog Testbench timing diagram implemented for the evaluation kit Artix-7 field-programmable gate array. In addition, the developed pipelined modulo multiplier takes no more than 0.02 % of the resources of the used field-programmable gate array for a given length of input data. Compared to the matrix multiplication method, a pipelined modulo multiplier can handle a large data stream without waiting for the result of the previous multiplication step. The modulo pipelined multiplier depth depends on the bit width of the input data. The developed pipeline device can be used in digital computing devices operating in a polynomial system of residue classes, as well as for high-speed data encryption in blocks of cipher processors operating on the basis of a non-positional polynomial number system."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128521","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623456c22467f00ffe94c7ec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"4 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"939ff66d-3a56-48aa-bc6e-8015b54df435"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"37-43","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/251913/250717","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6234617a2467f00ffe950bbc","name":"Sergiy","lastName":"Gnatyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4992-0564","documentHash":"e6bc2ed9-23a6-41ff-96db-f00a285c145d"},{"objectId":"6234617a2467f00ffe950bbb","name":"Timur","lastName":"Namazbayev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2389-2262","documentHash":"8dfed6b2-58a7-4ed2-8785-7f576a5517a9"},{"objectId":"6234617a2467f00ffe950bba","name":"Margulan","lastName":"Ibraimov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8049-3911","documentHash":"66f2f94d-2771-4957-ab2c-98a1af5b2acc"},{"objectId":"6234617a2467f00ffe950bb9","name":"Sakhybay","lastName":"Tynymbayev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9326-9476","documentHash":"312f2574-bde6-4eb8-80af-47cd31187d34"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.251913"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.
