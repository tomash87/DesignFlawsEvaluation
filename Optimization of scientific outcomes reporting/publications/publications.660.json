Te wizualne świadectwa powstały w latach 1940–1948 w getcie warszawskim i jego ruinach. Prezentowany wybór i układ stanowią autorską koncepcję Anny Duńczyk-Szulc i Agnieszki Kajczyk.\nObrazy ukazują zwielokrotnione spojrzenia na Warszawę tamtego okresu – są to filmy jednostek propagandowych i amatorów, fotografie robione przez żołnierzy i członków ruchu oporu, kobiety i mężczyzn. Zestawienie ich obok siebie daje zaskakujący efekt: rozmnożenie punktów widzenia, kierunków ujęć, pór dnia, jak również sposobów fotografowania i towarzyszących im emocji. Ujęcia te stają się uniwersalną opowieścią o praktykach obrazowania podczas wojny, ale także – dzięki odzyskaniu znaczenia kadrów i poznaniu intencji autorów – umożliwiają czytelnikowi opowiedzenie się po stronie ofiar. Wizualna historia tworzenia getta, jego funkcjonowania, powstańczego zrywu, likwidacji i trwania „miejsca-po-getcie” łączy się w jedną historię istniejącą w różnych pamięciach, narracjach i krajach: w Polsce, Niemczech, Stanach Zjednoczonych czy Izraelu.\nW książce po raz pierwszy opublikowane zostaną nieznane materiały z powstania w getcie. Fotografie i filmy pochodzą z ŻIH i Muzeum Warszawy, a także z IPN, Archiwum Państwowego w Warszawie, Archiwum Akt Nowych, FINA, z Izraela – Yad Vashem i Ghetto Fighters’ House Museum, ze Stanów Zjednoczonych – United States Holocaust Memorial Museum i YIVO, jak również z Bundesarchiv w Niemczech.\nOprócz materiału wizualnego publikacja zawiera teksty: uznanej badaczki Janiny Struk, autorki pionierskiej monografii Holocaust w fotografiach.

Patients received two doses of COVID-19 mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine (10 ug/dose) 21 days apart. Pre-vaccine anti-S SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured on the day of the first dose and at the median of 23 days after the second dose. The study was conducted during the COVID-19 wave dominated by the Omicron variant of the virus. Anti-NCP SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured twice to evaluate incidents of infection during the study period. Pre-vaccine quantification of both types of antibodies allowed us to differentiate patients into COVID-19 naive and previously infected in order to compare hybrid immunity with vaccine-induced immunity. Before vaccination, anti-S IgG serum geometric mean concentration (GMC) was 61.17 BAU/ml in the PIMS group and 24.97 in the CONTROL group, while post-vaccination GMC was 3879.14 BAU/ml and 3704.87 BAU/ml, respectively, and did not significantly differ between the groups. Hybrid immunity (regardless of PIMS history) resulted in a higher concentration of SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibodies after vaccination. Four (20%) of the children in the PIMS group and 11 (32%) in the CONTROL group got infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the study period, yet all of them asymptomatically, and this event has not significantly altered post-vaccination anti-S titers. In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination was highly immunogenic in children, including those with a history of PIMS-TS; hybrid immunity overperforms vaccine-induced immunity in terms of serological response in children. However, vaccination effectiveness in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infections in children should be further evaluated."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832499","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"3317-3327","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X23004279","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630dfa84097076263e81a24","name":"Miron B.","lastName":"Kursa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"101f5554-37a4-458f-a0d8-094cfb3472ca"},{"objectId":"6630dfa84097076263e81a23","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Zaryczański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a2e6a6d-3786-4f9c-9703-1e8deeb81221"},{"objectId":"6630dfa84097076263e81a22","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Pielka-Markiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90b676a9-b808-417e-a03c-69bb5cdc78eb"},{"objectId":"6630dfa84097076263e81a21","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wielgos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9217df50-f406-4933-9c2e-60660fe6b2cb"},{"objectId":"6630dfa84097076263e81a20","name":"Filip","lastName":"Szenborn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b25fa34b-9667-434f-9207-88eef9555e86"},{"objectId":"6630dfa84097076263e81a1f","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Popiel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3d7250e-22d3-44c1-be6f-02c6abe2ff23"},{"objectId":"5ebee5a4752340254fc44ad5","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Ludwikowska","uuid":"76D8E1C83077AF120E809CCCFD58C9FFE985BA9CFAF6F2E1EC577E77AA55B0C3E67732EAEA4FC20107CFCF941D096CDAA9DBF843F85A41B4A15C614198966CAD","orcidId":"0000-0002-4128-3401","documentHash":"5e3c51f3-81fc-42e1-80d6-6aa00ee88009"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf6c1","name":"Marta","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"0AD01404C873361848DA439B24C87EACEC9AFC06A00A77D56C43F112F682C02F0AF7A1FE7C4C5FD18C0342ED6600431F8145AE5D11278BD06FD283768C8625F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-9024-5532","documentHash":"dc0fe3ca-c1a1-42f6-89a7-75d6fc4a70b3"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12df","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Matkowska-Kocjan","uuid":"1F25F609E868B11E38986DA9DAA690F7ECA45D6A866E4A73C965EFC6D0F8638BE921347AE441611A618A8C31665A36D5FB3EB44E98E74738AD73666E86D2CA70","orcidId":"0000-0001-7605-3879","documentHash":"cf163af1-1eae-4596-b82e-f06df21a8745"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a11dc","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Biela","uuid":"F9B656142A15B4391FAAB82B33515FE81B03DB0D402D14CD54F599F1E85915D8DFA1F23F6E4B4630693DC1B84D51E237A9CB779B907C0FA67C54DB18885E298C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3461-193X","documentHash":"3d9428d7-c85a-4bbc-ab4e-d04dd1ec59a1"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1181","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Szenborn","uuid":"2DEE29D0CC7872447BAB8A20F176F62F61A8C990EBDD3A4671984D3747DCD56D0CC426D10B82E0B467EF81E2869044F6F73120D28196857735E0A495C31F2368","orcidId":"0000-0001-6574-8229","documentHash":"d7ae0fe1-ec76-4633-b67a-f463152f7c24"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.vaccine.2023.04.035"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CBIR of solar images","fast image hash","magnetogram image descriptor","magnetogram image hash","solar activity analysis","solar image description"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sun Magnetograms Retrieval from Vast Collections Through Small Hash Codes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":{"objectId":"64abc78740970762a23ebb59","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-36027-5","title":"Computational Science - ICCS 2023.

This approach enables us to compare short vectors instead of comparing full-disk images. To reduce retrieval time, we use a fully-connected autoencoder to compress the 144-element descriptor to a 36-element semantic hash. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach, which achieved the highest precision value compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

The paper describes concepts of translation competence, with particular focus on the PACTE and EMT models. When considering the acquisition of translation competence as a continuous process, it is important to precisely define its starting point.

General control objectives of such object include ensuring stability, zero steady state error and achieving simultaneously shortest possible settling time and minimal overshoot. The main purpose of this research work was the modelling and synthesis of three control systems for an averaging tank. In order to achieve the intended purpose, in the first step a mathematical model of the control system was derived. The model was adapted to the form required to design two out of three planned control systems by linearization and reduction of its dimensions, resulting in two system variants. A multivariable PID control system for the averaging tank was developed using optimization for tuning PID controllers. A state feedback and output feedback with integral action control (IC) system was designed using a linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and optimization of weights. A fuzzy control system was de-signed using Mamdani inference system. The developed control systems were tested using Matlab environment. Finally, the simu-lation results for each control algorithm (and their variants) were compared and their performance was assessed, as well as the ef-fects of optimization in the case of PID and IC systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832523","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"136 - 150","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://wm.pb.edu.pl/actamechanica/vol16no2/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca503b4097077ac1cf82bd","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kolankowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbd5d37e-2333-4855-ad56-a2c2639b95e0"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a047391fd2","name":"Robert","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"127619D874CCF5A0D938D886A9325D1B2883003613DFF54CDA596FF26775FB62A08B6938CA60EFE6B496A73671014E8DD311E2DB014D0B5AD2A9592B2976E044","orcidId":"0000-0002-8660-300X","documentHash":"88c11b01-13dc-4d08-bbd3-92eb8338f4c8"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BARIUM STRONTIUM TITANATE","CRYSTAL STRUCTURE","SOL-GEL METHOD","THIN FILMS","X-RAY PHOTOELECTRON SPECTROSCOPY"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d0ae","5e7092e6878c28a04739eee1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Study of the Layer-Type BST Thin Film with X-ray Diffraction and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca4f634097077ac1cf75a3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e6878c28a04739eee1","5e7092cd878c28a04739d0ae"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the present paper, results of X-ray photoelectron studies of electroceramic thin films of\\nbarium strontium titanate, Ba1xSrxTiO3 (BST), composition deposited on stainless-steel substrates\\nare presented.

By using a special filter structure and an innovative quality (Q)-factor tuning technique, an independent change of the cutoff frequency (ω0) and the Q-factor with unchanged gain at low frequencies is achieved in this filter. The techniques applied result in a simple\\nfilter design with low Q-factor sensitivity to component mismatch. These filter features greatly simplify the implementation of the electronic cochlea in CMOS technologies. An exemplary filter bank designed and simulated in an X-FAB 180 nm CMOS process is presented, which consumes 1.25–34.75 nW of power per individual filter when supplied with 0.5 V.

novel technique is shown to improve the isolation between radiators in antenna arrays. The proposed technique suppresses the surface-wave propagation and reduces substrate loss thereby enhancing the overall performance of the array. This is achieved without affecting the antenna’s footprint. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a four-element array for 5G MIMO applications. Each radiating element in the array is constituted from a 3×3 matrix of interconnected resonant elements. The technique involves (i) incorporating matching stubs within the resonant elements, (ii) framing each of the four-radiating elements inside a dot-wall, and (iii) defecting the ground plane with dielectric slots that are aligned under the dot-walls. Results show that with the proposed approach the impedance bandwidth of the array is increased by 58.82% and the improvement in the average isolation between antennas #1&2, #1&3, #1&4 are 8 dB, 14 dB, 16 dB, and 13 dB, respectively. Moreover, improvement in the antenna gain is 4.2% and the total radiation efficiency is 23.53%. These results confirm the efficacy of the technique. The agreement between the simulated and measured results is excellent. Furthermore, the manufacture of the antenna array using the proposed approach is relatively straightforward and cost effective."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832531","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1 - 13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca51074097077ac1cf8eb2","name":"Ernesto","lastName":"Limiti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1837309a-ea0b-4d29-9151-6e93868ea953"},{"objectId":"64ca51074097077ac1cf8eb1","name":"Chan Hwang","lastName":"See","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aefc3e1c-4ffd-4263-9dfa-eceadd676b08"},{"objectId":"64ca51074097077ac1cf8eb0","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Naser-Moghadasi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b7937e9-0668-476c-8b15-0b5432c0d771"},{"objectId":"64ca51074097077ac1cf8eaf","name":"Mariana","lastName":"Dalarsson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"719bf21f-051d-479b-adb1-34914a3243b5"},{"objectId":"64ca51074097077ac1cf8eae","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Soruri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b03ec35-c690-42e0-aed2-3b9200693595"},{"objectId":"64ca51074097077ac1cf8ead","name":"Esraa Mousra","lastName":"Ali","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acabc9b8-bf93-4c57-acef-cc6d69171217"},{"objectId":"64ca51074097077ac1cf8eac","name":"Harry","lastName":"Benetatos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13692357-b384-424d-9bea-dd5bf3bd5978"},{"objectId":"64ca51074097077ac1cf8eab","name":"Bal S.","lastName":"Virdee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a43c9a17-14f3-42ce-82f7-73d82d4f296d"},{"objectId":"64ca51074097077ac1cf8eaa","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Alibakhshikenari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a89f1f4c-b1cc-4cbd-bc96-dbd3765b990f"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b7630","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":"ADE10A3FDF1ADAA43EDDED1EECEF7257987D36621DDC2651FA1743F0B2EC4A58B0FCDE0410C8591A1F30E812DFBC087E070124E8464AF6B145423E85D7C160AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-9063-2647","documentHash":"64490206-262d-4cc6-8295-a68adf4c2dfe"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a047394615","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pietrenko-Dąbrowska","uuid":"D92C9C7576DBBE1EFC25050DE3FDDA72938A54DD93CCAE57615ECBB84D1CEDE94227300067A7AF2FD9FF4768EBC118FE349C8342D0C51685C9774D3748855262","orcidId":"0000-0003-2319-6782","documentHash":"b983edd8-e63f-4cf4-bad6-ae679aab18eb"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473945e2","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Szczepański","uuid":"0BF12A6AD749C4B39F1DDE26B95E9A952B33CFD2EE79F51165375FE012FFD0361B75B45A284B763AFFD309DF73B9FA14A874A220B77C31257C3DB4148E2BDE60","orcidId":"0000-0002-3110-7893","documentHash":"559813ea-15dd-4a80-a633-6348bf477c7a"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-12119-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["prawo medyczne","reklama wyrobów medycznych"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nowe zasady reklamowania wyrobów medycznych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a20f","mniswId":"1001503","title":"Nowy Gabinet Stomatologiczny","doi":null,"issn":"1644-4892","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"c79565c3-d4a9-4aea-b730-2e5f3d5c3db7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ad1e874097076ac0ae45b9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ad1e874097076ac0ae45ba"]},"issue":"35","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"OD POCZĄTKU 2023 R.

This paper investigates the effect of pounding on the dynamic response of colliding high-rise buildings with different structural arrangements. Three 3-D buildings are considered in the study, including 5-storey building, 7-storey building and 9-storey building. Three pounding scenarios are also taken into account, i.e. pounding between 5-storey and 7-storey buildings, pounding between 5-storey and 9-storey buildings and pounding between 7-storey and 9-storey buildings. These three pounding scenarios are studied and compared with the no pounding case. The results show that the level of accelerations of colliding buildings significantly increases for all scenarios, as compared to the no pounding case. At the same time, displacements experience both increase and decrease, while the peak storey shears experience an increase due to pounding with few exceptions regarding the top storeys.

Leptin is a secretory adipokine involved in the central control of appetite that appears to play a role in the etiology of feeding-related disorders. Additionally, the influence of exercise on feeding behaviors potentially modulates the circulation of metabolites that signal through the central nervous system. In this systematic review, we collected the recent clinical evidence on the effect of exercise on leptin concentrations in health individuals published from 2000 to 20 September 2022, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA 2020 statement). Six hundred and thirty-eight papers were retrieved and forty-eight papers were included in the qualitative synthesis. Data supports that exercise positively influences appetite via enhancing peripheral and central leptin signaling (reuptake), especially during weight loss. Exercise modulation of leptin signaling through leptin receptors helps to stabilize increases in food intake during periods of negative energy balance, prior to a decrease in the body fat tissue content. At a high intensity, exercise appears to counteract leptin resistance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832538","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64954e8d4097075a05cd33ba","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"13","doi":null,"documentHash":"00e50fda-863d-45fc-b460-65c283c79c4a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.

The paper starts with a review of tasks related to musical instrument\\nidentification. It focuses on tasks performed, input type, algorithms employed, and metrics used.\\nThe paper starts with the background presentation, i.e., metadata description and a review of\\nrelated works. This is followed by showing the dataset prepared for the experiment and its division\\ninto subsets: training, validation, and evaluation. Then, the analyzed architecture of the neural\\nnetwork model is presented. Based on the described model, training is performed, and several\\nquality metrics are determined for the training and validation sets. The results of the evaluation\\nof the trained network on a separate set are shown.

The effect of support (shear cap) stiffness on the calculation of the length of the shear control perimeter according to the available methods is presented. Based on the analysis, the authors indicate in what range of support stiffness the corner concentrations become important in the calculation of the punching resistance. For shear caps with high flexibility (≤ 0.5), the concentration of internal forces in the corners does not occur. The authors compare the numerical results obtained from the calculation methods and indicate the correlations, which can be useful guidance for structural designers. In the case of large shear caps, the simplified MC2010 method gives a significantly lower value of the effective control perimeter length compared to more accurate methods. This paper is intended to provide scientists, civil engineers, and designers with guidelines on which factors influence punching shear load capacity of the slab–column connections with shear caps."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832548","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"188","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca4f324097077ac1cf72fa","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Grabski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ef4f8a3-47bf-4100-866d-a1d0de106270"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047393065","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ambroziak","uuid":"54D701152C69F348384AD443F40DE7F8D8D0B52BD89DE3406D6A2DC5CF50C751D7A25BA461AAB7E7712CF126125507F1BD13C93042FFE9693919EA8E3648A260","orcidId":"0000-0002-7735-7863","documentHash":"12814137-eec4-4965-8f0b-6d4e06cb86ce"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15010188"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ATRP","RNA","RNA-amphiphiles","nucleic acid block copolymer","RNA−polymer conjugate","TBDMS","SBiB","phosphoramidite","solid-phase RNA synthesis"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["646c252a40e3ff6728fba4a2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis of RNA-Amphiphiles via Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization in the Organic Phase","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"65004f0c4097077bb44ada1b","mniswId":null,"title":"Precision Chemistry","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2771-9316","websiteLink":"https://pubs.acs.org/journal/pcrhej","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"eb2a351b-6da9-4e87-a6f1-722993755b4e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-05-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65004f0c4097077bb44ada1a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65004f0c4097077bb44ada1d","646c252a40e3ff6728fba4a2","65004f0c4097077bb44ada1e","65004f0c4097077bb44ada1f"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The combination of hydrophobic polymers with nucleic acids is a fascinating way to engineer the self-assembly behavior of nucleic acids into diverse nanostructures such as micelles, vesicles, nanosheets, and worms. Here we developed a robust route to synthesize a RNA macroinitiator with protecting groups on the 2′-hydroxyl groups in the solid phase using an oligonucleotide synthesizer. The protecting groups successfully solubilized the RNA macroinitiator, enabling atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of hydrophobic monomers. As a result, the RNA–polymer hybrids obtained by ATRP exhibited enhanced chemical stability by suppressing cleavage. In addition, we demonstrated evidence of controlled polymerization behavior as well as control over the molecular weight of the hydrophobic polymers grown from RNA.

Consequently, this study aims to broaden our understanding of transfer and its driving forces in the specific case of continual reinforcement learning. We adopt SAC as the underlying RL algorithm and Continual World as a suite of continuous control tasks. We systematically study how different components of SAC (the actor and the critic, exploration, and data) affect transfer efficacy, and we provide recommendations regarding various modeling options.

The purpose of our study was to compare various aspects of radiographic assessment following scarf and chevron osteotomies and try to determine which technique helps achieve a more pronounced intermetatarsal angle (IMA) and hallux valgus angle (HVA) correction and produces lower rates of complications, including adjacent-joint arthritis. This study included patients who underwent hallux valgus correction with the scarf (n = 32) or chevron (n = 181) method with a follow-up period of over 3 years. We evaluated the following parameters: HVA, IMA, duration of hospital stay, complications, development of adjacent-joint arthritis. The scarf technique helped achieve a mean HVA and IMA correction of 18.3° and 3.6°, respectively, and the chevron technique helped achieve a mean correction of 13.1° and 3.7°, respectively. The achieved deformity correction in terms of both the HVA and IMA was statistically significant in both patient groups. The loss of correction assessed with the HVA was statistically significant only in the chevron group. Neither group showed a statistically significant loss of IMA correction. The duration of hospital stay, reoperation rates, and fixation instability rates were comparable in the 2 groups. Neither of the evaluated methods caused a significant increase in total arthritis scores in the evaluated joints. Our study showed good outcomes of hallux valgus deformity correction in both evaluated groups; however, scarf osteotomy yielded somewhat better radiographic outcomes in HVA correction and no loss of HVA correction at 3.5 years of follow-up."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832566","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"676-682","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1067251623000303?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"660563884097076263384df4","name":"Jarosław ","lastName":"Olech","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"abe00f6b-2560-4d13-8b74-bc8ae174af41"},{"objectId":"660563884097076263384df3","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d41acb8-50c2-44e6-a91b-28319223990b"},{"objectId":"660563884097076263384df2","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57d46701-b6a5-493e-957b-d0860cabeb62"},{"objectId":"660563884097076263384df1","name":"Patryk ","lastName":"Kuliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"413395b2-c73d-4596-8a75-4bfe658832d7"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d02","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Morasiewicz","uuid":"E65620B1D22E9F5C963BB6D98BE6B0843DDA0F548588152C3FA7380A377FB51053274A076A73D2DA8FDD220BC24C910F1708D08520F562445F9F7BA01C92EABD","orcidId":"0000-0002-7587-666X","documentHash":"d5d9fc26-50a7-4f3e-af70-bab3429d0399"}],"doi":"10.1053/j.jfas.2023.02.007"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["HUMAN MILK","LC−MS LIPIDOMICS","LIPIDOME STABILITY","STORAGE"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["64ca502f4097077ac1cf8203","5e709445878c28a0473b95bf","5e70925e878c28a047394733","5e709388878c28a0473ac110"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Influence of Storage on Human Milk Lipidome Stability for Lipidomic Studies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789f2","mniswId":"12416","title":"Journal of Proteome Research","doi":null,"issn":"1535-3893","eissn":"1535-3907","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"21daf346-d817-419f-9be1-e6322cff03be"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca502f4097077ac1cf8202","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac110","64ca502f4097077ac1cf8203","5e70925e878c28a047394733","5e709445878c28a0473b95bf"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Human milk (HM) lipidome stability during storage is crucial in lipidomic studies to avoid misinterpretations. Facing the lack of comprehensive work on the HM lipidome stability, we performed a study on a potential alteration in the lipid profiles of HM samples stored under different conditions. An untargeted LC-Q-TOF-MS-based approach was applied to study the influence of storage conditions as well as the interaction of the storage temperature and time on HM lipid profiles. The samples were stored for 4–84 days at temperatures in the range from 4 to −80 °C and also were exposed to up to three freeze–thaw cycles. The results showed that the storage at 4 °C for just 4 days as well as being subjected to three freeze–thaw cycles can lead to a change in the content of lipids. The observed differences in levels of some lipid species in samples stored at −20 °C in comparison to the concentration level of those lipids in samples stored at −80 °C were not statistically significant, and inter-individual variance regardless of sample storage condition was maintained. The storage of HM samples at −20 °C for up to 3 weeks and −80 °C for up to 12 weeks ensures sample lipidome stability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832568","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"438 - 446","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca502f4097077ac1cf8203","name":"Michał","lastName":"Młynarczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24871120-ce5c-4628-8304-a86acdaa73d5"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b95bf","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Hewelt-Belka","uuid":"0484CA0C81931597DEBB4AF543052B9459BEE338158EC2B8D462614F300CA17B3FC0BB44CFCB19DF93D804FEEEB68754F9CB5D7B78E218EF12132CC259449692","orcidId":"0000-0002-1990-2130","documentHash":"8cf098aa-bc72-4da4-81f6-110bcbea4f9c"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac110","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"GARWOLIŃSKA","uuid":"5C51B0E3A573225DECE286661939573A1E3907EE2620DADADC9DBB3555D5D43C1A5B7A50D96D92C4157407C0830C85340E364A9ED6B2699746A5EAA02186C733","orcidId":"0000-0001-9572-6039","documentHash":"3ea67624-d89f-4811-9e27-20afca2fb69c"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a047394733","name":"Agata","lastName":"Kot-Wasik","uuid":"5D27FF0246C9F5D6A2AB1C4BB45B30C79646F7021B47E6530B1892344D70C4C40C7835CFE592E6A9CB0B81ED717E60C1C6FB36693799D322863B236848233279","orcidId":"0000-0002-2546-3779","documentHash":"7f83282d-162b-4f27-8d5b-071fbdd4b072"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.jproteome.1c00760"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Home Alone: Widows’ Well-Being and Time","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64abe03940970762a240e2e9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64abe03940970762a240e2ea","64abe03940970762a240e2eb","64abe03940970762a240e2ec","64abe03940970762a240e2ed","64abe03940970762a240e2ee","64abe03940970762a240e2ef","64abe03940970762a240e2f0","5e7093b1878c28a0473af501"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058832570","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"813-838","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10902-023-00622-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64abe03940970762a240e2f0","name":"Michał","lastName":"Myck","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b05c85d8-cd99-4256-961b-77e1c1747059"},{"objectId":"64abe03940970762a240e2ef","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Hamermesh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90ae9330-32ec-4b30-87dd-e7dd1b1ca53e"},{"objectId":"64abe03940970762a240e2ee","name":"Maja","lastName":"Adena","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0118da20-2548-455a-b55f-09ec04cfa181"},{"objectId":"64abe03940970762a240e2ed","name":"Monika","lastName":"Oczkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a033ddb-f887-4434-a783-1459d8150d8f"},{"objectId":"64abe03940970762a240e2ec","name":"Michał","lastName":"Myck","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df4a556d-16ab-4e1e-a461-d69765b15a4d"},{"objectId":"64abe03940970762a240e2eb","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Hamermesh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"daaa0d3c-4ccf-44e9-b01d-75a96c8e1b88"},{"objectId":"64abe03940970762a240e2ea","name":"Maja","lastName":"Adena","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b896500f-bf0c-4a49-bf3b-5313a6ffe5f9"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af501","name":"Monika","lastName":"Oczkowska","uuid":"AD5F2DE441A8AEE0B22D44141790765753F2FFCC1FEA24D21D44CDD7B10B42AB5C6A678707019225E999B3929363FF48D6297928AC88D01B92EC0231F6BCBA56","orcidId":"0000-0001-7252-838X","documentHash":"387859a7-c61c-425e-887d-f01aa4654f2f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10902-023-00622-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"9783030918477","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Structural Integrity and Fatigue Failure Analysis.

The main purpose of the experiment is to improve the ferroelectric performance of the multiferroic composites using the free sintering method (pressureless). Three multiferroic composite materials (BPF) with the content of ferroelectric/magnetic 95/05, 90/10, and 85/15 were obtained. The crystal structure, electrical behaviours, as well as the dielectric, ferroelectric, and magnetic characteristics of the multiferroic ceramic composites were investigated in detail. The research has proven that using two ferroelectric materials improves the ferroelectric properties of multiferroic composites (spontaneous polarization is in the range of 5.10–7.80 µC/cm2, whereas remnant polarization in the range of 2.37–4.05 µC/cm2). The ferroelectric hysteresis loops exhibited high saturation, while the electrical breakdown strength of the composite samples is very high. Also, the entire set of physical parameters of the multiferroic composite remains high. The permittivity at room temperature is in the range (800–1230), the tangent loss value in the range (0.016–0.022), and the spontaneous magnetization in the range (1.5–0.04 emu/g). The magnetic properties of the composite samples depend on the amount of ferrite in the composition, and are the highest for the composition with the highest amount of ferrite."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832573","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64abbd2540970762a23e0361","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"32","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ef482a65-74db-4510-bc93-aae48b9df744"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"nr art. 101847","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352940723001178?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f460","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Dercz","uuid":"3B63485714A504C5897BF77861665BC427CE98130A7B6A7E6B62919A6B3966E680697C7B14A85E237E04798DD19DBDF385824A582B40071ABEEB6BDA92BF0960","orcidId":"0000-0003-3682-7184","documentHash":"3231ca70-12bd-422f-8ef1-cbbc745f172f"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f219","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Bochenek","uuid":"993ACA230930A818B768280B22A8F590DC5B580EE26139DFB31C9290A7F3E6D5D85F59C044141FD32C21EF3F5F0C41E40DD212D54054DDF6E64ECC5F65F9F19B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0608-2505","documentHash":"9fc00bae-28a7-43d7-b0c0-edbd9b812b7f"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f0bf","name":"Artur","lastName":"Chrobak","uuid":"1369C460F9763DB7D4BCF02B47B89492DF6AF40909A69FD04EF44A9F5FA8E2EFB02B4FAAC433E06A5409FE967265E1EDD21190569DDC804BCC52C96AC9D16754","orcidId":"0000-0002-6482-3319","documentHash":"8e942fb5-ceee-4fe8-9235-9e40cc8331ad"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apmt.2023.101847"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COMPLEX NETWORKS COMPLEX NETWORKS 2022 NETWORK MODELS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":"9783031211263","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Complex Networks and Their Applications XI.

Its essential component is a dual-band bandpass filter (BPF), implemented using coupling lines and two T-shaped resonators. The BPF is incorporated into the divider structure to suppress the unwanted harmonics within the circuit. The latter is achieved owing to a wide stopband of the filter. The deigned dual-band WPD can suppress third unwanted harmonics in both channels with high levels of attenuation. The designed dual-band WPD operates at 2.6 GHz and 3.3 GHz with the return loss of 22.1 dB and 22.3 dB at the operating frequencies. Furthermore, the inser-tion loss and isolation are 0.3 dB and 20.2 dB at 2.6 GHz, and 0.9 dB and 24.5 dB at 3.3 GHz. The analysis and simulation results are corroborated by the measurements of the fabricated divider prototype. The competitive performance of the proposed circuit is also demonstrated through comparisons with state-of-the-art divider circuits from the literature."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832579","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1189","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca4fc94097077ac1cf7be0","name":"Faeeh Sadat","lastName":"Mehr","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a469eeb-f026-4bde-a400-8ed70af20332"},{"objectId":"64ca4fc94097077ac1cf7bdf","name":"Saeed","lastName":"Roshani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"54bbbe6b-a943-4035-b36e-2e09bd0ad018"},{"objectId":"64ca4fc94097077ac1cf7bde","name":"Sobhan","lastName":"Roshani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0ff2c35-2c5a-4151-a891-c35b866be39f"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b7630","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":"ADE10A3FDF1ADAA43EDDED1EECEF7257987D36621DDC2651FA1743F0B2EC4A58B0FCDE0410C8591A1F30E812DFBC087E070124E8464AF6B145423E85D7C160AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-9063-2647","documentHash":"64490206-262d-4cc6-8295-a68adf4c2dfe"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473945e2","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Szczepański","uuid":"0BF12A6AD749C4B39F1DDE26B95E9A952B33CFD2EE79F51165375FE012FFD0361B75B45A284B763AFFD309DF73B9FA14A874A220B77C31257C3DB4148E2BDE60","orcidId":"0000-0002-3110-7893","documentHash":"559813ea-15dd-4a80-a633-6348bf477c7a"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15031189"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["AXLE LOAD SPECTRA, DYNAMIC LOADS, INTERNATIONAL ROUGH INDEX, DYNAMIC LOAD COEFFICIENT, LOAD EQUIVALENCY FACTOR."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64ca4bab4097077ac1cf53a1","doi":null,"title":"Eleventh International Conference on the Bearing Capacity of Roads, Railways and Airfields.

Distribution of dynamic loads of a given axle is similar to normal distribution and can be\\ndescribed by static load and dynamic load coefficient. The dynamic load coefficient depends\\non road profile, vehicle speed, properties of suspensions and static load of axle. While for a\\ngiven road section road profile remains constant, vehicle speed and suspension properties are\\nsubject to limited variations, the static loads of particular axle vary significantly. The weigh-inmotion\\nsystems are the source of data on static loads, which are characterized by axle load\\nspectra. The axle load spectra are the key data input for pavement design. The article presents\\na new approach to inclusion of the dynamic loads in axle load spectra. The theoretical\\nexplanation is supported by sample calculations. A one-kilometer road section was selected for\\ncalculations and its profile was measured using laser road surface profilograph. The dynamic\\nloads were then calculated using the quarter car model and parameters appropriate for heavy\\nvehicle suspensions. This part of calculations proved that dynamic loads significantly increase\\nfor less loaded axles. Dynamic axle load spectra were calculated based on static axle load\\nspectra and function of dynamic load coefficient. The load equivalency factors and truck factors\\nwere calculated using the fourth power equation and considering both static and dynamic axle\\nload spectra.

Thus, we are proposing a machine learning-based novel coronavirus prediction technique, called COVID-Predictor, where 1000 sequences of SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other viruses are used to train a Naive Bayes classifier so that it can predict any unknown sequences of these viruses. The model has been validated using 10-fold cross-validation in comparison with other machine learning techniques. The results show the superiority of our predictor by achieving an average 99.7% accuracy on an unseen validation set of viruses. The same pre-trained model has been used to design a web-based application where sequences of unknown viruses can be uploaded to predict the novel coronavirus."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832584","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64e749744097071eff5b4710","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"7","number":"27","doi":null,"documentHash":"7360ee22-3a6c-476d-a2c3-0fb9295076bf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"23069-23074","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.2c00215","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6500422c4097077bb4496fb6","name":"Debasree","lastName":"Maity","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8cc6e199-3c20-4e8c-b717-91063fc85366"},{"objectId":"6500422c4097077bb4496fb5","name":"Nimisha","lastName":"Ghosh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b561898-415c-4536-8781-26f0dc333858"},{"objectId":"6500422c4097077bb4496fb4","name":"Indrajit","lastName":"Saha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e9b07002-9b09-461b-acd7-f93379c42da0"},{"objectId":"6500422c4097077bb4496fb3","name":"Jnanendra Prasad","lastName":"Sarkar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1ef7e55-4974-46e0-83b8-114de6eca285"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a54cf","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Plewczyński","uuid":"2314D98BD0F680AB583D0DB61D453E5AA5C23D13F6CFF32481301607D44AFDDC375A2DF573E09B08F90CE6746C048E3AA49D9A643407540AD5C4BA32BCD7D70E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3840-7610","documentHash":"db341a0d-92be-499e-b279-2261344ca124"}],"doi":"10.1021/acsomega.2c00215"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7dfe","602cf95e9543c7410626e60a","5e7092fb878c28a0473a057a","5e70935b878c28a0473a7e8a","5fcb687a085dcb666aca2ac8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The effect of the pandemic on European narratives on smart cities and surveillance","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a37","mniswId":"19999","title":"URBAN STUDIES","doi":null,"issn":"0042-0980","eissn":"1360-063X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f370ba9e-acb4-4950-8302-2e2a4a779bfc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65006b354097077bb44c72c5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fcb687a085dcb666aca2ac8","5e70935b878c28a0473a7e8a","5e7092fb878c28a0473a057a","602cf95e9543c7410626e60a","5e70935b878c28a0473a7dfe"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents an analysis of European smart city narratives and how they evolved under the pressure of the COVID-19 pandemic. We start with Joss et al.’s observation that the smart-city discourse is presently in flux, engaged in intensive boundary-work and struggling to gain wider support. We approach this process from the critical perspective of surveillance capitalism, as proposed by Zuboff, to highlight the growing privacy concerns related to technological development. Our results are based on analysing 184 articles regarding smart-city solutions, published on social media by five European journals between 2017 and 2021. We adopted both human and machine coding processes for qualitative and quantitative analysis of our data. As a result, we identified the main actors and four dominant narratives: regulation of artificial intelligence and facial recognition, technological fight with the climate emergency, contact tracing apps and the potential of 5G technology to boost the digitalisation processes. Our analysis shows the growing number of positive narratives underlining the importance of technology in fighting the pandemic and mitigating the climate emergency, but the latter is often mentioned in a tokenistic fashion. Right to privacy considerations are central for two out of four discovered topics. We found that the main rationale for the development of surveillance technologies relates to the competitiveness of the EU in the global technological rivalry, while ambitions like increasing societal well-being or safeguarding the transparency of new policies are nearly non-existent."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832586","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65006b354097077bb44c72c6","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"60","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"e906d97d-a087-414b-945a-1d4fc8629e1e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"60","pagesFromTo":"1894-1914","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00420980221138317","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602cf95e9543c7410626e60a","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Talaga","uuid":"071E551A82C529B5142136B1136B899980D0AE8B7AFF76DFBC9B1BEBBEECE0937278570E80AB87AC76B247AE2F26D738A4703283E5E279F34A2DB273314517E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2699-2856","documentHash":"06d8b534-260a-437c-938a-af712f1f4f25"},{"objectId":"5fcb687a085dcb666aca2ac8","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Biesaga","uuid":"7D5BF346B1E6E79FD3E45E931326EEDE6BBC82F3629234926E9F887480DEB79D99165B757CD6BBBF7E6664BAE3B9E3253A7C87A889332D612710BDD0C71D45DD","orcidId":"0000-0001-5548-3546","documentHash":"0339e904-0dcd-49ca-ad46-bdd31c32664a"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7e8a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Roszczyńska-Kurasińska","uuid":"0208B956418A8601C113A75D58E4C3C58B25AF0DCB6DD9CB59A50C080AC300D9A01EA0C031F30A209B319B86164F19F318B449B115F199D5F1E06580FCB48B79","orcidId":"0000-0002-3529-6724","documentHash":"c5fb26b9-ffcb-4005-a606-1e3328cf06d1"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7dfe","name":"Anna","lastName":"Domaradzka-Widła","uuid":"E19811C6B81039346AF6606FD184F1816B6EC9F217D834076B6C3ACB9B654555470174974887FC948D0BBAB95D3A788E70E54F733B006BB7FE0AD0E7FF43CDC5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9585-732X","documentHash":"b9d050b1-3230-4f84-a4ee-9766b9dde1ac"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a057a","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"DE84E936CA573BE82FDB53BBDD51F8BB27C405507AD935EE343776F9B5A1A4186A498BD9EFB7AC756E8141EDD130510C1D6478D5387D9509B6E1820E61C1C511","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5c883d8-99cf-4e7b-bb71-0f9ff6e8454a"}],"doi":"10.1177/00420980221138317"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["DREWNO KLEJONE","DŹWIGARY DACHOWE","PRACE REMONTOWE","SALA SPORTOWA"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63c0143340970702a66dbc34","doi":null,"title":"Awarie budowlane: zapobieganie, diagnostyka, naprawy, rekonstrukcje","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788376633374","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://www.awarie.zut.edu.pl/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"44270d95-0c2c-47f5-863b-698cc169ce8c","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb95b","mniswId":"77000","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","documentHash":"29d88656-7082-42c2-8581-932a41de6c85"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709248878c28a047393099","60c334e29543c723365440e6"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Stan przedawaryjny oraz sposób naprawy dźwigarów dachowych z drewna lejonego","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca4d194097077ac1cf59fb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709248878c28a047393099","60c334e29543c723365440e6"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W artykule przedstawiono opis uszkodzeń konstrukcji dachu sali sportowej w szczególności drewnianych dźwigarów dachowych z drewna klejonego które powstały w wyniku popełnionych błędów projektowych oraz wykonawczych.

Initially, the miscibility of CS and DES to prepare homogeneous dense blend membranes has been investigated. Different techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, contact angle (CA), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and swelling degree (uptake), were used to characterize the structure of the resulting membranes. Within the pervaporation performance for ethanol dehydration, Arrhenius and mass transfer analysis were analysed in detail. Interestingly, the addition of DESs provided superior performance to crosslinked CS: DES membranes compared with the ones lacking DES. Based on the morphology and properties observed, this new concept of CS-based membranes can be alternatively applied in other solvent separations requiring hydrophilic membranes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832591","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"360","pagesFromTo":"119499","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca51b84097077ac1cf9930","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Araya-Lopez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"701c5537-1cca-4c92-b9fd-7e353e3d58b1"},{"objectId":"64ca51b84097077ac1cf992f","name":"Gastón","lastName":"Merlet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0bf3d1e6-b23a-4378-9ecf-b580c41b1659"},{"objectId":"64ca51b84097077ac1cf992e","name":"René","lastName":"Cabezas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63963474-a472-4517-895a-ab57ed9c6c44"},{"objectId":"64ca51b84097077ac1cf992d","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Castro-Muñoz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"370b4910-692f-414d-aa80-030f75ebd9ef"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bfa","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Boczkaj","uuid":"9715EEAC4EAC127938012022C0A4ACD790F5566C9874EA60AB7E89002295933280DEA7551C62372A75C17B38F1F0807E49E0E86AD99D77507A737739E955F2FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5874-7591","documentHash":"c246f4c1-d0f2-47ee-a492-b341b7da4144"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac0e7","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Gontarek-Castro","uuid":"06260A099AB0045BDAD8E4492874C66DFC0634B4ED853467314172504DB6BF606B8B20539DDA1D642505FD4D17328F4F1A66313DEC11D8508E00A209BE689ADC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8493-1851","documentHash":"7edeae79-16d2-4236-95c9-dc21d14481d9"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a04739465a","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Karczewski","uuid":"23A4EB65C4378C77E40A609F60C35A89B3EC792C0B01214514A4B7DA807B2F9F4052E69821174B554C88504EA1BA483F8285440627476C8D98B71A53A6333FF6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9322-7842","documentHash":"95dbab74-c7d1-4966-aff9-2ae217562c95"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2022.119499"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["AMMONIA ESCAPE INHIBITORS","CALCIUM CARBONATE","CARBONATION","CO2 ABSORPTION","CO2 UTILIZATION"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c30d449543c72336543b70","5e7092e3878c28a04739ed25","5e709423878c28a0473b6fdd","5e709423878c28a0473b6fb2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Improvement of CO2 absorption and inhibition of NH3 escape during CaCO3 precipitation in the presence of selected alcohols and polyols","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478583","mniswId":"10543","title":"Journal of CO2 Utilization","doi":null,"issn":"2212-9820","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"59056b97-da04-4ca7-847c-3507afeb3101"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca51df4097077ac1cf9ba3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709423878c28a0473b6fb2","60c30d449543c72336543b70","5e709423878c28a0473b6fdd","64ca51df4097077ac1cf9ba4","5e7092e3878c28a04739ed25"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This research aims to investigate the effect of selected organic substances containing hydroxyl groups on the reduction of NH3 escape and the improvement of CO2 capture during the precipitation of calcium carbonate by carbonation method using post-distillation liquid from the Solvay process and gas stream containing CO2 in the amount corresponding to the exhausted gases produced by the combustion of fossil fuels. Glycerol, ethylene glycol (EG), methanol, isopropanol, pentaerythritol, and neopentyl glycol (NPG) were used as ammonia escape inhibitors. The addition of NPG has been shown to result in the highest reduction of NH3 escape (83.1%) and the highest CO2 capture efficiency (86.1%). During the proposed CaCO3 precipitation with NPG, 98.7% of the NH3 initially introduced into the reaction mixture remains in the solution. Furthermore, the features that should be taken into account when introducing various alcohols and polyols for capturing NH3 and CO2 in the calcium carbonate precipitation via the carbonation method have been discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832593","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"102085","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca51df4097077ac1cf9ba4","name":"Chunqing","lastName":"Jiang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"693bc71d-593e-4b9a-9a9b-27edef5235bb"},{"objectId":"60c30d449543c72336543b70","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Dobrzyniewski","uuid":"CD450E9A67640AE5D30D7FD19926B18C51CC8E2D62CFBE2D0119ECFFB3E9FE0573A8369E3EE178E2ECCE6909F875C53802D9B608801079EE41DA475FFBE354EF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfb0d6c6-dfa2-460f-9457-dae3b7c7f9c5"},{"objectId":"5e709423878c28a0473b6fdd","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Dudziak","uuid":"8B00BD88675B702EFE33880183A1CF921CDF0D2E08CA835A27A2171E0B809E0D138B242A87973CA1EA4266588F37226C9EE73E3F2E8FEBCACAE2492CF31FCC00","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a9b9592-f4a8-4c28-86ea-30dcee3b3865"},{"objectId":"5e709423878c28a0473b6fb2","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Czaplicka","uuid":"D1E8BC1F5F34DA1A9D945A6FB9CB0D23AC8EDD6EE654B0973032DE6EDBDF2D8B94C9FCF1EEB3EFBD73B0152576C2C849B364C06EBAAF305D9605F6BADBCB3243","orcidId":"0000-0001-6063-4505","documentHash":"a2120f40-0294-451a-8b9b-7eaa14eaec86"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ed25","name":"Donata","lastName":"Konopacka-Łyskawa","uuid":"30FA16082C5E90D6F980E53E10E1410467F7CF8C2B132C7DB19B5181F3A9D06682892AE45739B67EFD2657DE7D73975F1F90627BB9C1B7B6F2FF4834EF9BA9AA","orcidId":"0000-0002-2924-7360","documentHash":"b289c6b8-5906-47f1-a838-50fa5241dc23"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jcou.2022.102085"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","uid":"blTedeK8fuVutIuS0UC1hLA","uuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","parentUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","rootUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","name":"Politechnika Krakowska im.

Its unique structure provides strength and cushioning, while its recyclability and bio-degradability make it an environmentally friendly option. The strength of the corrugated board depends on many factors, including the type of individual papers on flat and corrugated layers, the geometry of the flute, temperature, humidity, etc. This paper presents a new approach to the analysis of the geometric features of corrugated boards. The experimental set used in the work and the created software are characterized by high reliability and precision of measurement thanks to the use of an identification procedure based on image analysis and a genetic algorithm. In the applied procedure, the thickness of each layer, corrugated cardboard thickness, flute height and center line are calculated. In most cases, the proposed algorithm successfully approximated these parameters."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832596","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64abc5294097071386dc210d","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"23","number":"13","doi":null,"documentHash":"080663a8-ee45-435b-8c5f-88cfe9f4dc8b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"6242-1 - 6242-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/13/6242","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64abc5294097071386dc210e","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Rogalka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa19ad49-3cf3-4294-8920-05475f2505aa"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9c0","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Grabski","uuid":"CD94449BAF1D39CDE57040471AEA47853D5320D7C563D73D9C9A493460F6739317388244DAD40A1F49C7FA1A435A624238660AF6B7F242A57A337E373E66918D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0553-1084","documentHash":"9246d700-756f-4649-858e-1a0039d18b74"},{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6f4","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Garbowski","uuid":"C2B4DE757D8886907DAD1487B338EB3FFEFC81745770C595B50FE00A4709A2FF2A90E163029C241915F2629083E468C343504A15B14819FB7702EFA9344EBBF0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9588-2514","documentHash":"3b0e42a7-4e11-459a-813b-c6de44def90c"}],"doi":"10.3390/s23136242"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dentysta","komunikacja z pacjentem"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ja do Ciebie, Ty do mnie.

Nevertheless, thanks to modern technologies, even those spheres that cannot exist online can quickly transfer their work to remote mode. Accordingly, such a not new phenomenon as the hybrid mode of work became increasingly widespread. Post-quarantine hybrid remote work models are relevant in studying the future of management organisations and implementing managing functions. Today, the research on the topic and the legislative field shows the imperfection of normative legal acts regarding interpreting the remote form of activity. This creates a basis for contradictions, determining the relevance of researching this topic. The study aims to determine the level of management efficiency and the problems of its providing in remote work mode. The efficiency level of the primary management functions of planning, organisation, motivation and control in remote work was defined by surveying employees of educational institutions, IT companies and trade enterprises. The methodology for assessing management effectiveness in remote work is proposed, and the main problems of ensuring such efficiency in the context of state and commercial companies are identified."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832601","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64a81d6e4097074cfbca9cda","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"9127750c-280a-4af2-924e-ffa6d03094a6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"244-257","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.aasmr.org/jsms/Vol13/No.3/Vol.13.3.17.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64a81e7c4097074cfbcaacea","name":"Alla","lastName":"Pankova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27101601-db4e-4bb5-b338-5390cf027cd2"},{"objectId":"64a81e5c4097074cfbcaaaa0","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Shpatakova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"194db0d0-73fe-4e21-8700-51ec443232a6"},{"objectId":"64a81e3a4097074cfbcaa6f1","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Chaplynska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f55b5e98-2fad-4657-a6ce-7702899cec51"},{"objectId":"64a81e164097074cfbcaa656","name":"Valentina","lastName":"Chychun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68e6bf91-5bb7-4abc-9028-2aa561db5915"},{"objectId":"5e7094b5878c28a0473c1ff1","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Saienko","uuid":"BCA1A7C2CB16C4A37F2E11431BAC13C4BA0930AD5752760E2165B487B506F511B48BA5EBB5DFAE280D38983F453183280F06EDB685C4FDF84ED2907D95965ABB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2736-0017","documentHash":"5d3a6e2f-f8ee-4fe8-ab50-df7df144b96f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ENERGY FIELD INTENSITY FATIGUE LIFE PREDICTION CRACK INITIATION SITES CRACK GROWTH DIRECTION BENDING-TORSION LOADING"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709481878c28a0473be99b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Notch fatigue analysis and life assessment using an energy field intensity approach in 7050-T6 aluminium alloy under bending-torsion loading","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781ee","mniswId":"8906","title":"International Journal of Fatigue","doi":null,"issn":"0142-1123","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"484f5a9e-7a9d-413e-836c-a3764e00c968"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca50fc4097077ac1cf8e03","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca50fc4097077ac1cf8e04","64ca50fc4097077ac1cf8e05","64ca50fc4097077ac1cf8e06","5e709481878c28a0473be99b","64ca50fc4097077ac1cf8e07"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper studies the fatigue crack initiation and fatigue crack propagation of notched cylindrical bars made of 7050-T6 aluminium alloy subjected to multiaxial bending-torsion loading.

Two methods of training the autoencoder are evaluated, namely backpropagation\\nand extreme learning machines. The root mean square (RMS) error in the reconstruction of successive fragments of the measured DC motor angular-frequency signal, which is fed to the input of autoencoder,\\nis used to determine the health indicator (HI). A complete test bench is built using a Raspberry Pi system (i.e., motor driver controlling angular frequency) and Jetson Nano (i.e., embedded compute node to estimate motor degradation) to perform exploratory analysis of autoencoders for condition-based monitoring and comparison of several classical artificial intelligence algorithms. The experiments include detection of degradation of DC motor working in both constant and variable work points. Results indicate that the HI obtained with the autoencoders trained with the use of either training method is suitable for both work points. Next, an experiment with multiple autoencoders trained on each specific work point and running in parallel is reviewed. It is shown that, in this case, the minimum value of RMS error among all autoencoders should be taken as HI. Furthermore, it has been shown that there is a nearlinear relationship between HI and the difference between measured and reconstructed angular-frequency waveforms."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832607","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"178 - 189","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca4d574097077ac1cf5eb2","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Grzymkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b24a24c-7418-448b-a937-ef075029472f"},{"objectId":"64ca4d574097077ac1cf5eb1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Włódarczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f5603b33-5fd6-4276-97e0-13dcd6b4192b"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b8086","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Stefański","uuid":"C079494B1EA4D6367D0A41DF81043E5A7F0238BB095A93E7E8891E8B066C6216884929E6F9CAE27CE2708F2B707499E68A10D344EE9CFB90BD11D73595471344","orcidId":"0000-0002-3952-5731","documentHash":"c0078ef0-a95e-49ea-bc44-41c110c5d0fe"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-16159-9_15"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DYNAMIC LOADS","NATURAL FREQUENCY","OSB","WOOD-FRAME BUILDINGS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d0878c28a0473c458b","61bc04397523404d4a8f366a","5e7092a5878c28a047399de9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Effect of Openings’ Size and Location on Selected Dynamical Properties of TypicalWood Frame Walls","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479331","mniswId":"16369","title":"Polymers","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2073-4360","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5c4f8b81-6463-4e5b-8c64-d1384b8f9293"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca4fa74097077ac1cf79ba","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a5878c28a047399de9","61bc04397523404d4a8f366a","64ca4fa74097077ac1cf79bb","5e7094d0878c28a0473c458b"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The wooden frame constructions are now popular in many developed countries of the world. Many of these locations where such buildings are constructed are exposed to seismic and other shocks which are generated by human activities. This paper discusses the effect of the size and location of openings in the wooden frame walls under dynamic loadings. Natural frequencies of such frames with and without openings have been determined. Three 14 m high walls with different widths, including 3, 6, and 12 m, have been considered. Dynamic analysis has been made using finite element method structural analysis software Dlubal RFEM 5.17. The results show that the effect of the size and location of the openings on the natural frequency is significant. Numerically speaking, the relative change of the natural frequencies of a wall without and with an opening in a specific place could be up to 30%. In addition, the change of the natural frequency for the location of the openings is more sensitive than that to the sizes. Furthermore, the appropriate sizes and locations of openings of the wooden frame walls have been suggested. The appropriate size and place were found to be small openings in the top of the walls."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832609","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"497","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca4fa74097077ac1cf79bb","name":"Najmadeen","lastName":"Saeed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"adb2fa52-fe39-48b1-987f-a603843d27fe"},{"objectId":"61bc04397523404d4a8f366a","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Manguri","uuid":"0D5A557C7C09CBAABE640019012B24D2C794D15774767C0B31656260B0C0997B776E2D1036DCFC51353F8EE6E8AA6C440FB741A0E0408C882A5E872AEB35AEE1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef392f34-01b4-496d-aa38-38b438a0f0c1"},{"objectId":"5e7094d0878c28a0473c458b","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Chuchała","uuid":"3B71DE1A02201FA773C4A8229545FA4F56AB39A6E431C91FD5999C4B13996D861BBCC5C29216A8AF4A38665108C4BD8EBA9F0E4158E10F523FB77ED6FC67C111","orcidId":"0000-0001-6368-6810","documentHash":"64633902-6072-41d8-8caa-06d5358c9281"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399de9","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Szczepański","uuid":"48F1D93B8B8FDD43015BAC31B9AEFE707077D027AD7B2BDBBCBF4F417353FF18071D576C4B2DBA45061BA4800FE9E0DCC0B754DEC667FF1D8484D668387A5966","orcidId":"0000-0001-6049-2391","documentHash":"20be9af0-9381-427e-9f02-5e766b5f09c3"}],"doi":"10.3390/polym14030497"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fatty acid composition","triacylglycerol polymerization","thermal stability","oil oxidation","molecular properties of oils"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a6300","5e709472878c28a0473bd37b","5e709344878c28a0473a61fd"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac2f9","5e70926c878c28a04739558e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Chemical Characteristics and Thermal Oxidative Stability of Novel Cold-Pressed Oil Blends: GC, LF NMR, and DSC Studies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","doi":null,"issn":"2304-8158","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"064a8447-000a-4e4f-950b-4311ffde6ca3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ad30a14097076ac0afa748","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ad30a14097076ac0afa749","5e709346878c28a0473a6300","5e709344878c28a0473a61fd","5e70926c878c28a04739558e","5e709389878c28a0473ac2f9","5e709472878c28a0473bd37b"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plant oils contain a high content of unsaturated fatty acids. Studies of food products have revealed a considerable disproportion in the ratio of ω6 to ω3. This article presents information on the healthful qualities of eight new oil blends that contain a beneficial proportion of ω6 to ω3 fatty acids (5:1), as well as their degradation during heating at 170 and 200 °C. The fatty acid profile was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), content of polar compounds and polymers of triacylglycerols by liquid chromatography (LC), water content was measured by the Karl Fischer method, and oxidative stability was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF NMR) methods. The results showed that during heating, the polar fraction content increased in samples heated at both analyzed temperatures compared to unheated oils. This was mainly due to the polymerization of triacylglycerols forming dimers. In some samples that were heated, particularly those heated to 200 °C, trimers were detected, however, even with the changes that were observed, the polar fraction content of the blends did not go beyond the limit. Despite the high content of unsaturated fatty acids, the analyzed blends of oils are characterized by high oxidative stability, confirmed by thermoanalytical and nuclear magnetic resonance methods. The high nutritional value as well as the oxidative stability of the developed oil blends allow them to be used in the production of food, in particular products that ensure an adequate supply of ω3 fatty acids."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832611","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"2660","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12142660","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ad30a14097076ac0afa749","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Cichocki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dfa2d94d-d922-44df-89d4-139a21bc2296"},{"objectId":"5e709472878c28a0473bd37b","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kowalczewski","uuid":"DE6CB135EA3EC9DEFAD4D1903F445B04F935CDE49DF028924FE4C2B542B69B3DCE4DD80636C1F2B5FCF8D125090539F66C6AE3409827CB09FE577B21D81042E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0153-4624","documentHash":"243c1264-fd70-4d77-b348-a3a1df8cbf0d"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac2f9","name":"Agata","lastName":"Sommer","uuid":"5151FF837A46B218FF9E820F84ABBC18CD8B83A135D5A661832B4F4224DF0478B809CC1A289C25927B7B3B6F428C7F4DB0BDD7C3D13038F4951274D7E253D23D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5329-4370","documentHash":"4b96dcd1-2b58-4f7c-b30d-0943a8ee861c"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a6300","name":"DOMINIK","lastName":"KMIECIK","uuid":"E0D6712B63D9FBC35DC0573E265821FE40D6C786CDD16CAF196153ECAAE84B97C2F8DD5EFFD7EFDCE29D615A4C58C578D51E085089BD3494447A5C5D807B11EC","orcidId":"0000-0003-3708-2890","documentHash":"7760b889-e49e-41ef-9f4d-97a0483cf843"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a61fd","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Baranowska","uuid":"456F4760BA9BD9333CB00B384890B39990CD8DBB3396739EC81B15CB6F9E11C51900F77DEF0AF9CAD9001A8178ABA3D58F029C04C8480C10A0802ACD237FAE67","orcidId":"0000-0001-6597-0858","documentHash":"b2babebc-bcc3-40ee-a925-622db0dad10d"},{"objectId":"5e70926c878c28a04739558e","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Staroszczyk","uuid":"06242428570C6CCA035AB6009AF51241F174223F921F32EF851427271C5C419586EDFA53F05BC287706E1A6DA3941CA9717D9A23E55B049E115B24CCA4C52B35","orcidId":"0000-0002-2404-4708","documentHash":"e5c7f6c5-6072-4608-925e-e0eb5fa9a300"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods12142660"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CARBON-BASED BIOMATERIALS","CARDIAC TISSUE ENGINEERING","GRAPHENE","GRAPHENE OXIDE","SCAFFOLDS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac343","6110ee1b9543c757bc082820"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Electrically Conductive Carbon‐based (Bio)‐nanomaterials for Cardiac Tissue Engineering","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f0af","mniswId":"27734","title":"Bioengineering & Translational Medicine","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2380-6761","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9ad97f8e-34da-4bc1-903d-af378c3210fd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca518b4097077ac1cf9638","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca518b4097077ac1cf9639","64ca518b4097077ac1cf963a","64ca518b4097077ac1cf963b","64ca518b4097077ac1cf963c","64ca518b4097077ac1cf963d","64ca518b4097077ac1cf963e","64ca518b4097077ac1cf963f","64ca518b4097077ac1cf9640","5e709389878c28a0473ac343","6110ee1b9543c757bc082820","64ca518b4097077ac1cf9641","64ca518b4097077ac1cf9642","64ca518b4097077ac1cf9643","64ca518b4097077ac1cf9644"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A proper self-regenerating capability is lacking in human cardiac tissue which along with the\\nalarming rate of deaths associated with cardiovascular disorders makes tissue engineering critical.\\nNovel approaches are now being investigated in order to speedily overcome the challenges in this\\npath.

At the time of continuous development of all technologies, deep machine learning (more precisely, convolutional neural networks), which is one of the branches of artificial intelligence (AI), has found wide application in many fields, including photogrammetry and remote sensing. One of the areas where a lot of research is conducted using these methods is the recognition of objects in aerial and satellite imagery. Through the application of deep learning algorithms and neural networks, it is possible to automate labour-intensive processes. However, while object detection in images using machine learning is popular for natural scenes and in recent years also for nadir aerial and satellite imagery, for aerial oblique imagery at the moment of this research there were relatively few publications on the subject. The challengeable task in object detection is the time-consuming generation of training datasets when access is limited or non-existent. This study proposed the methodology to automate this process with use of existing resources for transferring of references to new databases for training models for detect objects on aerial oblique images. The object detection was performed using the YOLOv3 neural network. Experiment results tested on two datasets have shown that the proposed method could realize the task of object detection in oblique aerial images."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832615","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"XLIII-B2-2022","pagesFromTo":"657-663","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6030fa2e9543c7410626fa5d","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Zachar","uuid":"D6D5C1D6E05795695040C0AD1FF87B42AC755F2277972AC34CB97F90C38CEE6BCB69E3DD8AD22F09895EE1FA2EF05D900922485379CEDC695CAE8E9EF0B06DF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1830-9423","documentHash":"2cf6abc6-b4ef-40cb-8c18-9895fab27d19"},{"objectId":"5e7093ed878c28a0473b36f7","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":"E263905AE4EE17DB4CE82C9285018D001CB1E31D85C983FEDB87AA330725524F1C0FB42DBC3BD736CFDBA65DC495D20E64B4606562B209095184A06FB752A0A4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2103-1546","documentHash":"5525eb84-938e-4cc6-9e84-97941aa7aa92"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a0535","name":"Zdzisław","lastName":"Kurczyński","uuid":"BE101DD5AE42BC51C50AAB8C971B9637004938686C48BAD605B7449F614B63EAFB2FDA8DE63085B19CBE1253700E08A5A7D612D43511FFB2EDD8B628920C7678","orcidId":"0000-0002-6041-9933","documentHash":"6e71d2e1-ff4f-49bf-a5dc-0f06b5ee102a"}],"doi":"10.5194/isprs-archives-xliii-b2-2022-657-2022"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["autologous chondrocyte implantation;","cartilage regeneration;","cartilage tissue engineering;","collagen scaffold;"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","parentUuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","rootUuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

This study presents Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation (ACI) on two different scaffolds for the treatment of lesions in hyaline cartilage in rabbits. The first one is a commercially available scaffold (Chondro–Gide) made of collagen type I/III and the second one is a polyethersulfone (PES) synthetic membrane, manufactured by phase inversion. The revolutionary idea in the present study is the fact that we used PES membranes, which have unique features and benefits that are desirable for the 3D cultivation of chondrocytes. Sixty-four White New Zealand rabbits were used in this research. Defects penetrating into the subchondral bone were filled with or without the placement of chondrocytes on collagen or PES membranes after two weeks of culture. The expression of the gene encoding type II procollagen, a molecular marker of chondrocytes, was evaluated. Elemental analysis was performed to estimate the weight of tissue grown on the PES membrane. The reparative tissue was analyzed macroscopically and histologically after surgery at 12, 25, and 52 weeks. RT-PCR analysis of the mRNA isolated from cells detached from the polysulphonic membrane revealed the expression of type II procollagen. The elementary analysis of polysulphonic membrane slices after 2 weeks of culture with chondrocytes revealed a concentration of 0.23 mg of tissue on one part of the membrane. Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation indicated that the quality of regenerated tissue was similar after the transplantation of cells placed on polysulphonic or collagen membranes. The established method for the culture and transplantation of chondrocytes placed on polysulphonic membranes resulted in the growth of the regenerated tissue, revealing the morphology of hyaline-like cartilage to be of similar quality to collagen membranes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832616","journalIssue":{"objectId":"650065674097077bb44c344c","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"5a0e82b6-3885-4166-929d-97fb11e09d39"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"2360","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/10/2360/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"650065674097077bb44c344f","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Czubak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"45aa2d1c-d3a3-4969-9a7a-6044f87a31f6"},{"objectId":"650065674097077bb44c344e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Jakutowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb45ad66-7e82-4e29-bcae-af41a9bca033"},{"objectId":"650065674097077bb44c344d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Płończak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff2f69b3-ce7e-4e63-a75a-fe8708bd58d8"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3216","name":"Monika","lastName":"Wasyłeczko","uuid":"D24C4DA498548D6F589328C25C10C50A851BEC5E9C3ABE20DD103D46A92D8493FE5A72CD57549918EC3EE00AFC4768D04012EE78CC44C39054FE904A63C26D67","orcidId":"0000-0002-8925-292X","documentHash":"856bce14-ca94-442e-b688-9b87c79d32ca"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395fa1","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Chwojnowski","uuid":"6934BA78FB893AD072D63BCA9B4940A1C4F2364335EE65271C7A5ECB90DB85EF1BA832B9D65431A93A17E8510A0B5E460EDF27231E255518D057D51372318C08","orcidId":"0000-0002-6691-074X","documentHash":"c813667f-3ee2-464d-a2d9-b2f0bcaa8514"}],"doi":"10.3390/polym15102360"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["APPARENT MOLAR VOLUME APPARENT MOLAR COMPRESSIBILITY MOLECULAR DYNAMICS AMINO ACID IONIC LIQUIDS MORPHOLINIUM IONIC LIQUIDS WATER"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925e878c28a04739470d","5e70925e878c28a047394726"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Understanding ion–ion and ion–solvent interactions in aqueous solutions of morpholinium ionic liquids with N-acetyl-L-alaninate anion through partial molar properties and molecular dynamics simulations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788ad","mniswId":"11911","title":"Journal of Molecular Liquids","doi":null,"issn":"0167-7322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e2167a97-56be-4ac4-81e7-457a12a26deb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca50a34097077ac1cf8862","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925e878c28a047394726","5e70925e878c28a04739470d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Amino acid ionic liquids (AAILs) provide a low toxicity, biodegradable alternative to conventional ionic liquids, while also maintaining solubility in water. Densities and sound velocities of aqueous solutions of four amino acid ionic liquids (AAILs), based on the N-alkyl-N-methylmorpholinium ([Mor1,R], R = 2, 3, 6, 8) cation and N-acetyl-L-alaninate ([N-Ac-L-Ala]) anion were measured at T = (293.15–313.15) K and at atmospheric pressure. These data were used to derive the apparent molar volumes and the apparent molar compressibilities in the concentration range of (0.02–0.3) mol kg−1. Established extrapolation procedures were applied to estimate the values of the limiting apparent molar volumes and the limiting apparent molar compressibilities. The limiting apparent molar expansibility coefficients were obtained and the hydration numbers for AAILs in aqueous solution were calculated using Passynski’s method. The results indicate that ion–solvent interactions in the studied solutions are determined by the hydrophobic effect and the charge effect, which are both dependent on temperature. At low temperatures the ion–solvent interactions are determined by the hydrophobic effect which results in the decrease of the limiting apparent molar compressibilities with an elongation of the alkyl chain of the cation of AAIL. At high temperatures the charge effect is dominant due to the decreasing limiting apparent molar compressibilities. On the other hand, ion–ion interactions are dominated by the hydrophobic effect regardless of the temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations were also performed and applied in interpretation of experimental data at atomistic detail. Computed limiting apparent molar volumes correlate well with the values derived from experiment. The apparent hydration volume, obtained by subtracting the intrinsic volume contribution, is large and positive, indicating hydrophobic hydration and not electrostriction is the principal mode of ions’ influence on the solvent. Analysis of radial distribution functions confirms insignificant share of ion–ion interactions via contact ion pairing. The solvation shells signify predominantly hydrophobic hydration, with locally strongly hydrated functional groups."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832618","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"354","pagesFromTo":"118876","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a047394726","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Warmińska","uuid":"EDA17C18EA0C2D2557B8BC52A0B6006836AA783CB5919FCC2524676F79926481BAF3D71305CA7B56C3ED715544B4ACCF219F1D5B682F0F135A8CF930A4572D68","orcidId":"0000-0002-7070-8288","documentHash":"70ff6506-247f-451d-a977-e989d92bb6d5"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a04739470d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Śmiechowski","uuid":"EB43467ADDD184BD73B647FD67863B800B6B71EE5E703E063A8AD9AB15C26E95C237023B7A4D6EAA6F8F509F253B00804D151504D4D3ED3091B0BAC238BDEA22","orcidId":"0000-0002-6267-3433","documentHash":"b050615b-50b2-4228-9395-a7c5ef11f2cd"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2022.118876"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["INTERPRETABLE AI, NEURAL KNOWLEDGE DNA, DECISION TREES, DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925d878c28a0473946d9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Adding Interpretability to Neural Knowledge DNA","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778df","mniswId":"4837","title":"Cybernetics and Systems","doi":null,"issn":"0196-9722","eissn":"1087-6553","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0c571509-d2c8-4a95-a444-b2cb919e8f9e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca51054097077ac1cf8e7f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca51054097077ac1cf8e80","64ca51054097077ac1cf8e81","64ca51054097077ac1cf8e82","5e70925d878c28a0473946d9"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper proposes a novel approach that adds the interpretability to Neural Knowledge DNA (NK-DNA) via generating a decision tree.

The experiment results show that the proposed method can transform the implicit knowledge stored in the NK-DNA into explicitly represented decision trees bringing fair interpretability to neural network-based intelligent systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832620","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"53","pagesFromTo":"500 - 509","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca51054097077ac1cf8e82","name":"Haoxi","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02bb3740-e86f-470a-9ec7-1b81755be20f"},{"objectId":"64ca51054097077ac1cf8e81","name":"Tao","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c961ed66-57aa-405d-a0d5-c4c0b1ec6947"},{"objectId":"64ca51054097077ac1cf8e80","name":"Junjie","lastName":"Xiao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae251e1f-7b38-4740-b792-77acb46396cd"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473946d9","name":"Edward","lastName":"Szczerbicki","uuid":"158074A6CF33851B26E8FA79976ED8B9FC195E586893AFBC7D35E2FF67EA249F6345965122C3AC541E9E38A7778BBED22FCB9DE6C436C856434C6CC456C0EC47","orcidId":"0000-0001-7794-2862","documentHash":"f9abfa89-46bf-47df-a6a5-51e12ad0ff8c"}],"doi":"10.1080/01969722.2021.2018548"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64ad06994097076ac0ad4d9f","doi":null,"title":"Małgorzata Mirga-Tas.

This paper presents results of an analysis of 23 glass beads from Soba, the most prosperous capital of medieval Nubia. Compositional analyses using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) have identified glass belonging to a number of broad compositional groups. Three samples were made of soda lime low-alumina glass produced in the Middle East (v-Na-Ca) and Egypt (m/v-Na-Ca). The remaining beads were made of two types of mineral–soda high-alumina glass (m-Na-Al) North Indian in origin. The results of this study provide new evidence for the provenance and chronology of glass beads available in medieval Soba and Northeast Africa, and contribute new data to research on trade contacts of that time."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832623","journalIssue":{"objectId":"650045da4097077bb449b3c3","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"65","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"6c7eb750-3efd-4abc-b83b-b35e46163a00"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"65","pagesFromTo":"1018-1031","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1111/arcm.12863","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"650045da4097077bb449b3c4","name":"Laure","lastName":"Dussubieux","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c021131-160b-4bc7-bc61-edc212814f94"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7e51","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Then-Obłuska","uuid":"02E87C186AB8A4959C422F25415EA486C17D18173E53BBB9ACFF8302F0F4BDD137EC541A1F1FCAE32770BC9B762CA0BEED26120E31638A84BE9060C1E020B02E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4690-0069","documentHash":"e5c65980-aa36-4871-8e97-470ce34c7c14"}],"doi":"10.1111/arcm.12863"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ługowanie metali","rozpuszczalniki głęboko eutektyczne (DES)","e-odpady"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"649c20c24097071386c52c16","doi":null,"title":"Nauka i przemysł -

Technological advances are helping to create Industrial Revolution 5.0 by creating additional value for both customers and companies by using the human mind and human creativity. This approach enables mass personalization to enhance customer satisfaction with the shift from the digital use of data to its intelligent application. Digital twins and simulation technologies optimize manufacturing and technological processes using cyber-physical systems. Virtual simulation and product testing from different angles increase the efficiency of the dynamic modeling and manufacturing of the final product. This paper aims to present an intelligent cyber-physical system platform with an open architecture with the possibility of free configuration and cooperation with external systems for diagnostics and control of technological processes using the industrial internet of things (IIoT). Such a solution makes it possible to manage the intelligent structure of companies in terms of processes, products, simulations, and virtual products by tracking the product cycle. The use of different data types in a single decision-making process (ranging from the availability of resources and personnel through the maintenance schedules of machines) allows for the appropriate analysis and optimization of the process. The use of uncertain data and data that has no clear impact on production requires solutions that are based on artificial-intelligence algorithms in the decision-making process that influence the optimization of a given solution."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832626","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"73-84","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003384311-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64abbe4040970762a23e0f51","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wyrwisz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"211f1b4c-a7eb-42b1-8ab4-9dc493c4fe17"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b8278","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Rymarczyk","uuid":"023ABED6AF8A07DC59434A46BF1405851E50E9B5A58FAEF3595AA01DF0D5786DDD410B82D35209792DD40E38264322EF283FDBDD40E1B4436360E00FBA3523C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-3524-9151","documentHash":"220aa72f-395d-4ef0-93fd-175503646454"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398648","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Król","uuid":"B20ADB10F45D88038ACD5CB9C6774DFB1705D5EB7965F3F2EE0C3E71021CF192F099BB84718B7172D88DEFDCB05FDAC114E116F84A0C41189102DB8FA01D845F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0114-2794","documentHash":"0e8a9978-eb5b-4bd7-86c7-1c60d8cceb14"}],"doi":"10.4324/9781003384311-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sorption of mercury in batch and fixed‐bed column system on hydrochar obtained from apple pomace","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547cfa0","mniswId":"16576","title":"Processes","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2227-9717","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9bbb9f49-7b25-4f2f-accb-63283b7536a1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64a7ed994097074cfbc8c03e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64a7ed994097074cfbc8c03f","64a7ed994097074cfbc8c040","6040d2539543c711bc6ea8cd","5e709434878c28a0473b81fe","5e709394878c28a0473ad508"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058832629","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://suw.biblos.pk.edu.pl/resourceDetailsBPP&rId=97911","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64a7ed994097074cfbc8c040","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Hodacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37a8a91c-a9cf-406a-bea4-7744ff363f72"},{"objectId":"64a7ed994097074cfbc8c03f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szostak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa0d208e-0c6c-4e94-8fd8-92192305478c"},{"objectId":"6040d2539543c711bc6ea8cd","name":"OLGA","lastName":"DŁUGOSZ","uuid":"6DE06B2E960998B4951BCAC819047C9276D2E45FF490356D07A7E3360A518FBDA6B64D71AD0BFC0455138D97E68B78ABF3C603253F8597A6FF8C1A7EFD30EFAF","orcidId":"0000-0003-0482-435X","documentHash":"f89555c5-b9b6-4f10-b365-781ea2759bfa"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81fe","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Pulit-Prociak","uuid":"7E0A0CE3DF0703B12A2877E20461C63E0B6B1F35377491A5F456F71878DD9B7A3350791C6028E375FBCB7FFAF77BBF411E6CB53C2157025E277AC8115459BF05","orcidId":"0000-0001-5005-7134","documentHash":"94f743da-52cd-45fd-8f49-323b18da6f28"},{"objectId":"5e709394878c28a0473ad508","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Banach","uuid":"E13D8A8CE22660763FB1EB711A8C1EBCB7E7E954A8330C5825ECA01BB49A0EAE6A342398C93575449B68AC30F04B96765C29C0E55EC0B94F44E958F2FE9BEAAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9406-2709","documentHash":"0fc1f43f-28af-4faa-a842-196c8ef6709c"}],"doi":"10.3390/pr10102114"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","uid":"bFdp5gORDGmB2AOTB2xubqg","uuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","parentUuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","rootUuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","name":"Instytut Metalurgii i Inżynierii Materiałowej im.

From the viewpoint of continuum damaged media (CDM), a mathematical model is developed that describes the processes of viscoplastic deformation and damage accumulation under creep. The problem of determining material parameters and scalar functions of the developed constitutive relations based on the results of specially set basic experiments is discussed. An experimental–theoretical methodology for determining material parameters of the derived constitutive relations of CDM is developed based on analyzing the viscoplastic deformation and failure processes of laboratory specimens in the conditions of soft loading (stress controlled). Experimental results of short-term creep of the VZh-159 heat-resistant alloy are presented. The obtained numerical results are compared with the test data using the numerical modeling method of experimental processes. Qualitative and quantitative agreement between numerical results and experimental data is shown. It is concluded that the developed constitutive relations are reliable, and that the proposed methodology accurately determines the material parameters of the model under degradation of initial strength properties of structural materials according to the long-term strength mechanism."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832638","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"34","pagesFromTo":"841 - 853","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca50fa4097077ac1cf8ddb","name":"Evgeny","lastName":"Boev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f58c351-0953-4abe-b196-14d55dd2996b"},{"objectId":"64ca50fa4097077ac1cf8dda","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Volkov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f400ea75-f3d1-40b2-8edd-e5acea3a9cbb"},{"objectId":"64ca50fa4097077ac1cf8dd9","name":"Leonid A.","lastName":"Igumnov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a43df4bd-5001-4cfa-bfa4-ae4e93cff4df"},{"objectId":"5e7094df878c28a0473c5abb","name":"Victor","lastName":"Eremeev","uuid":"4D67284961C6B3167A5033ACF6B14BCB3A84E33B594FB3951EB1EF1D51D8F9516B3C358B8A07186FBD7281FACACA85A84CE94398C2F8AB64E5BA4F5B8B3FD36F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d50c6765-f3cf-401f-b16b-07cc57ae7fd5"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00161-022-01094-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["3D PRINTING","ANTIMICROBIALS","CHITOSAN","FILAMENT","POLYCAPROLACTONE"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac2bb","602fa7209543c7410626f709","5e70925e878c28a047394714"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A novel method of creating thermoplastic chitosan blends to produce cell scaffolds by FDM additive manufacturing","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547753f","mniswId":"3243","title":"Carbohydrate Polymers","doi":null,"issn":"0144-8617","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c286039e-3a04-4eba-ac21-f6a7e1962904"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca4f2f4097077ac1cf72d4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925e878c28a047394714","64ca4f2f4097077ac1cf72d5","602fa7209543c7410626f709","5e709389878c28a0473ac2bb"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to its remarkable and promising biological and structural properties, chitosan has been widely studied in several potential applications in the biomedical sector.

Among La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3, LaNi0.6Fe0.4O3, Cu1.4Mn1.6O4, and LSM materials, only LSM materials did not trigger any chemical reaction or interdiffusion with BYO at temperatures up to 900 °C. Two cell designs, Cell A, with a Bi1.71Nb0.25Ba0.04O3+δ (BBNO) interlayer and high-fire Ag electrode, and Cell B, with an LSM-BYO composite electrode, were obtained in this study. The cells were sandwiched between two modular SUS 316 planar interconnects using a ZnO–SiO2–Al2O3 glass sealant to form the SEOG device. Although Cells A and B possessed similar ohmic resistance (Ro) values, the polarization resistance (Rp) values of Cell A were 3.6 times larger than those of Cell B. Furthermore, the stability study of the cells operated at 600 °C for 12 h revealed that Ro increased from 0.79 to 3.17 Ω cm2 and Rp from 3.12 to 12.58 Ω cm2 for the Cell A, while Ro increased from 0.76 to 0.77 Ω cm2 and Rp from 0.87 to 1.12 Ω cm2 for the Cell B. Therefore, minor variations in the Ro and Rp of Cell B indicate the excellent stability of the electrode. The degradation of Cell A was caused by the migration of Ag and formation of voids and cracks adjacent to the anode/electrolyte interface under the DC field. Furthermore, the Cell A experienced a decrease in faradaic efficiency for current densities greater than 0.20 A cm−2 owing to the partial decomposition of BYO at the cathode. In contrast, the Cell B generated an oxygen flux of 1.29 cm⋅min−1 at 600 °C. In addition, the faradaic efficiency of Cell B remained consistent for current densities up to 0.35 A cm−2. Therefore, the SEOG using LSM-BYO as the cell electrode exhibited excellent stability and electrochemical performance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832649","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"48","pagesFromTo":"1132 - 1141","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca4fd34097077ac1cf7c79","name":"Yung-Fu","lastName":"Hsu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95bae603-3766-40b2-bb2f-48cc593fa8ca"},{"objectId":"64ca4fd34097077ac1cf7c78","name":"Sea-Fue","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7d2b3bd3-59a8-4849-a151-42cb4c56f364"},{"objectId":"64ca4fd34097077ac1cf7c77","name":"Jeng-Ting","lastName":"Tsai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4ee3c9e-6503-4b03-8351-3054fab33cc0"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473945ae","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jasiński","uuid":"C17104892D6E29FA11F455EE8388AD3C5EADFBE3C47E669A1E385825D1D097176990FB9465D8DFD3D3571469DE592A2B5CF456723EA642783E32517A196D9845","orcidId":"0000-0001-9249-4869","documentHash":"b7242f69-1ca9-42e1-994c-3e4743a1a726"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ceramint.2021.09.198"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["leczenie nakładkowe","dentysta"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dobór pacjentów do leczenia nakładkowego","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a20f","mniswId":"1001503","title":"Nowy Gabinet Stomatologiczny","doi":null,"issn":"1644-4892","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"c79565c3-d4a9-4aea-b730-2e5f3d5c3db7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ad1f3f4097076ac0ae6427","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ad1f3f4097076ac0ae6428"]},"issue":"135","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"LECZENIE ORTODONTYCZNE PRZEZROCZYSTYMI NAKŁADKAMI WYMAGA WIEDZY NA TEMAT DIAGNOSTYKI ORAZ UMIEJĘTNOŚCI SELEKCJI PACJENTÓW DO LECZENIA.

The term “deep eutectic solvent” (DES) was later adopted for similar mixtures. As DESs have a number of interesting features, they quickly attracted the attention of researchers and found application in various branches of chemical and materials research. To date, various definitions of DES have been proposed. Nevertheless, there are still differing views among researchers on what a DES really is and what exact properties a mixture must have in order to be included into this group. The prefix “deep” should only be used for deep eutectic solvents with melting points significantly below ideal predictions. Otherwise, the simpler term “eutectic solvent” (ES) should be used. It therefore follows that in order to correctly assign a solvent to the DES or ES group, a phase diagram must be available to evaluate the deviation from the ideality, as well as to quantify the DES’s liquid window. The term DES is now commonly used in analytical chemistry, but authors rarely go into a detailed examination of a DES from the viewpoint of whether it actually is a DES or an ES. Instead, they logically focus mainly on the analytical part, that is, on taking advantage of the benefits that the DES provides. Therefore, it may happen that the solvent used is designated as a DES, even if it does not meet all the necessary requirements. Of course, we cannot or should not expect analytical chemists to do a detailed study of the physical properties of DESs in addition to solving analytical tasks, although we should encourage analysts to pay due attention to the correct use of the terms (D)ES in their publications, as it would certainly help further development in the utilization of DESs in various areas, not just in analytics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832655","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"179","pagesFromTo":"107498","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca50ed4097077ac1cf8d05","name":"Vasil","lastName":"Andruch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17c58abc-153a-4636-b8a1-5fe9558c1d92"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85e6","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Płotka-Wasylka","uuid":"37047B6E693B1C02F27245BC2D7E473A80DF9FB06C7CEC6B7555E194E532A1FA63BD5DF0B56B20B14B1D3200D3F8764B539CFE927EF73EBC76E6067857B1C729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1304-8623","documentHash":"0e91f69f-c646-4dbb-834c-4faee4f8e87b"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac061","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Makoś-Chełstowska","uuid":"D8220E784AF8BE6DB52B9BB9FD1B4CCB82EE64B75AEFC26E4D492FFCFD4B56A9CD6C3B5EB4DAD03564A374681E326F7E41B1C6D00D6E4871819E5F6FA0BEB9C8","orcidId":"0000-0002-1160-2790","documentHash":"d1c8d2b7-7db9-4391-927e-5f198c9fd1ea"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.microc.2022.107498"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ACTIVE LEARNING","CROWDSOURCING","SAMPLE ASSESSMENT"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a4878c28a047399b9a","5e70925d878c28a0473945fb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Active Learning Based on Crowdsourced Data","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca4f494097077ac1cf743e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a4878c28a047399b9a","5e70925d878c28a0473945fb","64ca4f494097077ac1cf743f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper proposes a crowdsourcing-based approach for annotated data acquisition and means to support Active Learning training approach.

The novelty of our approach is the assessment of energy transformation in the European Union through two aspects. The first one, “smart and efficient energy systems”, assess the current, widely understood energy consumption in economy, and the second one, “macroeconomic heterogeneity”, refers to the economic potential of a country. In our analysis, we included indicators from the 7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Sustainable Development Goals. Using taxonomic methods, we created clusters of coun-tries according to the emissivity of their economies and the socio-economic potential for the energy transition.

Furthermore, the pandemic has highlighted the strong interrelations between natural and societal systems, with societal resilience depending on a resilient environmental support system. In this context, this book argues that the pandemic represents a wake-up call for financial systems to be better prepared for the climate crisis and social risk and has provided a stimulus to scale down the reliance of the global economy on fossil fuels. The first part of the book provides a deep and creative discussion between leading international researchers and experts on the policy options and financial instruments which can help to catalyze the green finance transition in the post Covid-19 era. The contributions here show that sustainable finance is emerging as a powerful tool to catalyze the transition towards a more environmentally and socially sustainable economic model. Instruments such as sovereign green bonds, green securities, and other sustainability-related securities can play a significant role in the post Covid-19 world to fund economic stimulus and to lead the way to new and more sustainable future. The second part of the book supports the debate by highlighting a number of selected case studies on financing transitions in different regional contexts including Africa, Asia, Europe , and Latin America.

The adsorbents were characterized with advanced analytical techniques. The impact of EDB, MNPs/EDB and nZVCu/EDB dosage (1–4 g/L), pH (4–10), initial concentration of CR (20–500 mg/L), interaction time (180 min) and material type to remove CR from water was examined at ambient temperature. The CR removal followed sequence of nZVCu/EDB > MNPs/EDB > EDB (84.9–98% > 77–95% > 69.5–93%) at dosage 2 g/L when CR concentration was increased from 20 to 500 mg/L. The MNPs/EDB and nZVCu/EDB showed 10.9% and 20.1% higher CR removal than EDB. The adsorption capacity of nZVCu/EDB, MNPs/EDB and EDB was 212, 193 and 174 mg/g, respectively. Freundlich model proved more suitable for sorption experiments while pseudo 2nd order kinetic model well explained the adsorption kinetics. Fixed bed column scale results revealed excellent retention of CR (99%) even at 500 mg/L till 2 h when packed column was filled with 3.0 g nZVCu/EDB, MNPs/EDB and EDB.

Pure phase of hematite was found only for a particular combination of precursor and co-precursor and else a mixture of hematite and magnetite. Significant effect of the co-precursors on the nature and size of the synthesized materials was noticed. Gradual conversion of hematite to magnetite with increasing amount of co-precursor was established. Morin transition was observed in the temperature dependent magnetization study for the hematite materials. Absorption spectroscopy exhibited three different electronic transitions that take place within the 3d5 shell of the octahedrally coordinated Fe3+ ions for hematite materials. The optical (direct and indirect) band gaps estimated from the Tauc’s plot showed particle size dependence. From photoluminescence study the transitions of trapped electrons in various defect states of oxygen vacancies were observed which led to the appearance of nonradiative peaks. In the Raman spectra the significant bands of hematite (A1g and Eg bands) were noted. From morphology study the hematite nanomaterials appear as clusters of large irregular shaped particles of various sizes. Formation of hematite nanomaterials as observed by XRD studies was supplemented by the SAED patterns obtained in the HRTEM study. Present study established that nano-sized pure hematite materials can be thermally synthesized at comparatively lower temperature on thermal decomposition of iron(III)citrate by varying the weight ratio of suitable co-precursors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832673","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64abb19240970762a23d5d4b","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"129","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"0a406a25-cfd8-491b-89ac-c551d6d21bd7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"129","pagesFromTo":"nr art. 264","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00339-023-06559-4.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64abb19240970762a23d5d52","name":"A.","lastName":"Bhattacharjee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3942a4ce-8b04-46df-919e-6fe7df9b7763"},{"objectId":"64abb19240970762a23d5d51","name":"V.

An unquestionable conceptual advantage of our solution (OrthoView) is the fact that only one resulting 2D image is created from the point cloud, which can be the result of merging (integrating)\\n3D images from many cameras. Therefore, it allows for the fusion of\\ninformation from any number of cameras, without the need to implement solutions for identifying the same objects seen from different perspectives\\n(cameras). In order to test our solution stream, we created 6 scenes of different complexity, on the basis of which we present the effectiveness of our solution.

In binary SiOC/Sn composites, tin nanoparticles may be produced in situ via carbothermal reduction of SnO2 to metallic Sn, which consumes free carbon from the SiOC ceramic phase, thereby limiting the carbon content in the final ceramic nanocomposite. Therefore, to avoid drawbacks with carbon depletion, we used graphite as a substitute during the synthesis of precursors. The ternary composites were synthesized from liquid precursors and flake graphite using the ultrasound-assisted hydrosilylation method and pyrolysis at 1000 °C in an Ar atmosphere. The role of the graphitic component is to ensure good electric conductivity and the softness of the material, which are crucial for long term stability during alloying–dealloying processes. The presented approach allows us to increase the content of the tin precursor from 40 wt.% to 60 wt.% without losing the electrochemical stability of the final material. The charge/discharge capacity (at 372 mA g−1 current rate) of the tailored SiOC/C/Sn composite is about 100 mAh g−1 higher compared with that of the binary SiOC/Sn composite. The ternary composites, however, are more sensitive to high current rates (above 372 mA g−1) compared to the binary one because of the presence of graphitic carbon.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058832679","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12030410","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6602bac8409707626324ddb7","name":"Monika","lastName":"Wilamowska-Zawłocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e92b4679-e86c-4acc-b0d4-4f35d6782a5f"},{"objectId":"6602bac8409707626324ddb6","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Kovalska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa7513f8-52dd-4bc9-84d8-59f342b9c388"},{"objectId":"6602bac8409707626324ddb5","name":"Maria","lastName":"Gazda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd45d50e-2c6e-4927-8012-adaf8d478c1c"},{"objectId":"6602bac8409707626324ddb4","name":"Gurdial","lastName":"Blugan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29d96a94-32c3-458a-beae-fe4d593cc8ec"},{"objectId":"6602bac8409707626324ddb3","name":"Pradeep","lastName":"Vallachira Warriam Sasikumar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5e57edd-4f39-47e1-86f8-e92d26e7e11f"},{"objectId":"6602bac8409707626324ddb2","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Knozowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"928387fb-a9a4-4c21-bc5d-5f95170af89b"},{"objectId":"5f783e2d085dcb410a25e97f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Madajski","uuid":"6CC230F3E644B75AA23CD2BCA671FC7FB8C6953B65967C72CFEA87A7096BAC97C67CF2FD865AFB579CEA7FE7B9293BD950972486CA2433E7E7BBA2FAA843A374","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af45be1d-1b61-4076-a792-86d3b8915e62"}],"doi":"10.3390/nano12030410"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64a933b34097075481552605","doi":null,"title":"Nauka i przemysł: lubelskie spotkania studenckie.

One of the most commonly used intercalation anode material for Li-ion batteries, graphite, is vulnerable to Li nucleation, a side reaction which competes with the intercalation process and leads to loss of reversible capacity of the battery, ageing and short-circuits. In this study, we deploy a combined grand canonical large-scale electronic density-functional theory (DFT) and Poisson–Boltzmann electrolyte theory to study the nucleation and growth of Li clusters on the graphite anode in the presence of its surrounding electrolyte environment at different applied voltages with respect to the Li metal reference electrode. We find the voltage below which the nucleation energy becomes negative (corresponding to Li nucleation becoming energetically favourable), the ‘potential of zero nucleation energy’ (UPZN). We observe a distinct minimum in the plots of UPZN as a function of the size of nucleated clusters. When the applied voltage on the graphite electrode is below the minimum value of UPZN, the nucleated clusters start growing unbounded on graphite electrode. This potential for cluster growth (UPCG) is found to be -0.12 V on the periodic basal plane of unlithiated graphite and -0.08 V on lithiated graphite. The corresponding potential for the zigzag edge termination is -0.06 V on unlithiated graphite and -0.04 V on lithiated graphite. Thus, the nucleation and cluster growth is favored on the zigzag edge termination of the graphite electrode as compared to the periodic basal plane and on the lithiated graphite as compared to the unlithiated graphite. We find that the surrounding environment plays a significant role and that nucleation is more likely to occur in electrolyte environment than that predicted from calculations in vacuum. We observe that the potentials obtained with grand canonical ensemble DFT method in electrolyte are close to experimentally available data. The study has profound implications for the nucleation, growth and control of metal dendrites in a battery
