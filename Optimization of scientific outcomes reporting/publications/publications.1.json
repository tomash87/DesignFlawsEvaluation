As rates of data usage and internet consumption continue to increase, cyber awareness turned to be increasingly urgent. This study focuses on the relationships between cyber security awareness, knowledge and behavior with protection tools among individuals in general and across four countries: Israel, Slovenia, Poland and Turkey in particular. Results show that internet users possess adequate cyber threat awareness but apply only minimal protective measures usually relatively common and simple ones. The study findings also show that higher cyber knowledge is connected to the level of cyber awareness, beyond the differences in respondent country or gender. In addition, awareness is also connected to protection tools, but not to information they were willing to disclose. Lastly, findings exhibit differences between the explored countries that affect the interaction between awareness, knowledge, and behaviors. Results, implications, and recommendations for effective based cyber security training programs are presented and discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747048231914","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621f7ec92467f07479835bff","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"62","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"9054fc92-1e69-4d4b-b98e-856da33eab67"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"82-97","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epub/10.1080/08874417.2020.1712269?needAccess=true","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fbb78ce2467f015d9d7b2cc","name":"Hamdullah

aim of our study was to evaluate testicular growth and risk of atrophy at different lengths of time from the 2SLF-SO in boys with intra-abdominal cryptorchidism.\r\n\r\nMaterial and methods\r\nTwenty-seven boys aged one to 24 months were treated for 35 non-palpable testes. Twenty-one boys with 29 IAT underwent a two-stage laparoscopic Fowler-Stephens operation. The patients underwent ultrasound examination of the TV at six time points: before treatment (TP1), 3 months (TP2) and 9-12 months after laparoscopic F-S operation (TP3), 3 months after inguinal orchidopexy (TP4), 3–6 years of age (TP5) and 7–9 years of age (TP6). The testicular atrophy index (TAI) of the affected testicle was calculated.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe overall success rate of treatment was 93.1% (27/29). The median volume of the affected testicles before treatment was less than the median TV of the healthy gonad, but increased systematically at the successive time points, showing significant growth between the second and sixth time points (p < 0.02, R = 2.75).

Nowadays, we are able to distinguish low\ndensity lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) subfractions.\nExcept LDL also HDL small subfractions can increase the risk of CV events.\nTherefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between changes of lipoprotein\nsubfractions and the risk of hypertension development.\nMaterial and methods: In 2-year long study 200 volunteers with normal\nblood pressure at the age of 19–32 years were included. Each volunteer underwent\ndetailed medical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram was taken\nat rest, echocardiogram, lipid subfraction assessment (using Lipoprint®) and\ntwo 24-hour BP measurements.\nResults: Mean total cholesterol concentration was 189 mg/dl (4.89 mmol/l),\nwith mean LDL concentration of 107 mg/dl (2.77 mmol/l), HDL of 63 mg/dl\n(1.63 mmo/l), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) of 40 mg/dl (1.04 mmol/l)\nand triglycerides (TG) of 89 mg/dl (1.00 mmol/l). Subfractions LDL 1–3 were\nmost abundant, LDL 4–5 making up a marginal portion and LDL 6–7 were\nnot observed. Whereas, subfractions HDL 4–6 were most abundant, in lower\nconcentration was present HDL 1–3 and HDL 8–10. We showed that increased\nsystolic blood pressure coreclated significantly with HDL cholesterol\nconcentrations (p = 0.0078), HDL intermediate subgractions (p = 0.0451),\nwith HDL-3 subfraction (p = 0.0229), and intermediate density lipoprotein-A\n(IDL-A) (p = 0.038).

Both proteins were shown to be expressed, apart from the thyroid, also in other human tissues, including lactating mammary gland. NIS expression in human breast cancers has been widely studied. On the other hand, until now PDS mRNA levels in breast tumor tissue have been estimated only in high throughput analyses. Previously, we have observed that TPO is expressed in normal and cancerous human breast tissues and shows enzymatic activity. However, biochemical activity of TPO in human breast cancer cells requires iodide transport by NIS and PDS. Therefore, to extend our previous study on TPO expression and function in human breast tumors we performed analysis of NIS and PDS levels in the same group of patients.\nMaterial and methods: The study involved detection of NIS and PDS protein levels by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, as well as mRNA levels by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.\nResults: Here we provide direct evidence that NIS and PDS are expressed in human breast cancer tissue, with NIS levels being increased and PDS levels decreased in tumor tissue. Interestingly, PDS mRNA levels in breast cancer tissue seem to be influenced by the estrogen receptor status and age of the patients, while NIS mRNA levels were dependent on histological type of the tumor.\nConclusions: This study provides valuable information important for consideration in diagnostic or therapeutic application of radioiodine in breast cancer management."}],"lastRefresh":"1747048562462","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f349604097073235118817","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"3053331f-f93e-43a2-a7a6-4b1b61a24184"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"1041-1050","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Expression-of-pendrin-and-NIS-iodide-transporters-in-human-breast-tumor-and-peri-tumoral-tissue,19,38673,1,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebff4bead49b31ccec1b465","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kiedrowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed9b906c-9347-419e-9584-33c0ec62095f"},{"objectId":"5ebff4bead49b31ccec1b464","name":"Anna","lastName":"Łyczkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8c454ea-bad9-4688-886c-0aac96841d8f"},{"objectId":"5e709495878c28a0473bfea6","name":"Wanda","lastName":"Krasuska","uuid":"8C973B66478278E759EA234AB7B4F292A6ECD0E0C7213278C91A57193675762C238DA5B90FECD69DAB78DE0A2E7919999D22D9A477B44FDB3DB467624E665BD8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4807-4864","documentHash":"d8e0742e-bd5a-457e-96f2-82541ceb326e"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a46","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Godlewska","uuid":"739B7F732AB12A026CAEF1443204C278D712C978C62C345D08766082DA19965D49ADE5B80E54E9125A04E40BBE80E54C3429E4C4002B78BD6463A6D8DA91370F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2337-6724","documentHash":"72448d09-dcdf-4c3b-ab1a-d44ee4ef579f"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a32","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Czarnocka","uuid":"06CA09CE981C2E3C30C484994602FCC552A2FA1A1F9C7C5011421972B7617A3E0CFC077601C8BEE381F0E9AEBB12FC858016A456FDF0EA09D8389C29526BEE14","orcidId":"0000-0001-7701-760X","documentHash":"e7ae92ec-92e9-4a94-897f-c4a5eca5bd19"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a2f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Arczewska","uuid":"260CDD365E33D45A9D9171762385E4189BA5821555D30D86D25283EE2293C0FF2E9565BAF8FA3D8A1A087511BFC04B145E148C176EAE7EED4C19DD7D1D7966FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-9606-1585","documentHash":"a9072bea-2a43-4801-b6af-991cf9cd68c5"}],"doi":"10.5114/aoms.2019.89980"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sexual dysfunction","Sexual activity","Sexual behavior"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70920c878c28a04738f271"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Prevalence of sexual dysfunctions and associated risk factors in Poland.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771a3","mniswId":"1677","title":"Archives of Medical Science","doi":null,"issn":"1734-1922","eissn":"1896-9151","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"aadf3a3b-d87a-48ab-b21f-786d725fd767"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2019-07-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5ebff4bbad49b31ccec1b13e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{},"issue":"(4)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction:\nMany biological, psychological and sociocultural factors influence the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions and sexual behavior. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of sexual dysfunctions and sexual behaviors.\n\nMaterial and methods:\nThe study was the third edition of a general population-based, cross sectional survey, evaluating sexual attitude, sexual behaviors within and outside relationships and type of sexual dysfunctions present in the Polish population. The survey consisted of 82 questions, grouped into five blocks that contained open- and closed-ended general questions, inquiries about early sexual contacts, sex life, relationships, sexual behaviors and preferences. A standard questionnaire was used to obtain data on age, education, marital status, religious beliefs, medical history, disabilities and other illnesses. A total of 1054 responders aged from 18 to over 70 years participated in the study. Risk factors and other causes contributing to certain sexual dysfunctions defined in the DSM-5 and in the available literature were analyzed.\n\nResults:\nIn this research, 40% of women and 36.5% of men had at least one sexual dysfunction. Analysis of the total population showed that decreased sexual desire (29.0%), occasional climaxing (28.5%) and anorgasmia (21.0%) were the dysfunctions most frequently reported by women. In men, premature ejaculation (23%) and excessive sexual needs (16.3%) were most prevalent.

parenting practices have been shown to play an important role in the development of a child’s emotional, cognitive and social functioning, it is important to reliably measure this construct across various cultures and countries. A widely used instrument to assess parenting practices is the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire (APQ). However, no previous studies have verified the five-factor structure of this measure using confirmatory factor analysis. The aim of this study was to verify factor structure and examine psychometric properties of the Parent Global Report version of the APQ in a Polish sample. A total of 911 mothers and 497 fathers of children in the age range of 6–13 years from the community sample completed the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire as well as the Rating Scales for Parents assessing symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the five-factor model is characterized by a good fit in the Polish sample of mothers and quite a good fit in the sample of fathers. The Polish version of the APQ has a good construct validity. Children’s ODD symptoms were positively correlated with negative parenting practices and negatively with positive parenting practices. Children’s ADHD symptoms were the most strongly correlated with the inconsistent discipline subscale. Relations between ADHD and ODD symptoms and positive parenting practices were lower than with negative parenting practices.

This education aims to modify patient behaviour in order to reduce relevant risk factors and improve self-control and adherence to medications. The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between readiness for discharge from hospital and adherence to treatment at follow-up in MI patients.\r\nMethods:\r\nAn observational, single-center, MI cohort study with  6-month follow-up was conducted between May 2015 and July 2016.  The Readiness for Hospital Discharge after Myocardial Infarction Scale (RHD-MIS) and the Adherence in Chronic Diseases Scale (ACDS) were applied.\r\nResults:\r\nTwo hundred and thirteen patients aged 30–91 years (62.91 ± 11.26) were enrolled in the study. The RHD-MIS general score ranged from 29 to 69 points (51.16 ± 9.87).   A high level of readiness was found in 66 patients (31%), intermediate in 92 (43.2%), and low in 55 (25.8%) of patients. Adherence level assessed with the ACDS 6-months after discharge from hospital ranged from 7 to 28 points (23.34 ± 4.06). An increase in objective assessment of patient knowledge according to RHD-MIS subscale resulted in significantly higher level of adherence at the follow-up visit (p = 0.0154); R Spearman = 0.16671, p = 0.015; p for trend = 0.005. During the 6-month follow-up 3 (1.41%) patients died and 17 (7.98%) were hospitalized for a subsequent acute coronary syndrome.\r\nConclusions:\r\nThis study provided preliminary evidence of a long-term association between the results of assessment of readiness for discharge from hospital and adherence to treatment in patients after

W artykule podjęto tematykę dotyczącą zarządzania płynnością finansową w grupie kapitałowej. Potrzeba zarządzania płynnością finansową w przedsiębiorstwie wynika z tego, że posiadanie płynność finansowej jest niezbędne dla zapewnienia ciągłości działania jednostki gospodarczej. Jednocześnie utrzymanie określonego poziomu płynności finansowej w przedsiębiorstwie wiąże się z koniecznością posiadania pewnego poziomu środków pieniężnych, aby bezproblemowo móc regulować bieżące zobowiązania finansowe. Kwestia zapewnienia płynności finansowej dotyczy zarówno dużych jak i małych przedsiębiorstw, gdzie w przypadku złożonych struktur organizacyjnych, których przykładem są grupy kapitałowe, zarządzanie płynnością finansową jest znacznie trudniejsze.\r\nTym samym problem badawczy przedstawiony w artykule odnosi się do przedsiębiorstw funkcjonujących jako grupy kapitałowe, zaś cel opracowania obejmuje analizę i ocenę wykorzystania struktury cash poolingu w zarządzaniu płynnością finansową na przykładzie grup kapitałowych - spółek niefinansowych notowanych w indeksie WIG20 na GPW w Warszawie.\r\nMetoda. W opracowaniu zastosowano jako metody badawcze analizę literatury przedmiotu, jej krytyczną analizę, a także metodę deskryptywną oraz wnioskowania logicznego.\r\nWyniki. Na podstawie uzyskanych wyników badań można zauważyć, że spółki niefinansowe wchodzące w zakres WIG20 notowane na GPW w Warszawie będące grupami kapitałowymi często wykorzystują strukturę cash pooling w zarządzaniu płynnością finansową, która pozwala przede wszystkim ograniczyć zapotrzebowanie na zewnętrze środki finansowe, ograniczyć koszty finansowe oraz optymalizować środki pieniężne będące w dyspozycji przedsiębiorstwa."}],"lastRefresh":"1747049778760","journalIssue":{"objectId":"658187704097076c14b78023","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"17","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"320b0519-c8b3-4fdc-81e2-85db751d4f3a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1 - 13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"CASH POOLING AS AN INSTRUMENT OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IN A CAPITAL GROUP"}],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.bg.ug.edu.pl/index.php/wg/article/view/8532","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dd52","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kuciński","uuid":"5E7263069CBA9950B601FB034F768CD910633B68491983662F30D8949304E3EF00E040CABBE0448FD4BBC3ED19FE6E46E8C2E3B47CAAD361683AF1875E07DF4A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8988-8872","documentHash":"b94171d2-300f-46e0-a237-c29a7b91d375"}],"doi":"10.26881/wg.2018.1.01"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["samorząd szkolny","rada rodziców","samorząd uczniowski","edukacja w Polsce","polityka edukacyjna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["school councils","parent council","student council","education in Poland","policy of education"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Decentralization policies concerning leadership of parents and students in school councils in Poland.

To address this aim, a review of the relevant legislation and research work published between 1952 and 2018 has been carried out. Although research into school councils is constantly growing, the policy of education concerning parent and student leadership in Polish context remain unexplored. The paper argues that central to the development of the policy about parent and student leadership in Poland is the evolution from an autocracy after World War II to a democracy within the state monopoly at the present time. The vertical decentralization of decision-making, for example, on financial matters, examinations, school work supervision, is accompanied at the same time by a policy of keeping parent and student leadership in school councils under the control of the Ministry of Education."}],"lastRefresh":"1747049859950","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"21-38","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13603124.2019.1643501","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473adcca","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Leek","uuid":"091D48C4AC46393CA4681FB5247F9CA3B257B154F6EA95F98455622CC3B6E35BDF8116FFC5ACD1625C8CFB5CEEF972EB98024A4575980D035729135D66D4DCFC","orcidId":"0000-0003-1529-4454","documentHash":"f299fff1-d349-446b-ad6d-46f7f7985a59"}],"doi":"10.1080/13603124.2019.1643501"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Psychologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7e6a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Vulnerable and grandiose narcissism in adolescence: Associations with anger and hostility","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778c8","mniswId":"4801","title":"CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY","doi":null,"issn":"1046-1310","eissn":"1936-4733","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"7448a1e0-660e-4699-bddb-e17a763b6112"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5ec007baad49b31ccedb549a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ec007baad49b31ccedb549e","5e70935b878c28a0473a7e6a","5f51bd93752340073806a8fc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747049869051","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"146–154","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12144-019-00556-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f51bd93752340073806a8fc","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Maciantowicz","uuid":"96CE445CE1880A4533D98551417BBEC7E6B56DCBC104247F2E18DEFAE302ADC8928AE972139B9397A1C2D21684D3EF26AC069FDF394E05812ED55C900CC8B545","orcidId":"0000-0002-3099-5956","documentHash":"1b2d19c3-80b4-4349-8b39-754e7f21381a"},{"objectId":"5ec007baad49b31ccedb549e","name":"Sander","lastName":"Thomaes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ce13ccb-81b3-4c7a-b3f5-b78a7a9de140"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7e6a","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Zajenkowski","uuid":"49F78D50AD761310AADEC05EA8688C770410D7034F1FA53CCE5EC888B83B7C9E2AD768767EB5A37EBF54662184237D9B0903881C03FACF0F20F412F44F7AF631","orcidId":"0000-0001-8669-4231","documentHash":"3cd4a20d-461c-47fe-b36b-fa8e75ef7c82"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12144-019-00556-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Coal","Coal-fired plants","Fly ash","Unbured carbon"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","uid":"bDVT6eE951oVevqx9vwsANA","uuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","parentUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","rootUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","name":"Główny Instytut Górnictwa -

Although this is an area rich in aquatic and wetland habitats, its odonate fauna has hitherto been very little studied. Along with a few single records from July 2020 and May 2022, the authors discuss the results of this fieldwork, which yielded 42 species at 15 sites. The most interesting ones from the environmental conservation, faunistic and zoogeographic standpoints were Aeshna juncea, Anax parthenope, Ophiogomphus cecilia, Cordulegaster boltonii, Libellula fulva, Orthetrum coerulescens, Leucorrhinia dubia and L. pectoralis. Three earlier publications relating to this area contain information on 12 species, so together with the new data from the present fieldwork, the total number of species recorded there is now 44 (59.5% of the Polish odonate fauna). Given the landscape park’s location and the diversity of its habitats, one can expect at least 54-55 species to occur there. The park is ecologically valuable as regards the species richness and diversity of its dragonflies, but more detailed research is needed in order to enhance the conservation of these insects. In addition, the occurrence and ecology of some species and species assemblages should be further investigated, especially in the streams, small water bodies, fishponds and peatbogs, which are the most valuable habitats. The impact of drought on these insects also needs to be assessed: this is a matter of particular concern in the case of streams."}],"lastRefresh":"1747050008032","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Dragonflies

article is based on an observation that there are significant and non-arbitrary similarities between two, seemingly quite distant, theories that address the problem of linguistic categorization. One is the theory of open texture put forward by a prominent legal philosopher, Herbert L.A Hart. The other is the theory of prototypes, originated from psychological research by Eleanor Rosch and developed by cognitively- oriented linguists, most notably Charles Fillmore, George Lakoff, and Ronald Langacker. Firstly, the origins of the open texture theory are presented, including the discussion of Friedrich Waismann’s and Ludwig Wittgenstein’s ideas and their impact on Hart’s theory. Secondly, Hart’s theory of open texture is examined, based on several articles and his masterpiece: The Concept of Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press 1961). Thirdly, a brief introduction to the prototype theory is provided, focusing on its reception in Cognitive Linguistics. Fourthly, a comparison of both theories is presented, including a sketch of a broader philosophical and historical background, as well as a detailed analysis of similarities and dissimilarities between them. The comparison results in a conclusion that, on linguistic grounds, the open texture theory can be viewed as an anticipation of prototype theory. Finally, several reservations are made in order to avoid possible confusions and some obvious objections."}],"lastRefresh":"1747050608765","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"409-430","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11196-020-09722-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ff878c28a0473a0ba7","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Zeifert","uuid":"89B579938D26C07B0423FD3D167B907207EA1E3509C8FD2FF8B0A0D518C9EB66877E98F9AE6EA4382A9CBAB51C8445D8D7593321FA5CFBF14045678CD680D060","orcidId":"0000-0003-3266-3397","documentHash":"9f27f42a-4de9-4bee-95a6-11041552a9c0"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11196-020-09722-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["psychotherapy","Consensual nonmonogamy","polyamory","swinging","attitudes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7f70"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"They must be sick: consensual nonmonogamy through the eyes of psychotherapists","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479710","mniswId":"18412","title":"Sexual and Relationship Therapy","doi":null,"issn":"1468-1994","eissn":"1468-1749","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"42adbe2f-282e-4c11-80d7-498637412c5c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5eeb124fad49b36a161bfddc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7f70","63aeae70409707109b9fd593"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study examined current and prospective psychotherapists’ attitudes toward different relationship types (monogamy, polyamory, swinging, and cheating). The sample consisted of 324 participants who were presented with hypothetical vignettes of couples involved in each type of relationship and seeking the help of a psychologist due to symptoms of depressive disorders, alcohol abuse, erectile dysfunction, or marital conflicts. The participants rated relationship satisfaction, the morality-, and competence-related abilities of the clients, hypothesized about the source and possible solutions to the problem, and assessed the possibility of finding a therapeutic solution. People in nonmonogamous relationships were rated lower than monogamous ones on scales related to relationship satisfaction, morality, and cognitive abilities. Moreover, the participants often associated the source of nonmonogamous clients’ problems with their lack of sexual exclusivity, while the source of problems in the case of monogamous clients was usually assessed as being unrelated to any aspects of the relationship. A qualitative analysis of the hypotheses and solutions points to strong pathologization of consensual nonmonogamy: it was assumed harmful to the relationship, and people who engage in it were attributed numerous psychologically negative qualities. A distinct tendency to persuade clients to stop pursuing the open relationship format was also visible.

The most significant difference between the two groups pertained to the average time of foramen ovale restriction diagnosis which was\r\n33 weeks for survivors and 28 weeks for nonsurvivors (p ¼ .0416) and the duration of in-utero restriction (9 versus 5 weeks, p ¼ .0213).

(2) Ratio of forward pulmonary vein flow to reverse flow (f/r) expressed as a velocitytime integral (VTI) is a good emergent intervention predictor, but it does not correlate with foramen ovale size and maximal velocity, nor does it influence survival rates.

This paper therefore revisits the processes whereby the state firms of post-communist economies underwent organisational transformation; and sheds light on the non-linear nature of its subject’s development process, unfolding in the context of radical institutional change."}],"lastRefresh":"1747050699736","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"755-780","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00076791.2020.1743689","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7ea2","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Wąsowska","uuid":"9BE1CC665674E82679F6AE067AF9F06B8F0BFC1C9E8FB50EB2AE3A1AB896652281EFB93490E4B869216D118306F08A057EA1C96D061640D42D0DE1C0D8F21832","orcidId":"0000-0003-3489-077X","documentHash":"bc566a05-4500-4729-a4b5-b16c210593b9"}],"doi":"10.1080/00076791.2020.1743689"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["oddolne innowacje społeczne","produktowe innowacje społeczne","procesowe innowacje społeczne","NGOs","problemy społeczne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["grassroots social innovations","product-oriented social innovations","process-oriented social innovations","NGOs","social issues"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The implementation of grassroots product-oriented social innovations by non-governmental organisations: proposal of a measurement tool","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780f2","mniswId":"8381","title":"Innovation","doi":null,"issn":"1351-1610","eissn":"1469-8412","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"441a68c9-a308-423d-9b44-1ca04343ef73"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5f4439ad2467f04fd54fe5b6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70939e878c28a0473ade0d","5e70934d878c28a0473a6c64","5e709292878c28a0473983c0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this article is to present a tool for measuring the implementation of grassroots product-oriented social innovations by non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

studies have shown that money priming changes adults’ behavior and self-esteem, making them become more congruent with market mode. Money priming has also been seen to change behavior in children who have yet develop a complete understanding of its instrumental functions. Since money’s association with markets changes people’s behavior even in childhood, it is possible that its links and ties to self-esteem are forged at an early stage in life. The studies presented in this article aimed to verify how money priming affects various types of self-evaluations made by children. Two experimental studies were conducted. A total of 83 children aged 8–10 years took part in the first study, while 103 children aged 4–6 years took part in the second study. The results demonstrate that priming with money may change some, but not all, of children’s self-evaluations. Subsequent to money priming, children’s self-evaluations became more congruent with market mode: under the influence of money priming, children’s self-evaluations increased in domains involving perceived competences (associated with feelings of agency), but did not increase in domains related to social relationships."}],"lastRefresh":"1747050740252","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e52f942467f0034f088c10","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"69ac8e70-f872-4b5d-8198-3cc8eaffdc31"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"2334–2345","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12144-020-00736-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b54f3","name":"Agata","lastName":"Trzcińska","uuid":"C97175D1B5EC5AE05F9525A8E8FE3C7955CE9225017CBAF8100F607966F317051EABBD135F59BEEE99E53AFBF69477B554298E6CA67490C757368D95B67A6F1D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6640-5295","documentHash":"39d505ab-ac78-4f98-9f54-708e5364b0c2"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12144-020-00736-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sexual dimorphism in the level of special coordination ability of swimmers of the Sports Championships Schools","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c87d","mniswId":"11369","title":"Journal of Human Sport and Exercise","doi":null,"issn":"1988-5202","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"dd1ab005-f204-4f45-9c98-aa4d8470e908"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5f87ff902467f013ef718e47","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709366878c28a0473a8cbe","602f38b29543c7410626f214","5e70925b878c28a0473944ed"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747050754477","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"136-144","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/108468/6/JHSE_17-1_13.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f38b29543c7410626f214","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rydzik","uuid":"7BC83EC239014B976A213F19148CF6C5F85A2B1C40FA62D319D85D46088D1BD14009AF92F8705865303A93F80F9D369252B2FC56337AE25CC0FC5026D5E60874","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4ca4844-2678-4673-b7b6-88faffce0f21"},{"objectId":"5e709366878c28a0473a8cbe","name":"Paweł","lastName":"STELMACH","uuid":"B714E24E0864AE0092D11ADCFB5986FAFDD03EEC38D406BE6D5110F9E85F3B26C5C2B99DB5AA34210CE27AC26C1102BBD08E26A40180F4DDF60AF5DCCB493BBD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3460-6732","documentHash":"787ee49b-834c-4432-a834-109342ef82ff"},{"objectId":"5e70925b878c28a0473944ed","name":"TADEUSZ","lastName":"AMBROŻY","uuid":"B4D2982C5A50E6C95A7D48137E743EA9E41C3361F3700C705F2A5B5C0301AFC0040F75003E0EC8CB8DC072B632C844CD81D06BBA332C53666E658B5AE9046341","orcidId":"0000-0001-7361-9478","documentHash":"05ff181a-e409-44f0-bd9e-0210d7d6fef7"}],"doi":"10.14198/jhse.2022.171.13"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["International Baccalaureate","Polska","funkcje kształcenia","polityka i praktyka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["International Baccalaureate","Poland","Primary Years Programme","Middle Years Programme","Diploma Programme","International Baccalaureate curriculum"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"From educational experiment to an alternative to the national programme.

This difference has an impact on how referentiality is rendered in both languages. In this article, the authors investigate the use of referential markers by Polish–English bilingual children and Polish monolingual children. Using the LITMUS-MAIN picture stories, the authors collected speech samples of Polish–English bilinguals raised in the UK ( n = 92, mean age 5;7) and compared them with matched Polish monolinguals ( n = 92, mean age 5;7). The analyses revealed that the bilinguals’ mean length of utterance (MLU) in Polish was significantly higher than that of the monolinguals because the bilinguals produced significantly more referential markers (especially pronouns) which inflated their MLU. The authors posit that the non-standard referentiality used by the bilinguals in Polish is caused by cross-language transfer at the syntax–pragmatics interface. When producing narratives in Polish, Polish–English bilinguals overuse referential markers as cohesive devices in their stories, which is not ungrammatical, but pragmatically odd in Polish. Bilinguals tend to do this because they are immersed in English-language input, rich in overt pronouns. Thus, in the process of realizing the surface features of the Polish DP they partly rely on an underlying English DP structure. </jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747050760955","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"191-215","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0142723720933769","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66150cd64097076263984666","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Haman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"28f8edc4-7ca2-4e6e-b55f-f54343e01dd0"},{"objectId":"66150cd64097076263984665","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Wodniecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c5944b3-305d-4508-b849-80081279fae1"},{"objectId":"66150cd64097076263984664","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Mieszkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a9eec76e-1ffc-4f17-be75-047e2c30c669"},{"objectId":"66150cd64097076263984663","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Opacki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"329533a2-6707-4146-83c1-b29e3c07bf51"},{"objectId":"66150cd64097076263984662","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Otwinowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a2959c5-b7bd-4f36-bf2a-9ceb39ddaa7b"},{"objectId":"5e709315878c28a0473a2849","name":"Marta","lastName":"Białecka","uuid":"37DA68ADE82E14C05B75EBA9A781D84B3D55C191DDD30FDE704B3E5CA9B4235390C9E31744917621D58567244DAB05E9AF26329B945400AD9A5BFAF8BB91A620","orcidId":"0000-0002-0909-7123","documentHash":"adfff2ac-25da-4aab-a298-2a7c5af9bfae"}],"doi":"10.1177/0142723720933769"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["region przygraniczny","współpraca transgraniczna","Unia Europejska"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Border regions","cross-border cooperation","European Union"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Integration of Border Regions in the European Union: A Model Approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c71c","mniswId":"10347","title":"Journal of Borderlands Studies","doi":null,"issn":"0886-5655","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b2257d04-fc68-45c1-8f19-6c6c4c617f81"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5fa98fcc2467f06884ce9e42","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709469878c28a0473bc64f"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study analyzes the problems related to the integration of border regions in the EU. Existing literature on the subject presents a range of models that specify different types of border regions based on the intensity of their interactions and accounting for the causes of their development. It has been suggested that these models may help in evaluating the intensity of cross-border interaction, but such assumptions have not been empirically verified. Moreover, most of the presented models also fail to fully account for integration processes in the EU. Thus, the stages of cross-border integration defined in the literature seem insufficient. The current paper proposes a five-category model for border regions, listing the stages of integration between them: from regions that demonstrate no interaction whatsoever, to cross-border regions – covering at least two border regions – with the most intense interaction. The model has been empirically verified on the basis of selected Polish-German pairs of cities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747050776619","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"575-597","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08865655.2020.1816201","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc64f","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Wróblewski","uuid":"907702737B0B84BEF7D78F087049507D4FF504681BD64938C5E5292CBDD88AE35D1CFE791028D4BFAB607D7C8EEEED95057CE17D8115E6F0B15396343B1DE186","orcidId":"0000-0003-3677-043X","documentHash":"435d0ab5-f275-41ab-a6b9-a74bdcb6fa3d"}],"doi":"10.1080/08865655.2020.1816201"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["bezpieczeństwo","zagrożenie","poczucie bezpieczeństwa","\thistoria bezpieczeństwa","teoria bezpieczewństwa"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"659fe2b840970707a12f17f7","doi":null,"title":"Bezpieczeństwo publiczne","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7614-580-8","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://slownikispoleczne.ignatianum.edu.pl/index.php/ss/catalog/series/bezpieczenstwo_publiczne","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"9c0702c1-8464-4e73-bbdd-6a87982467fa","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb774","mniswId":"10900","name":"Akademia Ignatianum w Krakowie","documentHash":"86e8e2a9-9890-472e-b598-0912d192645f"},"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2023-11-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null}},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","uid":"bXY_DMagKuf8Wt0-tVB5Guw","uuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","parentUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","rootUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","name":"Uniwersytet Ignatianum w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709450878c28a0473ba381"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Bezpieczeństwo","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5fb379e12467f03b1f9de550","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709450878c28a0473ba381"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"&lt;div class=&quot;value&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEFINICJA POJĘCIA:&lt;/strong&gt; Bezpieczeństwo oznacza stan braku zagrożenia gwarantujący pewność istnienia i zachowania własnych wartości oraz możliwość realizacji własnych celów.

major premise of the study is a recognition that competitive companies increasingly engage consumers to create business innovation. This study aims to develop a framework for analyzing consumer engagement in business process innovation and apply this framework to ICT companies in Poland and the UK to analyze how they practice consumer engagement and what differences are exhibited between the two countries. It reports on 48 case studies where data were gathered through online observation, a qualitative analysis of collected data was undertaken, and data were analyzed by applying descriptive statistics and Chi-Square test. The suggested framework deals with four key aspects of consumer engagement in business process innovation, i.e., types and ways of consumer engagement, extrinsic incentives, and ICT supporting consumer engagement. This study advances the academic research on consumer engagement and provides a blueprint for ICT companies to design and improve their consumer engagement activities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747050819216","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d123aa40970711f8fb4761","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"62","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"e96bc9de-c183-4ec2-bb52-6e12c53de7bf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"302-315","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08874417.2020.1808865","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc4f2ef2467f06a58d26818","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Dettmer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e62959e9-9f26-423f-bc07-494473947e3a"},{"objectId":"5fc4f2ef2467f06a58d26817","name":"Roisin","lastName":"Mullins","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa557c45-0e41-48cf-a7b9-4cda7a02f900"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b8523","name":"Monika","lastName":"Eisenbardt","uuid":"495BD99A780792B3D08FED9FA54BAEED977BE592995F3E775C5E498C4E2BB5833F89BA60D509865BD4BB6154F7D9605EA3FA851CD356FD361187AD480D798A01","orcidId":"0000-0002-1133-0537","documentHash":"34ac8d58-2e02-46cc-bae5-fd3410fb957f"},{"objectId":"5e70920f878c28a04738f433","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ziemba","uuid":"084DC5EDDAA0018F7EEF800F4A0B0681D250890C144E6890E14A25A621F1D4294E3701DED8AC934090207B5F4BE7437D499496228D5982E04D6DC7F31BB907EA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1084-7497","documentHash":"31d03225-1e1c-46a3-ac70-7e640eff8463"}],"doi":"10.1080/08874417.2020.1808865"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cross-linguistic influence","subject placement","L3 acquisition","acceptability judgment"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","uid":"bc81RPyqL4Br7M4bOIzt-xA","uuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","parentUuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","rootUuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","name":"Akademia Ekonomiczno-Humanistyczna w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936c878c28a0473a9423"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1c","uid":"bN_sGtk59Mu8he_1_j8Q2_w","uuid":"32b4c316-a7d1-4895-bf12-88600ca349bd","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Neofilologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709459878c28a0473bb054","5e709358878c28a0473a7ad4"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709459878c28a0473bb054","5e709358878c28a0473a7ad4"]},{"id":"5ebe69927523400e6539056d","uid":"blVDuJOk6A6u3pTqHSm933g","uuid":"e5987d03-e105-4a42-a8ff-37151725b101","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","name":"Instytut Językoznawstwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3e1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cross-linguistic influences, language proficiency and metalinguistic knowledge in L3 Italian subject placement","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547ae2e","mniswId":"9162","title":"International Journal of Multilingualism","doi":null,"issn":"1479-0718","eissn":"1747-7530","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6f2186a-fc13-42ad-a4c9-cd713fe242e3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5f7ac3e72467f05f867a5bd7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70936c878c28a0473a9423","5e70947c878c28a0473be3e1","5e709459878c28a0473bb054","5e709358878c28a0473a7ad4"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"L3 acquisition is influenced by L1-L3 typology, learners’ proficiency in those languages, and metalinguistic knowledge.

Salt stress does not cause macronutrient deficiency in the leaves of urban trees. Ionic imbalance in the leaves caused by soil salinity worsens the health status of sensitive species. Abstract: Street trees are exposed to relatively high stress levels, and the average lifespan of street trees is shortened compared to those of trees living under controlled natural conditions. Soil salinity adversely affects trees at all stages of growth and development. This study attempts to determine how the urban environment, with particular emphasis on salt stress, affects tree species with different levels of salinity sensitivity. The aim of this study was to identify the strategies of eight tree species for mitigating salt stress based on the determination of the chemical composition of the macroelements in the leaves, the ionic imbalance, and the ability of the trees to synthesize and accumulate polyprenols in the leaves. The obtained results suggest that individual species implemented different strategies in response to salt stress. The low sensitivity species: Q. rubra, R. pseudoacacia, G. triacanthos and A. campestre. blocked the uptake of Cl and Na to the leaves. The medium-sensitivity species: P. x hispanica blocked the uptake of Cl and Na and G. biloba maintained very high contents of Cl and Na in its leaves without leaf damage and synthesized large amounts of polyprenols. G. triacanthos and A. campestre synthesized large amounts of polyprenols. The high-sensitivity species (T. x euchlora and A. platanoides) exhibited very high contents of Cl and Na in their leaves, which were significantly damaged and had a pronounced ionic imbalance. These effects were not compensated for by the increased synthesis of polyprenols. In conclusion, the accumulation of polyprenols in leaf tissue may be one of the strategies that increase the resistance of plants to salt stress. Plants have many other methods of mitigating salt stress."}],"lastRefresh":"1747050851920","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"36","pagesFromTo":"899–914","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00468-020-02044-0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f8d64912467f00cdd83b0cd","name":"Aneta H.","lastName":"Baczewska-Dąbrowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ca0d8c9-3f2a-4594-843b-b219180d6111"},{"objectId":"5f8d64912467f00cdd83b0cb","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Brągoszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddfda5a7-a2da-4249-bd8f-0735500dce15"},{"objectId":"5e70941a878c28a0473b641c","name":"Adam","lastName":"Jóźwiak","uuid":"4B278E50291E8326A44C4E8F7FC586829184DC8CABDC38A5AED711D8FB6BC06F4A2707BB84E8BB41B72DFF0EE5E05CD70C21FDCC513F06BC54E087954917167D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2ba35e8-8fc4-45fd-b74d-f4b6fa599e79"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fe1","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Chojnacki","uuid":"0F93B291B81764EE62A5C3E11A288D5FE78EEE3044F67CF74017ABC059CB167B7E364B8C0AB695126B9EA9744DBCC4DC36450E25B3CD9CCA72933C416EB7819A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c0de0ce-f44d-45bb-9e0b-7e850daa43d8"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f47","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kula-Świeżewska","uuid":"C4F330896C54362D8E00E45C00851FD7D985F8725EAAA28755436DA724437F9982EF232A3EB03200182480B55DD2A5580FA29B4B7809A9CCDF12EC49C4AB3EDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-3439-8948","documentHash":"e3ba940a-7111-4ba1-b57e-99f84301246f"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941d5","name":"Irena","lastName":"Suwara","uuid":"67E5DC4ACE1456705FF055F979C39B015803DEEEE0ECB94E8791A73FB32855EF6020E291A722E037551CB541D8D8DBBA2A3331A8DFC6EC1018667B9B44C64334","orcidId":"0000-0001-8754-1552","documentHash":"519d6663-4ba2-4cbf-97d4-7fe09e9e4ce0"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941b5","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Gozdowski","uuid":"2ADA9EA7DF267002603A97CF88CDEF61AB807E32BA879885200805C6AC0C3DD6C66FD1D5638F9E4F6F5D235AE1816EE70897E20A90C10A08020A68CB98E1B46D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7365-7607","documentHash":"bdf0462b-f3f6-4518-93b5-ea7e9a59d71c"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941b4","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Gworek","uuid":"CD07A5811B39278AB015C6528FA562CD8FFE27FCB12F33F5FD8FF17EA9411F6631D046C4082D4BD7260E695C986ECAE69B05640953BB58EE97AC1E84B7FD9180","orcidId":"0000-0002-2368-5888","documentHash":"890f6d4d-4f68-4e6d-bb20-4cb0ab35b9f0"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a047394115","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Dmuchowski","uuid":"C53E26D436B1BA66B93ACCBB2E007019404B6AA2DC1B8D1E5A9B550D98A9402CC0689CEDB4E578CEA483F786977024BAFF13124DB5D73BEFF97E1E50B21D6557","orcidId":"0000-0003-0092-365X","documentHash":"139274e2-acf8-4683-91d9-e9bf9b260b4f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00468-020-02044-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["medycyna alternatywna","głodówka","Facebook","komunikacja medialna","edukacja medialna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alternative medicine","hunger strike","Facebook","media communication","media education"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"„Fani głodówek (głodówka lecznicza)”, czyli o amatorskich poglądach na terapię","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a5b5","mniswId":"200026","title":"Świat i Słowo","doi":null,"issn":"1731-3317","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"6a69f7c7-7244-4b46-9038-f1e9a2e13947"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2022-07-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5f89766a2467f02bdcfaf9d3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709261878c28a047394a89"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Therapeutic fasting has a long history.

A group created on Facebook under the name “Fans of hunger (therapeutic hunger)” is of a particular interest. Posts that can be followed here perfectly illustrate the popularity of this alternative method of treatment and the influence of any publications encouraging starvation on its followers. They also show, in many cases,\r\na lack of reflexivity, a strongly emotional and, to a low degree, rational attitude to all information, which is also portrayed by the aversion to official medicine and scientific research. The article points out the approach to starvation of the discussed group of amateurs, most often lacking medical knowledge, and attempts to show that complete trust in unproven and insufficiently documented methods of treatment, following current fads in an unreflective manner and without checking their possible real effects, may even have a tragic end."}],"lastRefresh":"1747050851925","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"117-139","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a89","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Łeńska-Bąk","uuid":"42271334B5F2819E278A51BAAE6880B680424A54ACED7093772BF45594783B2D1E3716030BFD4DABB4AC330320BC6CBC1E7C48FA9BD7496161AA5D06B8A7FCC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3751-7957","documentHash":"28a97241-a3a7-4798-b20c-ace5213ea2a7"}],"doi":"10.53052/17313317.2022.09"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cardiovascular diseases","metabolic crisis","population-based screening","biobanking"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The study involved 507 people in the age range 20–64 years, including 257 women and 250 men. Variables were measured using the following methods: Znajmiecka-Sikora’s questionnaire of attitudes towards safety (PwB), Zaleśkiewicz’s questionnaire of the individual risk perception style (SIRI) and Lipińska-Grobelny and Gorczycka’s scale of masculinity and femininity (SMiK). The obtained results prove that psychological gender significantly differentiates risk perception style and attitudes towards safety. The feminine dimension has been shown to strengthen safe attitudes and minimize risk-taking, while the masculine dimension weakens attitudes towards safety and strengthens risk

Professionals helping victims of violence may be at the risk of STS symptoms development. Both empathy and cognitive processing of trauma seem to be important in this process. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between empathy, cognitive processing of trauma and symptoms of STS in women working with people who have experienced violence trauma. The mediation role of cognitive coping strategies in the relationship between empathy and STS was also checked. A total of 154 female professionals representing three groups (therapists, social workers, and probation officers) were included in the study. The age of the respondents ranged from 26 to 67 years (M = 43.98, SD = 10.83). Three standard measurement tools were included in the study: the modified PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), the Empathic Sensitivity Scale, and the Cognitive Processing of Trauma Scale. Correlational analysis indicated STS to have positive associations (Pearson’s correlation coefficients) with all three aspects of empathy, and three of the five cognitive coping strategies (denial, regret, downward comparison). Mediation analysis performed by the bootstrapping method found strategies of regret and downward comparison to act as mediators in the relationship between STS and empathic concern. The same results were obtained for perspective taking. In addition, the regret and denial strategies mediated the relationship between personal distress and STS. Empathy and cognitive trauma processing may play an important role in STS symptoms development. Preventive programs for professionals helping trauma victims should focus on cognitive processing of trauma and empathy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747050938959","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"12898-12921","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260520976211","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709337878c28a0473a51ba","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Michalska","uuid":"B386226C743F8E78632ABE178BB4B21B4976C06E2042BFC68DCF5F96B131E8A2EA1DDF78A4D382E0A3E8F5347AA4E435E92BE368AAEEF9CBAEAC4E04130D8133","orcidId":"0000-0003-2179-0307","documentHash":"d6c64f80-4d76-465e-a0e4-66b04b2df66d"},{"objectId":"5e709289878c28a0473977ed","name":"Janina","lastName":"Ogińska-Bulik","uuid":"F852D0306DFF47516D5A253C245F9BAA31D47BA41711AE32979083824307EEAB8DBFB817CB697616E26D89DC793F844AFB7A6FA792A07BFE40CF7566EC7FAFCE","orcidId":"0000-0001-8868-407X","documentHash":"a540c636-ffb5-4840-a5b8-e4587c2c6d7e"},{"objectId":"5e70920f878c28a04738f478","name":"Zygfryd","lastName":"Juczyński","uuid":"879F683888CE9F87BDC3FE6727BF9F5548F3D133081856B4BF222BF87BF79A6167FF303550419E239FB2198E2A0ACB3BC544CCFA67CF475387F80512BA083B6B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2794-9254","documentHash":"5d227c7b-f244-4f98-8491-6da8a5fb88db"}],"doi":"10.1177/0886260520976211"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

Cell cultures are commonly undertaken by research models before animal testing. They are the basis for the development of new diagnostic and cancer treatments. It should be emphasized that basic research is a strong foundation for any therapy introduced. This chapter provides an overview of the modern cell culture techniques that are currently developing, which allow the introduction of modern models that reflect the organs and physiological system.

chapter considers the impact of anthropology on legal thought and practice in relation to cultural rights and cultural heritage at the global level. It examines the mainstreaming of cultural heritage and cultural rights by analysing the normative and operational activities of the international community through its institutions and instruments of global governance. The author argues that the impact of anthropology on the global regime of cultural rights and cultural heritage consists in the employment of anthropological knowledge and expertise in the practical operationalization of culture in international law and policy. In this regard, the chapter delves into the nature and consequences of this employment in relation to the two core aspects: the rhetorical and conceptual evolution of the notion of cultural heritage in international law, and the rise of cultural rights as collective rights. Accordingly, it scrutinizes various stages of the heritigization and anthropologization of both international human rights law and international cultural heritage law from the end of the Second World War to the present. The chapter concludes with an evaluation of the current legal avenues for addressing global challenges in the domains of cultural heritage and cultural rights, which points to the pressing need for more efficient modalities of global solidarity"}],"lastRefresh":"1747051015142","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"475-492","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198840534.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198840534-e-29","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1c","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jakubowski","uuid":"D177EF777E631E7F8E90CDC2360D779483F870C4D0D808BC7C9713A8889BB658A5D303CAC436A150F8F43DB541F2C1A08DFB1449F44DE1EAD5D8D0AAD4C4BD78","orcidId":"0000-0002-4914-7068","documentHash":"829cc1dc-579f-4884-9361-d57293273339"}],"doi":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198840534.013.29"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70945e878c28a0473bb8ce","5e709217878c28a04738fd42","602e13159543c7410626ebc5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A search step optimization in an ambiguity function-based GNSS precise positioning","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989b","mniswId":"19170","title":"SURVEY REVIEW","doi":null,"issn":"0039-6265","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"0bcc2d71-898e-4a54-aeaa-2cf0e9a4bd42"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"602e24312467f023e6eb4536","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709217878c28a04738fd42","5e70945e878c28a0473bb8ce","602e13159543c7410626ebc5"]},"issue":"383","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747051021455","journalIssue":{"objectId":"648adad9409707349d31fb9c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"54","number":"383","doi":"","documentHash":"7dff3537-c35a-40c6-9ab3-ae495a3d4a0b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"117-124","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00396265.2021.1885947","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602e13159543c7410626ebc5","name":"Artur","lastName":"Fischer","uuid":"4D5C370A1D3E78CDAF14D2E60D364C56545B949341761E0EDD9364532208B41691A5D325C6F56EE5A681293ACA3932A1FF7787C268F418C06B24FFA09E79D1C8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4093-6773","documentHash":"e4ee1ecd-8cf7-4f07-9eae-18f6a2d48e43"},{"objectId":"5e70945e878c28a0473bb8ce","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nowel","uuid":"77AF809D87E775D4C95FA02FCA7501C5993642CDC35F1FD491FDB0192741476E27F76E4935CBECF4F1BADDDCB3CB111034E8E7F28E736EB14F8ECD7843E6B047","orcidId":"0000-0001-5593-2428","documentHash":"a698cb50-d066-49f6-b330-defcf4b73fb5"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fd42","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Cellmer","uuid":"2F815BEEE75990BA38E86FFE026E5C410DF564E6BD4016290A04A2A49AE52751F311DE9A6745136052CD51605FBE21DE1C49D4A039C9D504D6CAFB15328391F8","orcidId":"0000-0002-2614-8017","documentHash":"f1e13a64-7b79-434b-98ac-9f74f54a4e9d"}],"doi":"10.1080/00396265.2021.1885947"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65aa59e84097071977e4c43b","doi":null,"title":"Encyclopedia of Smart Materials","year":2022,"volume":"5","isbn":"978-0-12-815733-6","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780128157336/encyclopedia-of-smart-materials","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"1f6eaf65-36ef-4c61-9fad-da648ba6eda0","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7dc","mniswId":"22600","name":"Elsevier","documentHash":"159aa552-a0f4-4616-8a63-8488cd70979f"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

The neural model was developed with multi-layer perceptron topology. Input variables were expressed in 46 image descriptors based on RGB, YCbCr, HSV (B) and HSL models. Sensitivity analysis of input variables and principal component analysis determined the significance level of each attribute. The optimal model with the lowest error value root mean square, at the level of 0.04 contained 46 neurons in the input layer, 11 neurons in the hidden layer, 10 neurons in the output layer.

These new conditions changes may mismatch plant phenology from weather conditions, and affect the growing period of trees. Understanding the processes of local adaptation in bud phenology can help to predict the response of plants to these rapid and unexpected environmental changes.\r\n    Our study monitored bud burst and bud set weekly during four growing seasons in black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.] saplings planted in a common garden and originating from five provenances representing the whole latitudinal distribution of the closed boreal forest in Quebec, Canada. We compared the variance in bud phenology among populations and years, and analysed the relationships with temperatures at the origin sites.\r\n    Bud burst and bud set occurred in mid-May and mid-July, respectively, with a large variability among provenances and between the study years. A delayed bud phenology was observed in the provenances from warmer sites, with bud burst and bud set being 1.1 and 1.4 days later for every additional degree in mean annual temperature at the origin site respectively. Populations with earlier bud bursts also showed earlier bud sets, thus the growing season was similar among provenances. The heritability of bud set was higher than that of bud burst, with estimates of 0.26 and 0.21 respectively. On average, variance in bud phenology among provenances reached 5.3%, which was higher than that within provenances (2.6%). The factor year explained 37.7%–69.7% of the variance in bud phenology.\r\n    Synthesis. The findings demonstrate the evolutionary response to climate variations in the boreal biome. Endogenous and environmental components have different effects on the phases of bud burst and bud set. This complex interaction among drivers of bud phenology may prevent reliable predictions of changes in the growing season under changing climate. An earlier growth reactivation due to higher spring temperatures could result in higher frost risks to the developing buds. Despite a longer period for photosynthesis expected for the evergreen black spruce under warmer conditions, the period spent for bud development could remain unchanged.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747051060483","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"110","pagesFromTo":"1043-1053","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66052eaf40970762633513f0","name":"Sergio","lastName":"Rossi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e7619ae-d7c0-4943-a601-0fad8b7fdb4a"},{"objectId":"66052eaf40970762633513ef","name":"Jianguo","lastName":"Huang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d01e8f4-9884-4446-a907-824568fb506b"},{"objectId":"66052eaf40970762633513ee","name":"Evelyn","lastName":"Belien","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a240d62-7c7c-4bcc-9e57-a9bb0c0af6b6"},{"objectId":"66052eaf40970762633513ed","name":"Patrick","lastName":"Faubert","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25491651-c076-4c8e-93f3-a296c41e4324"},{"objectId":"66052eaf40970762633513ec","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Silvestro","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff902df3-f8e5-4855-80d0-a1dd6a41f187"},{"objectId":"66052eaf40970762633513eb","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Klisz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13902de9-2c6c-4f81-9242-f151e5bd7f70"},{"objectId":"66052eaf40970762633513ea","name":"Xiali","lastName":"Guo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8dd78796-c38e-4d97-b9e3-1df2de946a69"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b54c6","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Puchałka","uuid":"24E339D5260CF279C2F97E2F963F562014D9F6D6BEAB51AB3787C5D198B071297F6E3E53BA8B6A2B7E2C137C37DC54419B7C75C1F9C0EBED0524B6279956AAFA","orcidId":"0000-0002-4764-0705","documentHash":"8b647592-679b-4b07-bc00-a27f73876526"}],"doi":"10.1111/1365-2745.13582"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Heat

present paper focuses on the figurative senses of abstract art, which can be rooted in human bodily experiences, interconnections between cognitive domains as well as mental concepts arising from the perception of colour. We take a closer look at the works of art created by, among others, Wassily Kandinsky, Yves Klein, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman and analyse particular uses of colour in search of their deeper meaning expressed beyond the purely material surface. The concepts of physiognomic perception, emotional responses to art, and synaesthesia are briefly discussed as well. However, it is Joseph Grady's theory of primary metaphors which is the main point of reference for the undertaken discussion and interpretation of colour applications and their possible meanings.

aging poses challenges to societies with regard to the provision of care for dependent seniors. One of the spheres broadly discussed in terms of long-term care is housing policy. The focus of this article is the analysis of housing policy in Poland, with respect to demographical changes, and the ever increasing burden aging causes (i.e., problems with seniors’ ability to perform self-care and age in place). The analysis was based on the existing data and the sizable transdisciplinary body of international comparative housing policy literature. The effectiveness of housing policy in the context of care services depends on its integration with the social assistance and health care system and the size of the housing stock, along with the family’s caring

nanotechnology allows obtaining zinc oxide nanomaterials with unique properties that let its use in a wide range of commercial applications. Direct contact with these particles as well as their release into the environment is almost inevitable. This review aims to consider whether the toxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles found in numerous test models is a real threat to humans and plants. Emerging reports indicated both the risks and benefits associated with the use of zinc oxide nanoparticles in a manner dependent on the concentration and a method of synthesis, as well as the tested object. The amounts needed to achieve the antibacterial activity of ZnO-NPs, and the reported amounts of these nanoparticles in consumer products are sufficient to have a negative impact on living organisms. The most sensitive to their action are human cells, and the mechanism of cytotoxicity is mainly associated with the formation of oxidative stress caused by the action of zinc ions. ZnO-NPs in small concentration can have positive affect to plants, but it poses a threat to more sensitive ones."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051149508","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63becabb409707205875622f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"32","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"974bba15-4a1b-4ff6-857b-b67b920f5ed7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"885-901","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09603123.2020.1805415","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"605b14e52467f00fdb6ff785","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Czyżowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3398-4475","documentHash":"bc0c8f87-4bb9-4013-aa1b-01bc89161607"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a0473982cd","name":"Anna","lastName":"Barbasz","uuid":"83B57685912BB4502F97D65BEBCC8693B21F3FF8009819A36471D8FEA5A01A69BB0A108B82267A09D4268FB98EC4C9071091E9339527698FEC296F47412F2D06","orcidId":"0000-0001-5210-2349","documentHash":"bd06f437-716f-49fb-aa47-15bd194a676c"}],"doi":"10.1080/09603123.2020.1805415"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["affiliative memory","assemblage of memory","bieżeństwo","collective memory","participatory theatre","performance","postmemory, refugeedom","refugeedom"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f834","uid":"bGmVoErzdh2lpvOu5neayPA","uuid":"2d6d4cb6-c146-481a-9e8d-b5c137a35b0f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Instytut Socjologii (od 1.10.2019 r.)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a047392303"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"‘I remember little.

Thematically, the project is devoted to the history of the so-called bieżeństwo – a migration of people from eastern Poland during the First World War, forced by the retreating Russian Army, when the Germans broke through the eastern frontline in 1915. The stories of those refugees, among whom were a number of Rus’ peasants, and within that group, women with children (the term bieżenki signifies female war refugees), make up a crucial part of the regional history that has been largely absent from public knowledge and historical discourse. Methodologically, the project is based on participatory theatre that engages non-artists both as content providers, and on-stage performers. Theatrical practice has been used to collect the marginalised memories of bieżeństwo (as they are often kept and transmitted within family circles), and present them to the wider public in the form of theatrical performance. The project has also resulted in a theoretical concept of the assemblage of memory, inspired by and grounded in the creative process, which is briefly sketched out at the end of the article."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051160687","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6225d2592467f0548a01809b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"71fac22c-0524-4f4b-86dd-7d577fcc5a73"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"355–375","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/MSS/current","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392303","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Niziołek","uuid":"6B0A58316DD6523418CE0869AD942129C380E68D6FAC69C23B9F1732F7A28B901E0A9E0248563724765A44EB2E44284A2936A31C71E938BEC7E79E0721CF1A5A","orcidId":"0000-0003-3296-3816","documentHash":"b44fc266-4978-4d19-ba18-23f88b42095f"}],"doi":"10.1177/1750698020982047"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet

the world is struggling with a coronavirus epidemic. People explain diferently the causes and sense of this disease. Old Polish literature about diseases is representative for European thought in the modern era. The problem of the disease appears in old Polish literature in various discourses. The three most important are religious, medical–astrological and social discourse. In this article, I discuss basic paradigms of thinking connected with these discourses and the relationship between them. In the religious discourse, it is God who decides about health and illness. The pathological state of the organism can be both a trial and a punishment for the sinner. The medical and astrological discourse is based on ancient medicine, medieval medicine and astrology. It assumes a close dependence of human health on the balance of the fuids in the body and on the planetary system. The social discourse is dominated by epidemics of infectious diseases. It is a collection of advices for organizing a society during a pandemic."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051165314","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6582b53040970751d8ee6542","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"61","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"de2dcf4e-4327-4cb7-8929-e58cafbc9442"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"3340-3349","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10943-020-01056-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70928c878c28a047397b36","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Krzysztofik","uuid":"56689088F6C639E8D22162658D55C3FB1727C58CD55092E90F938A61B81FC0A45E906DDB2FEE3794D29260787E7D6820565C12A630D9347DFA48C073028697F8","orcidId":"0000-0002-1689-0314","documentHash":"7619b314-8470-40a0-bc13-9c3a6040a37b"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10943-020-01056-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["football","physical activity","distances covered","high intensity","sprints","passes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","uid":"bIVuXx-j3MA3vg5GttGgoow","uuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","parentUuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","rootUuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","name":"Instytut Geografii i Przestrzennego Zagospodarowania im.

The material consisted of 945 observations of 340 players. Analysed: total distances covered [km], distances covered with high-intensity running (20–25 km/h) [m], numbers of sprints, numbers of shots, numbers of passes, pass accuracy [%] and the official ranking of national teams. Three categories of time-zone shift (training centre → match venue) were taken account of, i.e. (1) West→East (WE), (2) Same Zone (SZ) and (3) East→West (EW). Analysis of results revealed that players in the EW and SZ categories were able to achieve results significantly better than those moving WE (total distances covered H = 11.815(2); p = 0.003; numbers of passes H = 7.630(2); p = 0.022), and this in relation to team placings in the end-of-tournament ranking (H = 18.099(2); p = 0.001). The results will be valuable in searching places for training centres during future FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship competitions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051165610","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620b65572467f07b3c5a0d0f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"30","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"b7fabc6b-7908-42b2-a1ff-2e3386dc7cf5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"145-155","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15438627.2020.1853545?journalCode=gspm20","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6062e3a82467f05a448a0d89","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Andrzejewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5127-711X","documentHash":"0f039ae8-8ed4-4b57-86fa-b11f8ad0c26a"},{"objectId":"602e0e2c9543c7410626eb56","name":"Michał","lastName":"Zacharko","uuid":"781CB1A85C6243762C5FAB0BCC95151D686A458CCB7BCA1D03156606EF392C086CB4F90E0A80149D8ABA0F30F83FE5992FB37A15D70965837C1E41AEB6B69C20","orcidId":"0000-0003-3298-3120","documentHash":"3ec152f9-1089-4219-826a-4262e88ed3fb"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00bf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Błażejczyk","uuid":"7F77105A6ADE01FFFE580FE4115AAB7C31C64E4BCF4047EE5AFBDF48B5C74BF3788A848DBFC4A01941DF6F65B021A0CFFCA72E58381239728A8C2987CC75B212","orcidId":"0000-0002-0439-6642","documentHash":"a668b0e7-7155-4283-a95c-a0d6f316ac4b"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398704","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Radzimiński","uuid":"63DF68E56726738DCCF9BB7A50CFD81BD673A9BC8A34955B217D87842813A3F1E50FB7E3934CEE9FFAD445CE87A8EB2258482DB26A2AE2CD6079D1C33C596CAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9802-3731","documentHash":"718610a2-734a-473d-b753-d8a78df39a75"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396aa9","name":"Marek","lastName":"Konefał","uuid":"4BA5942ED8EA1732AAA674B029E1DC04F39690E17D0197DA11F9E554C711B511856B3BA39C0F176F27D1EF56BAF23BDD9140E3F5EB2C45C493080D14A9C15DD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-0918-1683","documentHash":"01409811-ead3-4333-a743-af6e82c66be0"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047395032","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmura","uuid":"EEB7A20FA2D799420F2D762ECA0FE4F2C76A5C0AE01DCC6B10887917579B13BBE82146AFB8882A5EE795A797280B016D22F545AA273D7D035AFC2C58D5F66C86","orcidId":"0000-0002-4211-0393","documentHash":"3751ffcf-6c8d-4629-90da-8b931f5ae1a0"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047395000","name":"Jan","lastName":"Chmura","uuid":"ABE606DE08E7B6D614C0800FFD02FAC143BCB5139BD9EAA7B2090755FCEDA42E79AD67837541ABE9357040329BB6AF9AC6CC22D0D3CD888BD837FC531FF6B4DB","orcidId":"0000-0002-9153-7983","documentHash":"7518f239-57db-482e-8d9f-c54ede0afc99"}],"doi":"10.1080/15438627.2020.1853545"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Anthropology","law","law and anthropology","legal anthropology","legal pluralism","sociolegal studies","interdisciplinary studies"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-0-19-884053-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"The Oxford Handbook of Law and Anthropology","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":978,"publicationPlace":"Oxford","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"602b47e72467f021dbe38ea1","editors":[{"objectId":"649c05544097071386c3f279","name":"Olaf","lastName":"Zenker ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f6cac83-5968-4fce-8948-c8bfde0f2400"},{"objectId":"649c05544097071386c3f278","name":"Maria","lastName":"Sapignoli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf3afbeb-b90a-4bd0-905e-b5a92c4c37fa"},{"objectId":"649c05544097071386c3f277","name":"Mark","lastName":"Goodale","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57fd7e61-e40b-4192-9270-600aa92405b0"},{"objectId":"649c05544097071386c3f276","name":"Marie-Claire","lastName":"Foblets","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"991f6b70-cfac-4699-9f89-4c4c88203c9d"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["649c05544097071386c3f276","649c05544097071386c3f277","649c05544097071386c3f278","649c05544097071386c3f279"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This handbook is currently in development, with individual articles publishing online in advance of print publication.

Each of the chapters in the Handbook provides a survey of the current state of scholarly debate and an argument about the future direction of research in this dynamic and interdisciplinary field. The structure of the Handbook is animated by an overarching collective narrative about how law and anthropology have and should relate to each other as intersecting domains of inquiry that address such fundamental questions as dispute resolution, normative ordering, social organization, and legal, political, and social identity. The need for such a comprehensive project has become even more pressing as lawyers and anthropologists work together in an ever-increasing number of areas, including immigration and asylum processes, international justice forums, cultural heritage certification and monitoring, and the writing of new national constitutions, among many others. The Handbook takes critical stock of these various points of intersection in order to identify and conceptualize the most promising areas of innovation and sociolegal relevance, as well as to acknowledge the points of tension, open questions, and areas for future development"}],"lastRefresh":"1747051168280","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75c","mniswId":"1800","name":"Oxford University Press","documentHash":"271d88b1-5188-4c4a-9b77-7569c26422a0"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198840534.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780198840534","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198840534.001.0001"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["food variety seeking","regulatory focus","food neophobia","psychological safety"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a04739733c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of Regulatory Focus on Food Variety-Seeking Behavior of Chinese Tourists","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478776","mniswId":"11348","title":"Journal of Hospitality & Tourism Research","doi":null,"issn":"1096-3480","eissn":"1557-7554","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"bb92a165-c8c6-4d16-b06a-d929cbc35313"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60672fc52467f074653d7b32","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60672fc52467f074653d7b33","60672fc52467f074653d7b34","60672fc52467f074653d7b35","60672fc52467f074653d7b36","60672fc52467f074653d7b37","5e709285878c28a04739733c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"While limited attention has been paid to personality traits that influence tourists’ variety-seeking behavior with respect to food, evidence shows that Chinese people choose less variety than their counterparts in Western countries. We propose that regulatory focus influences consumers’ food variety-seeking behavior. Building on the theoretical alignment between regulatory focus, food neophobia, and food variety-seeking tendency, this research examines the effect of regulatory focus on Chinese consumers’ food variety-seeking behavior through three studies. Study 1 indicates that prevention-focused consumers have lower food variety-seeking intention than promotion-focused consumers. Study 2 shows that the former have higher food neophobia, leading to lower intention to seek food variety. Food neophobia plays the mediating role. Study 3 examines the moderating role of psychological safety, which can decrease food neophobia’s negative influence on seeking food variety. The results and implications of our findings are presented in the discussion section."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051178488","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cf9b4e4097075010efacd2","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"47","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"51216220-1f6e-4394-a0aa-cccdb366ee80"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"109634802098889, 24 s.","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1096348020988893","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60672fc52467f074653d7b37","name":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a4665e9-988c-4491-b323-e6e3ba995084"},{"objectId":"60672fc52467f074653d7b36","name":"Tai-yang","lastName":"Zhao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"445e99cd-bf47-46cb-8132-3e4379b9c283"},{"objectId":"60672fc52467f074653d7b35","name":"Xiao-tong","lastName":"Jin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2271523-ac8f-4ba6-aa26-54f97d76bfdf"},{"objectId":"60672fc52467f074653d7b34","name":"Feng","lastName":"Yao","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0778-7964","documentHash":"92fbc02d-cda9-46ef-8208-434206d94635"},{"objectId":"60672fc52467f074653d7b33","name":"Hong-jing","lastName":"Cui","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6706-9676","documentHash":"59af04a5-5198-4bd6-baa7-45948c83bba3"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a04739733c","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Smyczek","uuid":"C7B00442D3DD223087C65DCE10C1EC2C0961B98A125C162DB6D25B80504C2190DCB7E1494C14923D17BB60BED646AFF4B5CC446F611A60EBF9E9BFED831EFA4C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4459-2736","documentHash":"a317882d-0edb-4694-808b-82cf59536b55"}],"doi":"10.1177/1096348020988893"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Middle East","Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)","Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)","time series analysis","Governmental policy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","parentUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","rootUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The results reveal a strong increase in NDVI coverage in the Middle East during the study period (R = 0.75, p-value = 0.05). In Egypt, the annual coverage exhibits the strongest positive trend (R = 0.99, p-value = 0.05). In Turkey, both the vegetation coverage and density increased from 2001 to 2019, which can be attributed to the construction of some of the biggest dams in the Middle East, such as the Atatürk and Ilisu dams. Significant increases in the annual coverage and maximum and average NDVI in Saudi Arabia are due to farming in the northern part of the country for which groundwater and desalinated seawater are used. The results of this study suggest that one of the main factors affecting vegetation coverage in the Middle East are governmental policies. These policies could lead to an increase in vegetation coverage in some countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Iran, and

We find that while lower levels of political knowledge are associated with higher levels of populism, it is nevertheless ‘informed populists’ who are more likely to vote for populist parties, while ‘uninformed populists’ are more likely to abstain.

Is the relationship of new parents affected by anxiety, which the literature enlists among the core consequences of an increased risk of developmental disorders and hospitalization in the early stages of their child’s life? The aims of this study were to determining the links between the levels of anxiety, hope and partner communication in parents of premature babies, and investigating the associations between their reported hope and anxiety. The research included 69 parents (46 mothers and 23 fathers) of infants born before 37-week gestation. All children were hospitalized throughout the entire study. The results suggest significant relationships between partner communication and anxiety in the investigated fathers. The higher their level of state anxiety, the less support they were willing to provide to their partners, and the higher their level of trait anxiety, the stronger their tendency to depreciate them.

The experiencing self describes its feelings, needs, and desires, and reveals its own attitudes toward the situation and its circumstances. The narrating self aims to give a detailed account of the event, circumstances and its own actions, without saying much about its emotional state. Seventy-eight Polish women were asked to recount their traumatic experiences and answer questions about how the experience had affected their thinking about themselves and their world-view. The participants narratives were analyzed in terms of the dominance of either the experiencing self or the narrating self, or their possible balance. The participants also filled out questionnaires to measure post-traumatic growth and sense of purpose in life. The qualitative analysis suggested that greater post-traumatic growth was reported by women for whom the experiencing self either dominated in the narratives over the narrating self, or was balanced with the equally developed story of the narrating self. However, the quantitative analysis distinguished only between the experiencing self and narrating self positions, with the former demonstrating greater post-traumatic growth, whereas narratives that balanced both voices were intermediate in the comparison and were not distinguished from the other more pure positions. Taken as a whole, results support the inference that narration from an emotion-focused internal perspective facilitates personal growth in the face of very difficult life events."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051254968","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"699-718","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10720537.2020.1865221","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65f2b4c94097076263d83b29","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wiecheć","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95d1df5a-a4f7-4f20-bd7b-8a01e343aafe"},{"objectId":"65f2b4c94097076263d83b28","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da42ab57-4901-4d03-a7c5-b2e80803b304"},{"objectId":"5e70941f878c28a0473b695e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"0DB218DE281974ADCC037D5F3477F4DFC70F6A761578BDDD64895AE2708F56E39D941434E7077B104CD90E79BCE7A666D581A20258E3A4C2C039BFCA35DF5105","orcidId":"0000-0003-4942-5598","documentHash":"4cb926d4-b4b8-449a-9bcc-f8d9dd536413"}],"doi":"10.1080/10720537.2020.1865221"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["piłka nożna; preferencje; młodzież; Międzynarodowy Kwestionariusz Aktywności Fizycznej IPAQ; INDARES"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"608135d42467f0276870e0c9","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Instytut Nauk o Sporcie, Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

These proteins were immobilised on the surface of activated biocarbon obtained from the horsetail herb precursor. The values of the hydrodynamic radius of both biopolymer macromolecules in the solution were determined by the use of the viscosimetry method. This parameter is important for the specification of the possibility of proteins nano-molecules to penetrate the nano-pores of the adsorbent which leads to the increase of biopolymers adsorption. Such behaviour is observed at the pH value which is very close to the pI value of specific biopolymer (the greatest adsorption of proteins on the activated carbon surface occurs- at pH 5 for OVA being 323 mg/g, as well as at pH 11 for LSZ which is 464 mg/g). Under such conditions, the proteins macromolecules assume conformations characterized by the lowest values of hydrodynamic radius, i.e. 2.76 nm for OVA and 1.07 nm for LSZ. The data obtained from the analysis of gaseous products of thermal decomposition of the samples indicated the types of biocarbon surface groups as well as the enabled specification of the protein macromolecules adsorption mechanism.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747051267372","journalIssue":{"objectId":"612e0b7c2467f011b6e53604","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"72105388-fe46-4478-be9f-dc9a70e4cbb9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1323-1336","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11738-022-03386-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"618353b97523400564d8202e","name":"Marlena ","lastName":"Gęca","uuid":"18A7E7DFEF58594BA6F965A12A3117521CDD19491A0A29FB48920968F7A0F34F8ED0B48DB1EC894FB192D8CE3DE7C1262C4EA32AD84BCDDADC92297BA9E80036","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b5ec6d7-85d0-40d3-8806-10acaf7e073d"},{"objectId":"60c308f29543c72336543aac","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Medykowska","uuid":"58F2ED16A9D30DCE9C83C1C35B4A77FE3A4460AE3D4FD22C8A7FCDCC5DFE00C8DB66C40905FAED9E21E056FDAF9A196C4EC88ADE02B2A0A1029697C65EE02920","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"299c2ace-0147-4f95-ad38-e9f231c66eef"},{"objectId":"6048a8122467f07fde74d69b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Nowicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e7c457a-9b37-4071-a0ab-cd9dc8db1e1c"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a66c7","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szewczuk-Karpisz","uuid":"CECD106609F0BBAB1722ACD8B7A9A61340A3FB4210622A8338CC16EF7655907344554D3FC11DE2A9D4F39AA13F7AF0E38AC97A7D6669C32A408EF07BCCA84E05","orcidId":"0000-0002-8682-3491","documentHash":"68b9ee28-aa0c-47da-8c8c-513e1f9759b7"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ee","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Sternik","uuid":"DC097C64F23520925824CA44B2EA010375A53BA9CF73B7F1B6176FD0DA4F2D6F08C9429B48625C906F10378EF80E5971FBECBD98A0086F778DFE2BEF44C8B180","orcidId":"0000-0002-3063-7542","documentHash":"aacfa026-a5b4-453c-9bf0-74c955ca4631"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00b4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wiśniewska","uuid":"2DF4CC491F626BD1CD8F560E01027C2F6A453AF6547F520BD1B38A0881FC857BB636AF42C44010AB6A850008F1B48C2B3FA6D6A190743BC9949FB05DF03B1847","orcidId":"0000-0003-4003-9877","documentHash":"e6694d39-5f77-436d-a2a8-8b9942fdd7e6"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00ad","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Chibowski","uuid":"95F5E2FA6314153AEFF965DDE8EB6D56C3A854695201D0A66EC67A156C397203F49EFC389545D76A4EE1FC196F2A40331B31520FE2A87BBB724C2A96D8522599","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c99cfa3-1ba5-4e94-8722-b63157cc2e6b"}],"doi":"10.1007/s13204-021-01759-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Muscle strength and endurance in high-level rock climbers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547980a","mniswId":"18870","title":"Sports Biomechanics","doi":null,"issn":"1476-3141","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"613b1a2c-6e4b-41f2-ae78-48035ec75abb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"609d1aff2467f05adbc858d7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70932e878c28a0473a476b","609d1aff2467f05adbc858d8","5e70923e878c28a0473924b9","5e709200878c28a04738e620","5e70932c878c28a0473a443d","609d1aff2467f05adbc858d9","609d1aff2467f05adbc858da","5e70928b878c28a0473979a8"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The relative importance of key performance factors is poorly studied in high-level climbers. This study aimed to (1) determine the role of forearm muscle strength and endurance in high-level rock climbing, (2) and provide suitable dynamometric test parameters for muscle endurance assessment in high-level climbers. Six higher elite (redpoint Fr.9a) and eight elite/advanced (redpoint Fr.8a+) climbers performed one finger flexor maximal strength test and three finger endurance tests: a 30 s all-out test and a continuous and intermittent test at 60% of maximal voluntary contraction. Higher elite climbers had higher (p < 0.05) maximal strength, all-out test average force and continuous test force-time integral (all relative to body mass) than the elite/advanced climbers. These parameters correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with climbing performance, which has not been observed so far for continuous test scores. Unlike in previous research, intermittent test force-time integral neither distinguished climbing ability groups nor correlated significantly with climbing performance. Nevertheless, regression models comprising of intermittent and maximal strength test scores more strongly determined climbing performance than models including continuous or all-out test scores. Intermittent muscle endurance is among the performance factors in difficult rock climbing but appears to be less important than maintaining high forces during sustained muscle contractions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051283205","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1057-1072","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14763141.2021.1916577","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"609d1aff2467f05adbc858da","name":"Plamen","lastName":"Trendafilov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a562f24-2a90-4fb8-af52-56d95232ee03"},{"objectId":"609d1aff2467f05adbc858d9","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Draga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c07170dc-688f-431a-8d1d-b950a9061c35"},{"objectId":"609d1aff2467f05adbc858d8","name":"Michail","lastName":"Michailov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7240-9591","documentHash":"276f2fc8-5064-40ce-8d46-1e0c00dd7853"},{"objectId":"5e70932e878c28a0473a476b","name":"Robert","lastName":"Rokowski","uuid":"B9ED4F9EBAA486A9149657710E76C1301E26D8F06FC0D9CC7C3942A47D09D154F9EF8E97E7EBA6E193F911C2D877444DEE98CA552F9001B1453EE2206143D39D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1849-2587","documentHash":"7ba97ddb-853f-4d6f-8f99-8df56ea3af9e"},{"objectId":"5e70932c878c28a0473a443d","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Szymura","uuid":"AC1B1106FC864788B1B68DA0E94DE5FFAB3BFC23C4AC20FB6A1DD28D2ED81B4FDFF017356F338E590001373F64E41A0159B866C9E85EA7801355166FA3029C28","orcidId":"0000-0003-4594-7954","documentHash":"595abd95-cf3d-495c-941c-6b691c5d52c2"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979a8","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Szyguła","uuid":"5FE2CF5AA1EFA44C17853403E1A62E1B9B519269A4D7953F34C109B17DD1AF3A6DD863794E399749895F77FA740C142C12FCB81EF24AE3105FA33185E332AA33","orcidId":"0000-0002-6685-6579","documentHash":"c12def02-1c7c-4c5c-9b92-62d3989bc288"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473924b9","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Maciejczyk","uuid":"E0A224080BCD7374AFB4F40DD8BF9AD7C9DC00CD3E19C1265BF98D64BCB4FD7A191CF96A4DD7A69EE6F156B6910BBB8AEAF01078C880E9C103DA0327E011F6F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9505-4081","documentHash":"c23d5099-2656-43f9-8d74-a754077512da"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e620","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"WIĘCEK","uuid":"44B3E979DD5089EBED9AE03419692895A253454600B04780B9D7F190B2FF4B8305C1D72519C19C57C3395626076937E5AD4DB86CA39802ADD6E352C6E0AB1712","orcidId":"0000-0002-5390-3049","documentHash":"26b3746d-f258-4357-8891-46ea477f0e32"}],"doi":"10.1080/14763141.2021.1916577"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Roma,

number of studies have dealt with the effects of economic integration on foreign direct investment, yet without a comprehensive and simultaneous analysis of the overall positioning of the countries involved along the investment development path (IDP). In the current paper, a comparative analysis of IDPs of five Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries, both members and nonmembers of the European Union (EU), is conducted. The purpose of the paper is to determine the effect of economic integration on foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and on the movement of these CEE economies through their IDP stages. An attempt is made to identify the positioning of the sample countries on the IDP, using trend estimation depicting the relationship between net outward investment (NOI) per capita and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, as well as detailed descriptive data on inward and outward FDI stocks and flows, subsequently complemented with econometric analysis. While the findings point to a generally positive effect of EU membership on FDI growth and IDP trajectories, integration tends to exert a stronger effect on inward FDI than on outward FDI of the investigated member countries. At the same time, the study’s findings reveal the need to add new theoretical considerations to the interface between EU integration and the IDP model, as well as formulate certain policy implications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051286031","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"63","pagesFromTo":"27-54","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/SAHPFY6K2CPUIGUHFRJ4/full?target=10.1080%2F15387216.2020.1828124&","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6409aad940970770356bfad0","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Wolniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"60151649-d856-4363-9fee-f691f9d0be93"},{"objectId":"6409aad940970770356bfacf","name":"Jan","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e3969f2-7693-46ef-9658-daaada915277"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b827c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Trąpczyński","uuid":"6814AC1FB9845FBB4BF059D68C3F63E429F44881F895E68BDDDF090063777E6CB3FF1BC28A1A5FFA6E901C8813A83A2A25005030D2C949BB5ADD9BA3708A1453","orcidId":"0000-0001-8154-9174","documentHash":"b5849e76-cdc2-47fd-93f5-91c6a65543a5"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a2e","name":"Marian","lastName":"Gorynia","uuid":"DF6DCB8E84A37932F0E178AB52B73B7B105373DAC3A1E014708E4A16331529CC40EBDF4FD98C9F9B71DF7B5B297FC174E726BB8964C33B47178DD5DBAFC94633","orcidId":"0000-0002-7633-8249","documentHash":"331aa713-833f-4bf5-a82d-4adf2e8a973f"}],"doi":"10.1080/15387216.2020.1828124"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","uid":"byQikIwqf13QiA2ApyMoNIQ","uuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","parentUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","rootUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","name":"Śląski
