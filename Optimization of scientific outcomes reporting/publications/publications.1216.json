However, addressing and improving nutrition in various cardiovascular settings remain sub-optimal. This paper discusses practical approaches to how nutritional counselling and promotion could be undertaken in primary care, cardiac rehabilitation, sports medicine, paediatric cardiology, and public health.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: Nutrition assessment in primary care could improve dietary patterns and use of e-technology is likely to revolutionize this. However, despite technological improvements, the use of smartphone apps to assist with healthier nutrition remains to be thoroughly evaluated. Cardiac rehabilitation programmes should provide individual nutritional plans adapted to the clinical characteristics of the patients and include their families in the dietary management. Nutrition for athletes depends on the sport and the individual and preference should be given to healthy foods, rather than nutritional supplements. Nutritional counselling is also very important in the management of children with familial hypercholesterolaemia and congenital heart disease. Finally, policies taxing unhealthy foods and promoting healthy eating at the population or workplace level could be effective for prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Within each setting, gaps in knowledge are provided.\r\n\r\nConclusion: This clinical consensus statement contextualizes the clinician's role in nutrition management in primary care, cardiac rehabilitation, sports medicine, and public health, providing practical examples of how this could be achieved.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456184","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"696-706","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/article/30/8/696/7059095","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2754097076263e85fb8","name":"Pedro","lastName":"Marques-Vidal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49b7ab00-2793-4f47-af0d-989a4b36497c"},{"objectId":"6630e2754097076263e85fb7","name":"Delphine","lastName":"De Smedt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c8c2663-4fa3-4cb0-a238-4b1e4a94c470"},{"objectId":"6630e2754097076263e85fb6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Siegrist","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fcd14e3-3efd-4591-9af5-85d3ff83df79"},{"objectId":"6630e2754097076263e85fb5","name":"Zoé","lastName":"Colombet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e7cf540-610f-4a90-9190-5ae0f2045a0a"},{"objectId":"6630e2754097076263e85fb4","name":"Martin","lastName":"O’Flaherty","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dadbba19-bb95-43c6-8c8b-f30c2dc24016"},{"objectId":"6630e2754097076263e85fb3","name":"Elena","lastName":"Cavarretta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2ab808a-04e5-4ce3-be02-2e42a9923688"},{"objectId":"6630e2754097076263e85fb2","name":"Ana","lastName":"Abreu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0325130d-82a4-4e9e-83c0-809337082152"},{"objectId":"6630e2754097076263e85fb1","name":"Vasiliki","lastName":"Tsampasian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c72a20f-57f0-4062-a78c-3f05e833c5fe"},{"objectId":"6630e2754097076263e85fb0","name":"Vassilios S.","lastName":"Vassiliou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc7a30c7-5ad0-427c-8cac-196a8de02250"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f589","name":"Donata","lastName":"Kurpas","uuid":"ADEEA7F7787557BBD47A79DC92B001981C449CB800B492EBDB803F4D7CB85ADE2146F9B3770E9F290423E4CC1038DFE6CEFB9F1FD8D1DDE6755314E032ACC60B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6996-8920","documentHash":"c0a847aa-f42b-42ea-894e-eb756d928b4a"}],"doi":"10.1093/eurjpc/zwad057"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pruritus","chronic itch","enkephalins","dynorphins","endorphins","chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus","chronic kidney disease"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

It may occur in the course of other disorders, such as kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) most often affects people with end-stage renal disease. The etiology of this condition is still not fully understood, but researchers are currently focusing on a thorough analysis of the association between disturbed opioid balance and increased neuronal signaling leading to pruritus. The aim of this study is to assess the concentration of endogenous opioids in dialysis patients with and without pruritus and in the control group, and to determine the correlation between the concentration of these substances and the occurrence and severity of itching. The study involved 126 dialysis patients and 50 healthy controls. Patients were divided into groups with pruritus (n = 62) and without pruritus (n = 64). The severity of pruritus was assessed using the NRS scale. The concentration of endogenous opioids was determined using the ELISA. The concentration of met-enkephalin was higher in the group of patients with pruritus compared to the control group. Moreover, significantly lower levels of β-endorphin and dynorphin A were observed in the group of dialysis patients compared to the control group. In addition, a statistically significant difference was seen between the β-endorphin concentration in the group of dialysis patients with pruritus compared to the group without pruritus. The ratio of β-endorphin/dynorphin A concentrations was significantly lower in the group of patients with pruritus compared to patients without pruritus and the control group. No correlations were found between serum level of studied opioids and the severity of pruritus. The concentrations of the studied opioids did not correlate with the severity of pruritus. Observed opioid imbalance may affect the occurrence of CKD-aP in dialysis patients, but a thorough understanding of the mechanism of action of these substances in the sensation of pruritus is necessary to assess the possibility of finding a new therapeutic target."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456186","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.2474 [12 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/7/2474/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e27c4097076263e8612c","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Wala-Zielińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52ef3ed1-d193-43d4-b759-04c673a30654"},{"objectId":"5fc4a26d085dcb1e6ae0b878","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Świerczyńska-Mróz","uuid":"72D3D28FF688BEDC9BDB7287F2D5FDF186C624B611A2F20CACFBC9BD2BC69DDEEF5F66E3596DEA47C3473EE43C82E7AA3EE9E3D889006ACACD9F585B2571806C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0417-2745","documentHash":"3d390356-69cb-4699-b1f7-b2379ae6d514"},{"objectId":"5ebed479752340254fc3fe74","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":"953EA17B3EEB96D211EDAD12A32003E63501AE6C8C8A145A9D2AAAA036ED034093277AE7E6C67B7F2F758CBBE21B482F948146F58906D5B6DB12DB142786C0E3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4722-8531","documentHash":"40b209b2-c09b-4418-af1e-9f9342da2c19"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf6d3","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Nowicka-Suszko","uuid":"6EF9BE82B81BF610F12BE7B56B917722CCE3D14123E11190D920906210CEEB742A2B5F56D0409FBBA00007B6EE8369DAA0DE883CE3C8BCB5B06C8E67F2A35868","orcidId":"0000-0001-7502-3504","documentHash":"fbe79003-8ddf-45cf-bdaf-12a22a8631ca"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1375","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Szepietowski","uuid":"BFD55FB7279B9CE2DAE7D9EFAF01C474DAEE7B50FDB68898A3D2A2D0C28321A5F4FE19CB55BA9C55BF78966C75801D554A4A7A4917DC51DB31C2E704BDF467AB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0766-6342","documentHash":"230cd8c8-61bf-41ea-9ec1-60bff6453cd6"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1354","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":"24BD21FEF2D2C8CA3880ADF08AA3B3D165FA3F8DE2FB61B86CDB2AA8DF8817AE7760984796CF9BA0161C5D4A7C13EE580B1DBF8BEBD37D39EBB784E641B3B2A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-2632-2409","documentHash":"d503f845-e3f0-4f29-af55-9660bae3a658"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12072474"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["H19","acromegaly","lncRNA"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Besides its typical symptoms, it contributes to the development of cardiovascular, metabolic, and bone comorbidities. H19 RNA is a long non-coding RNA and it is suspected to be involved in tumorigenesis, cancer progression, and metastasis. H19 RNA is a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and monitoring of neoplasms. Moreover, there might be an association between H19 and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. We enrolled 32 acromegaly patients and 25 controls. We investigated whether whole blood H19 RNA expression is associated with the diagnosis of acromegaly. Correlations between H19 and tumour dimension, invasiveness, and biochemical and hormonal parameters were evaluated. We analysed the coincidence of acromegaly comorbidities with H19 RNA expression. In the results, we did not observe a statistically significant difference in H19 RNA expression between acromegaly patients and the controls. There were no correlations between H19 and the adenoma size and infiltration and patients&amp;rsquo; biochemical and hormonal statuses. In the acromegaly group, hypertension, goitre, and cholelithiasis were observed more frequently. The diagnosis of acromegaly was a factor contributing to the occurrence of dyslipidaemia, goitre, and cholelithiasis. We found an association between H19 and cholelithiasis in acromegaly patients.

American bat populations have suffered severe declines over the last decade due to the Pseudogymnoascus destructans fungus infection. The skin disease associated with this causative agent, known as white-nose syndrome (WNS), is specific to bats hibernating in temperate regions. As cultured fungal isolates are required for epidemiological and phylogeographical studies, the purpose of the present work was to compare the efficacy and reliability of different culture approaches based on either skin swabs or wing membrane tissue biopsies for obtaining viable fungal isolates of P. destructans.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nIn total, we collected and analysed 69 fungal and 65 bacterial skin swabs and 51 wing membrane tissue biopsies from three bat species in the Czech Republic, Poland and the Republic of Armenia. From these, we obtained 12 viable P. destructans culture isolates.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nOur results indicated that the efficacy of cultures based on wing membrane biopsies were significantly higher. Cultivable samples tended to be based on collections from bats with lower body surface temperature and higher counts of UV-visualised lesions. While cultures based on both skin swabs and wing membrane tissue biopsies can be utilised for monitoring and surveillance of P. destructans in bat populations, wing membrane biopsies guided by UV light for skin lesions proved higher efficacy. Interactions between bacteria on the host's skin also appear to play an important role."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456195","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-023-03603-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f79","name":"Jan","lastName":"Zukal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c6d2f0f9-dcd9-4dd7-b25c-f71e9ea4b8a8"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f78","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Piacek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfb3f414-dbb7-49b4-8bbb-5d50592943f6"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f77","name":"Sneha","lastName":"Patra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b33761c-220d-4f3b-a4f4-28ccbd5a22b6"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f76","name":"Sarka","lastName":"Bednarikova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae7c0d70-413a-4868-abd9-4206b2b4d78c"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f75","name":"Monika","lastName":"Nemcova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"629345f8-afb0-4fe2-8fa7-05cb6380ed21"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f74","name":"Astghik","lastName":"Ghazaryan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"379b96bc-6784-4c6d-9ab6-d7da8566fdba"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f73","name":"Adela","lastName":"Cmokova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2efa27f5-8abf-403b-afba-203356d1104f"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f72","name":"Alena","lastName":"Nováková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9aa94e4e-e2f6-4c52-b48b-a8e9fb1f2b4e"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f71","name":"Miroslav","lastName":"Kolarik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0337db96-3b1e-4790-82fa-87004e41e2cb"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f70","name":"Jiri","lastName":"Pikula","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cdac0700-ae2b-49d8-b490-c61dcc3a5bac"},{"objectId":"65eefec14097076263b99f6f","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Seidlova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c60295e8-83fe-460b-9ec1-6642e74a98c6"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e26f","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kokurewicz","uuid":"1A6A8EE0CB1B6BEB334C3F75B919407BE646B454A021F8981044A0F82E8C4E2928CC92E57626CCC578A3582DB24D7582363A0D4FEF518A2EA6388BA05F50607F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3906-2124","documentHash":"f6c25f06-720e-4cd7-888f-a14e962e977c"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12917-023-03603-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["N-isopropylacrylamide","TGA/DTG","non-isothermal","activation energy"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

There are many econometric methods that\r\ncan be applied to study the causal relationships between the variables. A new and still not explored field is the sports economics, where the researchers consider the relationships between clubs’ financial and organizational performance. To understand these phenomena, the authors use various statistical and econometrical methods. It is clearly visible in the growing number of publications in this area. In this paper, author attempts to investigate and describe the Granger-causality concept in finance-sports performance of selected football clubs. The following paper aims to identify causality and its direction between players’ transfer values and clubs’ sports performance in football. For the purpose of the thesis, the following hypotheses had been developed.\r\nH1: there exists a causal relationship between transfer spending and points of the selected football clubs; H2: there exists a causal relationship between transfer spending and standings of the selected football clubs. The research concerns the analysis of the causality relationship between financial and sports performance on the example of five best teams from five best European football leagues. All selected clubs characterize the best sports performance in their native leagues. In the study, three variables have been used. One of them has financial nature, while two relate to sports performance. Data reflect the two rounds that appear during every football season. The research includes data from the first round of season 2003/2004 to the first round of season\r\n2020/2021. It contains information about transfer values, the standings and points gathered by the clubs in a semi-year frequency. The research tool used for the study is GRETL software. Thank to this solution it is possible to test stationarity and develop the VAR model. This relationship between pairs of selected variables occurs only in a small percentage of cases, or it cannot be identified at all. As a final concussion, the weak utility of the approach for the practical purpose is suggested. The last part of the paper is a conclusion where the author put the list of limitations and recommendations for further researches."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456199","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"1982-1989","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.efsupit.ro/images/stories/septembrie2022/Art%20252.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b7274","name":"Michał","lastName":"Jagielski","uuid":"941AFC3C04C7EA26C8C24A283CF2AB8E42563EDFE67CCB22F9A176EEF8F6E65F8624FE364D7312B958E0DDBC1AAEAC2CF9983C019C9897E3F02970F91BAA5A66","orcidId":"0000-0003-1869-4859","documentHash":"5ea4f70b-3ec3-41fd-bd30-c2489b4d3c28"}],"doi":"10.7752/jpes.2022.09252"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CKD-MBD","PTH","cardiovascular","mineral","mortality"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

We investigated the associations between parathyroid hormone (PTH), phosphate, and calcium (and their interactions) and all-cause, cardiovascular (CV), and non-CV mortality in older non-dialysis patients with advanced CKD.\r\n\r\nMethods: We used data from the European Quality study, which includes patients aged ≥65 with eGFR ≤20 ml/min/1.73 m2 from six European countries. Sequentially adjusted Cox models were used to assess the association between baseline and time-dependent CKD-MBD biomarkers and all-cause, CV, and non-CV mortality. Effect modification between biomarkers was also assessed.\r\n\r\nResults: In 1294 patients, the prevalence of CKD-MBD at baseline was 94%. Both PTH (aHR 1.12, 95%CI 1.03-1.23, p 0.01) and phosphate (aHR 1.35, 95%CI 1.00-1.84, p 0.05), but not calcium (aHR 1.11, 95%CI 0.57-2.17, p 0.76), were associated with all-cause mortality. Calcium was not independently associated with mortality, but modified the effect of phosphate, with the highest mortality risk found in patients with both hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. PTH level was associated with CV mortality, but not with non-CV mortality, whereas phosphate was associated with both CV and non-CV mortality in most models.\r\n\r\nConclusions: CKD-MBD is very common in older non-dialysis patients with advanced CKD. PTH and phosphate are independently associated with all-cause mortality in this population. While PTH level is only associated with CV mortality, phosphate seems to be associated with both CV and non-CV mortality.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456200","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"2562-2575","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/38/11/2562/7180013","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845c0","name":"Kitty J.","lastName":"Jager","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17532306-5430-4f8d-9205-89a08a44815d"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845bf","name":"Nicholas C.","lastName":"Chesnaye","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68162081-b9ac-4490-afc0-b991197470f0"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845be","name":"Christoph","lastName":"Wanner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca3c523a-a6e8-4c56-9ca7-d1b6c14c2a55"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845bd","name":"Esther N.M.","lastName":"de Rooij","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcb9a239-7d69-4f39-95ef-ec3f8f049917"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845bc","name":"Friedo W.","lastName":"Dekker","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe78fac3-bf80-49e0-9a7d-d60f6895597e"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845bb","name":"Maria","lastName":"Pippias","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caad49ca-8de8-43eb-b648-11d7b0ab21bb"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845ba","name":"Peter","lastName":"Stenvinkel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d4844146-3d72-486a-a059-3c7f12424ab0"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845b9","name":"Christiane","lastName":"Drechsler","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e926c931-a0a6-4078-b6c8-9788cef33b6b"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845b8","name":"Gaetana","lastName":"Porto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ff1f154-0902-45a5-af91-63d48d98d282"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845b7","name":"Claudia","lastName":"Torino","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"848985f7-8a2f-4d9a-a455-cd41e854c329"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845b6","name":"Marie","lastName":"Evans","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de5c8ca0-8fac-47ab-b54b-1b3cc03dddcc"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845b5","name":"Fergus J.","lastName":"Caskey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9480eccd-fabf-455d-aa69-869b31e80120"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845b4","name":"Mario","lastName":"Cozzolino","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3edea63-7b29-492f-bccc-d300d39fe961"},{"objectId":"6630e1aa4097076263e845b3","name":"Lorenza","lastName":"Magagnoli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9369aca6-859d-45be-a4af-cacb512422d5"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a84b1","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Szymczak","uuid":"D5614A5F17692C2B5F2382FF9BD35BF08C02E128B47B225DC04E705C97087F58F1C166164E9F723BA69AF602BEECF137E93F0057B9FAAAFDDF1C383494934BCC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1248-081X","documentHash":"4bf9e9c2-d57b-478f-b13e-b5ccfe4fe90b"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1354","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":"24BD21FEF2D2C8CA3880ADF08AA3B3D165FA3F8DE2FB61B86CDB2AA8DF8817AE7760984796CF9BA0161C5D4A7C13EE580B1DBF8BEBD37D39EBB784E641B3B2A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-2632-2409","documentHash":"d503f845-e3f0-4f29-af55-9660bae3a658"}],"doi":"10.1093/ndt/gfad100"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["micro-enterprise","innovation capability","product innovation","process innovation","newto-\nthe-market","personal characteristics","organizational characteristics","external environment"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"What Shapes Innovation Capability in Micro-Enterprises?

In this process, a special role is played by companies’ capabilities, especially those related to innovation capability (IC). Despite many years of research into identifying the factors that influence IC, there are still many research gaps. One such concerns the IC of micro-enterprises. Only a few studies indicate certain factors that may affect micro-enterprise ICs. Thus, this article aims to analyse the determinants of micro-enterprises’ ICs from the perspective of implementing new-to-the-market product and process innovations. The theoretical framework adopted distinguishes between three groups of factors affecting micro-enterprise IC: personal, organizational and external environmental characteristics. The data examined come from an empirical study of a randomly selected representative sample of 1105 Polish micro-enterprises. To analyse these data, a logistic regression model was used. The results indicate that seven factors are common and significant determinants that explain the new-to-the-market product and process dimensions of micro-enterprise IC. Among them, the following have the greatest influence: engagement in initiatives for solving social problems, intensive cooperation with research centers, experience/skills and financial support.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456203","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/joitmc8010059","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bf91","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Zastempowski","uuid":"8D8DDE26CE4165EC99D19FD550D484C862E5E6C7E1B446D3207A524C967F5C17F735ED1B568789AE1A405EAAE8FCD717207B612E185A8B882A7DE9F9702A7DCF","orcidId":"0000-0001-8196-3236","documentHash":"0542a0e4-6339-4cc0-b2ab-f893a1ae3c55"}],"doi":"10.3390/joitmc8010059"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pyrolysis","biochar","Biogas kinetics","Methane fermentation","Spent grain","Anaerobic digestion"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6222d9387523402df08d2b48","602f82529543c7410626f568","602f4b0b9543c7410626f2e4","6708f698fdbe831eab397bb0","602f75b79543c7410626f4e1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Anaerobic digestion of brewer’s spent grain with biochar – biogas production kinetics and process efficiency","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f0ce","mniswId":"27765","title":"Detritus","doi":null,"issn":"2611-4127","eissn":"2611-4135","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8fe91f5a-1586-4149-97bf-ce2f5c533f21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eef8684097076263b98244","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f82529543c7410626f568","602f75b79543c7410626f4e1","6222d9387523402df08d2b48","602f4b0b9543c7410626f2e4","6708f698fdbe831eab397bb0"]},"issue":"June 2023","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biochars made from brewer’s spent grain were added to the anaerobic digestion of brewer’s spent grain to enhance the methane fermentation process and improve biogas production. In research, the effect of biochars made at 300, 450, and 600 °C and doses of 1-8% added to anaerobic digestion was tested. The biochemical biogas potential tests in mesophilic conditions were performed. The tests took 28 days, the biogas yield for each reactor varied from 500-650 ml×gVS-1, and around 60% substrate degradation was obtained. For each test, the kinetics parameters using the first-order model were determined. The constant biogas production rate (k), and the biogas production rate (r) varied from 0.05-0.08 d−1, and 42-60 ml×(gVS×d)−1 respectively. Though the differences in biogas production turned out to be statistically insignificant (p<0.05) due to the high disappearance in obtained data and conflicting effects, the response surface area analysis showed that biochar made at 450 °C at the share of 1-4% could be used to maximize biogas production. Nevertheless, supplementation with biochar needs to be done carefully since in many cases, a reduction in biogas production was observed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456208","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"16-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://digital.detritusjournal.com/articles/anaerobic-digestion-of-brewers-spent-grain-with-biochar--biogas-production-kinetics-and-process-effi/3527","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6708f698fdbe831eab397bb0","name":"Alan","lastName":"Gasiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cae36034-1961-4f9a-95a1-68b66577cea3"},{"objectId":"6222d9387523402df08d2b48","name":"Waheed","lastName":"Rasaq","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c73188e-05a2-4368-9798-ab4f838fbe1f"},{"objectId":"602f82529543c7410626f568","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Świechowski","uuid":"64EBA239DCD91D7B54AE56AFCC23B7C385F99CEF4C25698D882319431CBB62BFAEAFF20DB7FAF96933E33337F8712E43402AEDBC08B7E3AD11D3467198688D6D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ca20def-2e22-46de-b548-e21ebf48e068"},{"objectId":"602f75b79543c7410626f4e1","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Syguła","uuid":"B81842B1AF2C66BABBB18D5A4BF79FE8A67E9C54027C8DC84E4B4EAA90B526654E82A36961CF8A3EF5900368A9107712D7C3862746BF74AA0B732E494BF239ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-4284-6990","documentHash":"6c5b0b01-822e-48f8-bc80-625fd51b415e"},{"objectId":"602f4b0b9543c7410626f2e4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Łyczko","uuid":"39EEC3C52B018F373384C41F0E1FB450414CB122502093E113786A5DE3DDF5A5CD0041A930234BA08648905F3BC951856D8B6D665FF34E07B1D7E49AE6A8C74F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d9c5d5a-7c5a-46ff-b2a1-3fabc184ed96"}],"doi":"10.31025/2611-4135/2023.17277"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pneumococcal vaccine","vaccination program","voluntary vaccination"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

While a 10-valent vaccine is commonly used, parents have the option to use a 13-valent vaccine for a fee. This study aimed to investigate whether and how the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination affected the uptake of recommended vaccination and to assess the association of chargeable pneumococcal vaccination with recommended vaccination. Data from 1595 vaccination record cards kept by six primary care clinics in urban and rural areas of Poland were collected and analyzed for children born between 2015 and 2018. Belonging to the clinic and the year of birth were the only inclusion criteria. Following the introduction of free universal pneumococcal vaccination, more children were vaccinated with the recommended vaccination (61.2% vs. 66.6%, p = 0.026). The most significant change was in vaccination against rotavirus (48.5% vs. 54.4%, p = 0.018) and against meningococcal B bacteria (4.8% vs. 17.0%, p < 0.001). Children who received chargeable pneumococcal vaccination were also significantly more likely to be vaccinated with recommended vaccines (54.6% vs. 75.9%, p < 0.001). In particular, this was the case for multivalent vaccinations—against rotavirus, chickenpox, and meningococcal C bacteria. Reducing the impact of the economic factor, for example, by introducing free vaccinations, should have a positive impact on the uptake of other recommended vaccinations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456210","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art.1838 [12

gravity field models obtained from satellite gravimetric techniques allow for the assessment of ice sheet mass changes in remote polar regions, such as Greenland and Antarctica. So far, GRACE has been the primary mission for obtaining the global time-variable gravity field models. However, GRACE was launched in 2002, thus very little is known about the global mass changes before this data, as well as between GRACE and its successor – GRACE Follow-On. We derive a method of gravity field recovery based on Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) data to geodetic satellites that allows for obtaining direct ice mass change estimates for a period longer by 10 years than that provided by the GRACE missions. The developed method is based on splitting normal equation systems and re-stacking the solutions which allow for stable inversion, reduces the correlations between obtained parameters, stabilizes the ice mass estimates in polar regions, and reduces the noise over oceans by a factor of four. The secular trends obtained from SLR are equal to −113.5 and −82.8 Gt/year, whereas these are −119.1 and −83.3 Gt/year from GRACE and GRACE-FO to degree and order 10 for Greenland and West Antarctica, respectively, for the common period of 2002–2021 and after removing the post-glacial rebound effect. Despite the conformity of the trend and patterns, an underestimation is observed in the solutions expanded to degree and order 10. Therefore, scaling factors between GRACE/GRACE-FO expanded up to a degree and order 10 × 10 and 60 × 60 were derived and applied to SLR solutions to account for the differences in mass estimates due to the truncation of the models. SLR data revealed that in Greenland the smallest ice mass trends are for 1995–2000, 2000–2005, and 2015–2020 which are equal to +54.3, −15.5, and −75.9 Gt/year. The largest ice mass depletion periods took place in 2005–2010, 2010–2015, and recently in 2019–2021 with trends of −213.9, −287.2, and −276.1 Gt/year, respectively. For Greenland and West Antarctica, the period 2010–2015 is characterized by the most enormous ice depletion events, whereas the later 5-year period of 2015–2020 provided a near mass-equilibrium for Antarctica reducing the negative trend and returning to the situation from the ‘90s when no significant ice mass changes were observed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456214","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"302","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425724000051","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaf32a40970762632c2cb3","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Jäggi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"078f90d7-b718-4e5e-b678-e04960712d18"},{"objectId":"65eaf32a40970762632c2cb2","name":"Ulrich","lastName":"Meyer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3620875c-1fdf-40eb-8560-855313b3d50c"},{"objectId":"65a89b3b40e3ff6b129e0c79","name":"Filip","lastName":"Gałdyn","uuid":"9D49D628A0618A231D984697A4598F4E8EBE9EB592A764A8619F24493487D7B817B766E5D62DA751EB573E5C2CBB1FA206BF2525FBD4E112893E6D947D6A7EB5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b6b9c637-a0c7-4d3f-8ce4-1013af277f34"},{"objectId":"602f925a9543c7410626f61e","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Zajdel","uuid":"5E7BB79C3A34BEF743303834A2DBB23BF5EFF85CEB7F1AFDE8C949BF43ECB7477C36C3D2ECD294A54E31DAE35D3937A3551D6FDD070CF1252A87DB6EB38D4ACF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de7129cf-4f7b-4a9c-8998-38645d850a36"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83c7","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"SOŚNICA","uuid":"22D515E8674D468ED4D4CF62223E7EECD8B8352CEB0CD1836B9DDC1CE8294387C0820DC8358CDFCBC932A875FC2E9DCD5A7090797CD99D2610AC43E60CE18002","orcidId":"0000-0001-6181-1307","documentHash":"083640a6-2e12-412c-8dfb-f1627940b3cb"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.rse.2024.113994"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

This study involved 2023 subjects aged 35–70 years, from Wroclaw and surrounding villages. The assessment of food intake in the study group was assessed using the standardized Food Frequency Questionnaire. Dietary patterns were identified using the principal components analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation. Three dietary patterns were identified in the study group: unhealthy, healthy, and traditional. The prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, IFG, and visceral obesity decreased across the quartiles of healthy DP. Prevalence of IFG increased across the quartiles of unhealthy DP, but the prevalence of hypertension decreased. When the diet was more adherent to the traditional DP the prevalence of CVD, diabetes, IFG, visceral obesity, obesity, and being overweight was higher.

Due to their trimethylammonium functional groups, the host materials alone exhibited an affinity to anionic water contaminants and antimicrobial properties. The introduction of such particles as CuO, Cu2O, metallic Cu, CuO/FeO(OH), Cu4O3, Cu(OH)2, Cu4(OH)6SO4, Cu2(OH)3Cl increased these properties and demonstrated new properties. The composites were obtained unconventionally, in ambient conditions, using eco-friendly reagents. Alternative synthesis methods were compared and optimized, as a result of which a new group of hybrid ion exchangers was created (HIXs) containing 3.5–12.5 wt% of Cu. As the arrangement of the inorganic phase in the resin matrix was atypical, i.e., close to the surface of the beads, the obtained HIXs exhibited excellent kinetic properties in the process of oxidation and adsorption of As(III), as well as catalytic properties for the synthesis of triazoles via click reaction, and also antimicrobial properties in relation to Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, preventing biofilm formation. Using thermogravimetry, the effect of the inorganic phase on decomposition of the polymeric phase was evaluated for the first time and comprehensively, confirming the relationship and finding numerous regularities. It was also found that, depending on the oxidation state (CuO, Cu2O, Cu), copper-containing particles affected the textural properties of the polymeric phase endowing a tighter structure, limiting the porosity and reducing the affinity for water."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456227","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"art.3606 [24 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/17/3606","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e4d54097076263e876a5","name":"Irena","lastName":"Jacukowicz-Sobala","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eada2be1-07b8-4612-acc0-5993a957d8c1"},{"objectId":"6630e4d54097076263e876a4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Ociński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14775df2-0d1d-484f-abab-d19dfe3b81d1"},{"objectId":"6630e4d54097076263e876a3","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Stanisławska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4088e60d-61f3-412f-88e3-57a03ff2d2a2"},{"objectId":"6630e4d54097076263e876a2","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Kociołek-Balawejder","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"676af52a-1990-41f3-8662-f69e1186a035"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1469","name":"Igor","lastName":"Mucha","uuid":"7756B89EEB6165A7AE5FDCE2BC53E067162299634841E29581BF7E5AE3FFAC82CBDDBC9BD721878C00FF3F2BEAF11BF329E696DAEA1C5682C4B2BC95A9DDCFEF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1168-608X","documentHash":"c223e7a9-51aa-4367-85d7-ca766d284a87"}],"doi":"10.3390/polym15173606"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coronary artery disease","coronary computed tomography angiography","coronary stenosis","dynamic myocardial perfusion computed tomography","myocardial ischemia"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

However, a limitation of CTA is its inability to provide information on the hemodynamic significance of the coronary lesion. The recently developed stress dynamic CT perfusion technique has emerged as a potential solution to this diagnostic challenge. Dynamic CT myocardial perfusion provides information on the hemodynamic consequences of coronary stenosis and is used to detect myocardial ischemia. The combination of stress dynamic CT myocardial perfusion with CTA provides a comprehensive assessment that integrates anatomical and functional information. CT myocardial perfusion has been validated in several clinical studies and has shown comparable accuracy to Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis and superior performance to Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). More importantly, CTP-derived myocardial perfusion has been shown to have a strong correlation with FFR, and the use of CTP results in a reduction of negative catheterizations. In the context of suspected stable coronary artery disease, the CT protocol with dynamic perfusion imaging combined with CTA eliminates the need for additional testing, making it a convenient “one-stop-shop” method and an effective gatekeeper to an invasive approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456230","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.7062 [14 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/22/7062","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2974097076263e86469","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Witkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c6da7caa-6d34-43c6-8d88-ad98d26ecefe"},{"objectId":"6630e2974097076263e86468","name":"Michal","lastName":"Pula","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6ed6270-f034-4314-8f68-d71ee9a47e24"},{"objectId":"634f612b752340623bbe6534","name":"Agata","lastName":"Zdanowicz-Ratajczyk","uuid":"4568B5B59500948C862D57D12A309D41AF727151B44D4F7B4B691864D63C68929CE156D54670F399F25256396B1680EEC4E5A86D00969FC46D761DE2D1294B1F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0447-1021","documentHash":"9ad6b66d-1d2c-46fa-81df-9a5b207c09d8"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a145b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Reczuch","uuid":"1D5754AA35BE618F1D66CFB0CC4454EB5B8679160F28BA33A98F5D83EF82D47032963AFCC8C5D2058B08323E0AACFE538A280A08F7C2E2257F7D5C3511B6CA54","orcidId":"0000-0002-1699-739X","documentHash":"1565e1dc-063a-4ded-a942-34126cfa9ba5"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12f3","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Guziński","uuid":"7CF74BEEB4CC6FC10169FE39D0612C1495B6202F59EABC8AA6B95F7B1E0D4D19C8CAF1FA6F1FF5FC323B8DA4C8B8A0D7DE6F15C8720061A703E772DECB3B1AC6","orcidId":"0000-0002-9781-2114","documentHash":"9a9066c6-0649-4332-a7ae-6006b7dee90d"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12227062"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Condition-based structural health monitoring of offshore wind jacket structures: Opportunities, challenges, and perspectives","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479853","mniswId":"18989","title":"Structural Health Monitoring","doi":null,"issn":"1475-9217","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6c5e8087-d9cb-41d3-9ba1-7ced2155cb60"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eae5d140970762632ba9d9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eae5d140970762632ba9da","65eae5d140970762632ba9db","65eae5d140970762632ba9dc","643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","65eae5d140970762632ba9dd","65eae5d140970762632ba9de","65eae5d140970762632ba9df"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Structural health monitoring (SHM) has been recognized as a useful tool for safety management and risk reduction of offshore wind farms.

The achievements in the structural damage identification, location, quantification, and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation are respectively introduced in detail, and existing challenges are discussed. Possible solutions to the challenges using the Digital Twin (DT) technology are put forward. The DT is able to mirror a real jacket structure into a virtual model, and Bayesian updating can refresh the virtual model parameters in real-time to keep consistency between virtual model and physical structure; then, just-in-time SHM can be carried out for jacket structures by performing damage detection, location, quantification, and RUL estimation using the virtual model. As a result, the DT may provide engineers and researchers a practicable tool for safety monitoring and risk reduction of fixed foundation offshore wind structures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456234","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d39b3b4097072e0d295339","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"adb23dec-ba67-41da-be43-0a4ec5492ed7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"3558-3575","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14759217221148688","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eae5d140970762632ba9df","name":"Weihua","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7edb3d4-d1b5-4921-be98-3d2099e10c2b"},{"objectId":"65eae5d140970762632ba9de","name":"Atilla","lastName":"Incecik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e3a9e3b7-1b26-46a5-8d9c-43a7afe93a04"},{"objectId":"65eae5d140970762632ba9dd","name":"Shizhe","lastName":"Feng","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94017b62-935c-4e88-8b39-6847a811c8a7"},{"objectId":"65eae5d140970762632ba9dc","name":"Mengmeng","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77d39d6e-1ba9-4faa-bd85-4eda72a19bf9"},{"objectId":"65eae5d140970762632ba9db","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Gardoni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbbf81b3-e78d-4fd2-b3c5-8af59504e670"},{"objectId":"65eae5d140970762632ba9da","name":"Jiaxuan","lastName":"Leng","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5da86ad9-0f57-46b8-9ba9-a72cff0059dc"},{"objectId":"643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","name":"ZHIXIONG","lastName":"LI","uuid":"702756DCCCD3492C7F8BEE876ECFF5320F12A813CAE78A9EF23A2EFD6E44E8974DA4C0167114F64ABED373F069177BE3B59258C22EAA67DBD18E6C027CAFAFBA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59b058ba-526e-4828-8f00-3046d9f8887c"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.1177/14759217221148688"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

During sepsis, the absolute number of lymphocytes decreases. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells are reduced. Lymphocytes are an essential element of the body's defence against pathogens. Interleukin 7 has strong anti-apoptotic properties and induces the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. IL-15 prompts the generation of mature NK cells in the bone marrow, plays an important role in the generation, cytotoxicity, and survival of CD8+ T lymphocytes, and is essential for the survival of natural killer T (NKT) and intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). The study highlights the importance of monitoring IL-7 levels in patients with sepsis and septic shock, as low levels of this cytokine were associated with an increased risk of mortality. Physicians should consider using IL-7 levels as a biomarker to identify patients who are at higher risk of mortality and may require more aggressive treatment.

Our study aims to determine the prevalence and type of ocular manifestations in TA. A systematic literature search was conducted in December 2022 using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science). The following data were extracted from each article: the name of the first author; the patient’s age, sex, and origin (continent); circumstances connected with the diagnosis of TA; symptoms given by the patients; reported ocular manifestations; and administered treatment. The final analysis was based on data collected from 122 cases. Retinal ischemia, followed by optic neuropathy, cataract, and retinal artery occlusion, were the most prevalent eye conditions associated with the disease. Systemic steroid therapy, vascular procedures, and methotrexate were mainly used to treat pulseless disease. Patients mostly complained of gradual vision acuity loss, sudden vision acuity loss, ocular pain, and amaurosis fugax. The diagnosis of Takayasu’s arteritis should be considered in patients presenting symptoms of visual decline/loss, ocular pain, or signs of retinal ischemia, optic neuropathy, or early cataract formation. A proper diagnosis is crucial to ensure the patient receives treatment without significant delay."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456242","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.3745 [14 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/11/3745","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2644097076263e85dba","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Przeździecka-Dołyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb9de1ad-f8d3-48d8-bf31-d888b6791cb2"},{"objectId":"5fc4c228085dcb1e6ae0b8e7","name":"Artur","lastName":"Małyszczak","uuid":"2453CE7384F15B5E8E024F218B6D682C6CB0EDCA59EA3B962D5E1CCFD1206015E6EEAF8FD1F6D7CA7295D1D6BC77FFD3544D331FD1475C5DC829914E2C5802EF","orcidId":"0000-0003-0167-5600","documentHash":"dc07da7d-3194-405e-8bf5-dcda7401e757"},{"objectId":"5ecc8cc97523406a2b8ea622","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Szydełko-Paśko","uuid":"187C853E764779F476F1607F1BB5818864D045EAA9DDBB424652F969CF85E9712C6C6F2F2A1621F65C4D22633A20FC5FD148461719A099BD23D6BD4EFF2685D1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5374-8192","documentHash":"db9e4c2e-8341-48fc-949c-16333d2c9c1d"},{"objectId":"5ecc85d27523406a2b8ea5f9","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"98AC8C21CEF5905733B6FB1E86054E3F3D4D9282D27CBB361C6CD88070DA2BBE41F3743ABF23305338387458753C75A775B63E1F79B0C73D2152DB0271809AAF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4273-8196","documentHash":"344afeb9-758b-4934-981a-7188c24c15fd"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1ab1","name":"Marta","lastName":"Misiuk-Hojło","uuid":"FCDBB9AD0077C7D51D063A5E4FC6740ED419866EE80B884CF846ADF7AA9AC950733B90268DF92FA99205D16446D58891D41195DE953A1F63BB12A665AFDBE86B","orcidId":"0000-0002-4020-3203","documentHash":"0210b02e-dc19-4e3d-9506-784866a819f3"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12113745"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Translator Studies","Panajotis Kondylis","cultural role of translator","specialized translation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Działalność translatorsko-redakcyjna Panajotisa Kondylisa jako przykład kulturotwórczej roli tłumacza","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479ec7","mniswId":"200490","title":"HETEROGLOSSIA - STUDIA KULTUROZNAWCZO-FILOLOGICZNE","doi":null,"issn":"2084-1302","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"2583b748-4dcb-4c05-b99f-89033aee8420"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-07-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9a92540970762631fba17","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f86a99d085dcb410a25eee0","5e709281878c28a047396ebc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the article is to present the cultural role of translator based on the example\r\nof Panajotis Kondylis work and legacy.

Objective To calculate the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for change in exercise capacity in the 6MWT in iron-deficient populations with HFrEF. Methods In this pooled secondary analysis of the FAIR-HF and CONFIRM-HF trials, mean changes in the 6MWT from baseline to weeks 12 and 24 were calculated and calibrated against the Patient Global Assessment (PGA) tool (clinical anchor) to derive MCIDs in improvement and deterioration. Results Of 760 patients included in the 2 trials, 6MWT and PGA data were available for 680 (89%) and 656 (86%) patients at weeks 12 and 24, respectively. The mean 6MWT distance at baseline was 281 ± 103 meters. There was a modest correlation between changes in 6MWT and PGA from baseline to week 12 (r = 0.31; P < 0.0001) and week 24 (r = 0.43; P < 0.0001). Respective estimates (95% confidence intervals) of MCID in 6MWT at weeks 12 and 24 were 14 meters (5;23) and 15 meters (3;27) for a “little improvement” (vs no change), 20 meters (10;30) and 24 meters (12;36) for moderate improvement vs a “little improvement,”, -11 meters (-32;9.2) and -31 meters (-53;-8) for a “little deterioration” (vs no change), and -84 meters (-144;-24) and -69 meters (-118;-20) for “moderate deterioration” vs a “little deterioration”. Conclusions The MCID for improvement in exercise capacity in the 6MWT was 14 meters–15 meters in patients with HFrEF and iron deficiency. These MCIDs can aid clinical interpretation of study

quantum wells were grown by molecular beam epitaxy on high quality bulk (0001) GaN substrates. The quantum well thickness was set in the 6–8 nm range to favor the photoluminescence emission of indirect excitons. Indeed, such excitons are known to be spatially indirect due to the presence of the internal electric field which spatially separates the electron and hole wave functions. The growth conditions were optimized in view of minimizing the photoluminescence peak broadening. In particular, the impact of growth temperature (up to 900 °C) on the surface morphology, structural, and photoluminescence properties was studied. The diffusion of indirect excitons on the scale of tens of micrometers was measured with a micro-photoluminescence setup equipped with a spatially resolved detection. A dedicated model and its analysis allow us to extract from these measurements the exciton diffusion constant and to conclude on the optimum growth conditions for the GaN/AlxGa1−xN quantum well structures suited for studies of quantum collective effects in indirect exciton liquids."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456255","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d39501b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"135","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"11504509-fd17-484d-87c5-1a6ae0d05cf4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"135","pagesFromTo":"95702","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0182659/19703481/095702_1_5.0182659.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d395024","name":"M.","lastName":"Vladimirova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"979ed8eb-f94e-4bcd-96d2-45b88b9ab06b"},{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d395023","name":"T.","lastName":"Guillet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e485a74-7b69-440f-959d-a5d56d5a790a"},{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d395022","name":"P.","lastName":"Vennéguès","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b8d71df0-54bd-47f1-bab8-2925b4b4c824"},{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d395021","name":"I.","lastName":"Florea","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af1f970c-4b4b-4bbb-8575-31ebe824f717"},{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d395020","name":"A.","lastName":"Courville","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e72f860-797c-4ed2-81b7-b5624417ddaa"},{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d39501f","name":"V.","lastName":"Guigoz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d18299e0-da0a-4a38-b250-4580528dd7a8"},{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d39501e","name":"S.","lastName":"Vézian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82232cb7-76fe-4366-9c5e-72183d156ce8"},{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d39501d","name":"R.","lastName":"Aristégui","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98ac27b1-7b8e-4e65-ab19-0c2dc7d9d695"},{"objectId":"65e9e138409707132d39501c","name":"B.","lastName":"Damilano","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cae08a9e-8a6e-4439-be5d-8289c0999fe6"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5989","name":"Michał","lastName":"Boćkowski","uuid":"18E0485511ABDB0D41DB7F6F59E9E4626BB139E8F890BB7F1D72DE93FF779111D716976B750D1B02005018F23E408247F07044DC9DD6FE84870F35A167D66175","orcidId":"0000-0003-1616-685X","documentHash":"6f2bcbbc-7ec5-4a12-aa2e-323154ef506b"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bac7","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Teisseyre","uuid":"B8EA9B08E016F623CA1BE44C967B3CFEFCB29303A4C1AB55293493D94EC5CE0763D18144BF3517D306C1E92C6467D8EAF4D223507C34130DEB7FF8BC59B616D2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8640-1283","documentHash":"75ba7d92-035c-4417-999e-c9baa812356a"}],"doi":"10.1063/5.0182659"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mechanosensitive ion channels","piezo channels","mechanoreceptors","cancer"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The effects of their action can be observed both on the macro and molecular levels. They can also play a prominent role in the tissues and cells of animals due to the presence of mechanosensitive ion channels (MIChs) such as the Piezo and TRP families. They are essential in many physiological processes in the human body. However, their role in pathology has also been observed. Recent discoveries have highlighted the relationship between these channels and the development of malignant tumors. Multiple studies have shown that MIChs mediate the proliferation, migration, and invasion of various cancer cells via various mechanisms. This could show MIChs as new potential biomarkers in cancer detection and prognosis and interesting therapeutic targets in modern oncology. Our paper is a review of the latest literature on the role of the Piezo1 and TRP families in the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in different types of cancer."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456260","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art.167 [22 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0375/13/2/167","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e4c74097076263e8751c","name":"Mihaela G.","lastName":"Moisescu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3ccbd7a-3841-4d81-9036-b81ed5fc5335"},{"objectId":"6630e4c74097076263e8751b","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ce7be0f-9a2a-4c99-a9b4-560a87b8932d"},{"objectId":"652608a940e3ff22d34a6c61","name":"Julia","lastName":"Karska","uuid":"3A695F73BB174B5919DD2106D2BC58B0E13CC5F6A2EFD732DB5E243F9559D03EBE5CFABDC854912D35D66579BDCFA385620019296D4551AD71E29A95275FCF3E","orcidId":"0009-0001-4869-5943","documentHash":"4367e947-82cf-4312-9816-af6d07cc5a50"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1eb2","name":"Julita","lastName":"Kulbacka","uuid":"89F5F3BEF56B4A64B9BC60A721EA54D63EC87BA8F04E9C7A00FDEACD5FB5BC2D2B9205307431052D0508373A186A177F5472803C6473FD2F53F30FE93DD5970F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8272-5440","documentHash":"b50ad7c8-2652-43fc-aed0-9e38646ceea2"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b77","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Saczko","uuid":"AFE05EC221701A3C230E92F683C9A2D3EACF6D39C0233611CB1AEF993744B793E012FCF52CBF6AA2772C012CD5B9E42C7DAA9DC035729B88422F8F16A2F2977A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5273-5293","documentHash":"a027ef28-2fa8-4359-b6cc-ccbdc75e1d24"}],"doi":"10.3390/membranes13020167"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The study included 114 sport climbers whose RMR was measured with a Fitmate WM. Anthropometric measurements were performed with X-CONTACT 356. The resting metabolic rate was measured by indirect calorimetry and was compared with the RMR estimated by 14 predictive equations on the basis of using body weight/fat-free mass. All equations underestimated RMR in male and female climbers, except for De Lorenzo’s equation in the group of women. The De Lorenzo equation demonstrated the highest correlation with RMR in both groups. The results of the Bland–Altman tests revealed an increasing measurement error with increasing metabolism for most of the predictive equations in male and female climbers. All equations had low measurement reliability according to the intraclass correlation coefficient. Compared with the indirect calorimetry measurement results, none of the studied predictive equations demonstrated high reliability.

The aim of the article is to identify manifestations of power and violence in this education. The author uses the historical method, analyzing the documents produced by the Jesuits before their suppression in 1773, when a relatively uniform system of teaching and upbringing was in force in their institutions around the world. The author notes that Ignatian education was inspired by the spirituality and experiences of the founder of the Order, Ignatius of Loyola was as a self-demanding man, determined and at the same time sensitive and open. He created a thriving, highly hierarchical institution with a global reach, but able to flexibly adapt to local conditions. Despite their laudable aims, Jesuit schools offering Ignatian education have been marked by symbolic, structural and physical violence, and most Jesuits have sided with those of power and importance for centuries.

In light of the emergence of new molecules, a significant contribution to the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease is the study of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and the programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) protein and its ligands. BCL-2-family proteins are involved in the regulation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Disruptions in their interactions promote the progression and resistance of MDSs. They have become an important target for specific drugs. Bone marrow cytoarchitecture may prove to be a predictor of response to its use. The challenge is the observed resistance to venetoclax, for which the MCL-1 protein may be largely responsible. Molecules with the potential to break the associated resistance include S63845, S64315, chidamide and arsenic trioxide (ATO). Despite promising in vitro studies, the role of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors has not yet been established. Knockdown of the PD-L1 gene in preclinical studies was associated with increased levels of BCL-2 and MCL-1 in lymphocytes T, which could increase their survival and promote tumor apoptosis. A trial (NCT03969446) is currently underway to combine inhibitors from both groups."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456270","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.4708 [17 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/5/4708","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1954097076263e84350","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wicherska-Pawłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b9435cf-6e6c-44a7-a870-0a9a552552f0"},{"objectId":"5ebee51a752340254fc44867","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Kuszczak","uuid":"1DBC4ED2135BB30885AF234EBB372C7B737831BB0A86AADC0D64A893BE43D2D556AC2D7CDCEC7488F12C88A8D34D13B0E47A812D90E27B9BC182803956CE412B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8036-073X","documentHash":"185d1d2b-cbe0-488d-a995-3b224da1da35"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af7d5","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Rybka","uuid":"ABD3119E0AC71EED6C956FEF449E21570275B87BB7307D60FF9248CFCA52A6F24FAFB9B8D5111ECE32FCC39B3F24DBFC0F6028E24FA24A8E0BDB810F56338C2A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7965-3589","documentHash":"c3e7d192-11fb-4f44-9c9c-74e675037d31"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1345","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"EC583E9B358D41E95C6BE33A13775945DE0F74A3DB1247952A4E79946A2CB49F752B69D9BEAF3DD11A19A47951D32CEF8601CFD16411A241C6E98AEECADAD3DB","orcidId":"0000-0002-6612-3535","documentHash":"ccd91327-0392-41a2-9b9b-652ab7381228"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms24054708"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["mięso","efekty zewnętrzne","produkcja i konsumpcja mięsa","ograniczanie konsumpcji mięsa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["meat","externalities","meat production and consumption","limiting meat consumption"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64f5966340970739aa7cd104","doi":null,"title":"Edukacja dla demokracji.

However, clinical factors associated with this impairment remain unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and to evaluate the associations with clinical and hormonal parameters in a group of patients with PAI. (2) Methods: The study included 32 patients with autoimmune PAI, who answered the quality of life in Addison’s disease questionnaire (AddiQoL). Clinical data and hormonal measurements were collected from the patients. (3) Results: The total AddiQoL score of males was significantly higher than that of females (p = 0.011). Furthermore, males reached significantly higher scores in each of the four subscales (fatigue—p = 0.013, emotional sphere—p = 0.048, adrenal insufficiency symptoms—p = 0.039, and miscellaneous questions—p = 0.034). There was a negative correlation between HRQoL and gonadotropin levels (FSH and fatigue r = (−)0.38, p = 0.032; FSH and emotional sphere r = (−)0.416, p = 0.018). This study found no significant associations between AddiQoL scores and the presence of autoimmune comorbidities; only fatigue scores were worse in the presence of autoimmune thyroiditis (p = 0.034). The doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone in the replacement therapy were not associated with AddiQoL scores. AddiQoL scores correlated negatively with the age of diagnosis (p = 0.015). (4) Conclusions: Female sex, higher gonadotropins level, and older age at diagnosis were associated with impaired HRQoL in the studied group of patients with PAI."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456273","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.7237 [11 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/23/7237","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2984097076263e8647c","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Stańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ce640a1-19be-4a9e-a789-40946733e850"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9e98","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Szcześniak","uuid":"82AB14C297454EF2677A6523795ECCDABFCD9EF87D18CE5C4A813F68D3762ED645EEA7BCD8BC8FA726ACE61A609915BC44B541D8B2A6E080F480F4CD681E597D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8899-8842","documentHash":"5a1c37cb-fc7f-4481-bbf2-b4ab2bdd74ba"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9e8b","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Zdrojowy-Wełna","uuid":"CCB963491F44C71D27FDC6C078A4FF7DA07F6CEB31249F0C1B00F89EAEEE3C12A04D57BB9ED51B8D5A73CF96884EE4830C70EC5BADE6C17AFFE7976BCD7F9948","orcidId":"0000-0001-5640-1928","documentHash":"70402750-d24a-4fd8-b2b6-fd6ce6c1aab4"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8ef0","name":"Jowita","lastName":"Halupczok-Żyła","uuid":"37108E3CDBE836D316B776D0A30BFBF5C8B38192B4EAAB37F405E3110CE0D577B4DA76CEAF194AA46FD670DF972C4926F0E9C3C2DDCC51E946ECC08C448BF438","orcidId":"0000-0002-6901-377X","documentHash":"8f2c1164-d7eb-4377-b858-58175a77efa7"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394b47","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bolanowski","uuid":"D6BDEC0447FFC0B874EE0B10147B50E4454C85E87072EA305F1315AC36B10225E21A64B402C9F56B183705D748FA29CD88B3702D6B437881564452133204A03C","orcidId":"0000-0002-2360-6596","documentHash":"95ab512c-5e48-451e-9744-bed22aa52840"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12237237"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

However, clinical signs of leukostasis are observed at diagnosis in only approximately 10% of all cases and among these, priapism is infrequent. Here, we analyze data from pediatric CML registries on the occurrence of priapism heralding diagnosis of CML in 16/491 (3.2%) boys (median age 13.5 years, range 4&amp;ndash;18) with pediatric CML. In the cohort investigated, duration of priapism resulting in a diagnosis of CML was not reported in 5 patients, and in the remaining 11 patients, occurred as stuttering priapism over 3 months (n = 1), over 6 weeks (n = 1), over 1&amp;ndash;2 weeks (n = 2), over several days (n = 2), or 24 h (n = 1), while the remaining 4 boys reported continuous erection lasting over 11&amp;ndash;12 h. All patients exhibited splenomegaly and massive leukocytosis (median WBC 470,000/&amp;micro;L, range 236,700&amp;ndash;899,000). Interventions to treat priapism were unknown in 5 patients, and in the remaining cohort, comprised intravenous fluids &amp;plusmn; heparin (n = 2), penile puncture (n = 5) &amp;plusmn; injection of sympathomimetics (n = 4) &amp;plusmn; intracavernous shunt operation (n = 1) paralleled by leukocyte-reductive measures. Management without penile puncture by leukapheresis or exchange transfusion was performed in 3 boys. In total, 7 out 15 (47%) long-term survivors (median age 20 years, range 19&amp;ndash;25) responded to a questionnaire. All had maintained full erectile function; however, 5/7 had presented with stuttering priapism while in the remaining 2 patients priapism had lasted &amp;lt;12 h until intervention. At its extreme, low-flow priapism lasting for longer than 24 h may result in partial or total impotence by erectile dysfunction. This physical disability can exert a large psychological impact on patients&amp;rsquo; lives. In a narrative review fashion, we analyzed the literature on priapism in boys with CML which is by categorization stuttering or persisting as mostly painful, ischemic (low-flow) priapism. Details on the pathophysiology are discussed on the background of the different blood rheology of hyperleukocytosis in acute and chronic leukemias. In addition to the data collected, instructive case vignettes demonstrate the diagnostic and treatment approaches and the outcome of boys presenting with priapism. An algorithm for management of priapism in a stepwise fashion is presented. All approaches must be performed in parallel with cytoreductive treatment of leukostasis in CML which comprises leukapheresis and exchange transfusions &amp;plusmn; cytotoxic chemotherapy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456275","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.4776 [24 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/14/4776","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2534097076263e85bda","name":"Frederic","lastName":"Millot","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"753f6b4b-dc7a-4bc2-b78e-8417d9794334"},{"objectId":"6630e2534097076263e85bd9","name":"Markus","lastName":"Metzler","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2a78597-8842-49c7-bfa5-1b3aee859b62"},{"objectId":"6630e2534097076263e85bd8","name":"Stephanie","lastName":"Sembill","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e8bf6c1-aa53-450f-9b02-6b7f534dee8e"},{"objectId":"6630e2534097076263e85bd7","name":"Meinolf","lastName":"Suttorp","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a2f0764-7a59-46d4-9473-7dfa823d7017"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b82","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kałwak","uuid":"7C5C3811FE18F1D9FF5F0411E523EC2317E556F5015CB140CCDDA2DE35EA2E03B605702ADC6A1691CD66C88245E78CFE53805EF39361A9B884F00B4245E957CE","orcidId":"0000-0003-1174-5799","documentHash":"e4a1d339-defd-4374-8119-418a0e1add53"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12144776"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Reynoutria","Polygonum cuspidatum","gingiva","wound healing","resveratrol","polysaccharides","oral wound","dentistry","medicinal plant","pharmacopoeial drug","traditional medicine"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

In traditional medicine, one of the applications for Reynoutria japonica rhizomes is wound healing. In a recent in vitro study, we demonstrated that ethanol and acetone extracts from this herbal drug have the potential to heal oral gum wounds. However, considering that a majority of herbal medicines have been traditionally administered as water decoctions, in the present study, a decoction of Reynoutria japonica rhizomes was prepared and detailed tests to determine its in vitro gingival wound healing activity were conducted. We used the primary human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) incubated with a decoction to determine cell viability (MTT assay), cell proliferation (the confocal laser scanning microscope—CLSM), and cell migration (wound healing assay). Moreover, the collagen type III expression was examined using immunocytochemical staining. The studied decoction was qualitatively and quantitatively characterized using the validated HPLC/DAD/ESI-HR-QTOF-MS method. The Folin–Ciocalteu assay was used to determine the total phenols and tannins content. Additionally, HPLC-RI analysis of decoction and the previously obtained ethanol and acetone extracts was used to determine the composition of saccharides. Low concentration (from 50 to 1000 µg/mL) of decoction after 24 h incubation caused a significant increase in HGF cell viability. No cytotoxic effect was observed at any tested concentration (up to 2000 µg/mL). The lowest active concentration of decoction (50 µg/mL) was selected for further experiments. It significantly stimulated human gingival fibroblasts to proliferate, migrate, and increase the synthesis of collagen III. Phytochemical analysis showed significantly fewer polyphenols in the decoction than in the ethanol and acetone extracts tested earlier. In contrast, high levels of polysaccharides were observed. In our opinion, they may have a significant effect on the oral wound healing parameters analyzed in vitro. The results obtained encourage the use of this raw material in its traditional, safe form—decoction."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456277","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"art.267 [17 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/16/2/267","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1474097076263e83a6b","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Złocińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9d33d736-2094-4859-8536-22ab0588080a"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85f8","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Hadzik","uuid":"320FC1EDE4E4AC6564791F630F4633027393236FE08C394FBBA7A69961896BAA8577F4AAF51D05BD305D38201595D169547CED93D1797BF356EB24F6CFED2E52","orcidId":"0000-0002-2353-3198","documentHash":"7ffc7129-f59e-4056-bf86-738ac514412b"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b75a0","name":"Anna","lastName":"Choromańska","uuid":"41937AA4EB23BC363C4202FF2E1CDA761C68BBC8F95395EFA630A5E1780AC74145BA57D0AC6CF266CEC38E606534CA0EA82DC483908315FB736F638612CD2B5E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9997-7783","documentHash":"4c671f07-3b46-4c3a-9152-adb07456c8a3"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b18","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Dominiak","uuid":"6675E49D4A14BE1410843BB779E399C93B1246166D68AC4A81C617E9A927F998C49EE0596103225DF3DE16216A6C251DDCB622D3A14E3DC41FE33F24C2A09B9A","orcidId":"0000-0001-8943-0549","documentHash":"ae98244b-8063-40a7-830b-77b9e39d24d9"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a13a8","name":"Adam","lastName":"Matkowski","uuid":"C453F2B1959B4AF30650FFE16B2BC6E7AD05122AC8C11A1099B3988222166E3795AD5344236DBDA8F674BF91C77CB063DC3B302E25259A9BA020F133CE032C19","orcidId":"0000-0002-7283-2653","documentHash":"db1aaef8-fafa-4a97-9be2-8935c8d0f62b"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1344","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Karolewicz","uuid":"F4090C94D75F17146095ED3AC0DA0F7974D53077F06C325B2C3325A096F82991EC3541E4E0940FC76007DE12745CD4DC80788B3BDD21683026415623FEEFA547","orcidId":"0000-0003-0970-6344","documentHash":"49c8216d-d001-4c30-a2ae-f031d8509254"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12da","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Nawrot-Hadzik","uuid":"71C155994C4842C18264A91E5311EED16F7E9F629A31349666059F24C8D53417D4EBDCE735800C310A4F8E10F7695DA6656158F20DA1C95EB63C45237FCC5B0E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5797-7336","documentHash":"00180b99-f506-4364-ae61-a8bc0ab3fa04"}],"doi":"10.3390/ph16020267"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["IGS","GNSS","MGEX","Data mining","Geodesy"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"RINEXAV: GNSS global network selection open-source software based on qualitative analysis of RINEX files","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ea5b","mniswId":"26500","title":"SoftwareX","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2352-7110","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6a1ff98-7502-42f9-89fc-063a7f8dbec1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eaf33240970762632c2cd8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a89b3b40e3ff6b129e0c79","602f925a9543c7410626f61e","5e709437878c28a0473b83c7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The determination of global geodetic parameters using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations requires using a global, evenly distributed network of stations. The homogeneous distribution of stations is crucial for deriving Earth rotation parameters, coordinates of Earth’s center of mass, orbit determination, and the realization of the International Terrestrial Reference Systems. It is necessary to select the most representative group of stations, providing GNSS observations of the best quality, i.e. taking into account the factors, such as the number of observations, measured signal-to-noise ratio, or signal multipath indicator. This paper provides a description of the open-source software RINEXAV to select and optimize the GNSS station network based on the qualitative analysis of RINEX files.

In that regard it is especially important to avoid creating closed homogeneous communities, stressing this aspect in countries which are at the beginning of a way of introducing such solutions. Therefore, the aim of this research is to assess whether the pioneer intergenerational social housing building and its neighbourhood in Central European conditions properly answer the needs of older adults, improving their quality of life. The research was based on a survey conducted with two groups of residents: older adults (aged 65 and over) and other residents. Main findings show that moving to the analysed building reduced their architectural barriers which were problematic in previous living places. They assess the building itself more positively than its surroundings, and most of them have good social networks in this place. They are more interested in intergenerational housing projects rather than buildings designed only for older people. At the same time, younger residents benefit from some solutions designed for older people. Although most of them were neutral about having older people as neighbours while deciding about moving in, 20% of them highlight benefits of having them as neighbours at the moment. Satisfaction about living in the building is rather high in both groups and 87 % of older people and 80% of rest of residents would make the same decision about moving into this place. This study draws suggestions on future design of intergenerational housing and highlights the space for improvement based on the implemented case."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456282","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"142","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397523002266","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709276878c28a04739610d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kazak","uuid":"8BF592A9A46196A6F935B2BB31A500677E92CBD86B861922FB7AA22FB29395D1B64F43036B95965A8EC6195E7801C90063119847146D4F8539B9BD9881551DE0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1864-9954","documentHash":"9f3029ac-7cd5-4671-b3f2-c824c0d58001"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.habitatint.2023.102966"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Inter-rater","Intraclass correlation coefficient","Intra-rater","Reliability","Statistics","Test–retest"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Understanding when and which adrenal masses are ultimately excised surgically is not well understood. We sought to understand the ultimate fate of these incidentalomas using a large population-based dataset.\r\nMETHODS: The primary outcome of the study was determining the trend in adoption of surveillance vs. surgical excision according to socio-demographic, economic, and pathologic indices, and also provider specialty. Secondary outcomes were the assessment of perioperative complications, operative time, surgical approach, hospital stay, and provider specialty (general surgery vs. urology) among the cohort that underwent excision.\r\nRESULTS: Out of a total of N.=91,560 adrenal masses, ultimately N.=3375 (3.83%) of these underwent surgical excision. In the surgical excision cohort, the incidence of aldosteronoma, functional adenoma/Cushing’s disease, and adrenocortical carcinoma was higher than in the surveillance cohort. Those patients who were older, female, and with higher Charlson Comorbidity indexes (CCI) were less likely to undergo surgical resection. Factors that predicted for an increased probability of resection included obtaining more CT/MRI scans as well as general surgeons as primary physician providers. Over the study period, the vast majority of surgeries were performed by surgeons other than urologists (12.9%) and open and laparoscopic approaches dominated, with the robotic-assisted approach accounting for a minority of the surgical cases (23.9%). The minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach independently predicted for both lower rates of complications and shorter hospital stay.\r\nCONCLUSIONS: In the US, adrenal incidentalomas are more likely to undergo surveillance rather than surgical resection. In our study, surgery is mainly offered for functional or malignant disease and the receipt of surgery can vary by physician specialty. A MIS approach independently predicted for both lower rates of complications and shorter hospital stay."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456285","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"75","pagesFromTo":"73-84","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.minervamedica.it/en/journals/minerva-urology-nephrology/article.php?cod=R19Y2023N01A0073","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630eaa14097076263e8aa4e","name":"Benjamin

This\r\npaper aims to compare the market efficiency dynamics between Bitcoin and the emerging stock markets. In particular,\r\nthis study indicates whether the dynamics of Bitcoin market efficiency mimic those of emerging stock markets. Thus,\r\nthe paper’s contribution emerges from the combination of Bitcoin and emerging markets in the field of dynamics of\r\nmarket efficiency. The dynamics of market efficiency are measured using the Hurst exponent in the rolling window.\r\nThe study uses daily data for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and the Bitcoin market over the period 2011–2022.\r\nOur results show that there is at most a moderate correlation between the dynamics of Bitcoin and emerging stock\r\nmarkets’ efficiency over the entire study period. The strongest correlations occur mainly in periods of high economic\r\npolicy uncertainty in the largest Bitcoin mining countries. Therefore, the association between Bitcoin market efficiency and emerging stock markets’ efficiency may strengthen with an increase in economic policy uncertainty.

Particularly in males, it plays a crucial role in processes like male competition or sexual selection. Additionally, voice can provide a cue for body size assessment. This study investigates the relationship between male voice characteristics and physical features (assessed by women) and determines the accuracy of these assessments. Three groups of female judges assessed 60 male voices (20 different voices per group) across seven categories of male physical features: height, body fat, musculature, body shape, hirsuteness, age and strength. Recordings of five vowels and sentence and number of anthropometric measurements were made for each of the studied men. Intra- and extragroup agreement of assessments of men’s physical characteristics was demonstrated. Men with lower fundamental frequency (F0) and lower formant dispersion (Df) values were perceived as being heavier, older, stronger and more likely to have chest hair. However, across all the analysed fields of assessment, no accuracy was registered between estimates and men’s actual physical characteristics. These findings suggest that females were guided by stereotypes in their assessment of men’s appearance from voice alone. We propose the size exaggeration hypothesis as an explanation of this phenomenon."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456289","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09524622.2023.2229277","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eeff314097076263b9a291","name":"Jagoda","lastName":"Marchewczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73665e8b-e9fe-4ce3-81c0-22e06c630f23"},{"objectId":"602fb0619543c7410626f774","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawelec","uuid":"DF968DAE8525BB577ED8ABF56BA4F357E4FFB4F8BA168D878A59BD056A8C8EC19A07F9C94CCF70FFBC19751042F058ABCF9F1BEF804EC88E3ED0085EC5207FD4","orcidId":"0000-0001-9406-9997","documentHash":"7c2ee3ea-89a2-4460-a6a0-59b8534589b0"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d6f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Graja","uuid":"AA2D28245681F220439E4B59CAB3BE4E8E4E10C6A2ED7EC08ECF457CE48B6B48D014C09FD875D55D6B5CB50C272FBDF89183D8CA6CBD08B1B10EC3E164A3F25C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1726-8199","documentHash":"2b68ffba-8b41-4343-a0e9-8da0dec53aba"},{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b2fce","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lipowicz","uuid":"92812D336C7097797F3426AE0B5C748BBE6C5742126726F14010B3D7A0D844530C89F1CAB4A3D1A298CB7A439950DCC84F1AF19B515983A940D992AFC909E9A2","orcidId":"0000-0002-9182-6953","documentHash":"4634821d-603c-48b8-a54e-d0d33777d414"}],"doi":"10.1080/09524622.2023.2229277"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Furthermore, 5F-MDMB-PICA metabolites were identified in a urine sample as markers of exposure in situation when a parent compound is not present in specimens.\r\nMethods: Drugs and metabolites were extracted from serum and urine with ethyl acetate both under alkaline (pH 9) and acidic (pH 3) conditions. Hair, after decontamination and pulverization, were incubated with methanol (16 h, 60 °C). The analysis was carried out using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. For the identification of 5F-MDMB-PICA metabolites, an urine sample was precipitated with cold acetonitrile. Analysis was performed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatograph with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer.\r\nResults: 5F-MDMB-PICA was determined only in serum sample at concentration of 298 ng/mL. After 1 year, when analysis was repeated, concentration of synthetic cannabinoid in the same sample was only 17.6 ng/mL which revealed high instability of 5F-MDMB-PICA in serum sample. Eight 5F-MDMB-PICA metabolites were identified in urine sample, including two potentially new ones with m/z 391.18964 and m/z 275.14016.\r\nConclusions: Toxicological analysis confirmed a 1.5-year-old boy intoxication with 5F-MDMB-PICA. Besides the parent drug, metabolites of 5F-MDMB-PICA were identified, including two potentially new ones, together with possible metabolic reactions which they resulted from. Metabolites determination could serve as a marker of 5F-MDMB-PICA exposure when no parent drug is present in biological material."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456291","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"47-58","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11419-022-00629-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e5854097076263e887da","name":"Olga","lastName":"Wachełko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bdc120e6-0666-41cd-86af-d047fa202949"},{"objectId":"6630e5854097076263e887d9","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"19e42342-64b7-4bdb-a58e-f9bfddc4de46"},{"objectId":"634a1b297523402e341271bc","name":"Kaja","lastName":"Tusiewicz","uuid":"DA5236240327493FCAA10E0D523BA5ECBE6FB397FD2130EA0F803A3E08BD216F20898028919A5529B9B81DD6E3A45018BEC3FF66717AE3497BF0FBEE62E4373F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9968-2042","documentHash":"d2c02224-5568-498d-b6aa-9cc0adf81399"},{"objectId":"5e709464878c28a0473bc150","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Chłopaś-Konowałek","uuid":"133CFF0110A79095F35CFC6E7BE5BC434E6B3F4C7BC982AE7986FC4119C026324EDEE61A43A688976D38C96CAADF823550481E58C0B1C6A7E97B674EDF0D7C79","orcidId":"0000-0003-2814-8114","documentHash":"d30916b8-5810-4a6a-9c6c-3b0a4bfef900"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Szpot","uuid":"C0DD6021DF77CCF3DC6E35941E7AD532C9CF9E10BB0744B0F1B2DAEC2062CDAA348B9D49D148FD5480E1E057906E027FDEBC40888CD430841AE2816B0788C200","orcidId":"0000-0002-5352-3492","documentHash":"8f789c6c-3d19-4c38-ba3c-7176f398d2da"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1f0f","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"ZAWADZKI","uuid":"A503182E6481542437338034E0BE421E7C439271BBECF2167AFD04AE6AF8BAE0541FE861CD6BF2F981D76476181370A82533D1268C24EF669F25122174AE3ABA","orcidId":"0000-0003-2146-9724","documentHash":"4310342d-a7a3-4928-81e6-34a1ca07b42a"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11419-022-00629-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Convergence","Ecological footprint","Food expenditures","Spatial analysis","Sustainable consumption"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ecological situation and changes in food demand in the EU member states and selected OECD countries: Spatio-temporal analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d17","mniswId":"6701","title":"Food Quality and Preference","doi":null,"issn":"0950-3293","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cff1f5b3-3a60-4a2e-a1eb-aaaa4bf77372"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978aa40970762631b1af9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac594","5e709344878c28a0473a6169"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The ongoing process of globalization significantly affects the level of socio-economic development of countries\r\nand the progressing economic convergence.

hormone binding globulin (SHBG) deteriorated expression has been recently strongly correlated to increased level of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and insulin resistance, which are typical manifestations of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS). Despite previous reports demonstrated the potential therapeutic application of SHBG for liver-related dysfunctions, whether SHBG might modulate equine adipose-derived stem/stromal cells (EqASCs) metabolic machinery remains unknown. Therefore, we evaluated for the first time the impact of SHBG protein on metabolic changes in ASCs isolated from healthy horses.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nBeforehand, SHBG protein expression has been experimentally lowered using a predesigned siRNA in EqASCs to verify its metabolic implications and potential therapeutic value. Then, apoptosis profile, oxidative stress, mitochondrial network dynamics and basal adipogenic potential have been evaluated using various molecular and analytical techniques.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe SHBG knockdown altered the proliferative and metabolic activity of EqASCs, while dampening basal apoptosis via Bax transcript suppression. Furthermore, the cells treated with siRNA were characterized by senescent phenotype, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide, as well as decreased mitochondrial potential that was shown by mitochondrial membrane depolarization and lower expression of key mitophagy factors: PINK, PARKIN and MFN. The addition of SHBG protein reversed the impaired and senescent phenotype of EMS-like cells that was proven by enhanced proliferative activity, reduced apoptosis resistance, lower ROS accumulation and greater mitochondrial dynamics, which is proposed to be related to a normalization of Bax expression. Crucially, SHBG silencing enhanced the expression of key pro-adipogenic effectors, while decreased the abundance of anti-adipogenic factors namely HIF1-α and FABP4. The addition of exogenous SHBG further depleted the expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα and restored the levels of FABP4 and HIF1-α evoking a strong inhibitory potential toward ASCs adipogenesis.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nHerein, we provide for the first time the evidence that SHBG protein in importantly involved in various key metabolic pathways governing EqASCs functions, and more importantly we showed that SHBG negatively affect the basal adipogenic potential of tested ASCs through a FABP4-dependant pathway, and provide thus new insights for the development of potential anti-obesity therapeutic approach in both animals and humans."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456302","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"2251–2273","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12015-023-10580-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eefe874097076263b99df8","name":"Mohamad Al","lastName":"Naem","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce15ae05-eedb-4c94-a51c-c306319d633d"},{"objectId":"61e785b87523406748fb8694","name":"LYNDA","lastName":"BOUREBABA","uuid":"E9E482563FE63E31FD25D3D5B3F1FE97F8C784FB74495DAFBEE514285948D7708ABC57D70A7A7210E8AB66B1FA91DAC4CF304A8A8A5BB6233A578F342B73A0C1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"963e7a14-47c1-4f88-ba64-cc93c7c9718d"},{"objectId":"602f9be49543c7410626f682","name":"Malwina","lastName":"Mularczyk","uuid":"5144D17724771F33080F54F9A1B0C2802518F9139120BCFB6EC3D0136EFC666C6554E5114824F93A877C3185E285A8F9A8C9F725023DDF84525E6113F5C3990E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8189-9545","documentHash":"a4fa34dd-fb26-4f62-8062-9fff72784ecc"},{"objectId":"602f5b739543c7410626f399","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Sikora","uuid":"4EF91695706AA0F622671AD0B82EA82161E3102A167181A4AEC2895421F81224F85B923259240EBA13F76BD957253B556702A9FB04E5C1D9736544B6AE75DBCC","orcidId":"0000-0002-9965-587X","documentHash":"027edaa9-a1c8-4fbf-8f44-71cea8de6be8"},{"objectId":"5ec353c57523406cb1a7eb00","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zyzak","uuid":"F8B8E464C1271DABC65D6CE060665DA96F4CC3F470047E5068231B15AB0704D4519AEBA3EDDA02FA12E1C773178ABB07F524CE7AB5809AEFAB8359EBE4928C98","orcidId":"0000-0001-5960-9695","documentHash":"3ac6626e-db40-4d20-82a7-6fbd83e551d2"},{"objectId":"5e70944a878c28a0473b9c1f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Serwotka-Suszczak","uuid":"3F32F72CF3AEC0297EE325A12FCD83D83F06FEAFAA81F6DE3973FF16E88DD20D1ACB4AD7D1D63CC722A1BC92F30DF5427FFD97D1D9E3A69464E7CA9D76030ECC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4553-0908","documentHash":"a1749336-dc96-4d9a-a499-0adb765be110"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e29a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Marycz","uuid":"232BD10216D5623A2C97AEE2B23109CFB6C3A3BD5B79AA43203A222A1A37A575D9EBD9FFFDABB7F4C32C3CDC7BA67C6A7DE4A8F0D86DC6A5DF0F1CF93573FCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3676-796X","documentHash":"927d7659-0c17-40c1-bed6-9f2cf8d61940"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12015-023-10580-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["a mixed log-normal model","numerical model","water reservoir","water flow","climate change","Nysa Kłodzka","Kamieniec Z ˛abkowicki dam reservoir"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analysis of Changes in Water Flow after Passing through the Planned Dam Reservoir Using a Mixture Distribution in the Face of Climate Change: A Case Study of the Nysa Kłodzka River, Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547ddf2","mniswId":"22877","title":"Hydrology","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2306-5338","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"05cfb4ff-552a-4ef5-852f-427d8ca46478"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eef8654097076263b98230","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709422878c28a0473b6cf3","5e70924e878c28a0473935e0","65eef8654097076263b98231","65eef8654097076263b98232","602f3fc69543c7410626f25f"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate change and extreme weather events have the potential to increase the occurrences of flooding and hydrological droughts. Dam reservoir operation can mitigate or aggravate this impact. This study aims to evaluate the influence of the planned Kamieniec Z ˛abkowicki dam reservoir on the flow patterns of the Nysa Kłodzka river in the context of changing hydrological conditions and climate change. In the study, a 40-year observational series of hydrological data was used to simulate changes in water flow through the river valley in a numerical model. This simulation was conducted both for the natural river valley and for the same river valley but with the added reservoir dam. Flow simulations revealed that dam operation increased downstream flow values, reducing variability in extreme high-flow events. Addition, the mixture log-normal distribution shows that the operation of the dam resulted in a reduction in the variability of both low flows and extreme high-flow events. Furthermore, the model illustrates that moderate-flow conditions remain relatively stable and similar before and after dam construction. The Mann–Kendall trend test, Sen slope trend test and Innovative Trend Analysis indicated that the dam had a significant impact on flow trends, reducing the negative trend. This hydrotechnical structure stabilizes and regulates flows, especially in response to climate-induced changes. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the dam in mitigating flood risk and supporting water resource management. It is essential to consider the role of the dam in adapting to changing hydrological conditions influenced by climate change. For practical application, efficient flow regulation by reservoir administration is crucial."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456307","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5338/10/12/226","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef8654097076263b98232","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szewczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41b6c17c-877f-44b1-b201-ea40e11f5585"},{"objectId":"65eef8654097076263b98231","name":"Maksymilian","lastName":"Połomski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d49fcf5b-739f-45c7-866d-d381bcf6b30d"},{"objectId":"602f3fc69543c7410626f25f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"9B8B8F06B6C724E94B43BA1C2514F4DFF1A84347D388FCA28D8FF62A934929B74567A82CDA31D92CA2CDC4748A990E5306DD34096076874D95BDA9F4385D7B44","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"899ae4b9-922b-437f-b807-3f13a79f188d"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cf3","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Gruss","uuid":"F49E7556C93664F3BB275D707D699E5AD5880D0BF090B5414085A44583BCB7758059A18C40E60E4761ADAB3011B892455A1F98757A6B5209D686CE3DD0DEB5DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7548-9758","documentHash":"fde19c45-20c7-423b-a7ad-a48e82d69ec3"},{"objectId":"5e70924e878c28a0473935e0","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Wiatkowski","uuid":"3B2A563C5BB75017380E4AA991B146240D67646BD85053BFD519D5B3D6A139C55D82BF100C94F8D693BD6E609BE03902AE4EF60974C2D1DEA6271757B493EF67","orcidId":"0000-0002-5155-0593","documentHash":"68aae787-7828-4e50-b34e-fb0126814555"}],"doi":"10.3390/hydrology10120226"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["bezwzględna przyczyna odwoławcza","delegowanie","Minister Sprawiedliwości","nienależyta obsada sądu","osoba nieuprawniona","sąd","sędzia"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd5c","uid":"bT6SF6NUzNfZ5gtHBpUg4ag","uuid":"f8ccf691-8784-48da-819a-014977855cd1","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd5c","parentUuid":"f8ccf691-8784-48da-819a-014977855cd1","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd5c","rootUuid":"f8ccf691-8784-48da-819a-014977855cd1","name":"Uczelnia Łazarskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a047393149"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sposób określenia czasu trwania delegacji sędziego do innego sądu i skutki procesowe jego naruszenia: glosa do postanowienia składu siedmiu sędziów Sądu Najwyższego - Izba Karna z dnia 14 września 2022 r., I KZP 10/22","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd38","mniswId":"497407","title":"Orzecznictwo Sądów Polskich","doi":null,"issn":"0867-1850","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"77c3f7cb-9ba9-409b-a17a-ea5d2b74aca5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9cc8e409707132d372867","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709249878c28a047393149"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W glosowanym postanowieniu Sąd Najwyższy wskazał, że delegacja przez Ministra Sprawiedliwości sędziego do pełnienia obowiązków w innym sądzie musi wskazywać początkową i końcową jej datę, a skutkiem procesowym naruszenia tej zasady jest bezwzględny powód odwoławczy w postaci nienależytej obsady sądu (art. 439 § 2 pkt 2 Kodeksu postępowania karnego).

External validation is an important aspect of clinical outcomes.\r\nObjectives: We aimed to externally validate the novel dichotomous IHS4-55 in a non-biologic treated dataset of HS patients.\r\nMethods: Data from a previously published European-wide prospective clinical study of antibiotic treatment of HS patients were used to assess the association of IHS4-55 achievement with individual reduction in inflammatory nodules, abscesses, and draining tunnels. Moreover, the associations between IHS4-55 positivity and achievement of the minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) for Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Pain, and NRS Pruritus were analyzed.\r\nResults: Data were obtained from 283 individual patients, of which 36.4% (103/283) were treated with clindamycin and rifampicin and 63.6% (180/283) with tetracyclines for 12 weeks. Achievers of the IHS4-55 demonstrated a significant reduction the counts of inflammatory nodules, abscesses, and draining tunnels (all p < 0.001). Additionally, IHS4-55 achievers had an odds ratio for achieving the MCID of DLQI, NRS Pain, and NRS Pruritus of 2.16 (95% CI 1.28-3.65, p < 0.01), 1.79 (95% CI 1.10-2.91, p < 0.05), and 1.95 (95% CI 1.18-3.22, p < 0.01), respectively.\r\nConclusions: This study shows the external validity of the novel IHS4-55 by demonstrating a significant association between IHS4-55 achievement and a reduction in inflammatory lesion counts as well as achievement of MCIDs for DLQI, NRS Pain, and NRS Pruritus in an antibiotic-treated cohort.

In April and May 2020, 703 study participants tested for COVID-19 by PCR tests were registered. In June and July 2020, they were examined for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG. From October 2020 to January 2021, those among the study population with COVID-19 confirmed by PCR tests were registered, and the same group of participants was invited to be examined again for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In June 2020, antibodies were detected in only 88% of those who had PCR-confirmed COVID-19 in April–May 2020, which suggests that a significant proportion of persons in the Polish population do not produce antibodies after contact with SARS-CoV-2 antigens or rapidly lose them and reach levels below the lab detection limit. The levels of IgG class anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were significantly lower among people who previously had COVID-19 than for those who had received COVID-19 vaccination, which confirms the high immunogenicity of the vaccines against COVID-19 in the Polish population. The study confirms that a detectable level of IgG class anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies cannot be considered a reliable marker of the presence and strength of COVID-19 immunity preventing individuals from acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456315","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art.1198 [11 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/11/7/1198","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2124097076263e8538c","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kędzierski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f9025e8-2ee1-4a35-abc5-93ad37ac699c"},{"objectId":"6630e2124097076263e8538b","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Radziejewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4852bb68-3f52-44a0-80c3-2f61f10dc962"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa8e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wawrzyńska","uuid":"990AE0B5FE544CBCD354B55347163FD50B4D79D79CFA03C9FCF3F45B9CAEB837E67D7673F0B5169EDB666B7BFD7C6B9690B98D8D709F864D9CF702D5F01C74DC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6855-5510","documentHash":"5fee8373-6a3f-4c71-aee4-aa41167accef"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af80e","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Arkowski","uuid":"253C45D5809BA7A3F3F470427B227CBA8016A237E2D5C57ABB4AC50E5E260C081C2013B00714726435ADDE6F675828286D145A5DE7338594BE5A2F518BA0C92A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2761-7580","documentHash":"9f683750-66ea-43ef-bcdc-df016b81bcee"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1eff","name":"Robert","lastName":"Susło","uuid":"C2F389F9629FA953E2931B369B1BAD39A98409085A9D8575EABF385B62AE5A6412906ABF7FCBA9E3C87A16FAEF1DDAE1A500DAB4DA5AD69DAD922890664DCB95","orcidId":"0000-0002-2680-7617","documentHash":"b7149300-2c52-4706-90d0-4a5facc5cb51"}],"doi":"10.3390/vaccines11071198"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65eecfe040970749973c3126","doi":"10.4324/9781003308096","title":"Safety, Danger, and Protection in the Family and Community: A Systemic and Attachment-Informed Approach","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"9781003308096","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003308096","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"aa466d1d-db6c-45be-b491-5138707d4dbe","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"786c0d24-6774-4ed6-9d1b-52b0d7d62f49"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Psychologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70932f878c28a0473a4844"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Living with climate change and environmental crisis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eed59340970749973c9d25","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70932f878c28a0473a4844"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059456318","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"48-58","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003308096-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70932f878c28a0473a4844","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Budziszewska","uuid":"6AE2FB7C8660C711DFF2A21433D8672F6B51EDFC07CF7D1F5EB5FF55AA3ED9E4167FFB830B594712A83A4CD18613A8FB610E7EF64FD4CD4DB89C07D9BE06F100","orcidId":"0000-0002-1837-2086","documentHash":"6eae7a12-4058-4a7c-a70f-ea750d4adce6"}],"doi":"10.4324/9781003308096-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["augmentation","bioprinting","regenerative dentistry","regenerative medicine","tissue engineering"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

In this review, the authors discuss different bioprinting solutions and options in the context of the 4 factors of bone healing: structures or scaffolds, osteogenic cells, growth factors, and stabilization (diamond concept of healing), as well as the influence of a 5th factor - vascularization. Bone is a complex tissue; hence, bone bioprinting may require different technical approaches and mixed methods. Ultraviolet (UV) crosslinkable hydrogels, such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), are among the most promising bioinks; they are enhanced by hydroxyapatite or 1-2.5 mm beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) granules and porous scaffolds with recommended pore sizes greater than 300 μm. The advantages of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are their significant availability, low tumorigenicity, and great potential for differentiation into osteoblasts or endothelial cells (ECs). Although growth factors require advanced delivery systems, they provide excellent improvement in the functionality of printed tissues. A proper vasculature system supplies cells with oxygen and nutrients, removes waste products, promotes osteogenesis, prevents ischemic necrosis, and improves the mechanical properties of bone. With all of these aspects perfectly balanced and working in synergy, the clinical use of bioprinting is only a matter of time.

The anticancer properties of luteolin constitute a mosaic of pathways due to which this flavonoid influences cancer cells. Not only is it able to induce apoptosis and inhibit cancer cell proliferation, but it also suppresses angiogenesis and metastasis. Moreover, luteolin succeeds in cancer cell sensitization to therapeutically induced cytotoxicity. Nevertheless, apart from its promising role in chemoprevention, luteolin exhibits numerous potential utilizations in patients with conditions other than neoplasms, which include inflammatory skin diseases, diabetes mellitus, and COVID-19. This review aims to present the multidimensionality of the luteolin’s impact on both neoplastic and nonneoplastic diseases. When it comes to neoplasms, we intend to describe the complexity of the molecular mechanisms that underlay luteolin’s anticancer effectiveness, as well as to prove the usefulness of integrating this flavonoid in cancer therapy via the analysis of recent research on breast, colon, and lung cancer. Regarding nonneoplastic diseases, this review aims to emphasize the importance of researching the potential of luteolin in areas such as diabetology, virology, and dermatology as it summarizes the most important discoveries in those fields regarding its application."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456321","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.15995 [34 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/21/15995","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2144097076263e853be","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Sleziak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cfa250dc-76d8-4434-9b77-889a588c9e14"},{"objectId":"6630e2144097076263e853bd","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Stecko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b66444d1-edd1-4f3c-af5f-f77883090835"},{"objectId":"6630e2144097076263e853bc","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c1c5afd-2d74-4856-99f6-c226d6b028a9"},{"objectId":"6630e2144097076263e853bb","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sołtyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a778a4c-6258-4537-a71d-dccd827faeb2"},{"objectId":"6630e2144097076263e853ba","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Kaczor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"62fe0889-879a-4367-8200-4c3d6818c82e"},{"objectId":"6630e2144097076263e853b9","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Rakoczy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0d4df28-eec4-480b-a862-eee66f07ceca"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1eb2","name":"Julita","lastName":"Kulbacka","uuid":"89F5F3BEF56B4A64B9BC60A721EA54D63EC87BA8F04E9C7A00FDEACD5FB5BC2D2B9205307431052D0508373A186A177F5472803C6473FD2F53F30FE93DD5970F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8272-5440","documentHash":"b50ad7c8-2652-43fc-aed0-9e38646ceea2"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1415","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Baczyńska","uuid":"0D49D163A479AA0A702E2563AFDA45C981F362482AD5AEB17FC48CABE708AB8526838A63F448F2E850FCA34A25F7A75018FADB2DC1A0BA433D955F86DFFAC7EC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6781-6758","documentHash":"98a2219c-71f1-479b-8d91-5922e86c538d"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms242115995"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Reception of Cassius Dio’s Roman History in Pompey’s Chapter of John Xiphilinos' Epitome","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b362","mniswId":"200333","title":"Res Historica","doi":null,"issn":"2082-6060","eissn":"2449-8467","websiteLink":"http://reshistorica.umcs.lublin.pl/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"14d89146-5052-4da0-9ebf-532508bdd21a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9bfd8409707132d353e84","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e9bfd8409707132d353e85"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059456323","journalIssue":{"objectId":"658bfbc74097070a21eca196","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"56","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"5e092465-dbda-4a57-8dc5-240f2b9474ab"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"56","pagesFromTo":"45-87","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.17951/rh.2023.56.45-87","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9bfd8409707132d353e85","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Biały","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06d21d7b-f719-44df-88ec-0408baae5ef2"}],"doi":"10.17951/rh.2023.56.45-87"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sentinel node","lymph node metastasis","lymphadenectomy","cystectomy","bladder cancer","SPECT","CT"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

This study aimed to investigate whether radio-guided sentinel node (SLN) detection is a reliable technique for the perioperative localisation of potential lymphatic metastasis during cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Materials and Methods: We studied 54 patients with pT2-pT4 MIBC who underwent cystectomy with extended PLND (ePLND) augmented by the SLN technique. The identification of SLN was performed by preoperative SPECT/CT hybrid lymphoscintigraphy using peritumoral injection of nanocolloid-Tc-99m, followed by intraoperative navigation with a handheld γ-probe. All nodal specimens were collected separately and then fixed in formalin, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and examined by an experienced uropathologist. Results: A total of 1414 LNs were resected and examined for the presence of metastases. The mean number of harvested LNs was 26 (range: 11–50) per patient. In 51 of 54 patients, 192 SLNs were resected. In addition, 20/192 (10.4%) SLNs were located outside of the ePLND area. Overall, 72 metastatic LNs (LN+) were found in 22 of 54 patients (40.7%) and in 24/192 SLNs (12.5%). The SLN technique detected LN+ in 14 of 22 (64%) patients. The SLNs were the only sites of metastasis (SLN+ = LN+) in 6 of 22 (27.3%) LN+ patients, including two cases with foci located in the pararectal region. The diagnostic values for the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and false-negative rate for the SLN technique were 66.66%, 4.16%, 28.57%, and 33.33%, respectively. Extended lymphadenectomy and its combination with the SLN technique enabled the correct assessment in 96.3 and 100% of patients, respectively. Conclusions: The combination of ePLND and SLN provides a better pN assessment compared to ePLND alone. Although the SLN technique has restrictions that limit its diagnostic value, its use as an addition to lymphadenectomy allows for the visualisation of nonstandard lymph drainage pathways that may be potential metastatic routes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456325","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.3092 [12 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/9/3092","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1b04097076263e84636","name":"Karol","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5fbba72d-ddbd-44ed-af45-bb3910176ade"},{"objectId":"634f612b752340623bbe6655","name":"Adam","lastName":"Gurwin","uuid":"7231D10344EF07C49A3C4A89FE65F74D3BE24CD9AE367EEF9F4FA2B03383BE8DAF90D398E1B203E6A367F46B28A2D71A3DB19F1EA840A45AAADA9BF8F69EAC38","orcidId":"0000-0002-9711-6709","documentHash":"3801a1fd-cee9-4c44-853e-bac17ce0d212"},{"objectId":"6168e7a875234017e053d4b7","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Knecht-Gurwin","uuid":"EAFEFA7AF63A090859AB540AD4DAE35871F7984B8B55075BE6CB7ABCFACCD9A9A3D7CDDE7836A6EEB7F9B63C04847F15F15EB706B462E5E64B9DB73E7298E258","orcidId":"0000-0002-7107-1936","documentHash":"89bf642e-bc73-49e5-b08d-fe6d696997ce"},{"objectId":"5ecc82297523406a2b8ea5e8","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kiełb","uuid":"79CA0DF4E7E4B701A048EA6636BAADC5879B622E351A83D0937642391DA8B3A6BA28DA1F4EFE4653727F86C5525ABED83F777E7D2CBF2994E33C82BAF3405DAD","orcidId":"0000-0002-2291-2217","documentHash":"d8bd89e2-e945-4013-8b37-c19f92715cd1"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b02ba","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Małkiewicz","uuid":"F4F3E50567BC2918C95A8C6D9D2E0FB55A1C1642BE39F3B84F019A6AF650D97200382A3690626C7291B64FE946D54289F84673ECFDCACBC2E2EBA259C1F4A202","orcidId":"0000-0002-5933-3753","documentHash":"f3a194e9-5a15-4a20-80ed-07281ad5d4b4"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8eee","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":"FE9C4D23724D3D055D045282F9AD75FAB018A19DA85AE822459B00807DB4C4694A93AFC06467CDCBCF4A964D57A95272B7F072D375AB7EFF177F7F6C2609DCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1727-2283","documentHash":"98c9e9c8-1a51-4d6a-b2af-f010aba6a0be"},{"objectId":"5e70930b878c28a0473a1c2f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Hałoń","uuid":"AD80396A969D15F8E07528AE554AE33030B5E53460998C4656BC423CE3BC32FD6BD713CBC9F36CB36C97D4B6F295130E935E55F0BE149C4CEA8CA2D92C7995F9","orcidId":"0000-0003-4240-7899","documentHash":"feeaf9e1-d06e-4bc9-842f-c1a31cd24520"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1c06","name":"Diana","lastName":"Jędrzejuk","uuid":"A7C99030D7902CD2F4085FEB67C4E108A35770E48A2C66784C325D94958D7484D640BDB90D794587ECFA7A0AD9D2DF0554F7C29058BD3129875FDCCF19023010","orcidId":"0000-0001-7053-142X","documentHash":"70a0af2b-12a6-4b5c-a696-d193657947a5"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1281","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szydełko","uuid":"7DC38A63B4768AA5E153EF9E43D83AD135C49EC1F047EE18E5E98A81D52C20CE98D6BFDA8C262F9D622813C1C7EED898220A725F7398D2B73C322DF23A1ADC67","orcidId":"0000-0002-1360-0422","documentHash":"79ceced2-248c-4140-91ee-6f1c07dc3ed3"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394b47","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bolanowski","uuid":"D6BDEC0447FFC0B874EE0B10147B50E4454C85E87072EA305F1315AC36B10225E21A64B402C9F56B183705D748FA29CD88B3702D6B437881564452133204A03C","orcidId":"0000-0002-2360-6596","documentHash":"95ab512c-5e48-451e-9744-bed22aa52840"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12093092"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["veterinary ethics","qualitative and quantitative research designs","animal experimental model","steroid hormones"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

On the other hand, animals have their rights resulting from applicable legal acts, including Directive 2010/63/EU and, indirectly, the World Medical Association International Code of Medical Ethics (Helsinki Declaration, 1975, amended 2000). Thus, the question arises whether the credibility of the results of hormonal and orthodontic tests obtained so far and their usefulness for the human population is scientifically justified and worth sacrificing laboratory animals for. Especially that, according to statistical data, about 50% of laboratory animals are euthanized at the conclusion of the experiments. The aim of this article was to determine whether animal experiments are scientifically or morally justified in bringing significant evidence in studies that may validate the influence of changes in the concentration of female hormones secreted by the ovaries in various phases of the menstrual cycle in young patients on the duration of an increased tooth movement rate in orthodontic treatment. Papers reporting the results of the original research into female hormones, either natural or exogeneous ones, likely to alternate the orthodontic tooth movement rate were critically evaluated in terms of animal selection.

Among the several molecular mechanisms underlying EMS pathogenesis, increased negative insulin signalling regulation mediated by protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 B (PTP1B) has emerged as a critical axis in the development of liver insulin resistance and general metabolic distress associated to increased ER stress, inflammation and disrupted autophagy. Thus, the use of PTP1B selective inhibitors such as MSI-1436 might be considered as a golden therapeutic tool for the proper management of EMS and associated conditions. Therefore, the present investigation aimed at verifying the clinical efficacy of MSI-1436 systemic administration on liver metabolic balance, insulin sensitivity and inflammatory status in EMS affected horses. Moreover, the impact of MSI-1436 treatment on liver autophagy machinery and associated ER stress in liver tissue has been analysed.\r\n\r\nMethods: Liver explants isolated from healthy and EMS horses have been treated with MSI-1436 prior to gene and protein expression analysis of main markers mediating ER stress, mitophagy and autophagy. Furthermore, EMS horses have been intravenously treated with a single dose of MSI-1436, and evaluated for their metabolic and inflammatory status.\r\n\r\nResults: Clinical application of MSI-1436 to EMS horses restored proper adiponectin levels and attenuated the typical hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. Moreover, administration of MSI-1436 further reduced the circulating levels of key pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β and triggered the Tregs cells activation. At the molecular level, PTP1B inhibition resulted in a noticeable mitigation of liver ER stress, improvement of mitochondrial dynamics and consequently, a regulation of autophagic response. Similarly, short-term ex vivo treatment of EMS liver explants with trodusquemine (MSI-1436) substantially enhanced autophagy by upregulating the levels of HSC70 and Beclin-1 at both mRNA and protein level. Moreover, the PTP1B inhibitor potentiated mitophagy and associated expression of MFN2 and PINK1. Interestingly, inhibition of PTP1B resulted in potent attenuation of ER stress key mediators’ expression namely, CHOP, ATF6, HSPA5 and XBP1.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Presented findings shed for the first time promising new insights in the development of an MSI-1436-based therapy for proper equine metabolic syndrome intervention and may additionally find potential translational application to human metabolic syndrome treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456332","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1149610/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e785b87523406748fb8694","name":"LYNDA","lastName":"BOUREBABA","uuid":"E9E482563FE63E31FD25D3D5B3F1FE97F8C784FB74495DAFBEE514285948D7708ABC57D70A7A7210E8AB66B1FA91DAC4CF304A8A8A5BB6233A578F342B73A0C1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"963e7a14-47c1-4f88-ba64-cc93c7c9718d"},{"objectId":"602f9be49543c7410626f682","name":"Malwina","lastName":"Mularczyk","uuid":"5144D17724771F33080F54F9A1B0C2802518F9139120BCFB6EC3D0136EFC666C6554E5114824F93A877C3185E285A8F9A8C9F725023DDF84525E6113F5C3990E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8189-9545","documentHash":"a4fa34dd-fb26-4f62-8062-9fff72784ecc"},{"objectId":"602f5b739543c7410626f399","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Sikora","uuid":"4EF91695706AA0F622671AD0B82EA82161E3102A167181A4AEC2895421F81224F85B923259240EBA13F76BD957253B556702A9FB04E5C1D9736544B6AE75DBCC","orcidId":"0000-0002-9965-587X","documentHash":"027edaa9-a1c8-4fbf-8f44-71cea8de6be8"},{"objectId":"602f4b079543c7410626f2e3","name":"Ariadna","lastName":"Pielok","uuid":"C6078EEF5F2C0204CE537448F0572B9A512D9D4B08016DD7FDF4BCEBF342A0DFE4C362EE11A26E24A5DB16B0A3C3FC95DD18725A0464AAD7707BBAC93FB0DEE7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9371d858-d352-4573-88d9-bf1506af3519"},{"objectId":"5e70944a878c28a0473b9c1f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Serwotka-Suszczak","uuid":"3F32F72CF3AEC0297EE325A12FCD83D83F06FEAFAA81F6DE3973FF16E88DD20D1ACB4AD7D1D63CC722A1BC92F30DF5427FFD97D1D9E3A69464E7CA9D76030ECC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4553-0908","documentHash":"a1749336-dc96-4d9a-a499-0adb765be110"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e29a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Marycz","uuid":"232BD10216D5623A2C97AEE2B23109CFB6C3A3BD5B79AA43203A222A1A37A575D9EBD9FFFDABB7F4C32C3CDC7BA67C6A7DE4A8F0D86DC6A5DF0F1CF93573FCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3676-796X","documentHash":"927d7659-0c17-40c1-bed6-9f2cf8d61940"}],"doi":"10.3389/fendo.2023.1149610"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tefsir","Qur’an","Bible","orality","rhetoric","persuasion"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Oralność i retoryka świętych ksiąg : na przykładzie tatarskiego tefsiru - pierwszego przekładu Koranu na język słowiański (polski)","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a2e0","mniswId":"488004","title":"Poznan Polish Language Studies.

However, its role in the development of this cancer has not yet been precisely established. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of BCL11A at the mRNA and protein levels in NSCLC cases and non-malignant lung tissue (NMLT) and to determine the relationship between BCL11A expression and the clinicopathological factors and Ki-67, Slug, Snail and Twist. The localization and the level of BCL11A protein were examined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 259 cases of NSCLC, and 116 NMLT samples were prepared as tissue microarrays and using immunofluorescence (IF) in the following cell lines: NCI-H1703, A549 and IMR-90. The mRNA expression of BCL11A was determined using real-time PCR in 33 NSCLC cases, 10 NMLT samples and the cell lines. BCL11A protein expression was significantly higher in NSCLC cases compared to NMLT. Nuclear expression was found in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, while cytoplasmic expression was demonstrated in adenocarcinoma (AC) cells. Nuclear expression of BCL11A decreased with increasing malignancy grade and correlated positively with Ki-67 and Slug and Twist expression. The opposite relationships were found for the cytoplasmic expression of BCL11A. Nuclear expression of BCL11A in NSCLC cells may affect tumor cell proliferation and change their phenotype, thus promoting tumor progression."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456337","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.9848 [21 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/12/9848","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1624097076263e83dba","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kątnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d42e3175-b6ae-45e1-908a-df5e554aeeed"},{"objectId":"5e70948e878c28a0473bf845","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Ratajczak-Wielgomas","uuid":"EC900A4AE3ECA196CA503E47E4D6C94D6C7D61FAFADCEAE2EC21105616603EA8435D60FDC712C59E8411D005247FDF7657EC11F542C156897796C3A5ACBAD84A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6175-2204","documentHash":"432225db-e99d-4694-a0df-3c74c40509e0"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc677","name":"Anna","lastName":"Urbaniak","uuid":"98BA63F7C19325847F86E8B09D7002116719315AE16FA960B345732582F6EB2B8E1C1DEF717A9629D2291444B5F9BAE920F3310862E491A233D2832EB7525BBE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2803-0952","documentHash":"8efcb1f6-a4dc-457e-a7da-cdb017268f3a"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473b9f00","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Błasiak","uuid":"B06ACFC041296A751AE6E927CDC0CC96813711ECD6EBFE177086ABB54AA4704F69E4D687E98455A852350C644DEF0C559447030D22D8B13114A61A7DA1F15C32","orcidId":"0000-0002-5694-0638","documentHash":"caa8fedb-ed56-4ea3-92fd-48e7dcdd1d5b"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b649e","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Kmiecik","uuid":"416779DCB4274C75DB480E9537931F21E2B582706E9369C30F559EE48BC0173F9957EAB2A16E3B92FC5105CAD5E0DCC0F07E7A7F0F14DF785CD91F20E91FBDA4","orcidId":"0000-0002-6498-717X","documentHash":"61a68136-eed6-4846-acce-59102055f792"},{"objectId":"5e709416878c28a0473b6004","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Piotrowska","uuid":"10F0315411ADAB6C85453C530E770E65398AF500904C26DD132829A803CF7533D457AFE49C938B2AE89591339CF1769722811B27641A2531DFD336A95A69CD19","orcidId":"0000-0003-4093-7386","documentHash":"5d8cb456-e8a3-4d5f-8435-0ce1bb8fe385"},{"objectId":"5e7093b3878c28a0473af6e2","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gomułkiewicz","uuid":"266A25CA98D216264F5F3921ADDD6DF67851BCAC088E05A1DFDC3986A8210E56EE994299624BD4ADC1BA53A0F553272C2A93F0DB8358D02C8F1A223AE3C9CFD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2256-1055","documentHash":"36f5ba29-63c8-487b-abed-2a69c7e81302"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473acf9f","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Glatzel-Plucińska","uuid":"3B9616F96E4712E29C1BE611146EB9077015EA666EFF9248F00AADB4D6988B33B2BB63D740BF10C6F25E6E5D3B0D8D7577EDB2FAEA7BEC89FC3C4D1F6B45D65B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6901-1240","documentHash":"eb504e2d-eb2d-4e12-9b8c-3ee44119bf90"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8f1d","name":"Jędrzej","lastName":"Grzegrzółka","uuid":"046310A57A673C0F85C061444ACC555E82FEBB2F49A07C7EBA7155B3CDBD3FCA0703C6F83D1379551146DF2CC82CE601EA04C34802F138FC7E3E4FD1BCB5D30E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1548-279X","documentHash":"03a1bafb-fa4f-4297-aed9-5d944f25f971"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394b8c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Dzięgiel","uuid":"6BBB67F13D61C9909E916C46FF6E1EB81311F1502C4B9193E2874230702D463836F0AAD2AF9FF7ED50E94AEE59C5B0403D4C8B950CDEBAD8E7B531767C9952FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8292-1385","documentHash":"0c224c22-810f-4a80-af49-e0b135a76cc1"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms24129848"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["burden of disease","cross-cultural","disorders of gut-brain interaction","epidemiology","prevalence"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Achieving worldwide sampling necessitated use of two different surveying methods: In-person household interviews (9 countries) and Internet surveys (26 countries). Two countries, China and Turkey, were surveyed with both methods. This paper examines the differences in the survey results with the two methods, as well as likely reasons for those differences. MethodsThe two RFGES survey methods are described in detail, and differences in DGBI findings summarized for household versus Internet surveys globally, and in more detail for China and Turkey. Logistic regression analysis was used to elucidate factors contributing to these differences. ResultsOverall, DGBI were only half as prevalent when assessed with household vs Internet surveys. Similar patterns of methodology-related DGBI differences were seen within both China and Turkey, but prevalence differences between the survey methods were dramatically larger in Turkey. No clear reasons for outcome differences by survey method were identified, although greater relative reduction in bowel and anorectal versus upper gastrointestinal disorders when household versus Internet surveying was used suggests an inhibiting influence of social sensitivity. ConclusionsThe findings strongly indicate that besides affecting data quality, manpower needs and data collection time and costs, the choice of survey method is a substantial determinant of symptom reporting and DGBI prevalence outcomes. This has important implications for future DGBI research and epidemiological research more broadly."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456339","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"art.e14583 [19 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nmo.14583","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a2e","name":"Olafur S.","lastName":"Palsson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a640213e-c935-4176-bcab-006241e58e58"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a2d","name":"Johann P.","lastName":"Hreinsson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59dcfae3-d592-47d9-bbbf-5b85fde9a0c5"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a2c","name":"Jun","lastName":"Song","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6fe3b24-5889-42e5-b684-4626f274eeb2"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a2b","name":"Dan","lastName":"Huang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"363958be-07cc-4163-8fc8-80525df7bb8e"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a2a","name":"Nalan","lastName":"Unal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"353ed8d2-7be9-46b5-b298-64f8f06b5911"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a29","name":"Murat","lastName":"Buyruk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c966f26-8345-4db8-9ec9-99890726badd"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a28","name":"Sandie","lastName":"Thomson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b771363e-5800-487d-89ce-b97be96be7f2"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a27","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Stefanyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db115c6b-c05b-4ea1-948f-df88e8d013c2"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a26","name":"Nitesh","lastName":"Pratap","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3b97254-fa7f-44fb-9d52-31300ea3afb1"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a25","name":"Pierre","lastName":"Poitras","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3540a4a9-2c23-4f54-b0c6-bc645a138297"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a24","name":"Iradj","lastName":"Maleki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7880924c-5aa3-4259-8ec9-69b45f11251f"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a23","name":"Rutaba","lastName":"Khatun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5897b418-d559-403b-afe4-28b83311ae54"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a22","name":"Ammar Hassanzadeh","lastName":"Keshteli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0bcc5d04-2d47-456b-9458-a9c9c5564286"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a21","name":"Motoyori","lastName":"Kanazawa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb8a8ea9-1b2a-4eb3-b507-d3fa524d1fbc"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a20","name":"Ram","lastName":"Dickman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c12e7472-3b8e-4e57-994a-9f34b5acbc1f"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a1f","name":"Valeria","lastName":"Costa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a37780d-bd19-4005-abc3-de25f46a0fe6"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a1e","name":"Aurelio","lastName":"Lopez‐Colombo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07e6c87e-00fa-4a2e-a16f-e753d9f91c9c"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a1d","name":"Reuben K.","lastName":"Wong","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"086b317f-e275-4116-88e9-f43f32427e85"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a1c","name":"Stephen","lastName":"Vanner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"efc440b6-8299-4b9f-a724-20adc93b70e1"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a1b","name":"Ari Fahrial","lastName":"Syam","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81ffaf2c-3c67-4ead-a55a-cacd3a78f02d"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a1a","name":"Mashiko","lastName":"Setshedi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6ec59cd6-b3e6-41e2-b570-6beeb26bd5de"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a19","name":"Javier","lastName":"Santos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f6b35f01-b19c-48ca-a5cd-18eaa862689d"},{"objectId":"6630e2414097076263e85a18","name":"M.

The present study aims to identify circular economy (CE) determinants that conditionally increase/decrease energy use to remain sustainable. It focuses on the linkage between energy consumption and circular economy in the European Union (EU) member states. In the econometric panel model specifications, two alternative endogenous variables are considered, i.e., total energy consumption and energy consumption from renewable sources. The results demonstrate that the selected CE indicators decreased the former and increased the latter. The data covered the period from 2010–2019.

Many parents opt for the care provided by midwives who specialize in supporting home births. This retrospective study is based on 41,335 EMS emergency calls to women in advanced pregnancy, of which 209 concerned home birth situations documenting obstetrical emergencies over four years (January 2018 to December 2022), of which 60 involved the assistance of a midwife. Data were obtained from the Polish Central System for Emergency Medical Services Missions Monitoring, encompassing all EMS interventions in pregnant women. The most frequent reason for emergency calls for obstetrical emergencies with the assistance of a midwife was a failure to separate the placenta or incomplete afterbirth (18 cases; 30%), followed by perinatal haemorrhage (12 cases; 20%) and deterioration of the newborn’s condition (8 cases; 13%). Paramedic-staffed EMS teams conducted most interventions (43 cases; 72%), with only 17 (28%) involving the presence of a physician. Paramedics with extensive medical training and the ability to provide emergency care are in a unique position that allows them to play a pivotal role in supporting planned out-of-hospital births.

During the flavoring process, the cut tobacco is endowed with a unique flavor to stabilize the production quality. Most of the flavoring process in tobacco enterprises is finished in the drum, and the internal structure of the drum (including the number, angle and installation position of the baffle plate) will affect the flavoring effect and efficiency. Therefore, this paper studied the particle behavior of the cut tobacco in the drum based on molecular dynamics analysis to explore the influence of the drum structure on the flavoring effect and to find the optimal structure parameters. Based on the discrete element simulation, an original rotary drum is structurally modified twice, and the corresponding field test is carried out to evaluate the performance of the modified drum. The results suggest that the flavoring effect is significantly improved through the structural modification, the content of menthol and citronellol are increased by 24.70% and 23.74% in the first test after modification, and reached 83.2% and 85.4% of the theoretical value respectively, and the error of the running time in the drum between the simulation and the test result is only 6.3%."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456360","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eae808409707216edb55e6","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"146","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"3177c7a5-a9ab-4580-9749-20e4e3bc7bd3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"146","pagesFromTo":"715-732","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955799722004118?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eae7cc40970762632bbd5c","name":"Lei","lastName":"Deng","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e699c643-2968-4fd5-89f7-af9958e3555a"},{"objectId":"65eae7cc40970762632bbd5b","name":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba737d74-8bbe-49a7-a6f7-381d4a92ecfb"},{"objectId":"65eae7cc40970762632bbd5a","name":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27dd7873-9c20-4a18-83aa-4c859ab10f2f"},{"objectId":"65eae7cc40970762632bbd59","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Gardoni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d932159-2237-4e69-b074-46405d86fc2d"},{"objectId":"65eae7cc40970762632bbd58","name":"Tianqin","lastName":"Lin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac4a1f14-0f7f-4670-965c-704fdb6dc18a"},{"objectId":"65eae7cc40970762632bbd57","name":"Hebin","lastName":"Liao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fd5f7d3-da18-4df7-8af7-bb15151a044d"},{"objectId":"643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","name":"ZHIXIONG","lastName":"LI","uuid":"702756DCCCD3492C7F8BEE876ECFF5320F12A813CAE78A9EF23A2EFD6E44E8974DA4C0167114F64ABED373F069177BE3B59258C22EAA67DBD18E6C027CAFAFBA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59b058ba-526e-4828-8f00-3046d9f8887c"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.enganabound.2022.11.009"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aortic stenosis","Transcatheter aortic valve replacement","Transcatheter heart valve","Balloon-expandable prosthesis","VARC-3 consensus"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

A group of 29 patients was included in a retrospective study. All the participants underwent arthroscopic reconstruction of osteochondral lesions using hyaluronate-based scaffolds. The study group used standard questionnaires to self-assess their condition before surgery and at the time of completion. Despite the aforementioned, all the participants fulfilled two original questionnaires on postoperative rehabilitation and vitamin D supplementation. Significant pain reduction (mean NRS 1.83 vs. 7.21, p < 0.0001) and functional improvement (mean Lysholm score 82.38 vs. 40.38, p < 0.0001; mean OKS 40.2 vs. 23.1, p < 0.0001) were found. No differences in pain reduction and functional improvement were seen between genders. The impact of post-operative rehabilitation and vitamin D supplementation on clinical outcomes was found to be statistically nonsignificant.

Although passive satellite remote sensing has already demonstrated its capabilities in accurate crop development monitoring, its limitations related to sunlight and cloud cover significantly restrict real-time temporal monitoring resolution. Considering synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology, which is independent of the Sun and clouds, SAR remote sensing can be a perfect alternative to passive remote sensing methods. However, a variety of SAR sensors and delivered SAR indices present different performances in such context for different vegetation species. Therefore, this work focuses on comparing various SAR-derived indices from C-band and (Sentinel-1) and X-band (TerraSAR-X) data with the in situ information (phenp; pgy development, vegetation height and soil moisture) in the context of tracking the phenological development of corn, winter wheat, rye, canola, and potato. For this purpose, backscattering coefficients in VV and VH polarizations (\uD835\uDF0E0\uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC49, \uD835\uDF0E0\uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC3B), interferometric coherence, and the dual pol radar vegetation index (DpRVI) were calculated. To reduce noise in time series data and evaluate which filtering method presents a higher usability in SAR phenology tracking, signal filtering, such as Savitzky–Golay and moving average, with different parameters, were employed. The achieved results present that, for various plant species, different sensors (Sentinel-1 or TerraSAR-X) represent different performances. For instance, \uD835\uDF0E0\uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC3B of TerraSAR-X offered higher consistency with corn development (r = 0.81), while for canola \uD835\uDF0E0\uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC3B of Sentinel-1 offered higher performance (r = 0.88). Generally, \uD835\uDF0E0\uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC49, \uD835\uDF0E0\uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC3B performed better than DpRVI or interferometric coherence. Time series filtering makes it possible to increase an agreement between phenology development and SAR-delivered indices; however, the Savitzky–Golay filtering method is more recommended. Besides phenological development, high correspondences can be found between vegetation height and some of SAR indices. Moreover, in some cases, moderate correlation was found between SAR indices and soil moisture."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456369","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/20/4996","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaf1df40970762632c2baf","name":"Marta","lastName":"Pasternak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"45559eed-f8c5-4ff6-89f9-4f409fc7c98a"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cc3","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Pawłuszek-Filipiak","uuid":"EB2CEB5F2BA2743F2490B16DB767063ED6AA6E8AB19E69E2422264290DB59BE404533A33A66271C92A1893204F039985A6F23ADD1DB24226388784E32BF9C6C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2162-371X","documentHash":"a5b2da57-8267-4a03-8a2f-aeb97764ff62"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs15204996"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["genetic algorithm","cross-section images","flute parameters","double-walled","corrugated board"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9c0","65eee2234097076263b904b1"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6f4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Deciphering Double-Walled Corrugated Board Geometry Using Image Analysis and Genetic Algorithms","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"Sensors","doi":null,"issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-3210","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"80ff8bca-a845-44fd-adcb-a436c0342b72"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eee2234097076263b904af","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9c0","65eee2234097076263b904b1","5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6f4"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Corrugated board, widely used in the packing industry, is a recyclable and durable material. Its strength and cushioning, influenced by geometry, environmental conditions like humidity and temperature, and paper quality, make it versatile. Double-walled (or five-ply) corrugated board, comprising two flutes and three liners, enhances these properties. This study introduces a novel approach to analyze five-layered corrugated board, extending a previously published algorithm for single-walled boards. Our method focuses on measuring the layer and overall board thickness, flute height, and center lines of each layer. Through the integration of image processing and genetic algorithms, the research successfully developed an algorithm for precise geometric feature identification of double-walled boards. Images were recorded using a special device with a sophisticated camera and image sensor for detailed corrugated board cross-sections. Demonstrating high accuracy, the method only faced limitations with very deformed or damaged samples. This research contributes significantly to quality control in the packaging industry and paves the way for further automated material analysis using advanced machine learning and image sensors. It emphasizes the importance of sample quality and suggests areas for algorithm refinement in order to enhance robustness and accuracy.\n."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456371","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eee2234097076263b904b0","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"24","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"a693b044-40c4-46a4-ab7c-4dcf1328960f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1772-1 - 1772-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/6/1772","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eee2234097076263b904b1","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Rogalka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75bef2a8-45c4-401e-93cc-833703d25b2e"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9c0","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Grabski","uuid":"CD94449BAF1D39CDE57040471AEA47853D5320D7C563D73D9C9A493460F6739317388244DAD40A1F49C7FA1A435A624238660AF6B7F242A57A337E373E66918D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0553-1084","documentHash":"9246d700-756f-4649-858e-1a0039d18b74"},{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6f4","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Garbowski","uuid":"C2B4DE757D8886907DAD1487B338EB3FFEFC81745770C595B50FE00A4709A2FF2A90E163029C241915F2629083E468C343504A15B14819FB7702EFA9344EBBF0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9588-2514","documentHash":"3b0e42a7-4e11-459a-813b-c6de44def90c"}],"doi":"10.3390/s24061772"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lactones","biocatalysis","Absidia glauca","cytotoxic activity","microbial hydroxylation"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Microbial Transformations of Halolactones and Evaluation of Their Antiproliferative Activity","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eefe814097076263b99dcd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709264878c28a047394d56","65eefe814097076263b99dce","5e7091fc878c28a04738e247","5e709447878c28a0473b997e"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The microbial transformations of lactones with a halogenoethylocyclohexane moiety were performed in a filamentous fungi culture.

A high-fat diet (HFD) leading to obesity is a significant extrinsic factor in developing vascular atherosclerosis. In this study, we evaluated the effects of palmitic acid (PA) as a representative of long-chain saturated fatty acids (LCSFA) commonly present in HFDs, along with endotoxin (LPS; lipopolysaccharide) and uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS), on human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs).\r\nMethods: HUVECs viability was measured based on tetrazolium salt metabolism, and cell morphology was assessed with fluorescein-phalloidin staining of cells’ actin cytoskeleton. The effects of simultaneous treatment of endothelial cells with PA, LPS, and IS on nitro-oxidative stress in vascular cells were evaluated quantitatively with fluorescent probes. The expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule VCAM-1, E-selectin, and occludin, an essential tight junction protein, in HUVECs treated with these metabolites was evaluated in Western blot.\r\nResults: PA, combined with LPS and IS, did not influence HUVECs viability but induced stress on actin fibers and focal adhesion complexes. Moreover, PA combined with LPS significantly enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in HUVECs but decreased nitric oxide (NO) generation. PA also considerably increased the expression of VCAM-1 and E-selectin in HUVECs treated with LPS or IS but decreased occludin expression.\r\nConclusion: Palmitic acid enhances the toxic effect of metabolic endotoxemia on the vascular endothelium."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456379","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"399-409","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.dovepress.com/the-role-of-palmitic-acid-in-the-co-toxicity-of-bacterial-metabolites--peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-VHRM","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e4824097076263e86dac","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Bożemska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fc63cef-14ff-4fbf-a101-c2aa3baf8ad0"},{"objectId":"6630e4824097076263e86dab","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Choroszy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fec97074-da34-4358-aeec-ad5568361af1"},{"objectId":"5fc4f5e5085dcb1e6ae0b97a","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"3B2136806C6B3E2F5316DA821359B256181B93ED75206E6ECD285C27D6ECF29AFC7BE789E5C0FF7E5487208DCF81244DCF057733963BA5AC2FE3188D0F99A600","orcidId":"0000-0002-5364-6556","documentHash":"36782b99-96e6-407e-9814-36743c7d42b3"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa8e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wawrzyńska","uuid":"990AE0B5FE544CBCD354B55347163FD50B4D79D79CFA03C9FCF3F45B9CAEB837E67D7673F0B5169EDB666B7BFD7C6B9690B98D8D709F864D9CF702D5F01C74DC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6855-5510","documentHash":"5fee8373-6a3f-4c71-aee4-aa41167accef"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a1540","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Środa-Pomianek","uuid":"CC010C658E9E7BDC4B308C7A91318C661C69A228FED7E9CE7A901BC3BF1D90A30E7F76AE9C8DF7DD8F89E934CD55327F74CA29FBDF1A084AFE3E67DB321B766C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3454-5044","documentHash":"c46bb6f2-2053-4862-a5cd-731e6269218c"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12fb","name":"Beata","lastName":"Sobieszczańska","uuid":"E197F3168593B0F8BF8FDF0C68FD78EAF58FB916313FCC9928EC79AEDCE918F8A213B8B2579F9449FAE7160010379319BCCF55C4637919A87CC4680502D54CF7","orcidId":"0000-0002-3355-2480","documentHash":"ba2218a0-3554-41d7-9045-1b2aab0d1f36"}],"doi":"10.2147/vhrm.s408897"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65ba0cfc4097075661bd33e4","doi":null,"title":"Encyklopedia

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anthropometric measurements and body composition of newborns born to mothers with gestational diabetes in comparison to newborns born to mothers with normal glucose tolerance in pregnancy, in the first week of their life. Maternal factors affecting the gestational period were also evaluated.\r\n\r\nMaterial and methods: The study included 70 participants: neonates born to mothers with gestational diabetes (GDM) and neonates born to healthy mothers (non-GDM). A set of statistical methods (e.g., ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, Chi-square test, regression, cluster analysis) was used to compare data between the study groups and to find their association with maternal factors.\r\n\r\nResults: Our approach resulted in statistically significant classification (p < 0.05) by maternal history of hypothyroidism, weight gain during pregnancy and diagnosis of GDM. Newborns of mothers diagnosed with both GDM and hypothyroidism had lower birth weight and fat mass than newborns of mothers without GDM nor hypothyroidism (p < 0.05), however this finding might be associated with high incidence of excessive gestational weight gain among healthy mothers. No differences in body composition were found between the study groups on account of maternal GDM only (p > 0.05).\r\n\r\nConclusions: Thus, well-controlled gestational diabetes mellitus as an individual factor does not significantly affect neonatal anthropometric measurements and body composition.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456386","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"94","pagesFromTo":"119-128","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.viamedica.pl/ginekologia_polska/article/view/87271","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9e88","name":"Matylda","lastName":"Czosnykowska-Łukacka","uuid":"E6C25B14270A66ED0703F0CC55868E931E5F540FC1EA8750A4F8F74934E46969BA19C063555084C36F41019164688F11E78766B0B0A5B78FB41088330229BDB4","orcidId":"0000-0002-5483-5842","documentHash":"09bd8c23-4610-4051-98db-c66c7bdf3cbf"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12d4","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Królak-Olejnik","uuid":"324D17983A2E0D906FFDB78FA7464E746116B1EAC426321B8C1BEB1D1F77615D1DC6E0EF6F171B74EBDC9C55683500AD3BB02696E355DD47038F081F08069705","orcidId":"0000-0002-6493-0333","documentHash":"48006c10-c5b7-4fb6-9d2f-d0cb266b8ba5"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a11da","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Karcz","uuid":"8C67EFC08DC93EBC87658D5A0523A910CD23F5245A667F1D2369E2665A2DF97CCBE49B86CA6238C3191E665571B4C652275F2DEA4B0070E1A6025A64F7AB0F0E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4271-2626","documentHash":"3eba64f8-6c4c-42a0-889e-89684ea83765"}],"doi":"10.5603/gp.a2021.0249"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Wobec coraz większej powszechności i rozwoju koncepcji implanto-protetycznych gabinety stomatologiczne proponują pacjentom bezzębnym rozwiązania alternatywne do klasycznych protez osiadających. Jednak w przypadkach występowania przeciwskazań natury medycznej lub ekonomicznej, zaopatrzenie pacjenta w konwencjonalne protezy całkowite osiadające jest wciąż złotym standardem. Celem pracy była analiza piśmiennictwa dotycząca różnych metod wykonawstwa protez całkowitych oraz ich porównania. Uwzględniono metodę wrocławską, konwencjonalną, metodę biofunkcjonalną oraz technologie cyfrowe. Przeprowadzono analizę artykułów wyszukanych z bazy PubMed: między 2012 – 2022r. Wpisywano słowa kluczowe: „protezy całkowite”, „metoda wrocławska”, „technologia CAD/CAM w wykonawstwie protez”, oraz „metoda BPS”. Stwierdzono, że wybór najlepszej metody wykonania protez całkowitych dla każdego pacjenta jest złożony i uzależniony zarówno od aspektów morfologicznych, jak i psychologicznych pacjenta. Nie każdy bowiem pacjent z warunkami do ekstensywnej protezy będzie w stanie zaadaptować się do poszerzonej płyty protezy wykonanej metodą wrocławską. W przypadku pacjentów w zaawansowanym wieku, z problemami w dostępie do gabinetu stomatologicznego, metodą z wyboru może okazać się metoda konwencjonalna lub metoda cyfrowego wycisku dzięki skróconej liczbie wizyt w porównaniu do metody wrocławskiej. Z kolei oceniając parametry estetyczno-wytrzymałościowe, BPS wyróżnia się zautomatyzowanym protokołem w postępowaniu kliniczno-laboratoryjnym, ograniczając błędy ludzkie. Dzięki technologiom CAD/CAM, protezy wytwarzane tymi technikami dorównują lub nawet przewyższą klasyczne metody, pod kątem parametrów funkcjonalnych, jak i estetycznych i prawdopodobnie będą wkrótce je zastępować. Czynnikiem, który istotnie ogranicza możliwości obecnych skanerów jest brak możliwości rejestracji podatności błony śluzowej – stanowi to jeden z kluczowych elementów, ograniczający tę technologię."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Providing prosthetic rehabilitation by means of prosthetic replacements is one of the priorities in dental practice. Thanks to the accessibility and development of new implantological concepts and materials, today edentate patients are offered alternatives to conventional complete dentures. In the presence of medical contraindications or financial obstacles, however, traditional complete dentures remain a gold standard. The aim of this article was to review literature concerning different methods of fabricating complete dentures and perform their comparison. The following methods were taken into consideration: the Wroclawska method, the conventional method, the Biofunctional method and computer aided technologies. The data was collected from PubMed search engine between 2012 and 2022. The Key words used for the search were: „complete dentures”, „CAD/CAM complete dentures” and „the BPS method”. It was found that the choice of the best method of making complete dentures for each patient is complex and depends on both morphological and psychological aspects of the patient. Not every patient will be able to adapt to the extended prosthesis plate made using the Wrocław method; in some elderly patients, whose access to the dental office may be limited, the method of choice may be the conventional or the digital impression method due to the fewer number of visits compared to the Wrocław method. Still, when evaluating the aesthetics and strength parameters, BPS is characterized by an automated protocol in clinical and laboratory procedures, reducing the possibility of human error. Thanks to CAD/CAM technologies, prostheses produced with these techniques match or even surpass standard methods in terms of functional and aesthetic parameters, and will probably replace them soon. One factor, which significantly restricts the scope of modern scanners, is the inability to register the condition of the mucous membrane; it is one of the key downsides of this technology."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456388","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"73","pagesFromTo":"45-56","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.protetstomatol.pl/Metody-wroclawska-i-tradycyjna-wykonywania-protez-calkowitych-na-tle-najnowoczesniejszych,161057,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e97c4097076263e8a025","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Dec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a49e638-3014-4914-af34-9191f06bac61"},{"objectId":"5e70936b878c28a0473a91d4","name":"Edward","lastName":"Kijak","uuid":"3EA472A2BF921E4022D5366BDCCC8AF785549FA89EEB7A2DBA7DAB6896F041378B4A31D6EF31ABDDB7B53986D67F32347A0E25E7B07A5D0936F441FD675A01CB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4110-5987","documentHash":"1c73fcfa-87d9-47a4-a52d-db7c420050ad"}],"doi":"10.5114/ps/161057"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["camera recording","polysomnography","sleep bruxism","sleep disturbances","video-polysomnography"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The purpose of the study was to determine if a camera is necessary for the polysomnographic evaluation of sleep bruxism and how sleep bruxism parameters change when a camera is not utilised. The study material was actual polysomnographic recordings made in the years 2017–2020. A total of 199 single-night video-polysomnographic recordings of patients who were suspected of having sleep bruxism were chosen at random. The first analysis involved the evaluation of the video recording, while in the second video recording was not used. The findings revealed that all the examined sleep bruxism indices had statistically significantly higher values for the recordings made without the use of a camera. According to the findings, noncamera recordings had decreased sensitivity and specificity when the criteria of bruxism and mild-to-moderate bruxism were taken into account, and decreased sensitivity in the case of the criterion of severe bruxism. Sleep efficiency, the apnea/hypopnea index, and arousals had independent effects on the bruxism episode index value in the analysis of noncamera recordings. In conclusion, camera-based polysomnography still appears to be the most reliable way to assess the severity of sleep bruxism, particularly in patients who also report other sleep disturbances. The presence of symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, insomnia, or other sleep disorders should prompt us to use camera-based diagnostics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456391","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"art.e13858 [7 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.13858","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e5754097076263e8865e","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Błaszczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cdea3143-fcaa-4f60-9da2-4a93dd395ea0"},{"objectId":"5ecc82767523406a2b8ea5e9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Michałek-Zrąbkowska","uuid":"E75048882D4B0542BBC0345A05852295728855AFF7B4462B71411321B0A54083749DF1E8AB25BA89CCE40CA6B0B93B7D847E28B4ED1420628E64042AD6BB1CB0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9740-011X","documentHash":"718d3bda-2ae4-4f05-a912-1c2e28fa1e5e"},{"objectId":"5e70948e878c28a0473bf7ee","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wojakowska","uuid":"9608F2F967B828892E98041320BEF037523632025ED391957920F1218BB5D611FCEF6FD109B8342537FD093F2E6FF703A255CC5A63F782CA5891ED4724BECA4B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8699-6448","documentHash":"63971868-fd3e-4303-9cd8-4a80a52da533"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46e7","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Gać","uuid":"7C623C664249C7F2E9429F39BE3807EF40E01176F160F5888C8CC8BEFB4ACD2FB6DFA650BDA38D0E909F5324A3A07444DF6FDA59AF72D13ABA218D98D48509A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8366-0239","documentHash":"200bcb0c-102d-40bd-a86a-2a309102a1ac"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af24f","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Smardz","uuid":"E3E0D60063A7F468CAB1D93D661A43B4B71190E53B02F2007B8131B3711FB8F0194FA1A794E9FF47C9AD525FC3685E0F93CC00105E322C5DAA368319283942AA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0004-3134","documentHash":"e1fcf57c-ac6a-4800-8d93-be151ab4775a"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1f18","name":"Helena","lastName":"Martynowicz","uuid":"4E05962BA4513F438D25F4C100113C716C9B79792E33B8A72EE8445868166C063EC9258EFF44D5689E91CFD57F798439E01DCE55B1860946C1DF48C85DF710A2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1283-8460","documentHash":"06ae6407-b4b0-40a3-8a63-3ab9b0fa1e28"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1eee","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Poręba","uuid":"FBC0CF8DA48A626576FB4D809D93B3C1E9248B5AB24EF083B41459AD2904FFB64C3CB1937F9511356EF75FB721FCC4473E355D644AFB0EAD5DE1C8F51293A416","orcidId":"0000-0002-7217-7070","documentHash":"04697c74-eed8-42f7-95e1-badd682f02f6"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1342","name":"Mieszko","lastName":"Więckiewicz","uuid":"FA7EB40C92CDD16785E548D822F7EAB28489FCD3156C09A32DC9552FCD608535F0375C279E4DAFFB71391F2DD24377F500607118E88498C41E15A0411B1BCA5C","orcidId":"0000-0003-4953-7143","documentHash":"b6e1e483-3996-459d-a8d7-45739fc39fed"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e508","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"CD71868FC2D388FEA87DCFCFCA0D64D78F08A5C9B1CE4F6EEC31FE1E616B99C9AB5C7869D136364AE6528645197395647BE88502530F9ACF38F458501918360A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6610-2008","documentHash":"7e30072c-efe4-4b6a-b5ac-d5fd1ebbd5a6"}],"doi":"10.1111/jsr.13858"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rivers","riparian vegetation","hydraulic flow conditions","stream turbulence"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hydraulic Effect of Vegetation Zones in Open Channels: An Experimental Study of the Distribution of Turbulence","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eefdb54097076263b99bb1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e1bd","65eefdb54097076263b99bb2"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The development of vegetation in riverbeds is an important part of river engineering, and an in-depth understanding of its hydraulic influence is greatly needed. Our research focuses primarily on common reed (Phragmites australis) in riverbeds. To date, little is known about the hydraulic impact of the Phragmites australis reed and both field and laboratory data are still very scarce. Consequently, the main goal of our study was to evaluate the effect of vegetation zones on the spatial distribution of turbulence. Based on laboratory measurements of local instantaneous velocities, the values of the turbulence intensity (degree) Tu were determined, and its spatial distribution was illustrated. Analysis of the results showed that the relatively dense clusters of plants (reeds) act as “openwork deflectors” of the current and very clearly shape its spatial distribution. This can also be observed in the case of the distribution of the turbulence parameter Tu. For example, in the case of the development of riparian vegetation in the form of quasi-triangular communities of common reed (Phragmites australis) located alternately, there is a channelization of the flow, but also spatial changes in its character that occur. This work only presents results for preliminary hydraulic tests for Phragmites reed. These experiments should also be continued for other species of flexible riparian vegetation such as wicker. In the laboratory, the hydraulic influence of only triangle-shaped vegetation zones has been studied. Therefore, there is also a need for further hydraulic studies on vegetation zones of shapes other than triangular, e.g., rectangular, as well as vegetation zones with irregular shapes The authors see the need for such research and have already planned its continuation. Research on the interactions between vegetation and the structure of water flow in the riverbed is a very important aspect of contemporary trends in river environment management. Conscious, planned, and model-tested locating (or removing) of vegetation in a stream allows for shaping hydraulic and morphological conditions, thus controlling the processes of erosion, transport, and accumulation of debris."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456393","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/1/337","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eefdb54097076263b99bb2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wolski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aaa56484-240e-494f-a3ce-be066912d85a"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1bd","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Tymiński","uuid":"D500BDA165C2B53A5DE9E1B7BF7CDA4EDFDA51448C70E48A08ADEC3F9BA2456FFA2B4F1E465B366C0F8FE1ADE71A6BA4A9DA9898B6B6FCDB23931210ECD5AF93","orcidId":"0000-0001-7613-6770","documentHash":"df69661e-06d0-40ca-a0c3-7a87c1f2de51"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16010337"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","uid":"bGdC_bzKT-HVRZ9O1mobrEA","uuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","parentUuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","rootUuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","name":"Pomorski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936c878c28a0473a92b1","5e70936b878c28a0473a91a0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Associations of neurodevelopmental risk factors with psychosis proneness: Findings from a non-clinical sample of young adults.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477770","mniswId":"4183","title":"Comprehensive Psychiatry","doi":null,"issn":"0010-440X","eissn":"1532-8384","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6013ad62-911a-4de0-8f7d-ccf8a0352b46"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65df5fe640970762632ab56d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674f77dbfdbe8357174d6f53","674f77dbfdbe8357174d6f54","674f77dbfdbe8357174d6f55","5e70936c878c28a0473a92b1","5e70936b878c28a0473a91a0","674f77dbfdbe8357174d6f56"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059456395","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"123","pagesFromTo":"art. id. 152385","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"674f77dbfdbe8357174d6f56","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Gawęda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e87e0c8b-4954-492e-81a5-3a0b7dc06338"},{"objectId":"674f77dbfdbe8357174d6f55","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbeaf3c3-ad49-452a-8260-bf877a897298"},{"objectId":"674f77dbfdbe8357174d6f54","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Frydecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"185b7d3a-4098-49f9-beea-03d05fbdc7d7"},{"objectId":"674f77dbfdbe8357174d6f53","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Misiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d87fa790-e861-483e-819e-712a49a2d5d2"},{"objectId":"5e70936c878c28a0473a92b1","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Samochowiec","uuid":"CEDF9BD1ADD8A712851B0DF0F90B355C1D29522194FD82AC99C7680400C0D1F3B6F9C93366F6AAF4410FB28BC2299732A8B765C5ABD1B63C888579343F296514","orcidId":"0000-0003-1438-583X","documentHash":"d984b3a7-e227-4421-8d64-06c1d10408bb"},{"objectId":"5e70936b878c28a0473a91a0","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Jabłoński","uuid":"734F8BD17C96011406DE6FAB487FF6867E0F0CF969B03F11F840043E115E471017C4EBA59D627AEF91D81F2FED3E96FEE00A08B323FA865B04573FE0A800CDD0","orcidId":"0000-0001-9580-0905","documentHash":"3e305e9e-3918-4633-97c7-b1ce3c3fe3f4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.comppsych.2023.152385"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zbiorniki zaporowe","funkcjonowanie zbiorników","stan bezpieczeństwa zbiorników","Państwowa służba do spraw bezpieczeństwa budowli piętrzących"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["damming reservoirs","operation of reservoirs","safety of reservoirs","National Service Center for Safety of Hydraulic Structures"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zbiorniki zaporowe -

The obtained results confirmed the formation of a simple eutectic phase diagram, with a eutectic point containing 79 wt% fenofibrate and 21 wt% simvastatin, lack of chemical interactions between the ingredients, and simvastatin impact on improving fenofibrate dissolution profile, due to the formation of crystalline solid dispersions by the kneading method."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456398","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"art.603 [15 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/15/2/603","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1394097076263e8392b","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Złocińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"284e434a-9926-4c34-aa97-29233c2b4e1a"},{"objectId":"6630e1394097076263e8392a","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Czapor-Irzabek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30036700-821b-40f5-be84-a9013171d28d"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af2ba","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gawin-Mikołajewicz","uuid":"857F8528B8FD425554C8DD459AF0B9551A22252B327D242C342BEC509B6A475D7E244FA066ABC3ED16B825BF4711FDBE18A42A069BAAB6B118C3A3CD590599D1","orcidId":"0000-0002-5313-3435","documentHash":"0ce4fd00-636d-4af6-b745-63d2732725ad"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1a74","name":"Agata","lastName":"Górniak","uuid":"37FD3937664F0F65017A664CA1B9C86B2E2A52A337C268DECA2CA4AFB2E37DFDAB45B0620AAFA3837D6CD1B6063B19BA040410CEF72E190B5E50FFA3F3DF8C06","orcidId":"0000-0002-9580-6941","documentHash":"c396b7b2-1e95-48f7-b1e3-53c54b24f914"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1344","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Karolewicz","uuid":"F4090C94D75F17146095ED3AC0DA0F7974D53077F06C325B2C3325A096F82991EC3541E4E0940FC76007DE12745CD4DC80788B3BDD21683026415623FEEFA547","orcidId":"0000-0003-0970-6344","documentHash":"49c8216d-d001-4c30-a2ae-f031d8509254"}],"doi":"10.3390/pharmaceutics15020603"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","uid":"bX41kHc85ivocrWE0ISfROw","uuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","parentUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","rootUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","name":"Politechnika Wrocławska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091f4878c28a04738dae3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of storing composite filling materials in a low-pH artificial saliva on their mechanical properties -

The effects of these materials are dependent on various factors, including the processed substrate, process conditions, and the type and amount of the additive material. As part of the study, three different materials—iron powder, lime, and milled porous ceramic—were added to the 30-day anaerobic digestion of the brewer’s spent grain to improve its performance. Different doses ranging from 0.2 to 2.3 gTS × L−1 were tested, and methane production kinetics were determined using the first-order model. The results showed that the methane yield ranged from 281.4 ± 8.0 to 326.1 ± 9.3 mL × gVS−1, while substrate biodegradation ranged from 56.0 ± 1.6 to 68.1 ± 0.7%. The addition of lime reduced the methane yield at almost all doses by −6.7% to −3.3%, while the addition of iron powder increased the methane yield from 0.8% to 9.8%. The addition of ceramic powder resulted in a methane yield change ranging from −2.6% to 4.6%. These findings suggest that the use of additive materials should be approached with caution, as even slight changes in the amount used can impact methane production."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456402","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/15/5245","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6222d9387523402df08d2b48","name":"Waheed","lastName":"Rasaq","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c73188e-05a2-4368-9798-ab4f838fbe1f"},{"objectId":"602f82529543c7410626f568","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Świechowski","uuid":"64EBA239DCD91D7B54AE56AFCC23B7C385F99CEF4C25698D882319431CBB62BFAEAFF20DB7FAF96933E33337F8712E43402AEDBC08B7E3AD11D3467198688D6D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ca20def-2e22-46de-b548-e21ebf48e068"},{"objectId":"602f75b79543c7410626f4e1","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Syguła","uuid":"B81842B1AF2C66BABBB18D5A4BF79FE8A67E9C54027C8DC84E4B4EAA90B526654E82A36961CF8A3EF5900368A9107712D7C3862746BF74AA0B732E494BF239ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-4284-6990","documentHash":"6c5b0b01-822e-48f8-bc80-625fd51b415e"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16155245"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dementia","narrative design","spatial objects","care home design","communication in dementia care","embedded technology","interactive textiles","multi-sensory experience"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Homing wellness: can narrative design transform living spaces for people with dementia into engaging environments enabling communication?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1b6","mniswId":"6866","title":"Frontiers in Public Health","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2296-2565","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c85e448d-181f-4ff8-b815-8d75b271392f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9754f40970762631a8ade","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e9754f40970762631a8adf","65e9754f40970762631a8ae0","65e9754f40970762631a8ae1","65e9754f40970762631a8ae2","65275a2940e3ff22d34ab9c7","65e9754f40970762631a8ae3","65e9754f40970762631a8ae4","65e9754f40970762631a8ae5","65e9754f40970762631a8ae6"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Interactive design is an emerging trend in dementia care environments. This article describes a research project aiming at the design and development of novel spatial objects with narrative attributes that incorporate embedded technology and textiles to support the wellbeing of people living with dementia. In collaboration with people with dementia, this interdisciplinary research project focuses on the question of how innovative spatial objects can be incorporated into dementia long-term care settings, transforming the space into a comforting and playful narrative environment that can enhance self-esteem while also facilitating communication between people living with dementia, family, and staff members. The research methodologies applied are qualitative, including Action Research. Participatory design methods with the experts by experience—the people with dementia—and health professionals have been used to inform the study. Early findings from this research are presented as design solutions comprising a series of spatial object prototypes with embedded technology and textiles. The prototypes were evaluated primarily by researchers, health professionals, academics, and design practitioners in terms of functionality, aesthetics, and their potential to stimulate engagement. The research is ongoing, and the aim is to evaluate the prototypes by using ethnographic and sensory ethnography methods and, consequently, further develop them through co-design workshops with people living with dementia."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456403","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1198253/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9754f40970762631a8ae6","name":"Christos","lastName":"Drosos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a31dcd94-1674-4c33-90c2-bd9ca1c01ea8"},{"objectId":"65e9754f40970762631a8ae5","name":"Styliani","lastName":"Tyrovola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b6e204d4-ad0d-4cec-a880-5e5e5ceabcb4"},{"objectId":"65e9754f40970762631a8ae4","name":"Zoe","lastName":"Georgiadou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df219c69-7419-4ae4-8197-a91b55cf55e6"},{"objectId":"65e9754f40970762631a8ae3","name":"Emmanouela","lastName":"Sfyroera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26f78d21-8645-4582-87a3-ab8317a4666f"},{"objectId":"65e9754f40970762631a8ae2","name":"Georgios","lastName":"Priniotakis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b0b8acf-378a-434b-b87f-132ee4cbf7be"},{"objectId":"65e9754f40970762631a8ae1","name":"Anastasios","lastName":"Tzerachoglou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9c278a4-a5a6-43c9-aaa8-e2d271d54465"},{"objectId":"65e9754f40970762631a8ae0","name":"Avraam","lastName":"Chatzopoulos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"40acda7c-8484-4bcd-a7e9-10f82e188a06"},{"objectId":"65e9754f40970762631a8adf","name":"Loukia","lastName":"Minetou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0719be90-d575-4c01-abeb-979b208f59ec"},{"objectId":"65275a2940e3ff22d34ab9c7","name":"JOOST","lastName":"HOOF","uuid":"857E2BB15B2A692D79E99BC2B06CB85CCCFED582F26F683B585E7DF6106505710F2594EBCCFBDB786B64099029C5DC49144243EBA4965707DF0A446C83659693","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18236d3a-4785-455d-b289-e7751d5ed261"}],"doi":"10.3389/fpubh.2023.1198253"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1OTQ1NjQwMw=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
