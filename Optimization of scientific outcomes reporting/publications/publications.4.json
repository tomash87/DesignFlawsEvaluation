Through studies of the representation of the past and the creation of memory in education, mass media, and on a local level, it examines the responses of Polish and Ukrainian authorities and public institutions to questions surrounding historical issues between the two nations. At a time of growing renationalization in domestic politics in the region, brought about by challenges connected with migration and fear of Russian military activity, this volume asks whether international cooperation and the stability of democracy are under threat. An exploration of the changes in national historical culture, The Politics of Memory in Poland and Ukraine will appeal to scholars with interests in memory studies, national identity, and the implications of memory-making for contemporary relations between states."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056146528","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":"1","volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.routledge.com/The-Politics-of-Memory-in-Poland-and-Ukraine-From-Reconciliation-to-De-Conciliation/Stryjek-Konieczna-Salamatin/p/book/9781032113944?srsltid=AfmBOooQAhSvmTY8S4Lx4KZyJyBag0-CsiUOIO3Y6G0qCTcys-79a5r8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.4324/9781003017349"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Underground coal gasification","Condensate","Residue","Inorganic characterisation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","uid":"bDVT6eE951oVevqx9vwsANA","uuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","parentUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","rootUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","name":"Główny Instytut Górnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925a878c28a04739433a","5e709261878c28a0473949f4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Characterisation of inorganic constitutions of condensate and solid residue generated from small-scale ex situ experiments in the context of underground coal gasification","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH","doi":null,"issn":"0944-1344","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"fe4e7e2b-bd7e-49fb-a7e3-72c171be21d6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-08-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6124a6a42467f0076be9513d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6124a6a42467f0076be9513e","6124a6a42467f0076be9513f","6124a6a42467f0076be95140","5e70925a878c28a04739433a","5e709261878c28a0473949f4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper deals with the characterisation of inorganic constitutions generated at various operating conditions in the context of underground coal gasification (UCG). The ex situ small-scale experiments were conducted with coal specimens of different rank, from the South Wales Coalfield, Wales, UK, and Upper Silesian Coal Basin, Poland. The experiments were conducted at various gaseous oxidant ratios (water: oxygen = 1:1 and 2:1), pressures (20 bar and 36 bar) and temperatures (650°C, 750°C and 850°C). Increasing the amount of water in the oxidants proportionately decreased the cationic elements but increased the concentrations of anionic species. The temperature played minor impact, while the high-pressure experiments at temperature optimum to produce methane-rich syngas (750°C) showed significant reduction in cationic element generation. However, both coal specimens produced high amount of anionic species (F, Cl, SO4 and NO3). The “Hard” bituminous coal from Poland produced less gasification residues and condensates than the South Wales anthracitic coal due to its higher reactivity. The inorganic composition found in the solid residue was used in the theoretical calculation to predict the dissolved product concentrations when the solid residue interacts with deep coal seam water in the event of UCG cavity flooding. It was evident from the solubility products of the Cr, Ni and Zn that changes in the groundwater geochemistry occur; hence, their transportation in the subsurface must be studied further."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056146584","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"2203-2213","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11356-021-15780-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6124a6a42467f0076be95140","name":"Hywel","lastName":"Thomas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"717cc2a9-5450-41e6-a84c-371887ee6851"},{"objectId":"6124a6a42467f0076be9513f","name":"Renato","lastName":"Zagorščak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"748b6743-8c7d-4a62-8aa5-5d928a010280"},{"objectId":"6124a6a42467f0076be9513e","name":"Sivachidambaram","lastName":"Sadasivam","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08014363-5a66-4def-b04c-2a30999677dd"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a0473949f4","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Stańczyk","uuid":"D2802B26EA4EE208D3E12BD40F567C7BA7825BB07D84988C6E437F3A6A59C7F719074674A7DE7660B3E5B6F8D69688016874A49F764B6E2684BF6D5E6F3FC6FB","orcidId":"0000-0001-8273-7409","documentHash":"26337bd4-9ac4-4c19-970b-51dd1d43eac1"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a04739433a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kapusta","uuid":"7806AFC32353111DB00FBC716E74A0D436AB6C209E201739FA9E116EEEFCF903AC622B9FB8CCA00C8AF6672268B39C777CF9280D73DB3AF4CD8F69913B71B4B7","orcidId":"0000-0001-6343-9027","documentHash":"9e5edbb7-419d-4d66-a1e9-0fd9cb5205e2"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11356-021-15780-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1c","uid":"bN_sGtk59Mu8he_1_j8Q2_w","uuid":"32b4c316-a7d1-4895-bf12-88600ca349bd","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

traditional design fires commonly considered in structural fire engineering,\nlike the standard fire and Eurocode parametric fires, were developed several\ndecades ago based on experimental compartments smaller than 100 m2 in floor area.\nThese experiments led to the inherent assumption of flashover in design fires and that\nthe temperatures and burning conditions are uniform in the whole of the compartment,\nregardless of its size. However, modern office buildings often have much larger\nopen-plan floor areas (e.g. the Shard in London has a floor area of 1600 m2) where\nnon-uniform fire conditions are likely to occur. This paper presents observations\nfrom a large-scale fire experiment x-ONE conducted inside a concrete farm building\nin Poland. The objective of x-ONE was to capture experimentally a natural fire inside\na large and open plan compartment. With an open-plan floor area of 380 m2, x-ONE\nis the largest compartment fire experiment carried out to date. The fire was ignited at\none end of the compartment and allowed to spread across a continuous wood crib\n(fuel load \u0002 370 MJ/m2). A travelling fire with clear leading and trailing edges was\nobserved spreading along 29 m of the compartment length. The flame spread rate\nwas not constant but accelerated with time from 3 mm/s to 167 mm/s resulting in a\ngradually changing fire size. The fire travelled across the compartment and burned\nout at the far end 25 min after ignition. Flashover was not observed. The thermocouples\nand cameras installed along the fire path show clear near-field and far-field regions,\nindicating highly non-uniform spatial temperatures and burning within the\ncompartment. The fire dynamics observed during this experiment are completely different\nto the fire dynamics reported in small scale compartments in previous literature\nand to the assumptions made in traditional design fires for structural design. This\nhighlights the need for further research and experiments in large compartments to\nunderstand the fire dynamics and continue improving the safe design of

The procedure is associated with a high risk of complications, including fractures of the medial malleolus. In this study, the finite element method (FEM), based on CT examinations, was used to model the ankle fracture fixation after TAR. Three types of fracture stabilization were considered: screw, Blount staple, and both screw and Blount staple. In the in silico model, the maximum stress tension was found at prosthetic junctions with the base, cone, and talar components of the tibial prosthesis. When the fracture was stabilized with the Blount staple, tension along the cone of the tibial component was about 12% of the maximum tension. Stabilizations with the screw alone or Blount staple combined with a screw on the medial side of the cone induced tension in the immediate vicinity twice as high. In the area of the medial malleolus, the tension was alike for both types of stabilization. The tension was lowest when using the Blount staple alone. We conclude that, contrary to the hitherto clinical routine of using screws, fracture fixation using the Blount staple leads to the lowest bone tension around the fixation of the medial malleolus fracture after ankle joint endoprosthesis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056158448","journalIssue":{"objectId":"613754822467f0111cdf951c","year":"2020","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"fe53d03a-7db1-4189-b059-aa66a740bb54"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1335","pagesFromTo":"103-109","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33378001/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"613754822467f0111cdf951b","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Lorkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"894b5f9c-1f5b-456b-b6b8-d9de0177872a"},{"objectId":"5e70931a878c28a0473a2e79","name":"Renata","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":"C92B8DD616FE6D7E44332B9D11DA2057E7FF5D611D0AB71C89AC66556235758EC9E7E5DB70573659D7F2D8268D519DB68E719129537A04C954F32FF1B4303994","orcidId":"0000-0001-6251-7652","documentHash":"df235cd7-bfd2-428f-816f-3d44d2dcbcff"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a04739446d","name":"Mieczysław","lastName":"Pokorski","uuid":"C8E8F79F0AD2C6D2107CE904496BB82BB6A793C69891B8015FA982EE61D32EDDDA7E4AD8FD60930BA4F35B57DEAE39D24B8CA5BCAC25870564ED8BA4AAE644CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8710-9775","documentHash":"b2ad8d59-f4a1-408f-89a4-2c5f28133c92"}],"doi":"10.1007/5584_2020_610"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Waste reduction, mask re-use, COVID-19, surgical mask structure, surface cover factor, gas sterilization, steam sterilization, sterilization with hydrogen peroxide"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","uid":"buXMLEs4lpbxvwxbqswKB9Q","uuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","parentUuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","rootUuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","name":"Instytut Włókien Naturalnych i Roślin Zielarskich - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b58f8","5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c88","5e7094a3878c28a0473c0cb1","5e709411878c28a0473b5c6f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of the possibility of surgical masks re-use after a sterilization process in the pandemic condition of COVID-19","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479908","mniswId":"19401","title":"TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL","doi":null,"issn":"0040-5175","eissn":"1746-7748","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"35711ba7-7e78-415e-a55a-988abef4a244"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"613863d02467f01d5d7664e4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940f878c28a0473b58f8","5e7092c4878c28a04739c3dc","5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c88","5e709411878c28a0473b5c6f","5e7094a3878c28a0473c0cb1","5e7092d5878c28a04739da2e","5e709447878c28a0473b998b"]},"issue":"17-18","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to explore the possibility to re-use disposable masks in order to prevent excessive waste generation during the pandemic period.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused rapidly increasing waste production resulting from the necessity of common usage of disposable personal protective equipment.

A significant reduction in the cover ratio of layers composing surgical masks causes an increase of air permeability in the case of steam sterilization, leading to a reduction of the mechanical ability to prevent the penetration of microorganisms. The reduction in cover ratio limits the filtration efficiency.\nSurgical masks subjected to threefold gas sterilization can be recommended for re-use. This allows one to use the mask thrice, ensuring safety for users and limiting the mask-waste production to one-third of the volume compared with when the mask is used once.\nThe volume of mask-waste can be reduced with the application of the sterilization process for used masks during the pandemic period. Currently, it is not possible to sterilize all one-use masks, but implementation of this method in hospitals and medical centers is a step in the pro-environmental direction."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056158550","journalIssue":{"objectId":"639ad9084097074c71d27008","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"92","number":"17-18","doi":"","documentHash":"fef1a603-933e-4d42-a3ae-eff59583dcdb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"92","pagesFromTo":"3082-3096","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00405175211042889","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a3878c28a0473c0cb1","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Romanowska","uuid":"7EDF751C16B18D36D6F4ECA118713F046DB643DE7C0C293C8170D5DFF655E936684D1CB0C6F300BCB5ACDDC19B22C33B796DDCD2349EC581320A69C243B1EFD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8237-621X","documentHash":"8579b9e3-fe49-42fe-8d22-4752bb82ea73"},{"objectId":"5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c88","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kicińska-Jakubowska","uuid":"1EDDC13F7AE98AB62A005A4325E3BB3BC15893FBDF218CD41EEFD0957EAAD68F17A8FCF83066E2E4CD3EEB32B98E0EC1F6738B0D88A83C2ABD876073DD2D8E29","orcidId":"0000-0003-1886-9997","documentHash":"f6df2642-379e-477d-8bbe-a2f4c0e87965"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b998b","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Jundziłł","uuid":"2495A68034F6CE4075F8C7FBD09DAED8B94A9056504FD3B54B5A26779CEAF55EA070935A07C6A6746E49BA04864B1080CDF4E046E875A6C276B2467935B14177","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9511ae4d-c452-45cc-a840-1c070c292a64"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5c6f","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Kwiatkowska","uuid":"B2B2428BD0912C0942B14579D0E797BDF26FCFAF141E9CDB21FC96A901C0B83F53DC16FAF08464ED38F70B3C4EDFE15BE379F7BBA4A58A3C8440C6A28C6C93C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3447-5007","documentHash":"df501a13-07de-4a6f-a002-0a7a17021f5b"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b58f8","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zimniewska","uuid":"41E8D45ACC81819D11502D4D4CC9ABF218441F578C977A99E4C16EFC1890BF41607B3BD2CCDE30F6C9DBC8BE2C5908D9A391D56D4172EE2841EDCF5A88A64F53","orcidId":"0000-0003-3917-9872","documentHash":"76e110d1-1cd6-4342-a343-5fd5ded9c581"},{"objectId":"5e7092d5878c28a04739da2e","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"3B39778B9DEB872F42A659D52870FAF41379B53EC21BBB5833D2524E6B5AC8E8B58FE84603A8742F652233B1564692796D0D8742E27C19C278DFAA42488A9535","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39460cdb-742a-4d93-b6f4-8b1b18150735"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c3dc","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Witmanowski","uuid":"C63C7B317144C442BAE9B09C44D2309067557F97437DF589E93928D3D7D2A1776AF7899FA5362CEA6B8BAFD8E37BED4E79806856F973836082FB3C1B2B1B3F97","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d9a50119-2fe6-4e23-aa84-9b1905ccc92a"}],"doi":"10.1177/00405175211042889"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["granular jamming","smart structures","crash energy absorption"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Adaptive crash energy absorber based on a granular jamming mechanism","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454774b8","mniswId":"2980","title":"Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences: Technical Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"0239-7528","eissn":"2300-1917","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a1a9dcf0-8393-4a15-8ffe-557c354d4f4b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"615ab71f2467f0561f824837","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6448c7314097076e1e8eaba9","6448c7314097076e1e8eabaa","6448c7314097076e1e8eabab","5e7092fe878c28a0473a0a51"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The following discussion concerns the use of innovative smart materials called vacuum-packed particles (VPP) as active energy absorbers. VPP, also known as a granular jamming system, is a structure composed of granular media contained within an elastomer coating. By changing the vacuum pressure inside the coating, it is possible to control the mechanical properties of the structure. VPP have many applications, e.g. in medicine, robotics and vibration damping. No attempts have yet been made to use VPP to absorb the energy of a collision, although given their properties, this could very well be an interesting application. In the first part of the paper, the general concept of the absorber is presented. Then a protype and the empirical tests conducted are precisely described. The middle part of the paper considers the basic properties of VPP and modeling methodology. A proposal for a constitutive equation is presented, and a numerical simulation using LS-Dyna was performed.

Controlling the degree of agglomeration and coalescence is vital for manufacturing products that conform to the requirements. To predict the particle size accurately, this study presents a CFD model of particle agglomeration and droplet coalescence in a counter-current spray dryer. The stochastic agglomeration model was modified to incorporate more realistic droplet-droplet, droplet-particle and particle-particle interactions. Binary droplet collisions in the atomization zone of a spray dryer can result in either coalescence or separation. The boundaries between collision regimes were experimentally determined, and existing binary collision models were validated for water and milk concentrate to include the effect of viscous forces on collision outcomes. A high-speed camera was used to record the kinematic and physical properties of the droplets to identify various collision regimes. A suitable model was then incorporated in CFD simulations of spray drying. Using existing experimental data from a counter-current spray dryer with strong agglomeration, it is shown that the model can accurately predict product particle properties under different process conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056166774","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6139eb292467f02f5453f991","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"247","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"2c43327a-4ead-4548-9a49-d2f51e85e9a4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"247","pagesFromTo":"[1-18]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009250921006291","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735a460fdbe83034961f45e","name":"Evangelos","lastName":"Tsotsas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9096e7f0-0c46-4328-8d9d-c7026559c63a"},{"objectId":"6735a460fdbe83034961f45d","name":"Farooq","lastName":"Hussain","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"faaa8e66-fac1-4821-b522-d614d16b59b6"},{"objectId":"5e709466878c28a0473bc302","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Jaskulski","uuid":"58D0052C4A41D3C349A67236C2A5E2D0371BA07C97C01F4953C76D454AE0B6283469FFB328BC1A5BD205BA8DCB7167D2058F6FD9CAFE4065907221630FB99709","orcidId":"0000-0002-4270-0860","documentHash":"91b7870b-4245-4d53-ad7e-22e892040f16"},{"objectId":"5e709335878c28a0473a4ecc","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Piątkowski","uuid":"948123942E1C02139F88846A1FC60F9B87A11E787E03779DD7261AFF6EBA95F77C36AA9F9435C00A9FEFF1DF222EF3C3D6E194FBE43D9EDEF17D4AC8645565CA","orcidId":"0000-0003-4264-0527","documentHash":"02129902-7147-425a-b8a2-1c3714cabc00"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ces.2021.117064"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["geografie studenckie","krajobrazy studenckie","miasta poprzemysłowe","Łódź","Turyn"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["student geographies","studentscapes","post-industrial cities","Lodz","Turin"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nuancing student geographies: Studentscapes in post-industrial cities","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a34","mniswId":"19991","title":"Urban Geography","doi":null,"issn":"0272-3638","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"176c2f11-6b70-4555-a5f6-5f4bf0a4f7ee"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"613b5e592467f045c82f179a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709337878c28a0473a5101","65af8c8f4097071977745fde","65af8c8f4097071977745fdf"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article contributes to the debate that links student geographies with urban change. It has been argued that students reshape urban geographies through the creation of distinctive “student areas.” However, the literature has often done so focusing on one specific component (e.g. accommodation or leisure) and one specific city or neighborhood. Therefore, we aim to nuance the debate over student geographies in cities. To this end, we use the “studentscapes” framework and propose a concurrent examination of students’ educational, residential, and leisure activities distributed in the urban space of Lodz, Poland, and Turin, Italy. We show that the presence of higher education students plays a role in the multifaceted and dynamic restructuring of Lodz and Turin as they transition from industrial to post-industrial economies. We also claim that the dichotomous distinction between “student” and “non-student” neighborhoods might miss the wide range of configurations of students’ activities in urban settings."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056172784","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"44","pagesFromTo":"105-127","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2021.1969142","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65af8c8f4097071977745fdf","name":"Erica","lastName":"Mangione","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39591219-953a-4f3b-8921-b79fe5b1fa63"},{"objectId":"65af8c8f4097071977745fde","name":"Marco","lastName":"Santangelo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05018def-c57b-49b8-ba71-d6126f70a6c8"},{"objectId":"5e709337878c28a0473a5101","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Zasina","uuid":"584BDD99F0E749727293067CFC14F90ED673DB8C7A6AEE4F9EE55B4097AFB676381D7D49779AE44A13C55BF6F50DBC42AFE368CDA214D60BADA07A5FBF33C5F2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7519-6982","documentHash":"a81899c8-ac25-4788-99d3-00f38c0a202a"}],"doi":"10.1080/02723638.2021.1969142"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Alkali-silica reaction in calcium aluminate cement mortars induced by deicing salts solutions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547961d","mniswId":"17977","title":"Road Materials and Pavement Design","doi":null,"issn":"1468-0629","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"6254f0f3-457c-4f82-b30c-b33a5b28b840"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"613c53332467f059093c681e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70920b878c28a04738efc9","673d9b94fdbe832d85e2f7b7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747056173015","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14680629.2021.1916573","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673d9b94fdbe832d85e2f7b7","name":"Monika","lastName":"Malich","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a410b028-ba2c-4b59-a80a-6be7168357d2"},{"objectId":"5e70920b878c28a04738efc9","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"KOTWICA","uuid":"D15C31B30804B38A2C1EB6CE459A31DB214F9C314A8390BBC6092B6B6D320D1B15E6334A365949FD867A1F8F50C0A8694F6A56B61C3B88CFBE844C5EDBB373A2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4403-4133","documentHash":"27f5dac7-e60c-4be7-9f42-cc86121a2c2c"}],"doi":"10.1080/14680629.2021.1916573"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Parenchymal cell","Necrosis","Inflammation","Fat","Human liver","Steatosis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

The following novel observations and concepts arose: single fat droplets in parenchymal cells can grow to a volume four times larger than the original cell, thereby extremely marginalizing the cytoplasm with all organelles. Necrosis of single parenchymal cells, still containing one huge fat droplet, suggests death by fat in a process of single-cell steatonecrosis. In a later stage of single-cell steatonecrosis, neutrophils and erythrocytes surround the single fat droplet, forming an inflammatory fat follicle indicating the apparent onset of inflammation. Also, fat droplets frequently incorporate masses of filamentous fragments and other material, most probably representing Mallory substance. No other structure or material was found that could possibly represent Mallory bodies. We regularly observe the extrusion of huge fat droplets, traversing the peripheral cytoplasm of parenchymal cells, the Disse space and the endothelium. These fat droplets fill the sinusoid as a sinusoidal lipid embolus. In conclusion, adapted methods of fixation applied to human liver tissue revealed that single, huge fat droplets cause necrosis and inflammation in single parenchymal cells. Fat droplets also collect Mallory substance and give rise to sinusoidal fat emboli. Therefore, degreasing of the liver seems to be an essential therapeutic first step in the self-repairing of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This might directly reduce single-cell steatotic necrosis and inflammation as elements in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis progression."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056175517","journalIssue":{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa0220","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d048eb1f-c802-48e9-b77b-132376b4b593"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"157","pagesFromTo":"27-38","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00418-021-02030-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa021e","name":"Ger","lastName":"Koek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92cf0fab-5cc7-41bd-aabf-d608514a44b2"},{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa021d","name":"Steven","lastName":"Olde Damink","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"286beef8-1526-4d1b-a7e2-3a1742006871"},{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa021c","name":"Peters J.","lastName":"Peters","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b57063c-535a-430e-97d6-08f5cd47aeec"},{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa021b","name":"Peter","lastName":"Frederik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0aacd9a3-36f5-46b0-be9b-e9eb717c6fa9"},{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa021a","name":"Pauline","lastName":"Verhaegh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d43d0e5-4372-4496-9674-394dbe057bae"},{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa0219","name":"Celien","lastName":"Vreuls","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"143b9227-1f4b-435c-9a0c-062fe3c157ce"},{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa0217","name":"Gerald J.","lastName":"Shami","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"943c9fd7-5739-4cfb-9a5c-051a4ddbf9b1"},{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa0216","name":"Filip","lastName":"Braet","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5222-0895","documentHash":"77c1fa43-69fc-45f3-8a5f-7e0b9562fbde"},{"objectId":"615c4f392467f05fd3aa0215","name":"Eddie","lastName":"Wisse","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca76b877-5c6c-49a9-89df-c491174b7333"},{"objectId":"5e709443878c28a0473b930e","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Zapotoczny","uuid":"539FD5C159DEFBD00E7296733AB04DAFD8AF1B543EB6B16D171E13F53547A16985072896A1D631F01CC2E5A59A6125E84C377E85E0E552FAA8EB484D0773BB24","orcidId":"0000-0003-2129-3714","documentHash":"b1cd62ba-f21c-43af-b413-5f18a68856d6"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00418-021-02030-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Social impact bonds","Public–private partnership","profit","social outcomes"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Accessing Social Value from Profit-Oriented Public–Private Partnership","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547ca5f","mniswId":"12646","title":"Journal of Social Entrepreneurship","doi":null,"issn":"1942-0676","eissn":"1942-0684","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f84afb00-39e2-4e95-9688-1cfd15933061"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"613d8b602467f0647a008bfe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927d878c28a04739698a"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study demonstrates how to access social value from profit-oriented public–private partnership.

Previous studies have shown that two main factors influence decisions about pro-social behaviour: in-group membership and reciprocity. The main aim of this study was to investigate which of these motives children consider more important in making decisions about who to ask for help, resources, cooperation, or comfort. Children were given a choice to ask for those favours from either a friend or an out-group child who was recently a recipient of the child’s prosocial behaviour. In a study on children aged 4 to 6 years old with two research samples (sample 1: n = 60, sample 2: n = 71), we showed that reciprocity of recent prosocial behaviour is a stronger predictor than friendship when choosing a character in a helping need, resource sharing or cooperation related need, but not for a comforting need. Furthermore, this effect seems to be limited to reciprocating only the same type of pro-social behaviour."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056179038","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"383-399","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63aeac4b409707109b9f8ba8","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Myślińska-Szarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f522d0c-a67b-4e17-a2ed-df36eb8eece9"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a05dc","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Tanaś","uuid":"A77F5D915BCFC2C84F09C7CB0A72722338852AB4CC114F46E4A38A734DA57F5E080054011F7F06ECAA7CB575445E9272166B8878F6DBB6A25D90040A005E66A8","orcidId":"0000-0001-8038-8225","documentHash":"1a7844d3-aa8d-4069-b854-07cbfe9efdce"}],"doi":"10.1080/17405629.2021.1918095"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["kurczęta rzeźne","ściółka żytnia","zeolit","haloizyt","wzrost","jakość mięsa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["broiler","Rye litter","zeolite","halloysite","growth","meat quality"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Aluminosilicates at different levels in rye litter and feed affect the growth and meat quality of broiler chickens.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a6e","mniswId":"20109","title":"Veterinary Research Communications","doi":null,"issn":"0165-7380","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d0dbfc89-848f-44de-a82b-fb2fae70b0b7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"613deb3a2467f0647a008d29","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709447878c28a0473b97e4","5e7093dd878c28a0473b2216","5e7091ff878c28a04738e562"]},"issue":"-","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747056179164","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"46","pagesFromTo":"37-47","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b97e4","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Banaszak","uuid":"AAC55040598BCD7387EED1A6B445C7DD3B0A261C82EFE3CC5569C3B6DACB7CAAE1F5D7F55C84FE0E34D280150EEA90BE6B45D6E4989C9C4EECE8A198AA349AAC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8681-7286","documentHash":"d8d23759-7af7-4691-b92c-efbd9dfa072e"},{"objectId":"5e7093dd878c28a0473b2216","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Biesek","uuid":"8E4E85AE8D58EC944EED967F248CF4D73EE712065E22A81694A01E494BE2114FFE4286C867505923C635CEFDD448BAA06AC9F9883C7F70A830DD0595B00D0808","orcidId":"0000-0003-3050-8617","documentHash":"5f46ea53-45f9-458b-a240-3ec0cafe0104"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e562","name":"Marek","lastName":"Adamski","uuid":"082E51C42B43F78082A6816ACEE2819FDAEC52A80A4C548AD908313C718957E0FDB6CC1D25439E3D337C2A9540E9367A8198F00647182A0C05AC890EE7D757BE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6166-8547","documentHash":"555fae58-4519-4007-bad9-49f28b205024"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11259-021-09827-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mass spectrometry","surface-assisted desorption/ionization","laser ablation synthesis in solution","silver-109 monoisotopic nanoparticles","low molecular weight compounds","matrix-free laser desorption/ionization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

the beginnings of fuzzy logic, the Sheffer stroke operation has been overlooked and the efforts of the researchers have been devoted to other logical connectives. In this paper, the Sheffer stroke operation is introduced in fuzzy logic generalizing the classical operation when the truth values are restricted to {0, 1}2. Similar to what happens in Boolean logic, the fuzzy Sheffer stroke is functionally complete and it can be used to generate any other fuzzy logical connective by combinations of itself. Two construction methods are presented and the close connection of this operation with a pair of fuzzy conjunction and negation is analysed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056189962","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6221ccb52467f016970d4904","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"431","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d1d00ea5-b44c-486e-a0f6-d16b7a50c5e8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"431","pagesFromTo":"110-128","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165011421001834?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6141bd0b2467f00a85802ed5","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Ruiz-Aguilera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ab9128a3-bde7-435b-abf0-4dfd4fe14cf2"},{"objectId":"6141bd0b2467f00a85802ed3","name":"Sebastia","lastName":"Massanet","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8243-5013","documentHash":"874d7118-0213-49c1-8671-0a56ae0c1709"},{"objectId":"6141bd0b2467f00a85802ed1","name":"Pedro","lastName":"Berruezo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa387b0c-7343-4aab-8faa-671896221906"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8d26","name":"Wanda","lastName":"Niemyska","uuid":"785326FA8E8D4FB4BF235D7D8E719255EA7BEB55AEE0DD5C2AD2B78986D5055F66FE8D4167D155E98E64CA27129B282C210B9B03367D78BCD683D6959319F9DF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4167-1807","documentHash":"9a0b44ca-1121-4823-9bfb-730b136b56ed"},{"objectId":"5e7092ff878c28a0473a0c68","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Helbin","uuid":"2CC82F8926BD5443402C4B4135932178865EEC6D1240431F3D8ABCDDF261F049E6107B59DE5C50BBBEBA5CC88FED29951425464D91BE2B2161D03339C7B3516F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5961-3010","documentHash":"a05c40ef-4f82-4e18-9d5a-2f211576c361"},{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739eece","name":"Michał","lastName":"Baczyński","uuid":"25A3CE35CC5F1C7A49AF905D8B6A16DABD99EC9CC4AF813642603A72DA7DEEFA571B7096775AF655732F2B822C6D307E0A011E9F0C0394F8BBDE076EF94823A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-4442-2112","documentHash":"63b1b830-8875-40f4-9432-b0bf6b3e630f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.fss.2021.05.003"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cortical","HPA","HPG","Neuromodulation","Steroids","Stress"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b8878c28a04738643a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Imperial College London","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6141f2782467f00a85804414"]},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e3","uid":"bWAncCFOOFggrGtc2DIwFog","uuid":"5ffa91bd-7336-4c07-959e-0d3f198f1d5a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Instytut Optoelektroniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d7878c28a0473c521e"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933a878c28a0473a542c","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"]},{"id":"5e7091b4878c28a047385811","uid":"bJ-ji5NiY_gi01uQJeUheHg","uuid":"557b1db8-bde1-4f11-ae7c-0bf51122e518","parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Zakład Endokrynologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Impact of one HF-rTMS session over the DLPFC and motor cortex on acute hormone dynamics and emotional state in healthy adults: a sham-controlled pilot study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fe5","mniswId":"14954","title":"Neurological Sciences","doi":"10.1007/10072.1590-3478","issn":"1590-1874","eissn":"1590-3478","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"6258613c-2047-42cd-83df-6fe1e9b0016b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6141f2782467f00a85804412","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","5e7094d7878c28a0473c521e","6141f2782467f00a85804414","5e70933a878c28a0473a542c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Studies indicate that high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) can lower cortisol concentration or output, with some evidence suggesting a link to testosterone. Together, these stress and social hormones might help regulate the emotional response to HF-rTMS. This pilot study evaluated the effect of HF-rTMS on acute testosterone and cortisol dynamics and emotional state in eleven healthy adults. Using a sham-controlled, single-blind, crossover design, participants completed a HF-rTMS session targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and motor cortex on separate days. Stimulation (250 total pulses) was applied at 90% of the resting motor threshold. Salivary testosterone and cortisol, mood, motivation, anxiety, and heart rate (HR) were assessed before (T1) and 1 (T2), 15 (T3), and 30 min (T4) after each session. There were no significant session differences in testosterone and cortisol concentration, mood, motivation, and HR. Although DLPFC stimulation produced less anxiety (vs. motor cortex), and testosterone output was stable across both treatments (vs. sham-related decline in testosterone), neither differed from the sham. Within-person fluctuations in testosterone, mood, motivation, and/or anxiety were significantly related across the DLPFC and motor cortex trials only. In conclusion, a single sub-maximal session of HF-rTMS did not affect the hormonal, emotional, or physiological state of healthy adults, relative to a sham. However, the emergence of stimulation-specific testosterone and/or emotional linkages suggests that the repeated effects of HF-rTMS may also manifest at the individual level. This offers another pathway to explain the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS and a model to explore interindividual variability in health-related outcomes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056192595","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62da847140970752a1f1cf15","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"43","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"58c43311-1d50-4dd7-8e09-00b725f26ae3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"43","pagesFromTo":"651–659","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10072-021-05335-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6141f2782467f00a85804414","name":"Christian J.","lastName":"Cook","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"28198d8d-33b5-4138-84e1-1bc444e90d21"},{"objectId":"5e7094d7878c28a0473c521e","name":"Wiktoria","lastName":"Kasprzycka","uuid":"B0545DC975C23B024385676217F108AC1F9148217C6B5450E8DC1B8299E902E2FA578E59F3225645859857C61295EF627C40B0FF1151ECA332745F907014C8C1","orcidId":"0000-0002-2796-2555","documentHash":"4f8b5218-17b0-4454-b897-e7c77ad18d54"},{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","name":"Blair","lastName":"Crewther","uuid":"1B92721CD363D94CBA2DE83FE05638C7242F8FA781AD75AFE48220A8E21C71B11E2F98DC4C6A961F163AB35261CBE4A8CF98127F5064E33EEFAE9D0981310983","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3437f39-7c71-4805-871c-40f74ee9d44b"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a542c","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Rola","uuid":"15B045DCA7265A3981ACF84A6243EAA8BFE033F3DD4FDDD2E984A9A2C482DB7F1865502CDFE2FD1C839DFB4FA45A792A31073DC2724475572C8FEE3F8E8734F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-9388-5578","documentHash":"c819207d-5b9d-4a3d-88e3-561c12359d81"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10072-021-05335-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Distribution company, Department of distribution company, Power supply reliability indexes, SAIDI, SAIFI, Remote control"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f897","uid":"bP-QzAYByRyG9uTu1rKGpwQ","uuid":"3f70960f-2ec1-4f7c-9a93-7a0e52e0ee8b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Wydział Transportu, Elektrotechniki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396b8b","5e709253878c28a047393bdd","5e70927e878c28a047396b85"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The impact of selected variants of remote control on power supply reliability indexes of distribution networks","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a5f","mniswId":"5545","title":"ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING","doi":null,"issn":"0948-7921","eissn":"1432-0487","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3359b249-59f0-4f25-ac50-562d99e4dc38"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"614303dc2467f0237ad74d59","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396b85","5e709253878c28a047393bdd","5e70927e878c28a047396b8b"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ensuring reliability and continuity of energy supply is the main goal of local governments and distribution companies. The continuity of energy supply means capability of a power grid to supply agreed amount of energy, of specific quality, without power cuts. The expectations concerning the quality of supplied energy and ensuring its continuity are constantly growing, and any power cuts have significant impact on comfort of life and manufacturing and service sector. To increase reliability of energy supply and improve condition of a power grid in the distribution companies, the works are conducted to increase power supply reliability indexes.The main goal of this publication is to present a problem of discontinuity of energy supply and actions aiming at improvement of power supply reliability indexes. An analysis of discontinuity of energy supply presented in the article is based on data obtained from a selected department of a distribution company. Based on actual data, the impact of location of remote-controlled controllers on the value of SAIDI and SAIFI was presented.

Here, its derivation is pursued by the nondimensionalization method in the same manner as for the Rossby deformation radius and the Ekman-layer depth. Physical implications of the Obukhov length are inferred by nondimensionalizing the turbulence-kinetic-energy equation for the horizontally homogeneous boundary layer. A nondimensionalization length scale for a full set of equations for boundary-layer flow formally reduces to the Obukhov length by dividing this scale by a rescaling factor. This rescaling factor increases with increasing stable stratification of the boundary layer, in which flows tend to be more horizontal and gentler; thus the Obukhov length increasingly loses its relevance. A heuristic, but deductive, derivation of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory is also outlined based on the obtained nondimensionalization results."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056199079","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a1af854097073ee834303f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"182","doi":"10.1007/s10546-021-00657-7","documentHash":"f56fd17a-122e-43a8-a7fe-20f40cf2a62e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"182","pagesFromTo":"417-439","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10546-021-00657-7.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"614321a72467f0237ad78fc1","name":"Jun–Ichi","lastName":"Yano","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2643-7572","documentHash":"9076f3dc-ab22-4298-b637-c777a32045d4"},{"objectId":"5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b80","name":"Marta","lastName":"Wacławczyk","uuid":"51CA37BAF4AC4B6C4D41856D4B562875C95DD28015178D08E8118CA1052CBA3F516CC121ADC59D2E959D007D172DDF56170F5E16F2BCB73347CD816C83034A31","orcidId":"0000-0003-1039-4237","documentHash":"a0a790e1-1cab-40aa-afaf-1235e9b3434f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10546-021-00657-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","parentUuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","rootUuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Methods capable of synthesizing information from extant and fossil species have yielded novel insights into diversification rate variation through time, but little is known about their behavior when analyzing entirely extinct clades. Here, we use empirical and simulated data to assess how two popular methods, PyRate and Fossil BAMM, perform in this setting. We inferred the first tip-dated trees for ornithischian dinosaurs and combined them with fossil occurrence data to test whether the clade underwent an end-Cretaceous decline. We then simulated phylogenies and fossil records under empirical constraints to determine whether macroevolutionary and preservation rates can be teased apart under paleobiologically realistic conditions. We obtained discordant inferences about ornithischian macroevolution including a long-term speciation rate decline (BAMM), mostly flat rates with a steep diversification drop (PyRate) or without one (BAMM), and episodes of implausibly accelerated speciation and extinction (PyRate). Simulations revealed little to no conflation between speciation and preservation, but yielded spuriously correlated speciation and extinction estimates while time-smearing tree-wide shifts (BAMM) or overestimating their number (PyRate). Our results indicate that the small phylogenetic data sets available to vertebrate paleontologists and the assumptions made by current model-based methods combine to yield potentially unreliable inferences about the diversification of extinct clades. We provide guidelines for interpreting the results of the existing approaches in light of their limitations and suggest how the latter may be mitigated."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056199082","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6231acb82467f05185347bec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"eb3ec125-f848-4325-ab0c-dcdc49a6e72d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"71","pagesFromTo":"153-171","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article-abstract/71/1/153/6295892?redirectedFrom=fulltext","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"612f471c2467f00a74666947","name":"Graham J","lastName":"Slater","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"935b801a-14d1-4128-8cf3-37f624cace45"},{"objectId":"612f471c2467f00a74666945","name":"David","lastName":"Černý","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc8ba2e6-2e53-45d9-9afd-166bef036557"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be2b4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Madzia","uuid":"AD5F3D8A7AA2D833E27E4EA6967CA048C55CBC2910D98D2D28CC4FA89CFC553B57DDA9B5BC351D35E6AA78CFD78AE0002812CF562BA9B9A9E20FAD75010B7354","orcidId":"0000-0003-1228-3573","documentHash":"0941da7b-c444-4578-a944-d517f52d9f1c"}],"doi":"10.1093/sysbio/syab045"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cr-V-N","Structure","Hardness","Adhesion","Surface","Friction","Wear"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a82a","5e7094af878c28a0473c19f5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Structural, mechanical and tribological properties of Cr-V-N coatings deposited by cathodic arc evaporation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799e2","mniswId":"19803","title":"Tribology International","doi":null,"issn":"0301-679X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"eff2dc08-a106-4852-a6a4-6bc9d5aaf5a6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-08-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"614329402467f0237ad795cc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["614329402467f0237ad795cd","614329402467f0237ad795ce","5e7094af878c28a0473c19f5","614329402467f0237ad795cf","614329402467f0237ad795d0","614329402467f0237ad795d1","614329402467f0237ad795d2","614329402467f0237ad795d3","5e7092ae878c28a04739a82a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Cr1−xVxN monolayer coatings were synthesized using vacuum arc plasma flux method. The properties of the coatings were compared with CrN and VN, i.e. for coatings where x = 0 or 1. The surface morphology, microstructure and chemical composition of (Cr,V)N coatings were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The mechanical and tribological properties of coatings were characterized using nano-indentation, scratch test and Daimler-Benz test and ball-on-disk tribometer. It was found that the cubic CrN phase was formed. In coatings with vanadium the solid solution (Cr,V)N phase was observed. The diffraction lines of the coatings were shifted to lower angles which indicated the stress occurring there. The roughness parameter Ra increased linearly with vanadium concentration, from about 0.05 µm (CrN) to about 0.13 µm (VN) which was probably connected with significantly higher number of surface defects. The hardness and elastic modulus of Cr1−xVxN coatings increased from 20 GPa (CrN) to 35 GPa (VN) and 300 GPa (CrN) to about 500 GPa (VN) respectively. Adhesion of the coatings was very high. The critical load of the complete coating detachment exceeds 100 N. The highest wear rate was for CrN coating - (1.7 ± 0.1) × 10−6 mm3/Nm, while the lowest was for VN coating - (1.2 ± 0.6) × 10−7 mm3/Nm. The wear mechanism for all coatings against Al2O3 ball was mainly abrasive.

from renewable resources produced using sugarcane as raw material was modified with phosphonium ionic liquids. Tensile properties and thermal behavior of modified biopolyethylene in air and nitrogen atmosphere were studied. The thermal degradation of ionic liquids and their influence on thermal degradation of polyethylene from renewable resources were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In general, modification of biopolyethylene with phosphonium ionic liquids resulted in improvement of tensile properties, i.e., tensile strength and Young’s modulus. Thermal degradation of biopolyethylene modified with phosphonium ILs proceeds in one step in the range of 400–500 °C in nitrogen atmosphere. Modification of polyethylene with trihexyltetradecylphosphonium bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinate ionic liquid resulted in increase in DTGpeaks and T10% temperatures toward higher temperature for modified polyethylene in comparison with unfilled PE sample both in air and nitrogen atmosphere."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056206199","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"147","pagesFromTo":"1215-1224","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a5878c28a0473c0ff4","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"WĘGRZYN","uuid":"922FD6369A429A3261D9073E5CDA50AE9F8E2A42F0AC6F4786844B594DC03DC06469910B7C708372C27E41EE3EE3CCDDDD9667FB665386F177B2C5CF5780AA5E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2407-8887","documentHash":"5c76ea63-ff2f-48ad-9c39-075f5ab1cb22"},{"objectId":"5e70937f878c28a0473ab207","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Kukfisz","uuid":"FF7A0DD67F25DD4CBFBF2277B233614ED5AE1E07B392287C0CAFBF376545276085200F72A0343DF9621F6345767D092B6F70BC28FB81A26EA813C026C492C001","orcidId":"0000-0001-5049-7316","documentHash":"42c173bc-cbb9-4bd7-a5f2-9c51e045e414"},{"objectId":"5e70937f878c28a0473ab10d","name":"Renata","lastName":"Kamocka-Bronisz","uuid":"A813B0BFA6F2AAE842B9DC5CFA75CABB468D06A51B75073E7609CFA95EDADB6B34BD131DAAB610441BFD633E69909E3E2D0BA35D955488FD639699EDD55FA7AE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7eccfec3-7bd8-4394-8ffc-d671c1cdf016"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d866","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Rudnik","uuid":"56A12594A80396D0039CB69EE2B6502B1F9CA7688BBB3FEDDDA808E632E28635E4C202A8D2C10D1593F0ACA33EC98A902216B0847A5A4DA97F0D0DADA5FD7A16","orcidId":"0000-0003-4776-8298","documentHash":"4bc9c990-fffa-4b99-a477-7dbe3ff9d24e"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10973-020-10489-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["convex loss function","empirical process","generalized information criterion","high-dimensional regression","penalized estimation","selection consistency"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Improving Lasso for model selection and prediction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547967c","mniswId":"18174","title":"Scandinavian Journal of Statistics","doi":null,"issn":"0303-6898","eissn":"1467-9469","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"94dea9dd-9d16-48e7-bfe4-30200623d6af"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"614b252a2467f0268cb191ce","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c1878c28a04739c259","66066a8e40970762633cc061","66066a8e40970762633cc062","66066a8e40970762633cc063","66066a8e40970762633cc064"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It is known that the Thresholded Lasso (TL), SCAD\r\nor MCP correct intrinsic estimation bias of the Lasso.\r\nIn this paper we propose an alternative method of\r\nimproving the Lasso for predictive models with general\r\nconvex loss functions which encompass normal linear\r\nmodels, logistic regression, quantile regression, or support\r\nvector machines.

Because the island was isolated from the outside world until relatively recently, rongorongo has the potential of being one of only a few instances in human history of an independent invention of writing. However, no scientific consensus exists regarding the time span for when rongorongo was used. Its cessation in the 1860s is well-known but its origins are not. Here, we report on detailed analysis of one of the 23 existing rongorongo artifacts—the Berlin Tablet—including botanical wood identification, radiocarbon dating, and photogrammetric study. The wood used to create the tablet was identified as Pacific rosewood, Thespesia populnea, a species that once grew on Rapa Nui, which counters previous theories that the tablet was made from salvaged driftwood. The radiocarbon date, adjusted in accordance to the ethnographic data, suggests that the tablet was made some time between ca. AD 1830 and 1870. Prior to its collection, the tablet had spent a significant amount of time within a cave context that destroyed around 90% of its content. The text is estimated to have been over 5000 signs long, more than double the length of the next longest rongorongo text."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056215958","journalIssue":{"objectId":"614b539f2467f0268cb49866","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ec4a0783-227d-410e-bc5d-ab8c0daceeb8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"309-328","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15564894.2021.1950874","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"614b539f2467f0268cb49864","name":"Paul","lastName":"Horley","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fb5baf5-a240-4a3a-9cf1-db31b747881e"},{"objectId":"614b539f2467f0268cb49863","name":"Alexei A.","lastName":"Oskolski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fdf2a60-5e58-4af3-97c5-83839bac9c22"},{"objectId":"614b539f2467f0268cb49862","name":"Kamil E.","lastName":"Frankiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2638-7007","documentHash":"8aa5b250-79e7-4e1c-8115-b6986817370e"},{"objectId":"5e7094ab878c28a0473c1579","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"3062492A066D88E463128E5C6C1169EBA984D23FE562A34FBE49AFA0777EAD4CE080FD28B9C9397E57F6C54954376A6C025F277F50B29587E5B1922011B5E640","orcidId":"0000-0003-0172-8063","documentHash":"8ff22acc-9323-46ae-9448-636999cbb42d"}],"doi":"10.1080/15564894.2021.1950874"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["614b7d3f2467f0268cb6c045","5e7092cf878c28a04739d30e","5e709378878c28a0473aa8b7","5e70937a878c28a0473aa8ee"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wheat germ lipase: isolation, purification and applications","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547782a","mniswId":"4515","title":"Critical Reviews in Biotechnology","doi":null,"issn":"0738-8551","eissn":"1549-7801","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"59aa6d5e-4fda-4a5a-aac9-f133c499c2aa"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"614b7d3f2467f0268cb6c043","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["614b7d3f2467f0268cb6c045","5e70937a878c28a0473aa8ee","5e709378878c28a0473aa8b7","5e7092cf878c28a04739d30e"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years, wheat germ lipase (WGL) is attracting considerable interest.

So, efficient means of rejecting the non-cosmic-ray noise and identification of signals attributable to extensive air showers are necessary. To address these problems we discuss a Convolutional Neural Network-based method of artefact rejection and complementary method of particle identification based on common statistical classifiers as well as their ensemble extensions. These approaches are based on supervised learning, so we need to provide a representative subset of the CREDO dataset for training and validation. According to this approach over 2300 images were chosen and manually labeled by 5 judges. The images were split into spot, track, worm (collectively named signals) and artefact classes. Then the preprocessing consisting of luminance summation of RGB channels (grayscaling) and background removal by adaptive thresholding was performed. For purposes of artefact rejection the binary CNN-based classifier was proposed which is able to distinguish between artefacts and signals. The classifier was fed with input data in the form of Daubechies wavelet transformed

It proposes a definition of ‘maximal formula’, ‘segment’ and ‘maximal segment’ suitable to the system, and gives reduction procedures for them. It is then shown that deductions in the system convert into normal form, i.e. deductions that contain neither maximal formulas nor maximal segments, and that deductions in normal form satisfy the subformula property. Tarski’s Rule is treated as a general introduction rule for implication. The general introduction rule for negation has a similar form. Maximal formulas with implication or negation as main operator require reduction procedures of a more intricate kind not present in normalisation for intuitionist logic."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056227475","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"105-129","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-021-00775-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7fb7","name":"Nils","lastName":"Kürbis","uuid":"6C3E3D662B55DBC5EC853511036256FEB6634E9B18736E8288C60C6B7AA87E756D532EEFEC28CBEF986FCC9480B7ED1B5538D080DE38A3F1BBD459BD3405A087","orcidId":"0000-0002-3651-5458","documentHash":"1b7980f8-097e-430a-99fa-cf2e680f5d56"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00153-021-00775-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Promieniowanie jonizujące","Kataliza","Bakterie","Zwierzęta laboratoryjne","Myszy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Radiant catalytic ionization","Animal facilities","Mice","Microorganisms","TBARS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Radiant catalytic ionization improves the microbiological status of rodent facilities without affecting the prooxidative status of mice","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c67","mniswId":"13405","title":"Laboratory Animals","doi":null,"issn":"0023-6772","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d6c20cb8-9af8-41a8-ab06-762adbaf02db"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6150b5832467f0451f34ac0e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70935f878c28a0473a8568","5e7092c1878c28a04739c186","66017c9040970762631cab1e","66017c9040970762631cab1f","66017c9040970762631cab20","66017c9040970762631cab21","66017c9040970762631cab22","66017c9040970762631cab23","66017c9040970762631cab24","66017c9040970762631cab25"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main microbial contaminants of rooms in which laboratory rodents are housed are bacteria and fungi. Restriction of microbial growth to below threshold levels requires the application of various sophisticated antimicrobial techniques that must be effective and safe for the animals. Some of the most commonly used techniques, including chemical disinfection, ventilation, filtration, sterilization and radiation, are not always sufficiently effective. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of a modern technique (i.e. radiant catalytic ionization (RCI)) on the microbiological status of an animal care facility, and the health of the mice housed therein. The experiment, conducted over seven days, compared an experimental room with an RCI system permanently turned on with a negative control room. At the completion of the experiment, the number of bacteria in the RCI room air and on its walls was lower than that in the control room ( <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01 in both cases). Values of the basic prooxidative parameter, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances concentration, in tissues of mice from the RCI room were within allowed boundaries. Hence, application of an RCI system proved to be an ideal technique to ensure high hygienic standards in animal rooms without any adverse effects on the animals housed therein."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056227851","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"56","pagesFromTo":"225-234","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00236772211027740","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66017c9040970762631cab25","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Koczoń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"197be0b3-2ef0-4e76-920c-6e1d0667eef4"},{"objectId":"66017c9040970762631cab24","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Kosieradzka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfecd744-d844-4583-b2a7-d25965ddd65c"},{"objectId":"66017c9040970762631cab23","name":"Klara","lastName":"Zglińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44a985a1-94de-454a-81ae-5106891a237a"},{"objectId":"66017c9040970762631cab22","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Łozicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"96d2758e-fc20-448b-92f0-68241f704c95"},{"objectId":"66017c9040970762631cab21","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Fiszdon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2867a390-19b4-444e-8160-728586550268"},{"objectId":"66017c9040970762631cab20","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Gryń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f85cef6-1047-4b53-a29d-d7e7c977216f"},{"objectId":"66017c9040970762631cab1f","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Świderek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a4ef3436-a4c2-4397-8bac-cf488b0efd5d"},{"objectId":"66017c9040970762631cab1e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Niemiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f68b0b2c-ab66-4d13-a95b-ecf88e714681"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a8568","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Skowron","uuid":"49D00C05CF2DCF956E4376E85421FD1A4DF3E515F1752E012220C8DA54DA999CB725D0AC4AED22FD96AB9B5BF2974B2748C8B9EDE9D1F3D3011948CE319947D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-0868-864X","documentHash":"cee88439-5d7c-48c9-9647-528614338c33"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c186","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kwiecińska-Piróg","uuid":"15C5A7D01A27EA6368FD8FE563A012C2B9CCDA88F865A336A96DE59D59B896F6357A34F12323F86C51935DE6731A0A69BF0ED8C34B74666D504E07DE2AFC4AA7","orcidId":"0000-0003-1476-3263","documentHash":"c3185ef0-5cfc-4a61-b2fc-86689f775abc"}],"doi":"10.1177/00236772211027740"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cash holdings","Financial slack","Organizational resilience","COVID-19","Tourism industry"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092db878c28a04739e32a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A study of the tourism industry's cash-driven resilience capabilities for responding to the COVID-19 shock","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479969","mniswId":"19591","title":"TOURISM MANAGEMENT","doi":null,"issn":"0261-5177","eissn":"1879-3193","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"94e35ed5-17fe-4805-b873-1c424c4a94d9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6151b52c2467f05293ae6248","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092db878c28a04739e32a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study explores the tourism industry's cash-driven resilience capabilities. To map these capabilities, it enhances the existing analytical approaches to develop the two-dimensional evaluation of cash holdings of tourism businesses from four Central European Countries. The empirical investigation indicates that the non-resilient companies prevail over the resilient ones. If we consider the tourism industry sectors, cash-driven resilience capabilities differ statistically significantly at businesses size level but do not differ at the country level. It is observed that companies with greater cash-driven resilience capabilities are distinguished by a higher profitability and are less financially constrained. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on the COVID-19 impacts on the tourism industry by specifying the importance of financial slack and cash holdings in determining the resilience capabilities.

Therefore, hydrometallurgy is a promising technology for metal recovery and the removal of potentially toxic heavy metals found in industrial sludge. However, a comprehensive review that focuses on the heavy metal recovery from industrial sludge using hydrometallurgical approaches has not been conducted in the recent past. The present review discusses the capacity of hydrometallurgical techniques in recovering heavy metals sourced from different types of industrial sludges, highlighting recent scientific findings. Hydrometallurgical approaches primarily consist of three process stages: metal dissolution, concentration and purification, and metal recovery. The chemical characteristics of industrial sludge, including the type, concentration and speciation of heavy metals, directly impact selection of the best recovery method. Solvent extraction, ion-exchange, and adsorption are the major techniques employed in concentration and purification, whereas electrodeposition and precipitation are the main methods used in metals recovery. Future research should focus on the development of more efficient and environmentally-friendly methods for metal dissolution from industrial sludges contaminated with multiple metals, while increasing selectivity and energy use efficiency in the concentration and purification, and recovery steps."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056234254","journalIssue":{"objectId":"613741bf2467f0111cdf92b6","year":"2020","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b23ba20e-b5b1-4139-8554-14b43dee9053"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-41","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10643389.2020.1847949","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"613741bf2467f0111cdf92b5","name":"Yong Sik","lastName":"Ok","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3401-0912","documentHash":"b165e592-29eb-4ac8-ad0b-ca6acb380e35"},{"objectId":"613741bf2467f0111cdf92b4","name":"Siming","lastName":"You","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2175-7291","documentHash":"84e294f8-033f-4835-a2d2-75f268297fe1"},{"objectId":"613741bf2467f0111cdf92b3","name":"Mu.","lastName":"Naushad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25d598f4-0734-411f-93d0-34087fc560e7"},{"objectId":"613741bf2467f0111cdf92b2","name":"Rangabhashiyam","lastName":"Selvasembian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9172bea-e3d5-4991-a28e-020146e70e67"},{"objectId":"613741bf2467f0111cdf92b1","name":"Daniel S.","lastName":"Alessi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8360-8251","documentHash":"d9a5d5cb-0e7c-408e-a998-750d294aef34"},{"objectId":"613741bf2467f0111cdf92b0","name":"Meththika","lastName":"Vithanage","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2923-4065","documentHash":"25c01462-8ca2-48f5-a7ef-e5ad9b2c20a9"},{"objectId":"613741bf2467f0111cdf92af","name":"Anushka Upamali","lastName":"Rajapaksha","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3240-3934","documentHash":"05aacb45-da4b-46a6-aefa-0d6259155a30"},{"objectId":"613741bf2467f0111cdf92ae","name":"Viraj","lastName":"Gunarathne","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5690-7697","documentHash":"dc7aec24-b29e-4ef0-930a-c83d6b482e3d"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390aff","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"4FCF45750A5D33DB0E506D0634C8E83F1F567E71FDA182424BC16D3A9B7D6C806B3E751DD8DEB8A95F81EFA82B94E668B6604C0E4D9479D418440B46FFBD3060","orcidId":"0000-0001-8546-7299","documentHash":"de8bb1e3-4bc1-43e6-aba8-d51f467ca81f"}],"doi":"10.1080/10643389.2020.1847949"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Word equations","String unification","Context-sensitive languages","Space efficient computations","Linear space"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a0473914a0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Word equations in non-deterministic linear space","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454785b9","mniswId":"10623","title":"Journal of Computer and System Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"0022-0000","eissn":"1090-2724","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"34a313c0-b393-4383-8a3f-b8d6ff75f7b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2021-09-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61376ad02467f0111cdfa036","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741870","mniswId":"864","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming","shortName":"ICALP","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"cd0c32fb-c3c5-4439-9ce6-81d98ea425df"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922e878c28a0473914a0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Satisfiability of word equations problem is: Given two sequences consisting of letters and variables decide whether there is a substitution for the variables that turns this equation into true equality.

However, many pre-War traces of past landscapes have survived—imprinted in microtopography—in permanently abandoned villages. Currently, they constitute unique cultural heritage of communities no longer in existence. Our main goal was therefore to reconstruct a lost cultural landscape of mountain villages abandoned after World War II (WWII). The case study area comprised three such villages located in southern Poland, two in the Carpathians and one in the Sudetes. We used the national airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) dataset combined with archival cadastral maps and field survey to detect man-made microtopographic features related to past boundaries, road network, agriculture and buildings and to interpret them in the landscape context. We demonstrated that the pre-War human footprint left in relief was shaped largely by past landownership divisions, land use and environmental constraints (related to lithology, soils and topography). Our secondary goal was to assess the value and application opportunities of LiDAR in reconstructing past landscapes. We showed that 38–70% of non-natural parcel boundaries and 65–79% of roads marked on mid-19th-century cadastral maps are still detectable using LiDAR. Therefore, we argue that the past landscape pattern, originating in late Middle Ages and subsequently transformed prior to WWII, remains well preserved in the relief and that LiDAR is an effective tool to reconstruct a past landscape of mountain villages abandoned after WWII. We also confirmed that customized LiDAR visualizations are more informative than ready-to-use shaded digital elevation models (DEMs), in particular when integrated with cadastral and field-based data. We conclude that the greatest advantage of LiDAR is the capacity to provide a landscape context for isolated traces of past human activity, allowing for the reconstruction of entire spatial patterns and interrelationships developed by past societies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056241068","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"157-173","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arp.1846","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63a04c714097072312046033","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Wolski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"882636e7-e1ab-4da5-8d40-4032c47f1ff2"},{"objectId":"5e70943b878c28a0473b87c1","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Affek","uuid":"5AE228AAE077813CA5EFB357C5939F0010ADC2F16741B15C56771B26F0CBDFBF377A183103C6622DF0225732750E164FA7BC17291AD161139733C0F51324A10D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8751-8288","documentHash":"56783473-3599-45cd-a7b5-3c1ae8f6b786"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af8c4","name":"Maria","lastName":"Zachwatowicz","uuid":"F20C8685238224D636B1066C946732A42A98CB8BFADBA95B106925A19419C2DAC0333DB65D9D7959B78D95C8A741FE0B9923F77E5AFD2ECC2CBBD18EF30BD69B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7651-2211","documentHash":"0344ba0a-8f95-4243-9997-b0cab38cee3e"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473917ea","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"F6DAD99EBC4B9765BDE38E8E649F07B2784CF78AFC51D56DD7983A9B750D7DBFDD2854BAF28B49D49717AF32A11C3FEA871CBC6570775EF2EA792636ADCD8CDD","orcidId":"0000-0002-2837-2629","documentHash":"2fe48c96-0b82-43a1-9cc2-1d400edcccd6"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a04739157f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Latocha-Wites","uuid":"96565C0FA742FFA7173AC42FEEE56A5A307EA38CF8B73D92F4E14948FB7DCB869B1359D483688CFCF9BEEABFEC294CF551ACA676DB892FB34BA4FB967E320115","orcidId":"0000-0001-7292-5043","documentHash":"5d97e7a9-66c7-43e4-ab59-81cc5998f464"}],"doi":"10.1002/arp.1846"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["drapieżnik szczytowy","zachowanie podczas inkubacji","krajobraz strachu","wykrywanie pola magnetycznego","dron (UAE)"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apex predator","incubation behaviour","landscape of fear","magnetic field detection","unmanned aerial vehicle"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f903","uid":"bDRV4MaxR-ZX3JsID2JoVuw","uuid":"6d62a94f-547c-43bd-8416-8fbcb223b250","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","name":"Instytut Biologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709429878c28a0473b764e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Head and body orientation of the White Stork Ciconia ciconia during incubation : effect of wind, apex predators and power lines","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547894c","mniswId":"12142","title":"Journal of Ornithology","doi":null,"issn":"0021-8375","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7b569ba7-3653-4948-b38a-90ef53344800"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-07-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"615438c72467f049ef894bdd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709429878c28a0473b764e","6661a15e4097074fa1bcc9c5","6661a15e4097074fa1bcc9c6","6661a15e4097074fa1bcc9c7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Incubation behaviour is essential for understanding the reproductive success in birds. For example, the orientation of the bird is important for reducing incubation costs associated with wind or sun, but on the other hand can be modified by the perceived risk of predation. We studied the body position of incubating White Stork Ciconia ciconia in eastern Poland using a small unmanned aerial vehicle (drone). The head and body orientation of the incubating storks was non-random and modified by natural factors, mainly wind direction and speed, but also by the presence of an apex predator, the White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla. However, head orientation during incubation in nests located on electricity poles was also modified by the presence of the power lines, probably due to disturbance in the magnetic field detected by birds. Surprisingly, although the positioning of incubating birds (mainly females) is very important for the detection of predators and for reducing energy costs, these have not previously been studied. New technologies, such as drones, make it possible to collect new, extensive information on the incubation behaviour of birds."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056241121","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661a15e4097074fa1bcc9c4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"163","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"29fab8da-592d-4e73-9ebe-6342e70dfaec"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"181-189","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10336-021-01920-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a15e4097074fa1bcc9c7","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Tryjanowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eafbc25e-f4a7-4bbb-aabd-38ff53839b00"},{"objectId":"6661a15e4097074fa1bcc9c6","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Jerzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64ff4f0e-deaf-41d4-88fd-a261e870fc11"},{"objectId":"6661a15e4097074fa1bcc9c5","name":"Adam","lastName":"Zbyryt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9d5dc040-80b1-4877-b31c-d36e5b883868"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b764e","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"JANKOWIAK","uuid":"E1F32366431A606BA729F6067FCB5C45A4A327CF9E1D890C8BB75839B81395F74FC4C08B93CAB4657FF2519DED9BE5E130EDC875DC51582A2EB8909AE40E00B1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3843-9778","documentHash":"955df4a9-f4bd-49a3-9c3b-fc67706d7f93"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10336-021-01920-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Solitary bee","wild bee","Osmia rufa","pollinator management","red mason bee","artificial nests","insect breeding"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","uid":"bqvFVl6-FYxc-KjUUrbTwDw","uuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","parentUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","rootUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","name":"Instytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709316878c28a0473a2ad0","5e7092b1878c28a04739ada4"]},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ada4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Current state of knowledge on the biology and breeding of the solitary bee – Osmia bicornis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478466","mniswId":"10130","title":"JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH","doi":null,"issn":"0021-8839","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"58896df8-bb6f-4940-956e-272d75565717"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2021-08-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"613855fc2467f01d5d7663de","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ada4","5e709316878c28a0473a2ad0","5ffed99d085dcb0e357dceac"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This review gathers the majority of foregoing information about the red mason bee (Osmia bicornis, syn. rufa) (Apoidea: Megachilidae) and elaborates on the following issues: taxonomy and morphology, distribution, reproduction and sex ratios, nesting, life cycle, and daily activity, metabolic changes, accompanying organisms (including parasites), flower preferences and pollination, and breeding.

NATO’s new strategic concept was put forward at NATO Summits of 2018 and 2019 by Member State leaders, and it defines a new strategy to deter a potential aggressor. The new strategic concept is based on NATO’s strategy of cohesion and coherence discussed in detail in this article. NATO’s new strategic concept was a result of Russian military operations in Ukraine, Georgia, Estonia and Montenegro, as well as the deployment of Russian forces on Russia’s western and southern borders. Nowadays, when the application of a new strategy can give a significant advantage, Russia’s imperial policy using cutting edge technology seems unpredictable, as it does not give the enemy a chance to repel an attack in a timely manner.

The current study tested how comparisons to an ideal or anti-ideal politician moderated the evaluation of candidates whose images were defined by the strength and structure of positive and negative associations. Our study accounts for two key aspects of political behavior: the dependence on the point of reference and the associative structure of candidate image. Our approach was tested in the context of the 2016 US presidential elections, where Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump ran for the Presidential office. Although the study was conducted almost three years after the elections, its results still resembled the electoral behavior during the presidential campaign. The findings showed no differences between two politicians with regard to their similarity to an anti-ideal politician, however, they differed when compared to an ideal politician, with Clinton having more commonality with the ideal politician. Moreover, the activated category (ideal/ anti-ideal) moderated the evaluation of two opposing politicians. The results are discussed within the contrast model of similarity, pointing to the validity of our approach when used to analyze behavior in a political context."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056254015","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"8313–8326","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-021-02168-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6540efd4409707677dffcb26","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Olszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec8c8b19-d18d-40d3-8708-c07d01730917"},{"objectId":"6540efd4409707677dffcb25","name":"Sean P.","lastName":"Conway","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae0fae6c-b860-405a-899a-da8f0753016d"},{"objectId":"5e709448878c28a0473b9a0d","name":"Maria","lastName":"Sidoruk-Grymuza","uuid":"3DA99905C79FB98AB446A94631004BD0CC4980085B5154F2CAACA039B166B7EAE0677107BAC839127C77D92A2268332465C421970D68EAFC473E05425C06CEDD","orcidId":"0000-0002-1919-3426","documentHash":"838c77d3-fdb8-45a3-8eef-cbae6d241ed9"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa828","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Jabłońska","uuid":"8506F84496CE369E203EB03753C7F8E369ECBAD14A2CEA5F90D8E6C227E42BB144F108FC71DEAC384115DBBE3ABD49ABA22402F2849C958CE8A1F8FCFBF44C7E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4802-2842","documentHash":"c8bfe1d0-3ba6-4178-99be-b24336c953e7"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a0569","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Falkowski","uuid":"72084B62F9BC5537511524FA44A370D1A2BD7190DF6AF14573F35804F2364ECFAC35448A1256C8E7F79684FE4007A6FBCE04EE082E2CB4DFD0E6A46BAE78B29F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5919-1110","documentHash":"64805fef-e961-4e4b-9ddf-e2d2f0f2e362"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12144-021-02168-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ecological niche modelling and first records from Namibia and Zimbabwe validate the amphi-equatorial distribution of Byrsinus pseudosyriacus (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Cydnidae)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476efd","mniswId":"596","title":"African Journal of Ecology","doi":null,"issn":"0141-6707","eissn":"1365-2028","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"064aedf5-3ce1-4b0f-9c9c-83664ffe0d79"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"615591202467f025d9b41978","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924e878c28a04739364a","5e70924e878c28a047393645","649bfe254097071386c3c43d"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747056257016","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"60","pagesFromTo":"100-104","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/aje.12908","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"649bfe254097071386c3c43d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e274151-b928-4073-8fae-25b3a1833a33"},{"objectId":"5e70924e878c28a04739364a","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Lis","uuid":"CAA103FF04DEFB7E12F60A66901712A7FDD3E2D3DCBBCA2CD2B3249CFE71FDAA9297C64E26B0DFE9E551B84B255136F51345CA4AB85599A80225C56F506FFA03","orcidId":"0000-0003-1332-8331","documentHash":"e94e5c17-cc32-4a6c-abb4-de82274dd986"},{"objectId":"5e70924e878c28a047393645","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Lis","uuid":"6B1ED24BE4B5EB62ADE55073721FDFD9E157DB75E81A5475B14CED2DA818DE33ABE0ABA2489885784104CBC3A23EB1AFF72590864863F0E7D6EF9472FFA03D80","orcidId":"0000-0002-3292-1109","documentHash":"fe476213-a2c5-40b4-813e-ee8de7fbe794"}],"doi":"10.1111/aje.12908"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Caramulla quadrangula","DFT","UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF","acylated polyoxypregnane glycosides"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949d878c28a0473c0722","5e70929c878c28a0473990b1","5e709298878c28a047398b45"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fingerprinting of two an acylated polyoxypregnane glycosides from Caralluma quadrangula (Forssk.)

N.E.Br. (CQ). The analyses were performed using an electrospray-ionization quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-Q-TOF) mass spectrometer in positive ionization modes to explore fragmentation pathways. The used ionization mode provided consistent and/or complementary information for most of the pregnane glycosides, their fragmentation sequences, and their aglycones. Presumably, this is due to higher efficiency, sensitivity, and better selectivity of the mass spectrometry-based method. The present experimental and theoretical report deals with the characteristic fragmentation behaviors of two acylated polyoxypregnane glycosides CQ1 and CQ2 from the aerial parts of C. quadrangular. A DFT Study was performed to elucidate the position of ikemoyl, and benzoyl residues in compounds CQ1 and CQ2, respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056260269","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"136-140","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14786419.2021.1948847","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6140480a2467f0723cada1e2","name":"Arafa

The red upper layer of the objects consists of ”protohematite”, implying temperature-driven, goethite-to-hematite transition. The red layer shows traces of carbonized matter with saccharides and levoglucosan (from burning wood) as well as fatty acids. PXRD data suggest a source of higher temperatures (up to ~800°C) within the bottom layer, with ~200–300°C range ascribed to the red layer. On the basis of the collected data the artefacts are proposed to be relics of cooking stones."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056266414","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62dfb2c34097073fe3054e42","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"64","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"98bf86a6-b985-4d61-99a4-f5f6d52ebd91"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"300-316","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/arcm.12703","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616f7f2975234017e05656f1","name":"Michał","lastName":"Szubski","uuid":"BBF4D52444B48C29CE119D6BB206C4B4FB759B33467126F643633121FA605D8E883E300FE7F6ED0EA29704124390DF02DFED3EA93748CE2FCA2C33C6BAD4966F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0873-8686","documentHash":"d8676ef8-6745-466b-a58c-aba904e914d0"},{"objectId":"6140845b2467f0723cadb078","name":"Michał","lastName":"Paczkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3277-3468","documentHash":"61e39ed3-d917-4a39-84ba-975d6ccc1993"},{"objectId":"5e709492878c28a0473bfc3f","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Gójska","uuid":"F1A9D9763AA94FAFDEAD2E0FA504226BA7FC8A1E33B5FB60480C48ED0739F6F0916BC55A72D746B8B2F7756DAE342FC00FDDFA4C279F8912144ABEC8EBDBB7C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1550-2180","documentHash":"2a774082-e296-43c4-9cde-ae635698b238"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b6273","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wilczopolska","uuid":"3F4CD42A76298DD29FAD186142A33B9C528F7607E02C20914A9048330EEE97E74981681B4111285A50B90E93B36B642394CCE03C735C426FF880B646795C1B7A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4157-4804","documentHash":"f5ce9a5f-bccf-4f7a-a966-57e80f084f69"},{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4f94","name":"Tymoteusz","lastName":"Kosiński","uuid":"F663C9C367D7599675F0BBBCC5BB917A29CEC4E06265EB6EDD96BF6BEC7CBB970ACCB6DDF0AF4CD4BB4903AFCF6CA374C0E2B90C08CBD67104E0C82B9045BB63","orcidId":"0000-0003-2052-4269","documentHash":"b71ade53-429b-46e0-a267-95263d512133"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fb7","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Diduszko","uuid":"6FA54DF09909270DACB76A66BE36BA07DC7C3477ABB6FA15273B9B7B9879623878D8CB7DC19A862C6053A932248D3AB532F67214D58CC5E05B1A3DD431E36D9E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0590-6824","documentHash":"8d69efe2-821c-4d3e-bdfd-61a9370b4f25"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af946","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kruszewski","uuid":"AA68ECB830DBAF9EE61D4CDB12341ED0ECA4234724ACDC05F5DFD6D13559815CB99D36BF3EE64A608CB276067AFC226219055D9F71E955F6F22B4C6044D8F574","orcidId":"0000-0001-6332-9944","documentHash":"25a2c6ad-53f8-4487-9472-1cb27830180d"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7f8b","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Miśta-Jakubowska","uuid":"A42E1EEAD3AA6C6FDDC04EDA755D7A963625439A58E88806D3BA182DB091C81D733D363B0FF75D299783BBE856E8CBDD6A75D8C431CE89A616D0937267464A26","orcidId":"0000-0002-0053-8711","documentHash":"10cc968c-a190-483a-93ce-35eef08667c6"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7f64","name":"Krystian","lastName":"Trela","uuid":"3AA77AEDF77CF968C9696371DEDBF7D5EE2316995AB335D8F1C3D50DD2C2D125E3BD0CAEB623EF86D392FFC4A4757CFC26B2D5B5023A2260A3CBACC4254FD638","orcidId":"0000-0002-7936-1428","documentHash":"8fb70282-edcc-4da7-b959-591550200205"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7dbd","name":"Michał","lastName":"Przeździecki","uuid":"4EE9C4720BC4316B7710184CB11EC70E0126960440D5C87C24080383D4E52ABF4E9DE629F8100D30511CF7AEBDEAC9C94E1E2DD853E5D23915F7B112EFD6ABED","orcidId":"0000-0002-8605-3941","documentHash":"2f1ecec6-31ac-4927-96fe-f56679ddc42f"},{"objectId":"5e7092f4878c28a04739fd02","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pyżewicz","uuid":"ADB54245F3EB848AB299F47E2B4FA559DF091597B0F333894D8288436F235637C2772A14B6ECA5D0369F8ED0510FE49903ABF5B1F23744002A41D9B06EA9FE27","orcidId":"0000-0001-9228-9347","documentHash":"c0ae877a-b0b1-4812-9455-7e2c4664b3c5"},{"objectId":"5e7092e8878c28a04739f0e0","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Marynowski","uuid":"1A46A9E911DEC094412B8E638F930720895668E9AD696403C7F7ADB1E1BB673B4DB2665D110A90C1118D48A731657F3797D70721374E85CFE56BF149EF2BFAA2","orcidId":"0000-0002-9044-4398","documentHash":"3d779590-09f8-4172-ab81-bb234f20e29c"}],"doi":"10.1111/arcm.12703"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-0-367-89405-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka

research results internationally has become a hallmark of modern science. In many countries, scholars are expected to publish in journals that promise high citation scores, boosting the recognition of the authors and institutions they represent. Since most of such indexed journals are English-medium, these expectations influence the choice of the publication language, a problem particularly relevant in the social sciences and humanities (SSH), where research is often embedded in specific cultural contexts. This paper presents the results of a study on multilingual publication practices among SSH scholars at the University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland. It looks into the present and future language choices, reasons for these decisions, and the role of science policy in shaping the linguistic landscape of the SSH disciplines. The analysis is based on data collected in a survey and retrieved from the university publication reports for the evaluation period 2017–2021. The results demonstrate the dominant position of Polish and a strong and growing position of English, with a small share of publications in other languages. The findings point to the role of evaluation schemes in decisions regarding the publication language and the need for a science policy that fosters multilingual research practices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056271882","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6735f060fdbe832943b2021d","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"20","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"8c3ae1b0-55bc-4f4a-8f55-cbc75bc1160f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"801-824","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14790718.2021.1966432","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b42a6","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Zakrajewski","uuid":"57C0618CBCFF59F13501BD75C1FB52F357734A996A8BC93BEF365FC160B58385EE33FC8D5DECA2BD003E9868F4DCF18B8C710E56586ECD56973E860F2BE1D6DE","orcidId":"0000-0003-1412-4365","documentHash":"54affceb-ba74-43db-9735-f3f66b728253"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f2c8","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Warchał","uuid":"B508E0B9D88B0202E4776625471EFC088A03E84454FE1A23FF0D65F5DC10219D84EECB02C7D652754F772989D80D6BAA54DBB4A48BF5C095E7D81C36061B9E1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8422-4911","documentHash":"c2c817ae-dde9-463c-aca4-9e8ae9a37258"}],"doi":"10.1080/14790718.2021.1966432"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cambrian","Alum Shales","SPICE event","authigenic carbonates","anoxia","carbonate supersaturation","Snedronningen phenomenon"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df17","uid":"bxvEdTB_rZDwTwDCxKD8MAA","uuid":"baafdd5c-15d8-49db-ac14-1067a5fabd1b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Geologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7cfa","5e709356878c28a0473a79b2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Authigenic calcium carbonate precipitation in the “bathtub ring” around the anoxic Alum Shale Basin during the Furongian SPICE event (Baltic Basin, northern Poland)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e41","mniswId":"7212","title":"GFF","doi":null,"issn":"1103-5897","eissn":"2000-0863","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"680278d7-a974-4ce8-adba-366cf285a43e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6141caa72467f00a85803015","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e0b499543c7410626eb01","5e709359878c28a0473a7cfa","5e709356878c28a0473a79b2"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The precipitation of both biotic and abiotic calcium carbonate is of great importance in modern and ancient global biogeochemical cycles. In the present-day oceans, the widespread precipitation of inorganic CaCO3 on the seafloor or in the water column is possible only under extraordinary circumstances. By contrast, in the geological record, authigenic seafloor carbonate cements were widespread in the supersaturated, anoxic oceans of the Precambrian. Widespread authigenic carbonate precipitation ceased by the end of the Neoproterozoic as a consequence of global oceanic oxygenation: in the Phanerozoic, it occurred only during major anoxic events (for example, at the Permian/Triassic boundary) or in restricted, stagnant basins. Here, we present an anomalous record of CaCO3 precipitation from the Cambrian Alum Shale Basin of the Baltica palaeocontinent with Precambrian-like authigenic, seafloor encrusting, crystalline carbonates.\n\nThe depositional environment of this well-recognized, cool-water, stagnant anoxic basin favoured local carbonate precipitation via the surplus generation of alkalinity in anoxic bottom waters. However, the correlation of the acme of authigenic carbonate formation with the onset and peak of the Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion (SPICE) suggests a driver−trigger relation between the two phenomena.\n\nOn a smaller scale, carbonate authigenic precipitation is manifested by a cement-supported texture of the limestone intercalations in the Alum Shale facies. Instantaneous calcification of the faunal remains, termed here the Snedronningen phenomenon, must have been of great importance in the formation of Orsten-type Konservat Lagerstätten."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056272617","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6141caa72467f00a85803019","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"07e40baa-7d5f-49c7-9420-005f5b16cc08"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"144","pagesFromTo":"41-58","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11035897.2021.1941239","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602e0b499543c7410626eb01","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Majchrzyk","uuid":"E37445AF9BA79342CE8D7174BE9038B2F6EE36C22243D74E070E487FD9482714295053CE229B42A6B450BCDC7D749667BF04E1C062B18DDFB57A7A5D9F0A6714","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"547dde5a-a1fd-4c2c-87bd-1fe12fbc991e"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7cfa","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kozłowski","uuid":"434BB52B833E15FE651398D2CAA9427F934DD7A57BD4B2442008CCA7E11C1827633F5EF459E42D6802F0ACF77A14D6C55512BA13C0FA238211164437E4699773","orcidId":"0000-0003-0136-8299","documentHash":"c218e241-1d9a-48de-b003-75c09cfbc425"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a79b2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Żylińska","uuid":"54ADD3143D2DE72128DA1294DBE347F8A9D559B5DAA7F13FE749A3C13F7A41129A2EBE0C458F6E1D2F2FC36527851CC69E6511C5D8F74A31FE361B777A38B0FC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6924-4984","documentHash":"f8626fcc-a277-44a7-a147-1a3870f9beab"}],"doi":"10.1080/11035897.2021.1941239"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika

The objective of the presented study was to investigate gender differences in the changes of value systems after a cancer diagnosis. Methods In the study, we used the Polish adaptation of the Rokeach Value Survey and compared within-subject differences in the obtained results from before (retrospective) and after patients' cancer diagnosis. In the analysis, we used the Aranowska ω Coefficient of Choice and Single-Sample t-test statistics. Results Generally, after cancer diagnosis communal values gained, and agentic - lost importance regardless of patients’ gender. However, we found statistically significant effects of gender in value system changes, namely agency values (“independent” and “intellectual”) become less important for men than women, while the communal value “Mature love” was placed higher by men than women. Conclusion The results of the study confirm our initial hypothesis about significant gender differences in the changes of the value system. Practice implications Obtained knowledge can be used to better predict patient motivation and behavior in the face of oncological treatment. It is important that gender differences are considered in the process of cancer patients treatment. It can be beneficial for communication between a doctor and a patient and for counseling regarding coping with the disease."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056282841","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"105","pagesFromTo":"1030-1033","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399121004420?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63aeadaa409707109b9fb937","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Hamer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f14126d7-9859-4edb-a11a-ad20e5cb8421"},{"objectId":"63aeadaa409707109b9fb936","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ryś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5dfc9a8c-8f13-4e2f-a2a1-818459fd9f31"},{"objectId":"63aeadaa409707109b9fb935","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Greszta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b89dd2f7-9e0f-4a5c-89a4-751f7ab6f7c1"},{"objectId":"63aeadaa409707109b9fb934","name":"Michał","lastName":"Obidziński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24529726-b7d7-4716-bc18-f63869b1b949"},{"objectId":"63aeadaa409707109b9fb933","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Świderska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd466dbb-df4a-4f75-b104-a31e3ba305de"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7ef7","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Zalewska-Łunkiewicz","uuid":"C31930CC6501E427F0B057C6C682417D684A88DFEFF3B7B1E735853FDBE031237616F89A96F5F0EB67E443E242364392BD1F91BA535E899B30ED23F72B6D092B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5130-8510","documentHash":"55f2d15c-a817-4cbc-a65f-2d24c4ba1015"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.pec.2021.07.007"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af76c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Colpocleisis as an obliterative surgery for pelvic organ prolapse: is it still a viable option in the twenty-first century?

Salt stress increases the content of polyprenols inTilia's leaves, which may mitigate stress. De-icing salt has been used on streets and pavements in most northern countries since the 1960s. Salt stress limits all vital functions of trees. Tilia x euchlora is planted in many cities given its unique decorative qualities. The aim of this study was to determine the tree strategy to mitigate salt stress due to the synthesis of polyprenols in leaves. Many years of observations have demonstrated that trees of the same species growing in the same street conditions may have extremely different health statuses. The study consisted of two experiments: a field experiment with urban street trees growing in saline soils and a controlled pot experiment with young trees exposed to increasing doses of salt. The differences between the young trees from the pot experiment and older trees from the field experiment were expressed in their ability to synthesize polyprenols. In urban conditions, the tree leaves with less damage contained significantly more polyprenols than did those with more damage. The salt stress mitigation strategy may be related to the ability to synthesize polyprenols. This ability can be acquired through adaptation by older trees. The mechanism involves limiting the transport of Cl- and Na+ to leaves.

The aim of this study was to determine the diversity, intensity and drug resistance of potentially pathogenic filamentous fungi isolated from the fresh raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.). A total of 50 strains belonging to genera Fusarium, Cladosporium, Alternaria, Penicillium, Mucor, Rhizopus, Aspergillus and Acremonium were tested for drug resistance against 11 antifungals by disc diffusion and gradient strips methods. The average mycological contamination in the examined samples of raspberries amounted to 4.34 log CFU/g. The Cladosporium was isolated from all tested samples, followed by Alternaria and Fusarium with a frequency of 61% and 34%, respectively. The highest level of drug resistance was observed for Acremonium genera and Fusarium strains recorded a wide variation in drug resistance as revealed by susceptibility with amphotericin B and voriconzole with MICs ranged from 0.5–4 µg/ml and posaconazole with MICs ranging from 3–8 µg/ml. All fungal strains showed 100% resistance to caspofungin, fluconazole and flucytosine with both the methods, and 100% resistance to micafungin and anidulafungin in the gradient strip method."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056292464","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62df9c4b4097073fe3049cc6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"62","number":"1","doi":"10.1007/s12088-021-00966-y","documentHash":"d3426bb7-6636-4cef-bc30-eecc10658003"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"146-151","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12088-021-00966-y.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b42bf","name":"Angelina","lastName":"Wójcik-Fatla","uuid":"91FB79281E9E1E1E8D4CF9D15DF58423B26E03556A22DB938A8FDA5164F3F3C2C537CA0A1C9790C699CDA4EBBC2AE56609356E44B4913521DD9041120C2496A0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5260-4867","documentHash":"6355b5d9-7b65-41b4-ae96-d1d3fd7d25e8"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a663d","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Farian","uuid":"F00C52C48DECF57786B21906EF8575C0CE75F091D67F4F87AFEB2D9E2A5E0B1D85168F8A19ACAD2B76F79FFCA221248DAFFA322F96DAF7DDA5A27957A544E412","orcidId":"0000-0003-0135-2959","documentHash":"9fd24615-3bab-403b-998e-b7695ea7078a"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12088-021-00966-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["density functional theory","excited states","noncovalent interactions","range-separation","wave function"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947a878c28a0473be081"]},{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e049","uid":"b4fgYY2Mxwh_PUhU7P68_Tg","uuid":"a5fea403-3e76-478e-937d-8d6ba69cf30c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Wydział Fizyki Technicznej, Informatyki i Matematyki Stosowanej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947a878c28a0473be081","5e709268878c28a0473952c1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Range‐separated multiconfigurational density functional theory methods","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479ac7","mniswId":"20297","title":"Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Computational Molecular Science","doi":null,"issn":"1759-0876","eissn":"1759-0884","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a6b95d1b-f3c5-441e-8b96-2d9655dc0ca3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2021-08-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"614b4a002467f0268cb451a9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709268878c28a0473952c1","5e70947a878c28a0473be081"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Range-separated multiconfigurational density functional theory (RS MC-DFT) rigorously combines density functional (DFT) and wavefunction (WFT) theories. This is achieved by partitioning of the electron interaction operator into long- and short-range components and modeling them with WFT and DFT, respectively. In contrast to other methods, mixing wavefunctions with density functionals, RS MC-DFT is free from electron correlation double counting. The general formulation of RS MC-DFT allows for merging any ab initio approximation with density functionals. Implementations of RS MC-DFT aim at increasing both versatility and accuracy of the underlying methods, while reducing the computational cost of the ab initio problem. Variants of the RS MC-DFT approach can be divided into single-determinant-based range-separated methods and range-separated multideterminantal WFT methods. In these approaches the electron correlation energy is described both by a pertinent short-range density functional and by the wavefunction theory. We review the short-range functionals and correlated wavefunction theories employed in the framework of RS MC-DFT. We discuss applications of the RS MC-DFT methods to ground-state properties of molecules and to noncovalent interactions. Time-dependent linear-response theory and direct approaches to excited states are also presented. For each area of applications, we assess advantages of RS MC-DFT over conventional DFT and ab initio methods."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056295474","journalIssue":{"objectId":"614b4a002467f0268cb451ae","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d05d11f2-b8ae-4533-b4fe-1c3e9c3c140a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"e1566","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wcms.1566","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be081","name":"Michał","lastName":"Hapka","uuid":"8C6353E80815B228079614EC58C7D7DE9606CE8222FFF41566782B7B2D1564ED2380ED2F93939DBE188432F0225A0B0798711DD937EF6A365BEE291E6D34289E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7423-3198","documentHash":"ec7e1938-9db8-4711-8f9b-b86a18d6394f"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a0473952c1","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pernal","uuid":"CFAF4585BCF324F8FD06C9D6D0E0166EE4389FFC86DC027C0088E3A6A4EDE13AFCB5BFD81528F95449BDAE1837BA02381AA5D266E678D69536CACE65FD9C0BB3","orcidId":"0000-0003-1261-9065","documentHash":"b5e5c92f-f592-4a4f-a7d5-902f039cb8f3"}],"doi":"10.1002/wcms.1566"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f9bed9543c7410626f683","5e709447878c28a0473b997e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Leiszmanioza psów – choroba o wielu obliczach.

on a dataset covering mayoral elections in Poland held over the period 2006–2018, we contribute to the ongoing debate on the anomalous sources of advantage enjoyed by certain candidates contesting close electoral races. While our analysis lends support to earlier conjectures that such anomalies tend to be confined to small jurisdictions, we also point to context-specific clientelistic strategies behind the anomalous advantage. The last is driven largely by an experience of holding a mayoral office in the 1990s, an era when Polish mayors were elected by local councils rather than directly by citizens. When interpreting these findings, we emphasize fundamental characteristics of post-transition Polish local democracy, including feudal legacy, pauperization of the electorate and decentralization of public spending."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056299964","journalIssue":{"objectId":"666ff8fc4097073d00135858","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"72","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"fab8969c-9df9-4de4-934c-81fd77d5616d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"72","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176268021000951","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fa1158c085dcb2ecfccf37d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Alimowski","uuid":"43FE33CA6CCFD50194D3BA37465B3FB04FC2675E2D6577502A6EC122060086268A22420E7F4CAFBD755309C192AC9DAC38F9CD7413238516B8281539D1FDB761","orcidId":"0000-0003-0290-4217","documentHash":"26c74a24-c83e-4037-8c49-0f1791fddecc"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7c8b","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Górecki","uuid":"A0B135CE08C960C76FF95603A68FF17A07F4377F559633406D02CE857026540FD29E13FA927A764183843CF482417E91FF3DB4210A675CEA8204213E935DC804","orcidId":"0000-0003-0372-551X","documentHash":"5a7904a7-ee33-4cba-bb50-cf343b39e39d"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739230c","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Bartnicki","uuid":"2894E114C068733F8FF6850EB3E2A4D476D24F1B0B1078125C4018353CC84331326E3EAC725C15C8D0A9F31C20C75D996C0268E278C5181458DAC11EC4A6CF34","orcidId":"0000-0001-6330-6021","documentHash":"4e3308e9-b4f1-4387-a56a-e2a176b3289d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2021.102109"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9783030860004","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"XXX Russian-PolishSlovak Seminar Theoretical Foundation of Civil Engineering (RSP 2021)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6151659a2467f025d94de58d","editors":[{"objectId":"655ca08f40970749a84007c1","name":"Vatin","lastName":"N","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c34f0c7a-66dd-413a-8099-fd342806d8d1"},{"objectId":"655ca08f40970749a84007c0","name":"Akimov","lastName":"Pavel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddb0a953-f5be-40f9-aeb6-1d556eb16648"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["655ca08f40970749a84007c0","655ca08f40970749a84007c1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747056305602","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-86001-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["clergymen","mental health","nuns","religiousness","spiritual transcendence"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Investigating the relationship between spiritual transcendence, personal religiosity, and mental health in Roman Catholic clergy and nuns","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547943f","mniswId":"16779","title":"Psychology of Religion and Spirituality","doi":null,"issn":"1941-1022","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"9e3c363a-628a-4edb-8d94-855de4002e2e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"615feb072467f04d4f47fb73","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927a878c28a0473966e2","6614e170409707626394fc38"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigated the mental health, religiousness, and spiritual transcendence of Roman Catholic clergy and nuns.

The cross-sectional study sample consisted of 140 Roman Catholic clergymen and nuns in four groups (n = 35 for each group): diocesan priests, religious order priests, convent nuns, and monastery nuns. Self-report questionnaires were used in the study to assess religiosity (Personal Religiousness Scale [PRS]), spirituality (Spiritual Transcendence Scale [STS]), and both somatic and mental health (General Health Questionnaire [GHQ-28]). Of the participants, 26% (n = 36) reported some symptoms of mental health disorder, including somatic symptoms (31%), anxiety and insomnia (27%), social dysfunction (19%), and severe depression (10%). No significant differences between groups were found in mental health and the STS, except for Transcendence Proper subscale (with higher scores achieved by those whose ministration was mostly inside the congregation). A series of mediation analyses, based on the biopsychosocial model of health, was conducted to find models that can explain the highest percentage of total variance. It seems that among highly religious people, better health could be achieved following the causal chain of the path from personal religiousness through spiritual openness to transcendence proper (the model accounted for 27% of total variance).

It was found that amendment with MCPA and MCPA + SA modified the soil physico-chemical properties. Content of N and K was significantly higher for variants amended with SA and/or MCPA, while P content was lower in variant amended with SA. The cucurbits demonstrated varied efficiencies in mitigating the phytotoxicity of the MCPA-treated soil. For soil amended with MCPA + SA, samples remediated with cucumber were characterized as slightly toxic or toxic (45.2%–81.5%), while those planted with zucchini were nontoxic or slightly toxic (−40.6%−47.8%). Development of cucumber seedlings was fully inhibited by MCPA, regardless of SA application, zucchini demonstrated enhanced growth in soil treated with MCPA + SA and no statistically significant differences between morphological parameters of MCPA + SA-treated zucchini in comparison to control plants were observed. The obtained findings suggest that the application of SA is a promising way to mitigate the toxic influence of MCPA in the soil, depending on the cultivated plant species."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056305908","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"205-214","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15226514.2021.1932727","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602c9cf19543c7410626e0ce","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Mierzejewska-Sinner","uuid":"7358C40713CA32FB46E50B3101FF8E01598509C97A89C18E14EA05338831293372F64EB5FB04124A73651A06BFB11562019AC3D58B03BA25212E0F30E719E60A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0876-4286","documentHash":"a985492f-d036-4e90-8bba-bc04da70f1b3"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473addb0","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Urbaniak","uuid":"7C789DFD734CBA6124E976CA54F24954B95E00A16BA3BEF188BA258BCCB569B6C789A117B945FBB45D9599BD0F7CE4D741FE1141F93AA81FCC5CDD7C2F353FDB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5118-4530","documentHash":"37594ada-3b88-41f4-a528-4dae84d62b20"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a865c","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Tołoczko","uuid":"8B993FD26C6B0373C4A1435968E6A9BF93862B13B901DDE043CC9AFF08FBC888B96190D9E1382BAFFB21B7C3844B31EE5408A8377F2BFAAC8FC4BD04FE98DC27","orcidId":"0000-0001-5441-4418","documentHash":"1f1ed20d-4fbb-467f-9ba8-9fd5372f9285"}],"doi":"10.1080/15226514.2021.1932727"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia","familial atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia","inherited arrhythmias"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Association between the geographic region and the risk of familial atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia in the Polish population","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547931f","mniswId":"16294","title":"Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej","doi":null,"issn":"0032-3772","eissn":"1897-9483","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"bad56acd-02b3-41ae-9423-6d1b3a71f6b2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2022-07-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"615feec12467f02684f4040e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937c878c28a0473aadd3","657209264097071b8e6762df","657209264097071b8e6762e0","657209264097071b8e6762e1","657209264097071b8e6762e2","657209264097071b8e6762e3","657209264097071b8e6762e4","657209264097071b8e6762e5","657209264097071b8e6762e6","657209264097071b8e6762e7"]},"issue":"11, art.

Polyphenols have a lot of biological properties, such as antioxidative, antiviral, immunomodulatory and anticancer activities. However, the effect on mastitis has not been yet described. This research aimed to analyse the tolerability of selected polyphenols after multiple intramammary administrations (IMM) as well as to investigate their potential impact on somatic cell count (SCC) in mastitis dairy cows. The study was performed on 12 Polish Holstein Black-and-White cows in their 4th to 6th lactation. Only animals with inflammation in one-quarter of the udder were selected. The selection was based on SCC and clinical assessment. The experiment was performed with multiple intramammary administrations with each of these polyphenols in dairy cows affected with mastitis. Polyphenols were administered at a dose of 30 mg/quarter/day. Milk samples for SCC, blood plasma samples for pharmacokinetics and blood haematology and biochemistry (selected blood parameters were tested) were collected at baseline, treatment period and within the recovery period. Positive effects concerning the SCC in milk of mastitic cows were confirmed for all tested polyphenols."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056311401","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62739b0a40970720005a31c2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"bb03496a-0a4a-4b12-885c-c727459bff99"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"155-172","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/it/article/10.2478/aoas-2021-0060","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65c49c544097076263ab4c68","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Grabowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"559986ba-f7ca-4a32-a157-92440fa816ca"},{"objectId":"65c49c544097076263ab4c66","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gajda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1454051-a588-4c5b-8d16-411bcd5ff5ac"},{"objectId":"65c49c544097076263ab4c65","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gbylik-Sikorska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f13c32ea-3381-4b89-8f23-fa37e7d83278"},{"objectId":"65c49c544097076263ab4c64","name":"Beata","lastName":"Wojciechowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef9d37e2-8171-4002-a5a2-b643679f6336"},{"objectId":"65c49c544097076263ab4c63","name":"Artur","lastName":"Burmańczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a9532317-d1f9-4c6d-b4ef-ca97bac8a087"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b8741","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Sosin","uuid":"E4228B1F3AA4CF4A771A905319307606C703A2797D271D7E6E8D596CA4B2F536592070F354D74C7B8713762A6E95515BEA4D5F322538407DF25C28F56AA7B422","orcidId":"0000-0001-5304-972X","documentHash":"f57984ea-bb47-450c-87cf-ed13c5a5eb47"},{"objectId":"5e70921b878c28a04738ff65","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Markiewicz","uuid":"5FF691340A60E04D488CD8D45ADD25686BED2D2CDAF068D6958F62144C30E54991C2806FE322A1F96A200996F4D1FA4254AE29947E76A05B54CAF380101EEDF9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2324-852X","documentHash":"dd4e2093-2497-43e0-978b-9baba24fecfe"}],"doi":"10.2478/aoas-2021-0060"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

Reconstructing living stature using the length of long bones and linear regression is the method of choice, especially in the case of poorly preserved human skeletal material obtained from archaeological excavations. Although the choice of the best formulae is usually based on intuition, the need for a more formal approach is paramount. However, the solutions adopted to date require a significant number of well-preserved skeletons, which is rarely possible in bioarchaeological research.\n\nFor skeletal series consisting of very incomplete skeletons, it has been shown that a simple comparison of the mean differences in stature estimation using femur, humerus, and radius bone pairs may be instrumental for selecting the most appropriate of the available stature reconstruction methods. The results were confronted with the consistency of the same methods but also using bones that could not have been used previously; that is the tibia, fibula and ulna. All the methods tested were then compared with those selected as being the most consistent to see if the results they produce are significantly different."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056314868","journalIssue":{"objectId":"648ba78840970738370741be","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"64","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"238c2ede-a6da-4c8a-84dc-dee131cd1d6d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"265-280","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1111/arcm.12700","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ce878c28a0473c4278","name":"Robert","lastName":"Mahler","uuid":"3E9C855C1D5A9E8A205478415AB1B019D55EA401692117170D1F1B3CDAF9A13C96B976010D80B1C91D2D6138BBACFDCEDEFE98ECBE0AD3D27F93417C037FA99F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0336-2539","documentHash":"12e32c48-0798-44f5-be96-24a671e8456d"}],"doi":"10.1111/arcm.12700"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Objective

The paper presents the results of a survey of the members of eight kinds of LACs that have been established in 65 Polish cities. The research results provide proof of the inclusive character of LACs: their sustainability and the conditions for their deliberation (frequency of meetings, relations with the community).

The aim of the study was to assess the structure and selected thermal and mechanical properties of the obtained biocomposites. The morphology of samples was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope and a computed tomography analysis. The phase transitions of composites and polymer matrix were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the non-equilibrium and equilibrium thermal parameters of composites and the unfilled PHBV were established based on the thermal history. Knowing equilibrium parameters, i.e., the heat of fusion for the fully crystalline materials, ΔHf (100%), and the change of heat capacity at glass transition temperature (Tg) for the fully amorphous, ΔCp (100%), composites, the degree of crystallinity, mobile, and rigid amorphous fractions were estimated. The addition of hemp fibers to the PHBV matrix caused around a two-time increase in the degree of crystallinity in reference to the unfilled PHBV. It was also observed that the addition of hemp fibers caused a decrease in heat capacity for fully amorphous material for all the biocomposites obtained. A similar relationship was observed in case of values of the heat of fusion for fully crystalline material. Simultaneously, the decrease in amorphous phase contents was noted. It was also noted that the rigid amorphous fraction exists only for the unfilled polymer matrix. Some mechanical properties of investigated materials were also measured and presented."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056331479","journalIssue":{"objectId":"658d518a4097076c1457e165","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"147","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"edc57066-5ac8-47a3-93f6-34e0cb79bde1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1017-1029","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10973-020-10492-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658f14a44097076c145d782c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Czerniecka-Kubicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"193d9528-6605-4bfd-8990-28acc46c5cfd"},{"objectId":"5e7092c5878c28a04739c5a2","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"C91A5294B62067B92F5597F01629ACBE5DAE79FB0A78F75EF14DAAF61866D8CF9F70E56076BD9F459758BFA7E215CDE9555E6C8506F90BDBFEFBB405C8F566AB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9765-637X","documentHash":"50ba8ef4-394d-4958-8c16-d4ddb222fa8b"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739526b","name":"Marek","lastName":"Pyda","uuid":"FBE13015A9C40DA23AB567DBA5B852E23EF90D67B9A3CDE7F7F14F9D3B65E64DDFBD04CC04C31BC8F29250997E3DDA2AB61A6310638D54BBD3E6005516E270A9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7969-7063","documentHash":"b34c5371-1934-449e-8129-81c3585ce328"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739521d","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Frącz","uuid":"A12F4710061BE1A084076A586D6D9F2482CEE0FDB43CB0E118BA549A57C266F7C259F169A8F8E6B82A41DADA81F73D1E6B4F31B783A892E4AFF0492A732281FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2079-359X","documentHash":"c14600ef-2c7b-4dea-8336-c2e702e0ed90"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10973-020-10492-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e31","5e7094bd878c28a0473c2e29"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Colon Endoscopic Bubble Scale (CEBuS): a two-phase evaluation study.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa7","mniswId":"5670","title":"Endoscopy","doi":null,"issn":"0013-726X","eissn":"1438-8812","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c8145bc5-d488-4757-b275-b4770e7c7b05"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616436982467f006f7e4aa25","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["616436a62467f006f7e4ab6f","616436a62467f006f7e4ab70","616436a62467f006f7e4ab72","616436a62467f006f7e4ab73","616436a62467f006f7e4ab75","616436a62467f006f7e4ab76","616436a62467f006f7e4ab77","616436a62467f006f7e4ab78","616436a62467f006f7e4ab79","616436a62467f006f7e4ab7a","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e31","616436a62467f006f7e4ab7b","616436a62467f006f7e4ab7c","616436a62467f006f7e4ab7d","616436a62467f006f7e4ab7e","616436a62467f006f7e4ab7f","616436a62467f006f7e4ab80","616436a62467f006f7e4ab81","616436a62467f006f7e4ab82","616436a62467f006f7e4ab83","616436a62467f006f7e4ab84","616436a62467f006f7e4ab85","5e7094bd878c28a0473c2e29","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae60f"]},"issue":"(1)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background To date, no scale has been validated to assess bubbles associated with bowel preparation. This study aimed to develop and assess the reliability of a novel scale – the Colon Endoscopic Bubble Scale (CEBuS).\n\nMethods This was a multicenter, prospective, observational study with two online evaluation phases of 45 randomly distributed still colonoscopy images (15 per scale grade). Observers assessed images twice, 2 weeks apart, using CEBuS (CEBuS-0 – no or minimal bubbles, covering < 5 % of the surface; CEBuS-1 – bubbles covering 5 %–50 %; CEBuS-2 – bubbles covering > 50 %) and reporting the clinical action (do nothing; wash with water; wash with simethicone).\n\nResults CEBuS provided high levels of agreement both in evaluation Phase 1 (4 experts) and Phase 2 (6 experts and 13 non-experts), with almost perfect intraobserver reliability: kappa 0.82 (95 % confidence interval 0.75–0.88) and 0.86 (0.85–0.88); interobserver agreement – intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.83 (0.73–0.89) and 0.90 (0.86–0.94). Previous endoscopic experience had no influence on agreement among experts vs. non-experts: kappa 0.86 (0.80–0.91) vs. 0.87 (0.84–0.89) and ICC 0.91 (0.87–0.94) vs. 0.90 (0.86–0.94), respectively. Interobserver agreement on clinical action was ICC 0.63 (0.43–0.78) in Phase 1 and 0.77 (0.68–0.84) in Phase 2. Absolute agreement on clinical action per scale grade was 85 % (82–88) for CEBuS-0, 21 % (16–26) for CEBuS-1, and 74 % (70–78) for CEBuS-2.\n\nConclusion CEBuS proved to be a reliable instrument to standardize the evaluation of colonic bubbles during colonoscopy. Assessment in daily practice is warranted."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056334183","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64006d744097072cdecb23d8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"54","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"e2700de6-4260-4603-805b-4ede87e4d023"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"45-51","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1331-4325","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab85","name":"Miguel","lastName":"Areia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c5a4e66-eb02-48c9-bad2-1b68ed91f0d4"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab84","name":"Mario","lastName":"Dinis-Ribeiro","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc0c6431-e9f9-4424-9bbf-4e4f5da78270"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab83","name":"Eduard","lastName":"Veseliny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08cff423-5716-453e-a6a2-43b706fd9e13"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab82","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Szlak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae704ebb-446e-4d2e-9766-fcd49cd3e370"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab81","name":"Monica","lastName":"State","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c704e26b-8bfc-4e3e-a77e-c6022c31d994"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab80","name":"Marco","lastName":"Spadaccini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa74846b-06ec-4e60-9d7a-5bccad72eb23"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab7f","name":"Cristiano","lastName":"Spada","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fb3efa5-a952-45fe-848f-0dfa5a619300"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab7e","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Repici","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0ae98ab-5860-4ff8-b89e-31267af92e02"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab7d","name":"Lucian","lastName":"Negreanu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5613182a-30a4-4ada-93f6-a69c1005598b"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab7c","name":"Jamila","lastName":"Lenz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c74a4535-ba24-45ca-a9bb-9cf5e9875e5f"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab7b","name":"Laura","lastName":"Lamonaca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f656ce80-ab5e-457d-af38-7751290ef552"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab7a","name":"Martin","lastName":"Janicko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1386d441-6152-4026-84af-4af3c7c96387"},{"objectId":"616436a62467f006f7e4ab79","name":"Leonardo

the past years, terahertz (THz) technology has received more interest and attention because of its unique properties and capabilities that make it very attractive as a tool for non-destructive evaluation (NDE). Most items consisting of dielectrics, such as plastic, glass fibre reinforced plastics (GFRP), ceramics, and certain composites (e.g., GFC), are transparent to THz waves, whereas metals and other conducting materials such as carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP), are opaque to them. Solid pyrotechnics (e.g., rocket fuels) are among those materials that transmit terahertz radiation. The paper presents preliminary results of the possible application of terahertz radiation in the detection of defects in composite pyrotechnic materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056334233","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d1206840970711f8fb0cc5","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"279","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"7e816b5b-8cef-45f7-a715-1a08ff893168"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"279","pagesFromTo":"114770","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822321012198","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709482878c28a0473bec14","name":"Paweł","lastName":"HŁOSTA","uuid":"9D2EB92202E2DE598A8F5460DC1D6959D55D4D1EE1B5165F9464B749EDEA59E0775C6D3171C922581554F0863EDF56013AAF648266A8A33FAB423693CC79FC2E","orcidId":"0000-0001-5401-2902","documentHash":"df422a7f-1f09-40e1-9950-788c4bf24bd6"},{"objectId":"5e709453878c28a0473ba7cd","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Powała","uuid":"23E686A9597371A00FC9D7C2A178357652ED878EC1F1D52B8F506257321C2A48705DDD6F1DAF7D815DF121741CDD3F5BAD6B63194326F75D0ACA355E26A87395","orcidId":"0000-0001-7860-0899","documentHash":"1eb758a9-c76c-44d2-aaa4-0c8f44dfc520"},{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b17e9","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Nita","uuid":"ACF401F4CEE1EB778CCC2ADC84D9F144E0E309265EB03F55865EE9E343E183D6184ACC5847A4E778032B787C0ADB498C5027AE48CB4FD1884F98FC25227BB448","orcidId":"0000-0001-6185-2782","documentHash":"9796b78a-bac8-425a-8674-7d50d3b082e0"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473aef9a","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Świderski","uuid":"FEF6A366C49B7567A6DF133BD7512FA00630C1ED27523AAFC96941F99F8992299B7FD08766BBCAE766660AD4BA9507F26D0C69C43C046C378AEC34E3B81ED40F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4040-2197","documentHash":"bf607b05-9569-42de-91f7-21ec61551ca8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.compstruct.2021.114770"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Vaccination","Costs","Flu","Socioeconomic burden"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094dc878c28a0473c5763","5e709479878c28a0473bdeef","5e709224878c28a047390869"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Socioeconomic costs of influenza complications in hospitalized children.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771a3","mniswId":"1677","title":"Archives of Medical Science","doi":null,"issn":"1734-1922","eissn":"1896-9151","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"aadf3a3b-d87a-48ab-b21f-786d725fd767"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2020-09-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616436402467f006f7e49830","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bdeef","6164364e2467f006f7e49a57","5e7094dc878c28a0473c5763","5e709224878c28a047390869"]},"issue":"(4)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction:\nInfluenza may be correlated with a high number of complications and generate high costs of treatment. The study aimed to estimate the socioeconomic significance of hospitalized influenza cases.\n\nMaterial and methods:\nIn the 2015–2016 flu season 157 children (median age 17 months) were hospitalized in the Department of Pediatrics. The diagnosis was confirmed with the rapid influenza diagnostic test (RIDT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or both. The study assessed the direct and indirect costs of hospitalization, including the cost of treatment, work absence and the related income lost.\n\nResults:\nThe frequency of complications among the children hospitalized was 57.3% (90/157), mainly due to pneumonia (31%) and bronchitis (23%). Patients with complications required longer hospital treatment (8 vs. 6 days, p < 0.01) and generated a higher total cost (€ 1042 vs. € 779, p < 0.01), including the patient’s and systemic costs (€123 vs. € 94, p < 0.01 and € 916 vs. € 690, p < 0.01, respectively). Patients with complications had a 3.5-fold higher risk of generating higher (i.e., above median) costs. The difference in the costs between children aged under 2 and those over 2 years old was greater than the difference between children aged under 5 and those over 5 years old (€ 358 vs. € 253).\n\nConclusions:\nInfluenza complications generate higher systemic and patient’s costs, both direct and indirect.

Changes from baseline in intraocular pressure (IOP) and IOP-lowering medications were evaluated through the first 12 months of a planned 24-month follow-up period.\nResults:\nAmong 17 eyes of 15 subjects, mean IOP was reduced from 20.4 mmHg to 12.7–13.7 mmHg through 12 months of follow-up (p < 0.001 at every time point) and mean medications reduced from 2.5 to 0.1–0.6 (p < 0.001 at every time point). IOP reductions in eyes undergoing standalone surgery were approximately 2–4 mmHg greater at each time point compared to eyes undergoing surgery combined with phacoemulsification; this may be related to a higher baseline IOP in the former eyes (22.1 vs 18.5 mmHg). Six eyes developed hyphema, of which three required washout for elevated IOP on the first postoperative day; six additional eyes had IOP elevations that resolved with medical management.\nConclusion:\nViscodilation of Schlemm’s canal and collector channels paired with ab interno trabeculotomy performed with a single integrated instrument (OMNI), whether as standalone or combined with phacoemulsification, effectively lowers both IOP and the need for IOP-lowering medications through 12 months of follow-up."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056334311","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61ec3d9b2467f079a0946150","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"32","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"a94b4ea3-ded1-4fc9-a180-ef1ab2a9fc83"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"309-315","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1120672121998234","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6164352f2467f006f7e3ee6d","name":"Ingrid","lastName":"Kane","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a4e82df-7e0a-42d8-802b-9ab30170eb5e"},{"objectId":"6164352f2467f006f7e3ee6c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Koziorowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7fb2d2ef-afb6-4094-86c7-a55adde50045"},{"objectId":"6164352f2467f006f7e3ee6b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Skowyra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"672f8cef-4369-4b9d-a995-c006ba370e61"},{"objectId":"6164352f2467f006f7e3ee6a","name":"Julita","lastName":"Majszyk-Ionescu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f36d2da-199d-4d9c-9efb-9be63b710eb7"},{"objectId":"6164352f2467f006f7e3ee69","name":"Monika","lastName":"Rogowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"abe59d6c-a41e-4730-ac5b-cd9efd718935"},{"objectId":"6164352f2467f006f7e3ee68","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Duda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef0101ef-aa8e-473a-9985-90683c0eacd3"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8904","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Chmielewski","uuid":"DF5838E23CA8DD7EB14F52574E4DFEF2F70AD4BAFB96FDB332F04489DFD8C1EBCB6D94B5DC8F9A2A5BC53E73D4CC362A78044FDCB4AAAB2BE479298617A4549A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2606-1656","documentHash":"cdeb78b7-a559-47d7-8b30-04c8ec5d294b"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b241e","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Grabska-Liberek","uuid":"44ED4778E82F464A47399AED38B871126B6DC558D05DE767E9DD13A262703C0A39AB1C04E291C9E9B041505C78FFC8220BDA0D70587C95B17A5E60E40CD60298","orcidId":"0000-0003-4190-4826","documentHash":"e25f6a12-9b5c-4c48-91f7-d94e50363864"}],"doi":"10.1177/1120672121998234"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Secondary digital nerve reconstruction","Sural nerve autograft","Long-term surgical outcomes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709404878c28a0473b4d48","5e7093dd878c28a0473b2238"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Long-term sensibility outcomes of secondary digital nerve reconstruction with sural nerve autografts: a retrospective study.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c02","mniswId":"6292","title":"European Journal of Trauma and Emergency Surgery","doi":null,"issn":"1863-9933","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"a0076850-7775-43d6-ba51-839ea21cfde5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-07-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616436a02467f006f7e4ab10","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["616436b52467f006f7e4b229","5e709404878c28a0473b4d48","5e7093dd878c28a0473b2238"]},"issue":"(3)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nRecovery of sensibility after digital nerve injury is crucial for restoring normal hand function. We evaluated long-term outcomes of digital nerve reconstruction with autografts.\n\nMethods\nThis retrospective study included patients who underwent secondary reconstruction of digital nerves with nerve autografting. Recovery of sensibility was evaluated based on the following: patient self-assessment, two-point discrimination (2PD), and a total sensation score (sum of proprioception, temperature sensation, and sharp/dull discrimination). Mixed models regression was used to study predictors of sensibility outcomes. The predictors analyzed were age, sex, smoking status, number of fingers involved in a patient (as a measure of injury severity), time to reconstruction, and time to follow-up.\n\nResults\nIn 61 patients, 174 digital nerves in 126 fingers were reconstructed after an average of 33.1 weeks from injury. The mean follow-up was 6.4 years from reconstruction. The mean graft length was 3.6 cm. Self-rated sensibility in the affected area was very good in 13% of patients, good in 33%, satisfactory in 40%, and poor in 24%. 2PD at 6 mm was present in 17% of patients, at 10 mm in 12%, and at 15 mm in 18% (mean 2PD was 10.8). Proprioception was preserved in 107 (85%) fingers, sensation of temperature was preserved in 99 (75%) of fingers, and sharp/dull discrimination in 88 (70%) fingers.

wastewater treatment with potassium ferrate (VI) (K2FeO4) was optimized by response surface methodology. The optimum conditions for chemical oxygen demand removal were established a pH 3.5, 0.328 g/L dose of K2FeO4, and with a process duration of 48 min. At these conditions, chemical oxygen demand, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus decreased by 70.3, 58.9, 73.3, 82.0%, respectively; and the putrid odor was reduced. Simultaneously, the total viable count, total coli count, most probable number of fecal enterococci, and the total proteolytic bacteria count decreased by 89.5, 93.1, 92.9, and 95.0 %, respectively. Comparatively, an application of 0.450 g/L FeCl3·6H2O corresponding to the iron content in 0.328 g/L of K2FeO4 resulted in a decrease of total viable count, total coli count, most probable number of fecal enterococci and the total proteolytic bacteria count only by 38.1, 31.2, 42.9, and 58.0%, respectively. Therefore, flocculation with polyacrylamide anionic flocculant combined with potassium ferrate (VI) oxidation is a more effective alternative to coagulation with FeCl3 and the same flocculant.

Thereafter, subjects receiving reference adalimumab were randomized (1:1) to continue reference adalimumab or switch to CT-P17 from W26 (both Q2W until W48; TP2). Subjects receiving CT-P17 in TP1 continued CT-P17. W0-W24 results were previously reported; we present W26-W52 findings. End points were efficacy (including joint damage progression), pharmacokinetics, safety and immunogenicity.\r\nResults: Of 607 subjects who initiated TP2 treatment, 303 continued CT-P17, 153 continued reference adalimumab and 151 switched to CT-P17. Efficacy improvements up to W24 were maintained during TP2; efficacy was comparable among groups. At W52, 20% improvement in ACR response rates were 80.5% (continued CT-P17), 77.8% (continued reference adalimumab) and 82.2% (switched to CT-P17). Joint damage progression was minimal. Mean trough serum adalimumab concentrations were similar among groups. CT-P17 and reference adalimumab safety profiles were numerically similar and switching did not affect immunogenicity. At W52, 28.4% (continued CT-P17), 27.0% (continued reference adalimumab) and 28.3% (switched to CT-P17) of subjects were anti-drug antibody-positive.\r\nConclusion: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, safety

exact mechanism of lipid autoxidation in vegetable oils, taking into account physical aspects of this phenomenon, including the role of association colloids, is still not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to consider changes in moisture content and DOPC phospholipid (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) critical micelle concentration (CMC) in rapeseed oil during autoxidation as well as to find the relationship between these parameters and the accumulation of primary and secondary lipid oxidation products.\nRESULTS\n\nThe experiments were performed at initial oil humidity 220 ppm and 700 ppm, with DOPC below and above CMC. The increase in water concentration was favored by the presence of phospholipids above CMC and, at the same time, high initial water level, which favored oxidation processes and the creation of amphiphilic autoxidation products. At relatively high water level and low amphiphilic DOPC concentration, the growth of water content does not affect the concentration of oxidation products.\nCONCLUSION\n\nAmphiphilic substances play a significant role in increasing the water content of oil. Autoxidation products may reduce CMC of DOPC, but water is able to compensate for the CMC-reducing effect of oxidation products. The presence of association colloids and initial water content play a crucial role in the oxidation process of rapeseed oil. The increase in water concentration does not cause a sufficiently large increase in the number of micelles or sufficiently significant changes in their structure to effect an increase in the level of oxidation products. The formation of micelles requires an appropriate content of both water and amphiphilic substances derived from seeds (phospholipids). © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056351492","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jsfa.11376","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6432","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Siger","uuid":"C3270C674BDA7D2C35E148FFFDA42E9E585584A974412065CA42010E9D86710211245B46D7C6971FA9A0DF502D1F00ECB1ADA79418B229D8498598017DCE8C88","orcidId":"0000-0002-3681-153X","documentHash":"0e808053-045b-4d72-9071-800f369cbd44"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a63ff","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rudzińska","uuid":"EC3AA8ADC52060E880DC4D1888B125DA93BDC93A7731047801EEDFC6AD343DECA98E4E6F02BF901455DA020B995CABF26F4F556776A12BEF9C0A159F8641077A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6343-332X","documentHash":"7e0f304d-2b23-4acb-a2d3-eeb7c02bef26"},{"objectId":"5e709345878c28a0473a6261","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Dwiecki","uuid":"913D6F3824E63B79BBD9735EB4DA8553E5F58E2BBDAF4D138FA2132CCDD95C2E43F4DCE2D89239DBF4247ED11AE97DA797EF69F8C1D1DE082EDFB538328A10AE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1438-1217","documentHash":"1a2110d7-2298-4e3e-8454-6ba178cd689b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8d3","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bąkowska","uuid":"0BA1CE02B102CDCFC5AB6E6B74D3B9A866D13E31E8742EAC35544C18C8A4A22F7104D7436B879ED9BB00828B48F84178509FF0F2EBF560CD809E28B440549AC1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3604-4414","documentHash":"e7155022-0588-4364-8940-ef0c242e5c6b"}],"doi":"10.1002/jsfa.11376"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"9788394796730","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e266"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Międzynarodowa Konferencja Naukowa \"Postępy w leczeniu i opiece nad cielętami\".
