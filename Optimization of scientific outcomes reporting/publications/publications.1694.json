This study investigated whether melatonin, which is the most common medication for sleep disturbances in youth in Sweden, is associated with a decreased risk of injury.\r\n\r\nMethods: This population-based cohort study included 25,575 youths who initiated melatonin treatment between ages 6 and 18. Poisson regression was used to estimate rate of injuries in the year prior to and following melatonin treatment initiation. A within-individual design was used to estimate relative risks by comparing injury risk in the last unmedicated month with injury risks in the 12 months after medication initiation. Analyses were stratified by sex, injury type, psychiatric comorbidities and age at melatonin-treatment initiation.\r\n\r\nResults: While body injuries, falls and transport accident rates were comparable in the year before and after melatonin-treatment initiation, the risk of self-harm was highest in the months immediately prior to medication, and decreased thereafter. This was particularly prominent among adolescents with depression and/or anxiety, with females displaying greater absolute risks than males. Compared to the last unmedicated month, the 12 months post medication initiation had decreased relative risks for self-harm, with an IRR [95% CI] in the month following melatonin-treatment initiation of 0.46 [0.27-0.76] among adolescent females with psychiatric disorders, after excluding antidepressant users.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Decreased risk of intentional self-harm was observed following melatonin-treatment initiation among females with depression and anxiety, suggesting that sleep interventions could be considered in an effort to reduce risk of self-harm in this population."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005686","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"1027-1036","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13785","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"675165a1fdbe835717de6e42","name":"Sarah E.","lastName":"Bergen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0116224a-4cfc-426c-b05a-6d90cf75ad3f"},{"objectId":"675165a1fdbe835717de6e41","name":"Amy","lastName":"Leval","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08b02084-d342-4252-90b1-3cb293028216"},{"objectId":"675165a1fdbe835717de6e40","name":"Brian M.","lastName":"D’Onofrio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd5b32ad-2184-41ee-aaf4-278e4870c92c"},{"objectId":"675165a1fdbe835717de6e3f","name":"Henrik","lastName":"Larsson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a67a56c6-b02f-472d-919e-20bd1852e663"},{"objectId":"675165a1fdbe835717de6e3e","name":"Zheng","lastName":"Chang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6635ae94-6211-4e5d-99f1-17ea55027c11"},{"objectId":"675165a1fdbe835717de6e3d","name":"Johan","lastName":"Bjureberg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e85b1268-89c1-4e65-bfa4-03b95a199206"},{"objectId":"675165a1fdbe835717de6e3c","name":"Tyra","lastName":"Lagerberg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbed6deb-7214-47af-b9a9-afbe1d5cb655"},{"objectId":"675165a1fdbe835717de6e3b","name":"Ralf","lastName":"Kuja-Halkola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98ba6857-8cbe-4a03-a9ae-dfc967e7f09d"},{"objectId":"675165a1fdbe835717de6e3a","name":"Marica","lastName":"Leone","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e04a28c3-1378-449e-b37a-1229c48216c5"},{"objectId":"5e70933b878c28a0473a559e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Butwicka","uuid":"9C62F00F8421D708E6E4C75D771DEB81F037E60EB56D0868166058CCDC1F47BA85149A747DCAA803D5D6F94BF1C56E71845800AD94F9D3A1D8A3BB16E1B0C88A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb6dda4c-169b-473f-8b44-158e5f142986"}],"doi":"10.1111/jcpp.13785"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","parentUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","rootUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

By closely examining thermochromic materials, this article highlights their potential to offer innovative solutions for monitoring and preserving thermolabile products that require strict temperature control. This leads to a special emphasis on polydiacetylenes (PDAs), a class of conjugated polymers with unique low-temperature thermochromic properties, positioning them as promising candidates for reliable temperature indicators. This article then explores the underlying mechanisms for fine-tuning the thermochromic behavior of PDAs, particularly discussing recent advancements in PDA design, such as structural alterations of monomers to achieve low-temperature thermochromism. These modifications, influenced by factors like side-chain length, hydrogen-bonding interactions, and the use of copolymers, are intended to result in irreversible color transitions at specific low temperatures, which is crucial to maintaining the integrity of thermally sensitive products. Finally, this article discusses the potential applications of PDAs as thermochromic sensors in tissue biobanking, where their ability to provide visual indications of temperature fluctuations could significantly enhance the monitoring and management of biological

The study used 50 Hz RMF and various active \r\npharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) such as caffeine, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, and \r\nparacetamol. Various concentrations of active substance solutions in ethanol were used in the \r\nresearch, corresponding to those in commercial preparations. Each experiment was conducted \r\nfor 24 hours. It was shown that, regardless of the active compound used, an increase in drug \r\ntransport through the skin was observed with RMF exposure. Furthermore, the release profiles \r\ndepended on the active substance used. Exposure to a rotating magnetic field has been shown \r\nto effectively increase the permeability of an active substance through the skin."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005700","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67595b72fdbe8357175a5a43","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"185","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"eaa5f316-bc80-4586-a8df-a370adc07e09"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"183-189","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0939641123000590?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67595b72fdbe8357175a5a45","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kucharski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f648b748-6e81-4df3-a611-da79b948afe3"},{"objectId":"67595b72fdbe8357175a5a44","name":"Anna","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7275c473-eb06-41a7-8e9c-f00ccbd7124c"},{"objectId":"5e70945d878c28a0473bb6cf","name":"Paula","lastName":"Ossowicz-Rupniewska","uuid":"2A4A9DD3808539A83125AC09803D41BD5959AA482B3B223B42B5D66F53A2EA405800F7004BE49B95AB922FAF5674BA1447D46952E20A8964DD70E2AAEE55AF25","orcidId":"0000-0002-2362-1809","documentHash":"4ede81e5-c142-4847-b284-d4bec3004e4b"},{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b722a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Konopacki","uuid":"C91A1C4205051A1F90F2A5B7B506B833631C079CF6E6E8EBB016AFF794B40D929DDC7481693F9A19C4908CDA0F09259E00BFE8A4AE666F068846178711CD92CB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2240-7317","documentHash":"66812b35-936b-4297-8c8d-10f07717ff4e"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a569","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Rakoczy","uuid":"5EA72264E4558F4E10026249B572F679B161C02D8F2A970BF172315732323CB2F1AE5D1838D3D76705DA41005669E543E2BE6054A13EF03ABE211EBA89259780","orcidId":"0000-0002-5770-926X","documentHash":"b526c001-3f27-436b-9eb6-01b69bcceb31"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a503","name":"Marian","lastName":"Kordas","uuid":"4EF9885D25FEE8BF74D2FEF6F986B8050A185BC0D297A9D187E950B56BD7610A188072C19718C57E3CCCD260145DC6BDB5C8F4038811B3F26E00DF461BB2B8C4","orcidId":"0000-0001-9982-1658","documentHash":"7518fc84-093a-4b5e-a7d9-b75dbfb7f4db"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ejpb.2023.02.017"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Model epidemiologiczny","Infekcja","Modelowanie","Wirus","Szczepionka","Symulacja","Epidemia","Sieci społeczne"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de70","uid":"bUkdkGJsIreQW1gSKblRiGA","uuid":"e8c292f9-7b79-4d42-8480-d0c7f7a5787b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de70","parentUuid":"e8c292f9-7b79-4d42-8480-d0c7f7a5787b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de70","rootUuid":"e8c292f9-7b79-4d42-8480-d0c7f7a5787b","name":"Uniwersytet Kaliski im.

However, the problems of electric field homogeneity within a tumor can cause a diminishing of the treatment efficacy, resulting only in partial response to the procedure. This work used gold nano-particles for electric field amplification, introducing the capability to improve available elec-trochemotherapy methods and solve problems associated with field non-homogeneity. Methods: We characterized the potential use of gold nanoparticles of 13 nm diameter (AuNPs: 13 nm) in combination with microsecond (0.6-1.5 kV/cm × 100 μs × 8 (1 Hz)) and nanosecond (6 kV/cm × 300-700 ns × 100 (1, 10, 100 kHz and 1 MHz)) electric field pulses. Finally, we tested the most prominent protocols (microsecond and nanosecond) in the context of bleomycin-based electrochemotherapy (4T1 mammary cancer cell line). Results: In the nano-pulse range, the synergistic effects (improved permeabilization and electrotransfer) were profound, with increased pulse burst frequency. Addi-tionally, AuNPs not only reduced the permeabilization thresholds but also affected pore resealing. It was shown that a saturated cytotoxic response with AuNPs can be triggered at significantly lower electric fields and that the AuNPs themselves are non-toxic for the cells either separately or in combination with bleomycin. Conclusions: The used electric fields are considered sub-threshold and/or not applicable for electrochemotherapy, however, when combined with AuNPs results in successful ECT, indicating the methodology's prospective applicability as an anticancer treatment method."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005707","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"art.1278 [11

The authors highlight the natural landscape dynamics resulting from the topography, the aggression of the Baltic Sea against the beaches and sandy moraine hills, the dynamics of phyto-biological development in the endemic natural environment, and the dynamics of anthropogenic landscape changes resulting from the oversized spatial development of both residential and industrial buildings, as well as intermodal and port infrastructure development. The study analyzes natural values and their importance for both health and recreational purposes and shows the disproportional impact of economic/industrial development on the study area in recent times.

The aim of this study is to assess the occurrence of drought based on the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and SPI at multiple time scales (1-, 3-, and 6-, 9- and 12-month). NDVI values do not simply reflect meteorological drought. However, the spatial co-occurrence of meteorological drought with drought defined on the basis of the NDVI index was demonstrated.

A specially designed system was employed to increase the effectiveness of the machining process by imparting an additional rotary motion to the tool and an additional rotary motion to the workpiece. The aim was to efficiently remove the eroded metal particles and create a surface with smaller craters. The workpiece surface roughness was measured with a Talysurf CCI lite non-contact profiler. During this precision machining process, the arithmetical mean height (Sa) was less than 1 µm. The surface quality was examined also using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy (OM).

Ultimate and proximate analysis of mentioned samples revealed a higher content of carbon — 28.2 ± 8.0, 80.1 ± 2.3, and 50.3 ± 2.3, respectively — exhibiting sufficient potential to be converted into secondary carbon-based compounds. For this purpose, oxidative liquefaction of selected waste materials was carried out following a detailed experimental plan, a centred composite design for WTBs, and a central composite face-centred plan for MSW and PPEs. Temperature, pressure, oxidant concentration, reaction time, and waste-to-liquid ratio were the parameters of key interest, and their values were tested at a range of 200–350 °C, 20–40 bar, 15–60%, 30–90 min, and 3–25%, respectively, depending upon the type of waste. As a result, total polymer degradation (TPD) was recorded for three types of waste and the results were satisfactory, encouraging the decomposition of primary waste in liquid oxygenated chemical compounds (OCCs). Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionisation Detection (GC-FID) helped us quantify the number of OCCs for each waste sample. Energy consumption during the process was also recorded and optimisation of the experimental plan based on maximum TPD and OCCs yields against the minimum energy consumption was performed to make the process tech-economic.

Często ignorowali również dynamiczne zmiany, jakie zachodziły w obrębie samej terapii. Psychoterapia włączała krytyczne informacje o samej sobie i przekształcała w oparciu o nie zarówno teorię jak i praktykę.

These differences are rooted in the initial level of decentralization, municipal networking and the political and legal framework."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005746","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17535069.2024.2437416","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"675952fcfdbe83757db1241e","name":"Krisztián","lastName":"Kádár","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9e56ddc-43dc-4048-a058-6e8b61f3fb57"},{"objectId":"675952fcfdbe83757db1241d","name":"György","lastName":"Hajnal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fbe3e528-aab2-4b85-909f-8c722781d248"},{"objectId":"5e7094df878c28a0473c5bde","name":"Wirginia","lastName":"Aksztejn","uuid":"39A546CF723AB5196C42E74C82AB7A93FC7081E2CAB20548F1424E866AD691B98F289E75E9AE5F52527762764F100352E01619964C989474E2A0DE150F6476F2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2745-0151","documentHash":"9f3802d0-533d-4834-a52b-1b120a475622"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7ed3","name":"Marta","lastName":"Lackowska","uuid":"25C216C489D29DA606A6EDFCA1D0649DC2F4A0AE57221F7EAA7F8D6647D9F89DD3A3E07DAFCD616680469C2D5261371B26A6D981EF6DE565210DE6DD0793AFDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-7447-1150","documentHash":"b1e8b968-7fd7-442a-aba4-cfca53fd0ddb"}],"doi":"10.1080/17535069.2024.2437416"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["health outcomes","prolonged breastfeeding","immune properties","physiological nutrition","biochemical composition of breast milk","mother–breastmilk–infant triad"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

This study addresses the critical issue in the Tuchola Forest of Poland, examining the effects of\r\nnatural and human factors on forest fragmentation. Our objective was to identify the most suitable dataset for\r\nmonitoring forest fragmentation from 2015 to 2020, ascertain the primary drivers of fragmentation, and map the\r\nareas at high risk. Utilizing the PALSAR (25 m resolution) and Dynamic World (10 m resolution) datasets, we\r\ndiscovered PALSAR’s enhanced ability to detect changes in forest structure, particularly evident after a significant\r\nwindstorm in 2017. This dataset proved crucial in highlighting the escalating trend of forest fragmentation,\r\nreinforcing its importance for environmental monitoring and policy formulation. Our analysis identified key\r\nfactors influencing fragmentation, such as proximity to croplands, tree height and age, wind speed, and vegetation\r\nwater content, with areas near croplands and having younger, shorter trees being most susceptible.\r\nEmploying a Weight-of-Evidence (WOE) Bayesian modeling technique, we mapped forest fragmentation susceptibility,\r\ndemonstrating our methodology’s effectiveness through high accuracy validation (AUC of 0.82 and\r\nKappa Index of 0.68). Our innovative approach in mapping susceptibility to fragmentation, especially after\r\nextreme weather events, marks a pioneering contribution in Poland. This research advances the understanding of\r\nforest fragmentation dynamics and offers a scalable model for global application, emphasizing the urgent need\r\nfor targeted conservation strategies to preserve the integrity of forest ecosystems amidst climatic risk and\r\nanthropogenic pressures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005751","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"161","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X24004370?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"675958c4fdbe8357175603cb","name":"Amit","lastName":"Kumar Batar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1dff155c-319c-45f0-b707-196fe855266f"},{"objectId":"61bc04397523404d4a8f3624","name":"Sanjana","lastName":"Dutt","uuid":"1EE6434CF94980FF787BE2D6870223AC5CACDD8E0AD1CF17D2FECB45146D0BFE8B034E40A3CD509E082B751D518CB69EAC98CC80EE9268F89A9DD06C22C408C0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b10f342b-d0b6-4ad5-b25b-40c95a634314"},{"objectId":"5f77f719085dcb410a25e8c1","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Sulik","uuid":"5557161AD289F136A2FF1265C653D0CC45697B5B00183E7C9F996EBD4F00425F4EDA65A873CCD0527C092018090E4A5CA283D1B7B8CB90409A1503124B0460B5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"91a66d7a-5d26-4840-8adb-4ad0279c4266"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bd3a","name":"Mieczysław","lastName":"Kunz","uuid":"D4DCF0FCD4C74825534AF8D4968F676589D0A9071632990952F1E8027A496313CCBC06B883415AE5314811DEE4CC30B329AEAF680299A3F271464C9E5B293C93","orcidId":"0000-0002-3334-5238","documentHash":"3ba436c8-fe9d-4570-a738-e4c9e4f83075"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2024.111980"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["saliva","biomaterial","multiple sclerosis","blood"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Studies suggest that up to 49.7% of individuals with SDB also exhibit symptoms of SB. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the role of genetic background and neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of the co-occurrence of SB and SDB. It seeks to synthesize current knowledge, highlight gaps in the existing literature, and propose a new perspective that integrates genetic and neurobiological factors. This review shows that both SB and SDB may be influenced by a combination of genetic, neurochemical, and environmental factors that contribute to their shared pathophysiology. The key neurotransmitters-dopamine, serotonin, and GABA-may play a significant role in their co-occurrence by regulating motor activity, sleep architecture, and respiratory control. Understanding genetic and neurochemical mechanisms may allow for more precise diagnostic tools and more personalized treatment approaches regarding SB and SDB. Clinically, there is a need for interdisciplinary collaboration between sleep specialists, dentists, neurologists, and geneticists.

There is growing evidence that coronary microvascular dysfunction might be the underlying cause of both INOCA and HFpEF. Methods: In 65 patients with effort angina but no obstructive coronary artery disease, the index of microvascular resistance and coronary flow reserve were measured invasively in the LAD. The echocardiographic parameters, including left atrial strain, left ventricular strain, and indices of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, were compared between two groups of patients: those with normal coronary microcirculation parameters and those with impaired coronary microvascular function. Results: Patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction had higher a E/E′ index than those with normal microvessel reactivity. This finding was further confirmed by ROC analysis. The groups did not differ significantly in values of other echocardiographic parameters, including the left ventricular and left atrial strain. The prevalence of classical cardiovascular risk factors was similar in both groups. Conclusions: The coexistence of impaired coronary microvascular function with moderately elevated left ventricular filling pressures might correspond to the co-development of early stages of coronary microvascular dysfunction and HFpEF."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005760","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art.6841 [12 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/22/6841","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0df6","name":"Marta","lastName":"Obremska","uuid":"516DB71549F40F9A53943862377696294C203ED7EAEA56E81EB8DAA1960F8E0F5A756D13E97C590C7F160852F35F25B7BFA749A2994882598335C8473E60F01D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1937-1891","documentHash":"5fa9a026-7be1-4e74-aa74-dfbcd6779e08"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b65db","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sareło","uuid":"19E23CAEC83B7798F174FD6B7ED1DE5330EE8684739E7A7F86FD1692DF9FC6CA23D6018CFE0C3B7CF6CC19A0751C75FD0DD6B3660DF50CFB59C30F8B56FD2E20","orcidId":"0000-0002-9125-7594","documentHash":"518427da-429f-46c9-a5ca-db965176da22"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa8e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wawrzyńska","uuid":"990AE0B5FE544CBCD354B55347163FD50B4D79D79CFA03C9FCF3F45B9CAEB837E67D7673F0B5169EDB666B7BFD7C6B9690B98D8D709F864D9CF702D5F01C74DC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6855-5510","documentHash":"5fee8373-6a3f-4c71-aee4-aa41167accef"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af80e","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Arkowski","uuid":"253C45D5809BA7A3F3F470427B227CBA8016A237E2D5C57ABB4AC50E5E260C081C2013B00714726435ADDE6F675828286D145A5DE7338594BE5A2F518BA0C92A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2761-7580","documentHash":"9f683750-66ea-43ef-bcdc-df016b81bcee"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm13226841"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["milk production","dairy cattle","cathelicidin","CATHL2","reproductive traits","polymorphism"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a4c6","5e7092ab878c28a04739a435","60c33b559543c72336544191","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5a4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"CATHL2 polymorphism and milk production  and reproductive traits in dairy cattle","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703a","mniswId":"1152","title":"Animal Science Papers and Reports","doi":null,"issn":"0860-4037","eissn":"2300-8342","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fe90747c-1196-49b0-9210-8098e8db0aa8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67595c10fdbe8357175bddf3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5a4","5e7092ab878c28a04739a435","60c33b559543c72336544191","5e7092ab878c28a04739a4c6","67595c10fdbe8357175bddf4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cathelicidins are a group of host defense proteins that exhibit antibacterial, antiviral and\r\nimmunomodulating properties, while they also promote wound healing and participate in cell\r\nproliferation and angiogenesis.

They were characterised based on petrographic analyses of thin section and mutually complementary instrumental methods. The bricks came from the oldest parts of the castles preserved to this day, or from castles not preserved but examined and excavated during archaeological research. The data obtained allowed for the identification of building materials that shared similar material and technical properties and that can be associated with different phases of the castles. Based on the results, it was found that the Pleistocene tills commonly found around the castles were not used in the manufacturing of the bricks. Small local deposits of fatty clays were used – Pleistocene varved clays or Miocene variegated clays. The buildings differed in the composition and texture of their bricks, which indicates that the local clay raw material was extracted for each building separately. The share of raw material brought in from larger exposures further afield was small. Analyses of brick samples indicate the use of a fatty clay raw material that was improved by the addition of clastic material (quartz sand or a mixture of sand and quartz silt of various fractions)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005763","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"66","pagesFromTo":"282-305","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/arcm.12925","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"675958fafdbe83571756074c","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bartz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"00a44d52-9023-477b-80e8-fba1fb88f390"},{"objectId":"5e70941d878c28a0473b67fa","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Witkowska","uuid":"601DA15271221CD4500A83C410524C26091E90957852101277C0A5B714298A762F9AFE6292B7319AEC8D3796D0B523B96814EC4D6234C68499A2A39F28DA699C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1486098-b6fa-40d1-bdc0-5c3b5e6e1cff"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bf60","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Wiewióra","uuid":"19903514BAECA6F2C4C3BCB49CA91DC5A6E49F1FFB4C5A2F9A7D31C176D747E2E8CD8DE57CC59C5354179B14240505FFDC9E3AE6746786D00E2602304F50A520","orcidId":"0000-0003-4079-686X","documentHash":"5e81dbe9-025d-41da-a747-f49dd093febc"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739be16","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Jóźwiak","uuid":"C6661A7B0B044CC0DB170D857F94921BBE6452AC553F3B394B0AF797EE9436DC143C38F52D1447EE5A90651C9D44254D42B2D4FA09EE31AAE4F271B0D778D604","orcidId":"0000-0002-8228-4347","documentHash":"26fb46ff-2bda-4a22-ae08-2301a8f49777"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bd81","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Molewski","uuid":"65A4499AC33D8F9131D329BD2708D0C3924E7894C201DDAA4AE334E4CE55DA564F5F87C4F0EC484ED6D4B5CCBCE3575469FAFC256EF46EA6562576C0E223FECE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7375-815X","documentHash":"af79b690-1d04-4a9c-9d94-22e194f1bd26"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bd5f","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Łukaszewicz","uuid":"21431A1D7F3BDF375EF02E3894436B57064B14D0AF709E4A040DAFAB56FD4BCBA9805EA986FAF3DDE8FA96AC3CBFCEB7570DB18F33F41CCBCE97655BED60B2F2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a13ea532-5655-4ffa-96c6-9c24d93f805c"}],"doi":"10.1111/arcm.12925"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["neonatal nutritional status","perinatal outcomes","adipokines","gestational diabetes mellitus","fetal growth"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Given the potential for numerous short- and long-term complications for both mother and child, patients diagnosed with GDM require individualised treatment to compensate for metabolic abnormalities and ultimately reduce the risk of the known adverse consequences of impaired glucose tolerance. Methods and results: The manuscript presents a summary of the current knowledge on changes in maternal metabolism during physiological pregnancy and pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes. Furthermore, the article provides a synthesis of the findings from recent research examining the impacts of gestational diabetes and the therapeutic modalities employed on the nutritional status of the fetus and neonate. Additionally, the review elucidates the function of the placenta and placental hormones in fetal development, as well as the impact of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and adipokines on fetal and neonatal nutritional programming and predisposition to metabolic complications in adulthood. Conclusions: The metabolic environment, resulting from abnormal glucose tolerance during pregnancy, exerts a particularly significant impact on fetal growth and, consequently, on the birth weight and fat mass of the newborn infants. This is a pivotal factor influencing the nutritional and metabolic programming of the developing fetus, predisposing the individual to the development of metabolic complications throughout their lifetime."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005765","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"art.4093 [16 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/23/4093","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12d4","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Królak-Olejnik","uuid":"324D17983A2E0D906FFDB78FA7464E746116B1EAC426321B8C1BEB1D1F77615D1DC6E0EF6F171B74EBDC9C55683500AD3BB02696E355DD47038F081F08069705","orcidId":"0000-0002-6493-0333","documentHash":"48006c10-c5b7-4fb6-9d2f-d0cb266b8ba5"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a11da","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Karcz","uuid":"8C67EFC08DC93EBC87658D5A0523A910CD23F5245A667F1D2369E2665A2DF97CCBE49B86CA6238C3191E665571B4C652275F2DEA4B0070E1A6025A64F7AB0F0E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4271-2626","documentHash":"3eba64f8-6c4c-42a0-889e-89684ea83765"}],"doi":"10.3390/nu16234093"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["additive manufacturing","vibration eliminators","passive vibration damping"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709371878c28a0473a9c9a","5e7092ab878c28a04739a534","5e7093ad878c28a0473aeea8","67595956fdbe83571756b217","5e709325878c28a0473a3a43","5e709284878c28a047397235"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Towards Highly Efficient, Additively Manufactured Passive Vibration Eliminators for Mechanical Systems","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67595956fdbe83571756b216","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709325878c28a0473a3a43","5e709371878c28a0473a9c9a","5e7093ad878c28a0473aeea8","5e709284878c28a047397235","5e7092ab878c28a04739a534","67595956fdbe83571756b217"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Structural damping largely determines the dynamic properties of mechanical structures, especially those whose functioning is accompanied by time-varying loads. These loads may cause vibrations of a different nature, which adversely affects the functionality of the structure. Therefore, many studies have been carried out on vibration reduction methods over the last few years. Among them, the passive vibration damping method, wherein a suitable polymer system with appropriate viscoelastic properties is used, emerges as one of the simplest and most effective methods. In this view, a novel approach to conduct passive elimination of vibrations, consisting of covering elements of structures with low dynamic stiffness with polymeric pads, was developed. Herein, polymer covers were manufactured via fused filament fabrication technology (3D printing) and were joined to the structure by means of a press connection. Current work was focused on determining the damping properties of chosen polymeric materials, including thermoplastic elastomers (TPE). All investigated materials were characterized by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), and mechanical properties (tensile test and Shore hardness). Lastly, the damping ability of pads made from different types of polymers were evaluated by means of dynamic tests."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005767","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ca4f404097076d2607cb13","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"7b94c54e-de96-4ce3-84e2-c3e3525a616b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13, [nr art.] 1250","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/3/1250","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67595956fdbe83571756b217","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kramek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0144a5da-d9a3-4f34-b79b-fb3f3e7e7b7b"},{"objectId":"5e7093ad878c28a0473aeea8","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Dunaj","uuid":"D0210FC6C94E70BFE61D56981B7CD8D951CAF2B7611B39AAB460FBD020355B674A8BEAE81C56D24311221B4573F0D3F51B67468911A3856A1F50FF3ABCEA00C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6866-2586","documentHash":"b0ea5d24-2463-43ba-8159-e9252e2fe11a"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9c9a","name":"KAROL","lastName":"MIĄDLICKI","uuid":"311FC0D420F61E8107BED06BA2568C9F12E14AF545855713906EAF0F4F552D81BF3C0053C3E766B071A8435C421CBE4F7E1A502F16A0A4F080BA8CB230A797BE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6456-3724","documentHash":"97c1752c-891b-4d16-bfe8-a8a33c88add6"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3a43","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Irska","uuid":"793C8BC908C98BE8DF5CD21B9D4D773DE45CA40BE9AE59C89A94812C24EBF58BF55A67C7C33036D3F15E0FF0713DF7F2C9F315CEE01CC4B8B473A81E1CB008D1","orcidId":"0000-0002-5521-1847","documentHash":"b13edf6e-d41b-4be6-b791-b0f2d9b5e532"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a534","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Piesowicz","uuid":"5F1EE119AC4A66D8A7F593668F35D9B8E1D47C594449B038149CAFF7A6325F7E0EC97158FC1DBB2EBA4BE84079597FBF472BF733D5A3E76FD9B83DAB7CE0C24B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4371-5236","documentHash":"50930aa6-6ad3-4460-9286-99fd52c078a5"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397235","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Berczyński","uuid":"3634802785EE1D033B050C9587450FBCDC56D2E7F3FBFDBD21AD9D56FB8FAA813E859BFA5EA4FF5C96E3D5C381E2003D5B890F9EAB1EBD70E7D0DD359BA51F28","orcidId":"0000-0002-8403-6355","documentHash":"d93a4e74-114e-4cd5-a1c0-752fa8e880e9"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16031250"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["European Financial Market Supervision","European Banking Authority (EBA)","Consumer","Financial Service","European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs)"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709231878c28a0473916dc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Role of European Supervisory Authorities in Consumer Protection Standard Setting on the Financial Services Market : Based on the Example of the European Banking Authority","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a4f7","mniswId":"200433","title":"Studia Europejskie-Studies in European Affairs","doi":null,"issn":"1428-149X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"81dc40ad-4c0c-4b45-a8d7-c8bc16ec4a35"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-10-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67517daafdbe835717e3b6fc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709231878c28a0473916dc","67517daafdbe835717e3b6fd"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of the article is to present the genesis of the emergence and the scope of powers of the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) (the EBA, ESMA, and EIOPA), with particular reference to the EBA as regards the building of its supervisory normative standard and the protection of the consumer of fi nancial services. The authors will propose de lege ferenda postulates which, in their view, would allow for an improvement in the quality of the fi nancial services offered to consumers and ensure a higher level of protection of their interests and, at the same time, legal certainty for their providers. Increasingly sophisticated and complex fi nancial products cause interpretation diffi culties for both the courts and consumer protection authorities, but above all for consumers themselves, which consequently poses a challenge for both sides of the market (supply and demand). It is also a challenge for the post-crisis ESAs as the EU bodies not only designated to monitor and manage both the stability and security of the fi nancial market, along with the actual level of consumer protection within it. In the preparation of the article, the legal-dogmatic and legaltheoretical method, which is standard for such studies, was applied, which allows for an analysis of the provisions of EU law and the identifi cation of the norms stemming from them using interpretation and the assessment of the content of the provisions through the prism of the principle of consumer protection from Articles 12 and 169 TFEU and the EBAs’ competence provisions. Due to the fact that, in principle, the powers and competences of all three ESAs are analogous and only differ in terms of the scope of their application (i.e., fi nancial institutions operating in the relevant fi nancial market sectors – banking, insurance, and pension and investment), the authors will present their considerations with reference to the European Banking Authority (EBA), which is an exemplifi cation of the powers of the other supervisory authorities.

ECMO mortality scores had AUROC (0.58-0.62), AUPRC (0.62-0.74), and Brier score (0.286-0.303). Roch score had the highest accuracy (AUROC 0.62), precision (AUPRC 0.74) yet worst calibration (Brier score of 0.3) despite being calculated on the fewest patients (144). Severity of illness scores had AUROC (0.52-0.57), AURPC (0.59-0.64), and Brier Score (0.265-0.471). APACHE II had the highest accuracy (AUROC 0.58), precision (AUPRC 0.64), and best calibration (Brier score 0.26).\n\nConclusion: Within a large international multicenter COVID-19 cohort, the evaluated ECMO mortality prediction and severity of illness scores demonstrated inconsistent discrimination and calibration highlighting the need for better clinically applicable decision support tools.\n\nKeywords: ARDS; COVID-19; ECLS; Sars-Cov2; V-V ECMO; extracorporeal life support; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; mortality; prediction scores."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005774","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67519f28fdbe834f76857dc1","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"47","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"c002faa0-6ba2-4102-ad48-caade46d978b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"1490-1502","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/aor.14542","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67519f28fdbe834f76857dca","name":"Ahmed S.","lastName":"Said","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29777ac6-e816-458d-8aa8-c7e69788008f"},{"objectId":"67519f28fdbe834f76857dc9","name":"Chenyang","lastName":"Lu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba5c1a93-25cf-4f7f-92ec-fa5ee147b513"},{"objectId":"67519f28fdbe834f76857dc8","name":"Philip P.

paper presents the results of testing the performance of lightweight structural concrete containing hemp shives as an aggregate. It has been analysed how the higher binder content and use of the Portland cement affect the thermal and microbiological properties of the lightweight concrete. The aggregates of the plant origin and cement are incompatible because the plant chemical compounds, dissolved in water or an alkaline environment, inhibit cement hydration. To avoid this, mineralisation of the aggregates of plant origin is necessary. The most often used binder in hemp concrete is hydrated lime, a mineraliser. An addition of hydrated lime and sodium trisilicate was used for hemp shiv mineralisation in the tested materials with a cement binder. Concrete containing hemp shiv and cement binder, of which volume share in the concrete was at most 15%, was prepared as a reference concrete. In the remaining three concretes, the total content of the binder in relation to hemp shiv (by mass) was increased 2.5 times. It was shown that lime-binder hemp concrete offers a promising antimicrobial strategy, as it can inhibit bacterial and fungal growth on their surface with superior efficacy. The best results were obtained for tested concretes with the cement–lime binder regarding compressive strength; the average compressive strength was 9.56 MPa."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005786","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ae81404097077279b16394","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"14","doi":null,"documentHash":"2122fb27-7a7d-4f96-8f84-3cd4a20d6f53"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12, [nr art.] 8447","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/14/8447","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c32b559543c72336543f86","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Paszkiewicz","uuid":"E014FD5595DB4189383030B3CAC2BDF13139A04BB1AA2F9FC140FDE1C9EB6CA7615044DD19EC6FFA710A107B1FCE6902F3142E0EDCA9A6D3DC300938C11E4796","orcidId":"0000-0002-0237-9435","documentHash":"64bb344c-9b97-4ec7-b63d-a02d857ae223"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b63c1","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Strzałkowski","uuid":"549B448F59713F40D9CBE3AD9E16C9FF1C2A1A394E25EF5C515E2ACCF60EA2DBBE56061991FF67D19E33161156688CA66B9601FE28753CA97A5E7967EB568085","orcidId":"0000-0001-7001-9303","documentHash":"d351112b-2d79-4de7-ba6f-2fccb97148b6"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0f6f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Głowacka","uuid":"50CBCD05071CAAFC35C99FF5C6691757AEEE7AB85CF3EB50B645C79BA3349764757399E3BBC0225B679DEE5D6AEA9E3742CF8B71CE8EEC9530A56702738C3C19","orcidId":"0000-0002-4733-5970","documentHash":"a9930aef-8fdf-46c7-bf39-77afd27886a8"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a4b8","name":"Agata","lastName":"Markowska-Szczupak","uuid":"8165E361EBE57943E95FE880B7351FC06DA3E14707691CB6546047F0262C940A58CEA36A6CA189A53118BF351F9CD99CF0C49E8915D686BAF737D1D20115ED0C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3034-0263","documentHash":"b5e34176-f122-4a91-9545-567cdc145670"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a460","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Horszczaruk","uuid":"6CB652D6C34517E3CDA9058CD7A9957CCBF76A51A782D03AFC5B475F9F50F9D70DC648ADC8CA06FAE3E19E06F4D9667B0FC85A9A10055E36A23438477E730CF9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0840-5048","documentHash":"d01a8c40-2978-45a7-904a-6a552a2c24b3"}],"doi":"10.3390/app13148447"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electromobility","electric vehicle","transport","sustainability"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d5878c28a04739dace","5e7092ab878c28a04739a4c3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of knowledge of young users and their views on e-mobility","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a617","mniswId":"19733","title":"Transport Problems","doi":null,"issn":"1896-0596","eissn":"2300-861X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"33d4ea2e-eb2b-463f-bb58-988c281d3441"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"675765c0fdbe83571745a934","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67595fcafdbe8357176279a9","5e7092d5878c28a04739dace","5e7092ab878c28a04739a4c3","67595fcafdbe8357176279aa"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The European Union is set to become the world’s first climate-neutral\r\ncontinent in 2050. Achieving such an ambitious goal requires cross-cutting measures in all\r\nkey sectors of the economy, including transport, which is one of the main sources of\r\nemissions in Member States, including Poland. Electromobility is a key instrument for\r\nreducing the negative impact of transport on climate and the environment. The current\r\nautomotive market in Poland, for the most part, is made up of old combustion engine cars.\r\nThe average age of a passenger car in Poland in 2021 was 14.5 years, 0.2 years more than\r\nin 2020. An important point to note is that in 2021, nearly twice as many used cars were\r\nimported into Poland as new cars were sold, and this was 11.3% higher than the figure\r\nrecorded in 2020. At the same time, 48% of the cars were equipped with diesel engines.\r\nThus, it is reasonable to identify the current state of knowledge of e-mobility and its\r\nassessment by young consumers (18- to 25-year-olds). How they perceive such vehicles is\r\nof great importance. Young buyers are a special group in the automotive market - their\r\npurchasing preferences will determine the nature of the car market in the future, including\r\nwhether it will be zero-emission. Learning about the opinions of young consumers is\r\nimportant. On the one hand, it allows knowledge to be gained about the beliefs, feelings,\r\nand level of interest in this type of car and the actions young people want to take regarding\r\npurchase and use. On the other hand, knowledge of their attitudes towards electric cars can\r\nbe the basis for creating more relevant information messages.

Therefore, in this contribution, we explore the efficiency to exfoliate bulk boron into a few-layered borophene induced by mechanical energy in the planetary ball mill. It was revealed that the resulting flakes thickness and distribution can be controlled by (i) rotation speed (250–650 rpm), (ii) time of ball-milling (1–12 hours), and mass loading of bulk boron (1–3 g). Furthermore, the optimal conditions for the ball-milling process to induce efficient mechanical exfoliation of boron were determined to be 450 rpm, 6 hours, and 1 g (450 rpm_6 h_1 g), which resulted in the fabrication of regular and thin few-layered borophene flakes (∼5.5 nm). What is more, the mechanical energy induced during ball-milling, and the heat generated inside, affected the structure of borophene resulting in different crystalline phases. Besides being an additional and interesting discovery, it will also open up opportunities to investigate the relevance between the properties and the emerging phase. Structures labeled as β-rhombohedral, γ-orthorhombic, τ-B and the conditions under which they appear, have been described. Therefore, in our study, we open a new door to obtain a bulk quantity of few-layered borophene for further fundamental studies and practical potential assessment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005790","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67595ca6fdbe8357175cd631","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"25","doi":null,"documentHash":"4a0caae4-83f9-4f2f-93ac-147b5bf5d41e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"16907-16914","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1039/D3RA02400H","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63a3cf397523402197993c18","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Zielinkiewicz","uuid":"7E31DF94DBFA470D72797B4477805F06157C71E0C3C2F3615DA8CB0D1CCDCDC5688B1BAB5EC239B26FD0568D0639402C9005AD4F3A1418D0A336D6A8CEB96155","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b2a99d8-7851-49de-8a81-0b084799a300"},{"objectId":"60c346bb9543c72336544358","name":"Daria","lastName":"Baranowska","uuid":"B6C5F566D7DC5CB88B98041F5EDCAC6BD8C013F184F87120B2CCD21126225922F840E4AD581A023F6B1CDB5B2439119528DD978C404A91FD0175CDB101509558","orcidId":"0000-0003-1969-8552","documentHash":"fd55ca33-e3d9-492d-b24e-78c1f1649cce"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a4e0","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Mijowska","uuid":"771C8E0E5A51A6715ED8D8C655598A655EC2F7AF6F6F75FBB1520FC654A290AED97CFA212E6F47488CE789C279DD292CD44DB8C460E8DBAB4F6A1BDD65AF5988","orcidId":"0000-0003-2023-8756","documentHash":"650ab05d-4218-42f2-b5ce-f64f9f2f5bb3"}],"doi":"10.1039/d3ra02400h"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The data collected during the survey were used to compare perceptions of different specialty physicians’ perspectives on various aspects regarding palliative care.\n\nResults The results of the study showed significant differences in the assessment of the palliative care services availability (73% of primary care physicians rate it poorly comparing to high rating of 60% by palliative care specialists), as well as disparities between the declarations regarding the criteria used to decide on referral to palliative care (achieving the best quality of life) and the actual referral of patients (primary care physicians are third on the list of specialists referring patients to palliative care). Despite the need for adequate cooperation between family physicians and palliative care physicians, some difficulties were identified, such as primary care physicians’ lack of knowledge of the patient palliative care referral criteria, and financial as well as personnel and palliative care facilities’ limitations, were identified.\n\nConclusions The study confirms the need for better cooperation between primary care physicians and palliative care specialists in Poland.

The benefits of vaccination for asthma control in children and the elicited immune response are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the impact of these vaccinations on respiratory infections, asthma symptoms, asthma severity and control status, pathogen colonization and in vitro immune responses to different stimulants mimicking infections in asthmatic children.\r\n\r\nMethods: Children aged 4-6 years were recruited into the multicentre prospective PreDicta study conducted across five European countries. Information about vaccination history, infections, antibiotic use, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use and asthma symptoms in the last 12 months were obtained from questionnaires of the study. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected at the first visit to assess bacterial and viral colonization, and venous blood for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The PBMCs were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin, R848, Poly I:C and zymosan. The levels of 22 cytokines and chemokines were measured in cell culture supernatants using a luminometric multiplex assay.\r\n\r\nResults: One-hundred and forty asthmatic preschool children (5.3 ± 0.7 years) and 53 healthy children (5.0 ± 0.8 years) from the PreDicta cohort were included in the current study. Asthmatic children were associated with more frequent upper and lower respiratory infections, and more frequent and longer duration of antibiotic use compared with healthy children. In asthmatic children, sufficient H. influenzae vaccination was associated with a shorter duration of upper respiratory infection (URI) and overall use and average dose of ICS. The airway colonization was characterized by less pneumococcus and more rhinovirus. Pneumococcal vaccination was associated with a reduction in the use rate and average dose of ICS, improved asthma control, and less human enterovirus and more H. influenzae and rhinovirus (RV) airway colonization. Influenza vaccination in the last 12 months was associated with a longer duration of URI, but with a decrease in the occurrence of lower respiratory infection (LRI) and the duration of gastrointestinal (GI) infection and antibiotic use. Asthmatic preschoolers vaccinated with H. influenzae, pneumococcus or influenza presented higher levels of Th1-, Th2-, Th17- and regulatory T cells (Treg)-related cytokines in unstimulated PBMCs. Under stimulation, PBMCs from asthmatic preschoolers with pneumococcal vaccination displayed a predominant anti-inflammatory immune response, whereas PBMCs from asthmatic children with sufficient H. influenzae or influenza vaccination were associated with both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune responses.\r\n\r\nConclusion: In asthmatic preschoolers, the standard childhood vaccinations to common respiratory pathogens have beneficial effects on asthma control and may modulate immune responses relevant to asthma pathogenesis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005799","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"78","pagesFromTo":"1473-1488","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.15551","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"675162f3fdbe835717ddb332","name":"Cezmi

Structure, morphology, and composition of the films are studied by IR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. They are close to the structure of bulk PTFE. The roughness of the films’ surface is changed with gas pressure and LTP power variations. Films are transparent from UV to near-infrared regions. Refractive and extinction indices and their anisotropy are measured by spectral ellipsometry. They are tuned by variations of deposition conditions. Hardness and Young modulus of the films are increased if EVD + low power LTP is used for film deposition. Use of EVD + LTP also increases thermal stability of the films. Contact angle of the films corresponds to the bulk PTFE.

hybrid entanglement can be created between two qubits, one encoded in a single photon and another one in coherent states with opposite phases. It opens the path to a variety of quantum technologies, such as heterogeneous quantum networks, merging continuous- and discrete-variable encoding, and enabling the transport and interconversion of information. However, reliable characterization of the non-local nature of this quantum state is limited so far to full quantum state tomography. Here, we perform a thorough study of Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt Bell inequality tests, enabling practical verification of quantum nonlocality for optical hybrid entanglement. We show that a practical violation of this inequality is possible with simple photon number on/off measurements if detection efficiencies stay above 82%. Another approach, based on photon-number parity measurements, requires 94% efficiency but works well in the limit of higher photon populations.

An electrically conductive filler such as carbon-based materials like graphene or carbon nanotubes when added in sufficient quantities to a polymer material can form a conductive composite. When the content of the conductive filler increases, the nanoparticles start to contact each other and form a continuous path that makes the free electrons travel easily and conduct electricity. These conductive composite materials are lightweight, exhibit resistance to corrosion, and can be easily adapted to meet the needs of a specific application. Therefore, these conductive composites may replace the metals in some applications. The applications of conductive composites include, for instance, electromagnetic interference shielding materials, coatings, sensors, batteries, and electrodes. In turn, the platelets/lamellar fillers, such as clays, or also graphene derivatives forms, are known for their influence on the creation of the so-called tortuous paths for gas molecules and thus improvement of barrier properties. This improvement seems to be due to an increased tortuosity of the diffusive path for permeants, forcing them to travel a longer path to diffuse through the film. The increase in path length is a function of the aspect ratio of the lamellar nanofiller and its volume fraction in the nanocomposite. These lamellar nanoreinforcements, whose main role is to improve barrier properties of polymers, are mainly responsible for the applications related to food packaging. This chapter focuses on the poly(trimethylene terephthalate)-based nanocomposites containing carbon-based materials such as graphene, or carbon nanotubes, applied as a conductive nanofiller, or lamellar nanofillers, such as clay, graphene, etc., applied as gas barrier improving agent. In addition, the chapter provides a comprehensive review of electrical and barrier properties of PTT-based blends and copolymers, as well as bio-based eco-alternatives, i.e., polyesters based on renewable raw materials (furanedicarboxylic acid), containing different types of nanofillers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005812","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"149–166","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-19-7303-1_8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942e878c28a0473b7bab","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Paszkiewicz","uuid":"38008239DEE8436CB07BE8AC0E6B973900FE5E332B4C70C9C0F031548D50303C02E023161410BBC58414C3CAA13E9261F96ABEB00AE0322A58816F2271BDBA14","orcidId":"0000-0001-7487-9220","documentHash":"45608b15-071f-4ba0-a47f-73218bcc3478"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-7303-1_8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bioorganic research","untargeted metabolomics","honey metabolites","origin traceability","targeted metabolomics","chromatography-based metabolomics","data elaboration","suspect metabolomics","sample preparation"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

These approaches give an insight into the metabolic diversity of different honey varieties and reveal different classes of organic compounds in the metabolic profiles, among which, key metabolites such as biomarkers and bioactive compounds can be highlighted. Chromatography-based metabolomics strategies have significantly impacted different aspects of bioorganic research, including primary areas such as botanical origins, honey origin traceability, entomological origins, and honey maturity. Through the use of different tools for complex data analysis, these strategies contribute to the detection, assessment, and/or correlation of different honey parameters and attributes. Bioorganic research is mainly focused on phytochemicals and their transformation, but the chemical changes that can occur during the different stages of honey formation remain a challenge. Furthermore, the latest user- and environmentally friendly sample preparation methods and technologies as well as future perspectives and the role of chromatography-based metabolomic strategies in honey characterization are discussed. The objective of this review is to summarize the latest metabolomics strategies contributing to bioorganic research onf honey, with emphasis on the (i) metabolite analysis by gas and liquid chromatography techniques; (ii) key metabolites in the obtained metabolic profiles; (iii) formation and accumulation of biogenic volatile and non-volatile markers; (iv) sample preparation procedures; (v) data analysis, including software and databases; and (vi) conclusions and future perspectives. For the present review, the literature search strategy was based on the PRISMA guidelines and focused on studies published between 2019 and 2024. This review outlines the importance of metabolomics strategies for potential innovations in characterizing honey and unlocking its full bioorganic potential."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005815","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"art.606 [27 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/14/11/606","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6751bee5fdbe835717e8cf9d","name":"Carlo Ignazio Giovanni","lastName":"Tuberoso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e70f6315-65a9-4714-96a9-13950155fe9a"},{"objectId":"6751bee5fdbe835717e8cf9c","name":"Renata","lastName":"Odžak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25bff9b3-5824-47eb-9b10-79a68c051d4d"},{"objectId":"6751bee5fdbe835717e8cf9b","name":"Saša","lastName":"Prđun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f444fb39-29b8-4d73-8eca-0f309cb07cb8"},{"objectId":"6751bee5fdbe835717e8cf9a","name":"Marina","lastName":"Kranjac","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f1d9bd0-863e-4340-955b-0e5031d52e1a"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9ecb","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kuś","uuid":"6EA069D286AD04D3034EF4C71B8919E9DE33A4715D806DBD846D018FEA48DC26EDA416D1255D45433A6E9BCAB129662B6C9697C1CC8A3784E29B9BA4F813BD8D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7368-1076","documentHash":"1a8b3009-c6fa-418c-bf25-a421c2fb0a3a"}],"doi":"10.3390/metabo14110606"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Prokreacja","Zachowania prokreacyjne","Mechanizmy adaptacyjne"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de70","uid":"bUkdkGJsIreQW1gSKblRiGA","uuid":"e8c292f9-7b79-4d42-8480-d0c7f7a5787b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de70","parentUuid":"e8c292f9-7b79-4d42-8480-d0c7f7a5787b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de70","rootUuid":"e8c292f9-7b79-4d42-8480-d0c7f7a5787b","name":"Uniwersytet Kaliski im.

phase estimation in the presence of unknown phase diffusive noise is a crucial yet challenging task in noisy quantum metrology. This problem is particularly interesting due to the detrimental impact of the associated noise. Here, we investigate the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion using generalized Holland–Burnett states, known for their experimental accessibility. These states provide performance close to the optimal state in single-parameter phase estimation, even in the presence of photon losses. We adopt a twofold approach by analyzing the joint information extraction through the double homodyne measurement and the joint information availability across all probe states. Through our analysis, we find that the highest sensitivities are obtained by using states created by directing all input photons into one port of a balanced beam splitter. Furthermore, we infer that good levels of sensitivity persist even in the presence of moderate photon losses, illustrating the remarkable resilience of our probe states under lossy conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005819","journalIssue":{"objectId":"668fc4bcfdbe83640c264572","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"26","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"efb17126-b2eb-4ce5-8f81-71a74b06aad9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"073016: 1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ad5eb0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"675196d0fdbe834f7684b8cd","name":"Marco","lastName":"Barbieri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b6aefb3-b114-4479-8c73-76765719633f"},{"objectId":"603f45319543c711bc6ea2c0","name":"Jayanth","lastName":"Jayakumar","uuid":"BB865E5C217F0A9172C11CEDB46CC12CDA7734BDD83B433811A79003D29DD4354FFE7E8A72C9D15C5C31984716BEE90A69CA9101EEFCFDCA405411F367D5F013","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbe3b7f3-9309-4e70-b387-ab7f9576f3ad"},{"objectId":"602fa5bf9543c7410626f6f3","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mycroft","uuid":"98F5CA3BF94721E402C7847EE027AEDEC40EEDEC11E58D16CBA71AB9843259D177629FFB5257CB2A6298760CC82457993852331BF1185B6B6204D4FA11439879","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5c03dac-ba2c-4658-9662-0df75bac9d45"},{"objectId":"5e7093ba878c28a0473afdfb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Stobińska","uuid":"C1A3533439B80D50623DE158E27CF70937D1971E413643D0CCA80ED191627D9FB6CDC5602E3AD74F563A07543C67B6650EB691982A2740A0EB4FA35F87E89D1B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5168-433X","documentHash":"ba10498b-b3b7-4e4f-99ee-83c0be3556b1"}],"doi":"10.1088/1367-2630/ad5eb0"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["model biznesu","Przemysł 4.0","rewolucja przemysłowa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["industrial revolution","Industry 4.0","business model"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-67153-58-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709280878c28a047396ca0"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Architektura społeczna modelu biznesu czwartej rewolucji przemysłowej - konceptualizacja, modelowanie i wizualizacja konstruktu","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":302,"publicationPlace":"Toruń","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67595aeefdbe83571759213c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709280878c28a047396ca0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060005820","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8d0","mniswId":"55800","name":"Towarzystwo Naukowe Organizacji i Kierownictwa.

However, energy companies directly implement the government’s energy policies and innovation strategies. Thus, this article attempts to answer the question concerning the relationships in three large energy companies operating in Poland (1) between the use of renewable resources for production and the innovative nature of a company, (2) between the use of renewable energy sources and the standing on the stock exchange and profitability. This study used multiple case studies, financial analysis indicators, a time series analysis, and an interdependence analysis. This study covers 2011–2022 and allows consideration of long-term changes in domestic energy policy. Our findings suggest that there is a relationship between a company’s investment activity and the use of renewable energy sources. Unfortunately, the scope of the use of RESs in these companies is small (from ca. 1% to 15%, which demonstrates the low progress of green transformation) and has negative correlations with the investors’ assessment and profitability. In relation to innovation, the ratio of intangible assets to total assets was the highest for Tauron SA, increasing from 1.96% to 5.16%. Its material commitment to innovation is distinguishable from the other two companies. This is also the company with the highest share of RESs in energy production. The second place belongs to Enea SA with its ratio of intangible assets to total assets that increased from 0.72% to 1.69%. The ratio was lowest for PGE SA, increasing from 0.37% to 1.47%. The results and standing of the analyzed energy companies are strongly affected by energy policy amendments, including the improved status of coal and the re-oriented use of RESs (prioritizing solar energy over wind). As a result, these companies, despite the twelve-year period of the implementation of green transformation in the European Union, have achieved little on the path to sustainable energy. Therefore, achieving the goal of a zero-emission economy seems unlikely, since the renewable energy mix is still very slight and not diversified. Changes in energy policy are also not conducive to sectoral and economic innovation.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005861","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67595af8fdbe835717593ca0","name":"Sara","lastName":"Rupacz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"456c037e-5368-4c24-9298-5e98bcb278af"},{"objectId":"5e70920f878c28a04738f55b","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Jonek-Kowalska","uuid":"EAF81FC571DDEC10C4AFDBFA6B0E6C0B7187ABFE356956ADC289BFEAD18A7782F156A64EAC47372CD6C65E14E913D93EF824F63081D8738150F220A1A054125B","orcidId":"0000-0002-4006-4362","documentHash":"bcd56062-8c80-4fa4-bee9-11b788d669ca"}],"doi":"10.3390/resources12120147"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"650aa76d4097070d18bc6865","doi":null,"title":"Postępy w alergologii.","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-66946-55-2","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/search?query=isbn,exact,9788366946552&tab=LibraryCatalog&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&offset=0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"e284e0b0-d2e3-42a3-857a-0a55e6969346","publisher":{"objectId":"5d42ecc9878c286b5030d56d","mniswId":"41400","name":"Medical Tribune Polska","documentHash":"0799e0c3-2824-4c5a-a651-b85b7b476b8f"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Uszkodzenie bariery nabłonkowej a architektura zapalenia T2-zależnego - nowy paradygmat rozwoju alergii?","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"675162edfdbe835717ddb315","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e966"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"of external factors.

The statistical analysis of data made it possible to establish the propagation of the different types of damages. It was demonstrated that the defects that demand the replacement of individual sleepers on the railway track with new sleepers are mainly sleeper cracks and fractures including concrete crushing. The railway sleepers removed from the railway track have been investigated to discover the reasons for the crack formation. The sleepers were subjected to microscopic and electron-microscopic analysis including electron – probe microanalysis and molecular spectroscopic investigations and the obtained results showed that the crack network in the sleepers is spatial or 3D and it has the most branched pattern in its upper planes. The internal crack surfaces show signs of concrete corrosion caused by the interaction of cement alkali with chemically reactive fillers. The crack surfaces in the lower part of the sleepers show the presence of dealkalization products that is obviously the result of electromigration. It can be indicative of the contribution of leakage currents to the corrosion processes on the DC-electrified railway tracks. Hence, the primary reason for the defects in question, which resulted in the replacement of the sleepers, was the concrete corrosion caused by the interaction of the cement alkali with chemically reactive fillers facilitated by leakage currents."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005865","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"640f28a0409707703509f725","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2021-09-10","endDate":"2021-09-13","fullName":"BulTrans

landforms originated from jökulhlaups or glacial lake-outburst floods (GLOFs), and their small-scale components help in recognising the sedimentary environment of the flood. The GLOF fans that developed along the Pleistocene ice-sheet margin have not been investigated in detail, and north-eastern Poland, with its Megaflood Landform System and Bachanowo and Szeszupka fans, seems ideal for landform and sedimentary studies. This paper provides (1) an important opportunity to recognise the origins of glacier lake-outburst flood outlets and their evolution during two GLOFs and (2) a model of the origin of ice-marginal fans considering changes in sedimentary environment reflecting flood stages. During the first GLOF (GLOF1), the rising stage of meltwater burst triggered the formation of a supraglacial outlet and the development of the Szeszupka outburst fan. During the pulsed peak discharge, subglacial multi-channelised meltwater outburst caused the formation of the Bachanowo Gate, which was finally transformed at the flood waning stage. Such processes were associated with the widening of the floodwater subglacial routeway, when floodwater outlets rapidly spread across the glacier snout. In contrast, GLOF2 was responsible only for the Szeszupka fan erosion and development of outburst terraces. The small-scale bedforms continuum, recognised on the outburst fan surface, is associated with the development of streamlined erosional residuals, scours and their trains during the rising stage and peak discharge, while the waning stage and very end of flood conditions were favourable to the formation of pendant bars, distributive channels with erosional bars and chute bars, regardless of the feeding systems of the outburst fans. The fan deposits were OSL-dated and revealed either, likely, overly old ages or an age of 13.2 ± 0.9 ka.

Nowelizacja stanowi wyraz daleko idącej ingerencji ustawodawcy w obowiązujący stan prawny dotyczący wykroczeń przeciwko bezpieczeństwu i porządkowi w komunikacji. Przewiduje bowiem dość istotne modyfikacje w zakresie prawnokarnej reakcji na nie, przeo-brażenia kształtu znamion wybranych typów czynów zabronionych, i proponuje zupełnie nowe typy czynów zabronionych. Z przeprowadzonej analizy wynika, że myślą przewodniątych zmian jest przede wszystkim zwiększenie stopnia punitywności prawa wykroczeń wzglę-dem sprawców naruszeń drogowych. Taki sposób legislacji rodzi naturalną obawę instrumen-talnego stosowania prawa wykroczeń w odniesieniu do sprawców tego rodzaju wykroczeń. Przyjęty kierunek zmian rodzi podejrzenie, że ustawodawca niedokładnie zaznajomił sięz materią objętą jego ingerencją – w każdym razie, nie znajduje umocowania w bieżącym stanie przestępczości komunikacyjnej czy w analizie praktyki orzeczniczej. Wzmożenie repre-syjności nigdy nie przekładało się wprost na ograniczenie przestępczości komunikacyjnej.

The amendment represents a far-reaching intervention by the legislator in the current legal status regarding offences against safety and order in transportation. It foresees quite significant modi-fications in terms of the legal-criminal response to them, transformations of the characteristics of selected types of prohibited acts, as well as propose entirely new types of prohibited acts. From the conducted analysis, it appears that the guiding thought behind the above changes is primarily to increase the degree of punitiveness of the petty offences law towards the per-petrators of traffic violations. Such a legislative approach naturally raises concerns about the instrumental use of the petty offences law with respect to the perpetrators of these kinds of offences. The adopted direction of changes raises suspicions that the legislator has not thoro-ughly familiarized themselves with the matter covered by their intervention. In any case, it does not find grounding in the current state of traffic criminality, or in the analysis of judicial practice. An increase in repressiveness has never directly translated into a reduction in traffic criminality. The latter is indeed a much more complex problem, involving the necessity of multi-faceted

paper is devoted to the development of hydrogen-containing, environmentally safe, fire-resistant, and corrosion-protected lubricant cooling liquids (LCLs) from vegetable oils with improved sanitary and hygienic parameters for the machining of parts and equipment made from high-strength steels for application during the interoperation period in turbine halls. The use of plant raw materials as ecologically and fire-safe LCLs increased the efficiency of LCLs when evaluating drilling steel in terms of the dependence of the stability of the cutting tool on the drilling speed. Chips formed from LCLs during turning had a compact, cylindrical appearance, and the addition of both water and coolant during turning significantly changed the morphology of the cutting particles. Using water and LCL intensified the physical and chemical destruction processes. After the use of water and LCL, the concentration of hydrogen in the cutting products of 38KHN3MFA steel increased, which indicated its participation in facilitating the destruction during machining. In the chips formed when using LCL, the amount of hydrogen increased by 2.25 times compared to the chips obtained with the dry treatment, while with coolants, it increased by 2.6 times, indicating the intense flow of decomposition products of LCL through diffusion processes in the cutting zone. Hydrogen reduces the energy costs for the destruction of structural and phase components and promotes their dispersion. The creation of 2D and 3D images allowed for a more detailed approach to the study of the influence of LCL on surface treatments."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005878","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ad8cdc4097070d11c0108e","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"a2b37c2d-e4d8-455a-8236-2591507c2669"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-25, [nr art.] 535","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/1/535","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67595c75fdbe8357175c7f39","name":"Valentina O.","lastName":"Balitska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e57d6a5c-3e8f-4cfa-9a8f-a4b937864776"},{"objectId":"67595c75fdbe8357175c7f38","name":"Valeriі O.","lastName":"Kolesnikov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a37105d1-705d-4008-a2b8-42075101c8ce"},{"objectId":"67595c75fdbe8357175c7f37","name":"Maria R.","lastName":"Havrilyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e3e149d9-5bc9-46a5-a1b1-50052326f9b5"},{"objectId":"67595c75fdbe8357175c7f36","name":"Ljubomyr M.","lastName":"Ivaskevych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3831ac1b-b49a-4005-8d30-650c2d59058c"},{"objectId":"5e709303878c28a0473a10db","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Balitskii","uuid":"12778F06D7D7BAECBCD03D7FA3EE40A8754FBB46626C22D3343BC7D27D6DD9D1986243B1584057CB7BB6FF29682BCE783213E888EF8FA6CB39DA0F0F22C84FB0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3841-5493","documentHash":"f7d64270-6a7a-4030-91f6-2fae9047f6ef"}],"doi":"10.3390/en16010535"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Guideline‐directed medical therapy","Diuretics","Congestion","Decongestion"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Therefore, finding effective and sustainable ways to alleviate congestion has become a crucial goal for treating HF patients. Congestion is a result of complex underlying pathophysiology; therefore, it is not a direct cause of the disease but its consequence. Any therapy that directly promotes sodium/water removal only, thus targeting only clinical symptoms, neither modifies the natural course of the disease nor improves prognosis. This review aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the current decongestive therapies and propose a new (not diuretic-centred) paradigm of long-term congestion management in HF that attempts to correct the underlying pathophysiology, thus improving congestion, preventing its development, and favourably altering the natural course of the disease rather than merely treating its symptoms."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005880","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"2094-2106","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejhf.3423","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6751be86fdbe835717e8cae7","name":"Marco","lastName":"Metra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23f50fbe-0897-439f-90ed-1fa1e2c852b7"},{"objectId":"6751be86fdbe835717e8cae6","name":"Gad","lastName":"Cotter","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1058cd45-75c0-4e2c-878e-e557af32a37d"},{"objectId":"5e7094ac878c28a0473c161b","name":"Jan","lastName":"Biegus","uuid":"3F1772885467EA82C05C16361FF52ED06D518044AE616D76D4EE084E1AA2CA30E7FD4E9D492D556CB258C2AB5521D546BF8766BD1779E8A6EC211AE547D9D0C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9977-7722","documentHash":"65fd753d-b33d-4d55-b945-facfa1203461"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1458","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ponikowski","uuid":"4BA43AD81191E72DA939FC5D83BEA90B9477144E13175E0C90F36EE4CB3FEE9042BB27EBF84E4EC7BA5B8F74BCDAD927438A7A29631A6A4168BC1347284129FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3391-7064","documentHash":"85c7bbe3-e979-4c59-ab11-59e57cb9e09e"}],"doi":"10.1002/ejhf.3423"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["planar parallel manipulator","fuzzy logic controller","pneumatic positioning system","electro-pneumatic servo-drive"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709244878c28a047392ad2","5e709244878c28a047392af4","5e7093ac878c28a0473aed05"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Design of a 2 DoF Planar Parallel Manipulator with an Electro-Pneumatic Servo-Drive—Part 2","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67595458fdbe83757db13785","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709244878c28a047392af4","5e7093ac878c28a0473aed05","5e709244878c28a047392ad2"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper is the second part of the study of a planar manipulator and this section presents the construction of a prototype manipulator.

In heart failure (HF), it is particularly important due to the increasing role of urine composition. Therefore, we proposed this study to assess the accuracy of urine chloride (uCl−) assessment via strip test in relation to chloride and sodium (uNa+) measurements in a gold-standard laboratory method. Methods: Urine samples were collected before administering morning medications. Afterwards, they were analyzed concurrently using the strip test and gold-standard laboratory method. Results: The study cohort comprised 66 patients (82% male, mean age 68 ± 12 years), of whom 65% were diagnosed with HF and 35% without HF. Across the entire cohort, a strong correlation was observed between uCl− measured by both methods (r = 0.85; p &lt; 0.001). However, the strip test was found to underestimate uCl− relative to the laboratory measurements (mean difference of 18 mmol/L). Furthermore, strong correlations were observed between the methods among patients with HF and without HF (r = 0.88 vs. r = 0.71, respectively; p &lt; 0.001 for both), where they presented similar relationship patterns. Interestingly, in patients with a low glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ≤ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), the correlation between both methods was greater compared to those with high eGFR (&gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2) (r = 0.94 vs. r = 0.76, respectively; p &lt; 0.001 for both). The relationship between uCl− from the strip test and uNa+ from the laboratory measurement was weaker than for uCl−, but it was significant. Conclusions: These findings suggest that point-of-care strip tests for assessing urinary chloride demonstrate high accuracy and potential utility, particularly in patients with reduced eGFR."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005901","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.2473 [13 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/12/11/2473","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6705eaa8ece39845a342ab2d","name":"Berenika","lastName":"Jankowiak","uuid":"2D893B53792F5F19CD58F792878142A0281E97E58D6ABE15E13AB290EE4BAE877B3CD06A3145C006EE2A983570F8F747AEBDB29A40D0B2E7929BDE90B4E57D7A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e2726a3-3ae4-45a1-b11c-79802e8736bb"},{"objectId":"6168e7a875234017e053d594","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Guzik","uuid":"18034AFE30878BCFD12A4DDED457ABE28208DE3BAD4969D3ADB823F9F5CE276A979CBA1E8BEFFD512AFE4ACAE9442D2E24494A61E848453DA525194B3BE55675","orcidId":"0000-0001-9711-6568","documentHash":"9e135fca-cbfb-4474-9c12-3d87643721fd"},{"objectId":"5e7094ac878c28a0473c161b","name":"Jan","lastName":"Biegus","uuid":"3F1772885467EA82C05C16361FF52ED06D518044AE616D76D4EE084E1AA2CA30E7FD4E9D492D556CB258C2AB5521D546BF8766BD1779E8A6EC211AE547D9D0C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9977-7722","documentHash":"65fd753d-b33d-4d55-b945-facfa1203461"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1458","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ponikowski","uuid":"4BA43AD81191E72DA939FC5D83BEA90B9477144E13175E0C90F36EE4CB3FEE9042BB27EBF84E4EC7BA5B8F74BCDAD927438A7A29631A6A4168BC1347284129FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3391-7064","documentHash":"85c7bbe3-e979-4c59-ab11-59e57cb9e09e"}],"doi":"10.3390/biomedicines12112473"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a632f","5e709344878c28a0473a621c","5e709472878c28a0473bd3e7","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f1","5e709346878c28a0473a62b5","5e709261878c28a047394a61","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f6","5e709347878c28a0473a643e","5e709346878c28a0473a6320"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Shields against pollution: phytoremediation and impact of particulate matter on trees at Wigry National Park, Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478297","mniswId":"9257","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION","doi":null,"issn":"1522-6514","eissn":"1549-7879","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6dac09c2-dbd8-458f-8012-f80cc963ea26"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6750b903fdbe834291222e2b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6750b903fdbe834291222e2d","6750b903fdbe834291222e2e","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f6","5e709472878c28a0473bd3e7","5e709344878c28a0473a621c","5e709346878c28a0473a62b5","5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f1","5e709346878c28a0473a6320","6750b903fdbe834291222e2f","5e709347878c28a0473a643e","5e709261878c28a047394a61","5e709346878c28a0473a632f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study examines the impact of airborne particulate matter (PM) and associated trace elements (TEs) on deciduous and coniferous trees at the edge of Wigry National Park in northeast Poland, focusing on pollution levels and the potential for phytoremediation. Researchers measured PM concentrations in the air and on the leaves of Picea abies, Quercus robur, and Corylus avellana, along with photosynthetic indicators (Fv/Fm ratio and performance index). The study found significant differences in pollution intensity across areas with varying levels of human activity. P. abies, an evergreen species, accumulated the highest PM levels (>200μg/cm2), while Q. robur had the highest accumulation among deciduous trees (>50μg/cm2). Trace elements such as Fe, Cu, Zn, Sr, and Cd were detected, with C. avellana being the most efficient in accumulating Cd (up to 7.5mg/kg). The accumulation of pollutants correlated with reduced photosynthetic efficiency in trees closest to pollution sources. The findings suggest that strategically planting specific tree species can help mitigate air pollution in national parks and protect sensitive vegetation. Future research should explore the long-term effects of PM on forest health and the role of different species in phytoremediation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005904","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6750b903fdbe834291222e2c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"3a2abaac-4bee-4064-8073-511137e68f25"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15226514.2024.2426771","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6750b903fdbe834291222e2f","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Moniuszko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cd25144-15c3-4f5c-aba8-6fd0f5ce57c3"},{"objectId":"6750b903fdbe834291222e2e","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Przybysz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"329313c9-0d9e-4932-8f71-e16c07c6f1f0"},{"objectId":"6750b903fdbe834291222e2d","name":"Robert","lastName":"Popek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ce60b85-ddc4-46d8-99b2-0015a9480898"},{"objectId":"5e709472878c28a0473bd3e7","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Baranowska","uuid":"784F75F07B29C118EA1F29584B2050AB31521A027A6ACB7AEE943D5276962F2AA1682CF570A603B28B408AF0E0D05B74E4798D4EFB507F64F42656B70A7C8D31","orcidId":"0000-0001-9915-3776","documentHash":"f6301a93-ad30-4d51-9500-bfcd0d7c1640"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a643e","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Robakowski","uuid":"C08571EC4996C26F2CA93649ED5315470FA83850B47E4A58C8DF77487871A140BC6E7529BCB5D06289995B7F895EBEBE8808A0B5880881FFA04908E0171081BB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5564-7360","documentHash":"2ebc0be5-e987-470d-9850-5b6ac2443de2"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a632f","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kowalkowski","uuid":"1357A8D7AC91B76B639143D5BD6D11684EBEFB0E8D4A32378E575004F299A84E8FC2294FB6CBC9DCB7B32D813D8EF0A67D03C29FE94580A9C5B2C1E83A5403B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-5801-9818","documentHash":"903cf134-2c2d-4401-9d9f-73659262d7f4"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a6320","name":"Robert","lastName":"Korzeniewicz","uuid":"3DA9CE8B74C2D567C594EC33B397F3611EDE86838E0A8486D474EEAC7F981CDBED557238BD8517529C31CD86A18D9D4A6EA81AB9619F774588C5C2016C65F75B","orcidId":"0000-0002-4653-9154","documentHash":"23fe7fa4-56d5-46ad-8f64-ffc5c288fc6f"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62b5","name":"Maria","lastName":"Hauke-Kowalska","uuid":"CD8E1A374E8C98118ABB87A4F44C4EC9ABCC43F06D9ABC78967B79FF8E3572A91CABBFCA7D278E1E568D8B1709106EB641C8D95B79C59091F2CDDB20393654A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-6525-2861","documentHash":"5ec5fd44-ccdb-4f69-b88b-f4624f2ba4c6"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a621c","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Bułaj","uuid":"210AB66DBBD53625BCE8B4EC586F26CC6D990A162EC7083B7250ECEE6820C023D4AC40C2E423CC6B02F2B4C5C4B1E7E0C74FF2D31F53F78E08E55187095A66CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-8945-1355","documentHash":"77d04324-3121-4aae-91aa-bb436b32ac15"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f6","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Łukowski","uuid":"F39E74CC05397C5CEBACC79F5823CE316F6BD2D7EA35B9C15342035D7CE0A6A2A1AEFF6BBC6092CA65551E8A963A5F38E20AF2495748826D21F3CCC1E134018A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4860-4984","documentHash":"ba7a07cf-dcc2-4e95-bc5c-619b7d658a96"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8f1","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Jagiełło","uuid":"ECDE1B482C82777B01F34470AAA547CA2218B365EDA9FCDF11F85A56ECEC2EEB85F0B558A5B11F7684A89E09C585ED25DB2B0FC85E9112F4724A934FB638003D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5915-079X","documentHash":"cafb24f3-c9f4-4f37-a4b7-a93aafb09617"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a61","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Zadworny","uuid":"F0CE2CD9244536FFF2B4925C3FE964E9D11542858F5BE6CA31C11201E81059EA6EC73F5A41C6FF90D22D4549C75E1344574612194CF7710C8BDBF09ECDC9FF9F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7352-5786","documentHash":"edf6bc42-6faa-43f4-aae6-5d0cbfd7e40d"}],"doi":"10.1080/15226514.2024.2426771"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dynamics","finite

However, it is a complex issue, especially when damping is concerned. The paper presents the method of modeling welded structures based on finite element method and model updating. According to proposed procedure the finite element model of the welded structure is obtained by coupling its updated components. The model updating process is based on a substructural identification algorithm. The parameters of the weld model are extracted based on the isolated welded joints present in the modeled structure. The application of the method is presented on the steel welded frame example. Model verification consisting in comparing the results of the finite element analysis with the results of the experimental modal analysis carried out in the form of an impulse test showed that the relative error for natural frequencies did not exceed 4.1 %, on average 1.1 %.

Based on these efforts, code provisions and various models have been proposed for predicting intermediate crack (IC) debonding failure. The paper presents a comparison of seven selected models: fib bulletin 14 approach, Teng et al. model, Lu model, Seracino et al. model, Said and Wu model, Elsanadedy et al. model and ACI 440. The accuracy of each model was evaluated based on the test results of 58 flexural specimens with IC debonding failures of externally bonded (EB), carbon FRP plates or sheets found in the existing literature. The experimental database was prepared to include a wide range of parameters affecting the issue under consideration. A comparison of the measured and predicted load capacity values was made to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the considered models. The analysis included the limitation of the load capacity estimated based on IC debonding models as well as concrete crushing and FRP rupture types of failure. The results indicate that the latest models proposed for direct implementation in design guidelines—the Said and Wu model and the Elsanadedy et al. model—offer the best accuracy in predicting the load capacity. In contrast, the fib bulletin 14 approach shows a wide dispersion of predictions and a large proportion of highly overestimated

A molasses solution was prepared with a sucrose concentration of 1 mol/dm3. A two-step synthesis process was involved, which includes the hydrothermal synthesis of spherical carbonaceous materials from molasses followed by chemical activation. The carbonaceous material to activation agent ratio was studied from 1 to 4. The CO2 adsorption of all activated biocarbons was tested at 0, 10, and 20°C and a pressure of up to 1 bar. The results showed a significant correlation between CO2 adsorption and the textural properties of the activated biocarbons. The activated biocarbon with the highest CO2 adsorption of 7.1 mmol/g at 1 bar and 0°C was successfully produced by modifying with KOH. The selectivity of CO2 over N2 calculated on the basis of the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory was excellent (16.5). The Sips model was found to be the most suitable, and the isosteric heats of adsorption were also specified."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005921","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6458c4a44097077a5e3a4233","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"394fb35b-fdbb-4d4d-b2d9-f08e9588f614"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11,

This study assesses the potential of HIV self-testing (HIVST) to enhance early detection, particularly among heterosexual individuals, and evaluates its advantages and limitations within the Polish context. Methods: This study examines the advantages and disadvantages of HIVST by analyzing data from various studies. It focuses on the acceptability, sensitivity, and specificity of HIVST, comparing blood-based and oral fluid-based tests. Moreover, the economic impact and potential public health benefits of HIVST in Poland are evaluated. Results: HIVST is well-accepted, especially among key populations; it can reduce stigma and enhance privacy. The results of studies conducted in Poland indicate that heterosexuals are more inclined to use self-testing methods than traditional diagnostic procedures. On the other hand, HIVST has the potential for false-negative results due to the serological window and the possibility of missed diagnoses of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Moreover, the cost of HIVST remains a significant barrier, as it is not publicly funded in Poland. Conclusions: Despite its limitations, HIVST offers a number of significant benefits, including increased rates of testing and earlier detection, which could prove vital in reducing the transmission of HIV in Poland. This study proposes that increased funding, the integration of HIVST into public health strategies, and further research to enhance its implementation, alongside education and support for its effective use, should be prioritized."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005929","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"art.2475 [13 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/14/22/2475","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6751bee2fdbe835717e8cf85","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Dudzik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27bc2e32-ca42-4a4f-9448-899ce51daf9b"},{"objectId":"6751bee2fdbe835717e8cf84","name":"Igor","lastName":"Domański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0c92d86-9306-4b0a-a744-ea3554f056ee"},{"objectId":"6751bee2fdbe835717e8cf83","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9228bb49-3d0f-4fda-b255-fd03a7c41128"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1ba6","name":"Brygida","lastName":"Knysz","uuid":"E75FC309E09018953F16D8B309C132A2F9212666E1AEB1064C2C16B7AF25A129005CE4A1347D7A4F9A34A2DD4627411FF1C5236CEFEFEC1366D5598E93DCF6B2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2605-1079","documentHash":"d4933e78-6452-4bd8-8630-d55900d617ea"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a164e","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Szymczak","uuid":"90F98EBA88F7C2A20CEBB36BB455F41641935924BBAB28A1C27648858508EBF756072F6519E223A805BD411A9F2538DEF4D1E3B124AB1438274F8ED72E785667","orcidId":"0000-0001-6695-2942","documentHash":"2b0c14e4-6bdf-45fa-aae7-772f107d5319"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a149f","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Szetela","uuid":"9BBC21452CC44B27EA0932B6BAD3B3B5B27C889E22F6BE0DA114740C21ABA0E756CE0819AFD7B31894497FEBFA7AB7A035938D846081809A932A3D3615AAF149","orcidId":"0000-0001-7178-9801","documentHash":"d2096515-dc4f-4d32-8ddf-be6219781d1c"}],"doi":"10.3390/diagnostics14222475"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["environmental quality of life","sustainable development","TOPSIS method","green economy"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a3f2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Regional diversity of the environmental quality of life in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a747","mniswId":"200171","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Politechniki Śląskiej.

The study uses indicators to monitor the links between the natural\r\nenvironment and society. They indicate how environmental conditions affect the quality of life\r\nand well-being of the population. Design/methodology/approach: The study used one of the taxonomic methods - the TOPSIS method, based on which the voivodships were divided into four classes characterised by similar levels of environmental quality of life. Findings: The study results showed that Podkarpackie, Lubuskie, Małopolskie and Warmińsko-Mazurskie voivodships, characterised by high natural values and relatively low environmental impact ratios compared to other voivodships and the national average, were in the best group due to the environmental quality of life. The last places belonged to the Pomorskie, Opolskie, Łódzkie and Śląskie Voivodships.

Digital analyses of the city were carried out using the following methods: a) the Visual Impact Size (VIS), which allows to determine both the visual impact field and the domination of architectural objects in space; b) simulations of selected views from the human eyesight level. The proposed cityscape survey methodology is presented based on the example of the city of Toruñ (Poland) in relation to the location of a planned high-rising building. The study used a 3D Digital Surface Model of the city (DSM). All simulations were carried out using proprietary software (C++)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005935","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6759596afdbe83571756d0ad","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2023-03-21","endDate":"2023-03-23","fullName":"28th
