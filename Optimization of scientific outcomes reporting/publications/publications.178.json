Workers also develop accelerated and acute silicosis after shorter exposure to respirable silica dust at high concentrations.\nThe objective of this study is to investigate and identify the occupational groups at the highest risk of silicosis due to short-term RCS exposure.\nAll confirmed cases of silicosis reported to the Central Register of Occupational Diseases in Poland between 2000 and 2019 were included. Data analysis covered: gender, age at the time of occupational disease diagnosis, exposure duration to RCS and sector of the national economy.\nA total of 2066 confirmed cases of silicosis were analysed. Thirty-two cases occurred after RCS exposure shorter than 5 years. Median age was 50. Seventy-five per cent (n = 24) of these cases were diagnosed in industrial processing workers who were mainly employed in manufacturing of non-metallic mineral products (44%, n = 14) and metal production (19%, n = 6). 16% (n = 5) of cases were associated with employment in mining and quarrying, 6% (n = 2) in conservation of monuments and 3% (n = 1) in construction.\nThe findings identify occupational groups at risk of silicosis due to short-term silica exposure. Medical professionals should be aware of early silicosis symptoms, and occupational health professionals and employers should improve protective and preventive measures in silica related

controlled creatine-release system has been developed from whey protein-based gels. Their functionalization was carried out by aeration and sodium ions induced “cold gelation” processes. The effect of protein concentration in the aerated whey protein gels at pH 7.0 and 8.0 was analyzed. Physicochemical properties of the aerated gels were evaluated. It was possible to obtain the ions induced whey protein aerated gel with well distributed creatine and different microstructure as well as rheological properties. Different protein concentrations and pH enabled obtaining gels with different rheological properties, texture, air fraction, diameter of air bubbles, microstructure and surface roughness. An increase in the protein concentration enhanced the hardness of the samples, regardless of their pH. The mechanical strength of gels prepared at pH 8 were higher than those\r\nobtained at pH 7, as was manifested by the smaller storage modulus of the latter. The former gel exhibited a microstructure between particulate and fine-stranded. A stronger gel matrix produced smaller air bubbles. Aerated gels produced at pH 7.0 had higher roughness than those obtained at pH 8.0. Optimal conditions for inclusion of air bubbles into the gel matrix were: 9% protein concentration at pH 8.0 and this aerated gel was selected for digestion in the artificial stomach. There is a small conversion of creatine to creatinine in the artificial stomach digestion process (9.6% after 6 h). The diffusion of creatine crystals from the aerated gel matrix was the mechanism responsible for the release process. Aerated whey protein gels can be used as matrices for time extended releasing of creatine in the stomach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309478","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"79","pagesFromTo":"103060","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S146685642200145X?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62ce80c74097075e7c657158","name":"Katsuyoshi","lastName":"Nishinari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0a20e54-cfcc-4b61-843f-5f84b7a07dd8"},{"objectId":"62ce80c74097075e7c657157","name":"Salvador","lastName":"Perez-Huertas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a33cdcd3-4487-4dc7-9f06-fce4c8548832"},{"objectId":"62ce80c74097075e7c657156","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Terpiłowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e9b2199-d57e-414d-80e8-e1469a033030"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5ce","name":"Marta","lastName":"Tomczyńska-Mleko","uuid":"3B3A2BA8838E0EF18C5BDC3FBE696E690E80FCAE086E54B78F9A3A571D1BEA631AB456720E1100431350B6377C74D72D52BE8EE1E8017616FC6396C4487A0CDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6870-1060","documentHash":"a0f545da-1ca1-4def-bfc4-e1488b6965ef"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a04739099e","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Mleko","uuid":"B27FEDD0287F54B7DC4920F40FB447439467A8FCB656952E3D4ED660CDF5AA4E0F8474BB952CBAB4DCA5ACF59D33A3A79DF2FC98201DF45EFE3A6CE239E063CA","orcidId":"0000-0002-4704-0777","documentHash":"8acc1acf-f9af-4b89-aa81-b8a34de4b035"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ifset.2022.103060"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["immersive virtual reality; virtual reality; health-related physical activity; intensity of physical activity; active video games; serious games"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"608135d42467f0276870e0c9","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Instytut Nauk o Sporcie, Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Therefore, this study estimated the level of oxidation in a fermented long-maturing tenderloin inoculated with lactic acid bacteria strains. To estimate the level of fat and protein exposure to oxidative factors, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), oxidation–reduction potential (ORP), oxygenation index (Oxi) as well as surface  ydrophobicity (HS) of protein, and the content of free sulfhydryl (SH) groups were used as indicators of oxidation status. To validate the results, changes in the color of the products were determined using instrumental methods. This study confirmed the relationship between fat oxidation (based on TBARS) and oxidation of myoglobin as a protein representative (based on Oxi). Indeed, statistical analysis showed that TBARS, Oxi and SH were correlated with each other and could be used as indicators of oxidation in fermented products. The findings of this study also showed the use of LAB as starter cultures for meat fermentation may have an impact on the level of oxidation; in particular, the BAUER strain showed a protective effect on proteins in the final stages of the production of dry-cured pork loins."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309482","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"11736","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/22/11736","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64a29ef240970713863e428a","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Kołożyn-Krajewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d6322c9-a1b9-4294-b21b-50c71e4f6199"},{"objectId":"64a29ef240970713863e4289","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Siłka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53066163-7488-4c90-a88f-de6e72779d17"},{"objectId":"64a29ef240970713863e4288","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Gazda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a38361d8-7420-4fc5-906d-fabb66498470"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc10e","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Kęska","uuid":"0C738FEA8C27C59785DB64D4A29832B3CEB7C5A283244342A7F4D096A0E39441C7F04F0FD20335F34E3004BD0CD1356D487D83B7B3DD1F2E0EF45726094721FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2668-2025","documentHash":"a1acce9d-0596-462c-83cd-ea74a74188db"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909f8","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stadnik","uuid":"9F5BB08503DFF7C33EE871564373C68A538B108044BB5C5238DCA0A7ECE25149BC236155C30F69F44AC9E9CD5725131B55EB2267C316425E78F2173BE5326187","orcidId":"0000-0002-5029-5535","documentHash":"1a58bec0-9883-4b0c-91a8-fd65d04da0c9"}],"doi":"10.3390/app122211736"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a04739142c","5e7093ba878c28a0473afdb2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"N=2 resonant superalgebra for supergravity","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479279","mniswId":"16112","title":"Physics Letters, Section B: Nuclear, Elementary Particle and High-Energy Physics","doi":null,"issn":"0370-2693","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"af35369b-0fb2-4603-b963-69c53a99c0d6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6378d08f4097076055cfbda2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afdb2","5e70922e878c28a04739142c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present new superalgebra for N=2D=3,4 supergravity theory endowed with the U(1) generator.

However, the systematically important morphologic characteristics that can be used to differentiate taxa are often problematical in their application. A review of the large number (over 30) of significant species or forms assigned to Eccaparadoxides clearly indicates that only the pygidia offer fairly reliable morphologic criteria that can be used taxonomically and phylogenetically. The pygidia allow for recognition of four different morphological groups (pusillus, lamellatus, pradoanus and asturianus) of which the asturianus group can only be questionably assigned to the genus. Species known only from cranidia cannot be assigned to Eccaparadoxides with certainty. This study refines the biostratigraphy for the interval from the upper Wuliuan to the middle Drumian and shows that this interval brackets the range of most Eccaparadoxides species.

paper presents a proposal for the use of energy indicators to evaluate the load modelling methods on the dynamics of a mobile crane. Three different variants of mathematical models of a load carried were examined and compared: as a lumped mass on one hook-sling, as a sphere on one hook-sling, and as a box on four hook-slings. The formalism of joint coordinates and homogeneous transformation matrices were applied to define the kinematics of the system. The equations of motion were derived using the Lagrange equations of the second kind. These equations were supplemented by the Lagrange multipliers and constraint equations formulated for the cut-joints and drives. The energy indicators were proposed to evaluate the behavior of the crane and the carried load. The authors proved that modeling a load in the form of a lumped mass is a great simplification in the analysis of crane dynamics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309500","journalIssue":{"objectId":"636d0ac540970767941bde6f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"a0184de2-930b-4a04-b342-a1662de569be"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/22/8156","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e61c","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Urbaś","uuid":"30F041198784216D54A1C00A5E094E8B3EAD1E437FE1B27C1BAE2D33FF9A062685A06EB4A2B8CF7174BAD641DCCF2F8F4A68B5200A365CC89A696CF838056E27","orcidId":"0000-0003-0454-6193","documentHash":"4d8dcec6-acfa-471e-b22a-dc191fd86a44"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e4b7","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Stadnicki","uuid":"99B5D7A0D5AF3F720E199C16BE4C44C3820C21CB5F3264A9CA315D4E46E791C4CFBDFF2963F245D0A20F0CC3EEC442637E5D7FF655E25A0EBF1AD7205E8CA3DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3297-3291","documentHash":"06dad38c-2c7b-46f0-be7b-c4745d23feb2"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dc75","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Augustynek","uuid":"DDFE1F99DFB1CF29A2762C7BB74E2545CE2DA9493E2FD27F846D52A79B145A5C4D7D33F274EF2A344DEAB961150CA18E637C59ACBE9E9E73F2435206F724AFAD","orcidId":"0000-0001-8861-4135","documentHash":"f2e620f9-d9fb-4f05-bb48-42894e665263"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15228156"},{"mainLanguageName":"niemiecki","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b1387"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Tradition und Erneuerung: Sprachen, Sprachvermittlung, Sprachwissenschaft.

extend the well-known model of graph-restricted games due to Myerson to signed graphs. In our model, it is possible to explicitly define not only that some players are friends (as in Myerson's model) but also that some other players are enemies. As such our games can express a wider range of situations, e.g., animosities between political parties. We define the value for signed graph games using the axiomatic approach that closely follows the celebrated characterization of the Myerson value. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for computing an arbitrary semivalue, including the extension of the Myerson value proposed by us. We also develop a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for power indices in weighted voting games for signed graphs with bounded treewidth. Moreover, we consider signed graph games with a priori defined alliances (unions) between players and propose algorithms to compute the extension of the Owen value to this setting."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309514","journalIssue":{"objectId":"637b6ed440970701eefe0a19","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"313","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c46b53dc-8554-41ab-91de-be5d1223672a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"313","pagesFromTo":"103792, 1-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0004370222001321?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"637b6ed440970701eefe0a1d","name":"Makoto","lastName":"Yokoo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc303896-8035-48ca-9aff-4718731cadb3"},{"objectId":"637b6ed440970701eefe0a1c","name":"Yuko","lastName":"Sakurai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0ffaf83-777a-4c80-b727-6b891bb0301c"},{"objectId":"637b6ed440970701eefe0a1b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Grabowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9619d361-093f-4cb2-9158-700a6aad597a"},{"objectId":"637b6ed440970701eefe0a1a","name":"Takamasa","lastName":"Suzuki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32ec438b-db52-4103-b3af-3d3a6f2dbd38"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bddf1","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Skibski","uuid":"AC4470B9ADB2116E239BC351689FAB9A1946F7EF655818DF2A76EED91275A2204CA7D7827570FF1EC96603F75B57BA0E98CE74A85E4538FBC04C124A97EEA299","orcidId":"0000-0002-3978-416X","documentHash":"5b400cb4-14d0-46dd-b8e7-493eb1e1a8dc"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7dd2","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Michalak","uuid":"B05263B399EF1DFC39418FCFA50E40C0D167BBB9E0F0641D2A5F76B8C080BF4A92EFB5EDA1894E32C51519D02CEB7F9C2979D71C8D127894ECA76D7BBBE13611","orcidId":"0000-0002-5288-0324","documentHash":"4a034254-a922-4157-9d16-b779a7670d36"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.artint.2022.103792"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a7988"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1f","uid":"b0noSHIUtJa6Uw08fQ9NYJQ","uuid":"03cbc2ce-336f-4f80-872b-657ea8d2cccc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Prawa i Administracji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a7988"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Najwyższy Trybunał Narodowy a osądzenie sprawców zbrodni popełnionych podczas tłumienia Powstania Warszawskiego -

This global crisis has contributed to the business turmoil and has been seen in services in particular. Due to restrictions on economic activity introduced by governments of countries, which were aimed at slowing down the scale of virus infections, many enterprises faced a severe dilemma, i.e. how to continue their activities, how to survive the crisis, and maybe end this activity, or change it into another. For many companies, the pandemic crisis turned out to cause multi-faceted losses and even bankruptcy. But also, some companies saw the crisis as an opportunity to introduce positive changes and gain new sales markets and customers. For these companies, the coronavirus pandemic has become a growth catalyst.\n\nPurpose of the article: The theoretical part of the article is devoted to analyzing the literature resources on the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on business. In the practical part, the author explores the results of the quantitative research conducted in 2021 to find out how the coronavirus influenced the functioning of the SME sector in Poland. The author posed the following research questions: How did coronavirus impact the functioning of enterprises? How did companies cope with this crisis? Was the pandemic crisis a source of financial failure or collapse of Polish enterprises? Was it an opportunity for market success? Did the pandemic initiate new business strategies, cause or accelerate changes in the business model?\n\nResearch methods: The literature review was made using the database of scientific articles in Google Scholar and ResearchGate. The author searched for relevant articles using the following keywords: “COVID-19”, “coronavirus”, “pandemic”, “pandemic crisis”, and “lockdown”. The quantitative study covered 500 Polish business entities operating in production, trade, and services in domestic and foreign markets. There were no limitations regarding the area of activity (according to the Polish Classification of Activities) or the number of years of firms’ presence on the market. The study did not cover large enterprises, i.e. 250 or more employees.\n\nMain findings: In general, the coronavirus pandemic caused problems in the market but did not contribute to the drastic collapse of the SME sector, nor was it a catalyst for their spectacular development. The conducted study showed that most companies dealt moderately well with the pandemic crisis. They took remedial action to avoid a complete loss of liquidity, going out of business, and bankruptcy risk. A small percentage saw an opportunity in the crisis or used this time to improve their situation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309524","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.56","pagesFromTo":"131-148","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.umcs.pl/h/article/view/13995","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709435878c28a0473b832c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szymczyk","uuid":"29805BEE5A4791CBB8098352E019ECF5C0B08BB4FFEA6B6643ED0DC518D03854FB6501B89D62DE21D17F2C5C1A39B051A603CED851A9019747C54A166DAA25E5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0869-2454","documentHash":"f45c40ff-86fa-40c2-9464-06a853f2ea11"}],"doi":"10.17951/h.2022.56.2.131-148"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a047387584","uid":"b4FcDppAk4ud7l0c4s_LO0w","uuid":"ca366d7e-9389-4288-99fe-04f0b8e332b3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Instytut Genetyki, Hodowli i Biotechnologii Roślin","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b6878c28a0473af960","5e709224878c28a047390956"]},{"id":"5e7091be878c28a047387586","uid":"b19pJ6HgFitgkFuk9B9b_iQ","uuid":"4c92ed64-6916-4cbc-b37a-0c120e58fc36","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Instytut Gleboznawstwa, Inżynierii i Kształtowania Srodowiska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390b6a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evaluation of the current State of preservation of Vaccinio uliginosi-Pinetum Kleist 1929 in Eastern Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cfc3654097075e7c6f5960","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709224878c28a047390956","5e7093b6878c28a0473af960","5e709227878c28a047390b6a"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study assessed the genetic variability and the possibility of Scots pine regeneration in marshy forest. The genetic parameters were determined using the ISSR technique. The relationships between herbaceous plants, pine regeneration density, and their genetic variability were determined. On average, per 1 m2, three regenerated pine seedlings with a mean height of 27.56 cm were inventoried. Based on genetic analysis, it was found that the proportion of polymorphic loci was 60.46%. The average number of alleles at the locus was 1.345, and the effective number of alleles at the locus was 1.345. The values of the expected heterozygosity and Shannon index were 0.200 and 0.301, respectively. No species competing with pine regeneration were found. A significantly negative correlation of the number of pine regenerations with the area covered with an herbaceous plant layer and tree canopy closure was found. There was a relation to the insufficient amount of light under the stand canopy. In conclusion, the condition of marshy forests was satisfactory and the genetic variability of pine seedlings was moderate. The vegetation was typical for this habitat, but the significant presence of dry habitat species could indicate the beginning of habitat drainage. It seemed that the amount of light under the stand canopy was insufficient. Nevertheless, more light probably reached the inside of the stand in the terminal stage, as a result of upper layer tree separation, which in turn may facilitate the effective regeneration of Scots pine in this habitat."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309525","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"5387","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/9/5387","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af960","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Masternak","uuid":"5F927114FC9D25D036F1F6AFA3EAEA5D145A7974276E7D697C729263A1402D208F5A93FFCD13DED439C53A2828E9127B5994AC4F4F267D207CD2ED983925C18F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6883-7526","documentHash":"e2239d5c-e0f7-47f4-82a6-e7d9a3dc4c5e"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390b6a","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Urban","uuid":"5A19E790883EDA32D81499864575432985A774A13A5908566FDF18A3E2C302F6DAEE677FFB0B55D76F2A5541CCC0E7BE0851ABA395C66CE196CD226BCC8BA19E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3541-1753","documentHash":"70ed6449-e6dd-46c3-a362-5a6930c395ae"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390956","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"923A7DC2ED96701630A8FC828C2CFC415B9F5FD0AF16FF3F340DA87141F71F9B1D6D9537CB30965F3A7E741AD2A90052B00052EE485B78B92C1745621527D84A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9334-099X","documentHash":"4e076c4f-2520-4a77-9313-4d1a10464a7b"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14095387"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Trust;","risk;","socio-cultural trauma;","refugee;","war in Ukraine"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709204878c28a04738eb3f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zaufanie jako komponent adaptacji społecznej osób w sytuacji uchodźczej - wybrane teoretyczne perspektywy studiów nad zjawiskiem","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b568","mniswId":"200274","title":"Studia edukacyjne","doi":null,"issn":"1233-6688","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"424109c8-9ac7-4a03-b897-bcb58d4aa831"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"637b461640970701eefb6083","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709204878c28a04738eb3f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The topic of analysis is social trust treated as a component of the process of refugees’ social adaptation.

The main goal of the study was to analyze the changes of trace elements in engine oil during various field works. For this purpose, engine oils from two tractors were selected for the study. These tractors were cou-pled  with:  a  cultivator,  a  reversible  plow,  a  tillage-sowing  unit,  and  a  trailer.  The  samples  were  taken  at  the  beginning  and  after  the  field work with a given unit was completed. The instrumental chemical anal-ysis method HDXRF was used to determine changes in the content of the trace elements: Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Ni, Ca, P, Zn, and Mo in the engine oil. The comparison of oil from tractors coupled with various agricul-tural machines allowed the conclusion that the distribution of the con-sumption of  tested  metals,  as  well  as  the  concentrations of  individual elements, differed significantly depending on the coupled machine. The research  showed  that  agricultural  treatments  with  a  cultivator  caused the highest percentage of wear-induced changes in the content of metal elements  such  as  Cr,  Cu,  and  Pb.  On  the  other hand, the operation of  a  tractor  coupled  with  a  tillage-sowing  unit  resulted  in  the  vehicle's  accelerated wear."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309536","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/article/10.2478/agriceng-2022-0001","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62ce7f074097075e7c656896","name":"Branislav","lastName":"Sarkan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70a3dc56-8e87-48f3-8c8a-2346ac6219cf"},{"objectId":"5e7094d2878c28a0473c4858","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Gołębiowski","uuid":"C6C25FA8A616123FFB076EE6D275640C098053BEA7C10C401556F977B8424326A32C06EF66037B6219550054F5445BB5856FC38838CE67A4C4146F66B737FF75","orcidId":"0000-0002-4170-1351","documentHash":"99d55744-a3bb-4ed9-8f0b-2b65d38748d0"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a94","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Zając","uuid":"2F85FF889A1D5B8D81CE8673AE73A708C6EA4BE1E981AF4034C36A4991A412EED1CD144A977F6EADD79B33529444D65260C2B7E7FFD3C4BD50C6FA65D1DFDC10","orcidId":"0000-0002-9025-4551","documentHash":"099d2b47-f54d-401f-be71-883f9fdc6a18"}],"doi":"10.2478/agriceng-2022-0001"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091bd878c28a0473872cb","uid":"bjWp3IAlrgzVQ6cqEMdFY4g","uuid":"9f7e2183-4eee-40e4-823d-3dd447ea0ec6","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Ochrony i Kwarantanny Roślin","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a0473909e9","5e709224878c28a04739091e","5e709225878c28a04739099c","5e709227878c28a047390b05"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Biodiversity of fungi colonizing scorzonera (Scorzonera hispanica l.) cultivated with the use of biostimulants","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum, Hortorum Cultus","doi":null,"issn":"1644-0692","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"23f8064b-bfb0-4086-bd56-6f4298ea904e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cfc6994097075e7c6f5efe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a0473909e9","5e709227878c28a047390b05","5e709225878c28a04739099c","5e709224878c28a04739091e"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biostimulants are friendly to the soil environment and can effectively improve the plant growth and yielding. The aim of field and laboratory studies was to establish the effect of biostimulants on the growth and on the health status of Scorzonera hispanica L. plants. The field experiment was carried out in south-eastern Poland on Haplic Luvisol. The biostimulants were applied according to the manufacturers’ recommendations. Moreover, the biostimulants Asahi SL (active components: nitroguaiacolate and nitrophenolates), Beta-Chikol (a.s. – chitosan) and Bio-Algeen S90 (extract from seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum) were applied for the pre-sowing seed dressing of scorzonera cv. ´´Duplex´´. For comparison, the fungicide Zaprawa Nasienna T 75 DS/WS (a.s. – tiuram 75%) was used. Untreated seeds served as control. Moreover, the biodiversity of soil-borne fungi colonizing the roots of this vegetable was determined. The number of seedlings and the health status of scorzonera plants were determined during three growing seasons. In each year of the study, both scorzonera seedlings with necrosis symptoms on the roots and the infected roots obtained after scorzonera harvest were subjected to laboratory mycological analysis. The experiments showed that, the emergence and health status of scorzonera seedlings after the application of biostimulants, especially after Beta-Chikol, were significantly better than in the control. Asahi SL and Beta-Chikol were more effective than Bio-Algeen S90 in limiting the occurrence of fungi pathogenic towards scorzonera plants. Diseased scorzonera roots were most frequently colonized by Alternaria scorzonerae, Alternaria alternata, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Fusarium spp., especially by Fusarium oxysporum. In conclusion, Asahi SL, Beta-Chikol and Bio-Algeen S90 can be recommended as effective biostimulants in field cultivation of Scorzonera hispanica."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309538","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"99-111","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.up.lublin.pl/index.php/asphc/article/view/4438","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390b05","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Patkowska","uuid":"F74DB7DBE40AE75952E67918DB1AD04CF370F727CD85A1B5A09D9B95E671544234CDFCD7670A138A013B374B60E6B2816CD841DF92C2A4C709B08FC13967C3B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0742-352X","documentHash":"61381934-0f3f-4054-936c-09aa12211af9"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909e9","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Skwaryło-Bednarz","uuid":"8D0CF29E672ADC955734C671CD135B719448D2A7A8A7F2170CDD4F1FD26C7386BA0674C28924AF57FDF0E3182F58928F6BAE4C790C1176C4B349FDCDBB8E01B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8608-9138","documentHash":"5a570333-f59f-49a3-8520-e27c196182fc"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a04739099c","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Mielniczuk","uuid":"CBB8DDE9CB195A91F46837E1BBF5D12CD5C5F332BFB41723F1B60AD44E94400D79D0640EF5A13979F14A690CAE8E7F1D152E09813094F4D425D25992C4E2E54A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1974-0597","documentHash":"991de033-f58a-4656-86cb-7deb52ca1f0f"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a04739091e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jamiołkowska","uuid":"92702F7F7374B05DE02946F251DBA3FA2A7B27A683EC8982EE83FEAD1EF9BB4E968016878919F6A16B40FEFED80C1850926D976EBF2727B5D735FF008EDCB7EC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4121-5318","documentHash":"92dd7bcc-b6bb-400e-8353-2d72e7aecab2"}],"doi":"10.24326/asphc.2022.3.9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091bd878c28a0473873a8","uid":"bFjWYhFHGr4MutQXUx1E8HQ","uuid":"edf810b2-67a1-4617-9324-4b34485d6d4f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Instytut Żywienia Zwierząt i Bromatologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a3c"]},{"id":"619eeea57523402fabdec1a7","uid":"bcD6ws1rBvMgqVrdBUveYFQ","uuid":"db928bb7-b202-4ae0-bb7c-d44c14aa8031","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Biotechnologii, Mikrobiologii i Żywienia Człowieka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a14","5e7094f6878c28a0473c8129"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A review of research on the impact of E171/TiO2 NPs on the digestive tract","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b9f","mniswId":"13071","title":"Journal of Trace Elements in Medicine and Biology","doi":null,"issn":"0946-672X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"dac44c25-a5d3-4757-ada1-0c8f6c5a7f28"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62ce91954097075e7c662e58","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f6878c28a0473c8129","5e709225878c28a047390a14","5e709225878c28a047390a3c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nanotechnology utilises particles of between 1 and 100 nm in size.

It is shown that the vector spectra, even with the broadening effects, exhibit sizable signatures of chiral symmetry restoration thanks to the chiral mixing depending on three-momenta carried by the vector mesons. Those spectral functions are used to calculate the integrated production rates of lepton pairs, and a proper binning in momenta and potential decrease in the vector-meson masses due to chiral symmetry restoration are discussed in quantifying the signatures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309543","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"106","pagesFromTo":"054034-1054034-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.054034","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebee209752340254fc43ab9","name":"Chihiro","lastName":"Sasaki","uuid":"3D2DB8933221C1EA956800FB2D620E06F810B41E8AEC8920897AF104F5A11065F25150B0136AFC36A29F2143D0F55BDA00B38779169132DD40C2A491EB69D366","orcidId":"0000-0003-4612-3375","documentHash":"38f271e6-c98b-4084-95e3-351fdbcb140c"}],"doi":"10.1103/physrevd.106.054034"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62cfc0aa409707101fe8895e","doi":null,"title":"The Reception of Joseph Conrad in Europe","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-1-4742-4108-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/reception-of-joseph-conrad-in-europe-9781474241106/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"6e68f727-de72-4846-90c1-adab7df3425a","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb74c","mniswId":"200","name":"Bloomsbury Publishing","documentHash":"f208b731-16f7-47ea-aae1-e9e456acbe2f"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f2e5"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"The Reception of Joseph Conrad in Poland (1896-2018)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cfc220409707101fe892d8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f2e5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Agnieszka Adamowicz-Pośpiech Without doubt, Joseph Conrad’s writings have influenced and modified Polish culture. However, the reception of Conrad’s works (and his life) has itself been influenced by cultural conditions in Poland – both historical and political. Hence several phases of his reception can be identified which differ as far as the approach to and interpretation of Conrad’s oeuvre and biography are concerned. These phases correspond to the periods 1896–1921, 1918–39, 1939–45, 1945–56, 1956 to the 1970s, and the 1980s to 2021. The story of Conrad’s presence in Polish culture is of a writer little known at the very beginning, but then widely read and deeply influential (not only on literature but on the nation’s morale) during the Second World War. He then becomes a writer enmeshed in ideological wars in post-Yaltan Poland, and, finally, he has been accepted as a master, but is now more revered than read."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309545","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"21-34","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f2e5","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Pośpiech","uuid":"8DA8306AD5E2C1DA56D201A9E1B3CE0D0B8575060877CC736241EC9F7B3E9964781F2650DB2D98226866B7B8E0E463120F2D7BD658F889DCB01B135C08CFD462","orcidId":"0000-0002-2251-434X","documentHash":"b06134eb-1ce0-4a0a-98b4-b1524943b74e"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62cffc724097075e7c6fa3b0","5e7092cf878c28a04739d2cb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"SPIDE: sybil-proof, incentivized data exchange","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454776f3","mniswId":"3946","title":"Cluster Computing","doi":null,"issn":"1386-7857","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e4aa9603-fff6-4cce-af37-bde77a72012f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cffc724097075e7c6fa3ad","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cf878c28a04739d2cb","62cffc724097075e7c6fa3b0"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Decentralized, open-access blockchain systems opened up new, exciting possibilities - all without reliance on trusted third\r\nparties. Regardless of the employed consensus protocol, the overall security, decentralization and effectiveness of such\r\nsystems, largely depend upon properly structured incentives. Indeed, as has been previously spotted by Babaiaff et al.\r\nBitcoin-like systems, oftentimes lack some of these. Specifically, current blockchain-systems fail to incentivize one of their\r\ncrucial aspects–the underlying data exchange. As we rationalize, proper incentivization of that layer could lead to lower\r\ntransactions’ confirmation-times, improved finalization guarantees and at the same time to discouragement of malicious\r\nbehaviours such as block-withholding attacks. Indeed, incentivization of the data-exchange layer allows the system to\r\nremain operational when all agents, including routing nodes, are assumed to be rational. In this work, while focusing on the\r\nproblem of sybil-proof data exchange, we revisit previous approaches, showcasing their shortcomings and lay forward the\r\nfirst information exchange framework; with integrated routing and reward-function mechanics, provably secure in\r\nthwarting Sybil-nodes in 1-connected or eclipsed networks. The framework neither requires nor assumes any kind of\r\nconstraints in regard to the network’s topology (i.e. the network is modelled as a random-connected graph) and rewards\r\ninformation propagators through a system-intrinsic virtual asset maintained by the decentralized state-machine. The\r\nproposal, while being storage and transmission efficient is suitable for rewarding not only consensus-related datagrams\r\n(both data-blocks and transactions) but consensus-extrinsic information as well, thus facilitating an universal sybil-proof\r\ndata-exchange apparatus, provably valid under the assumption of existence of a data store whose property of non-\r\nmalleability emerges as time approaches infinity. Our research was conducted under two scenarios - with round leader\r\nknown and unknown in advance of each transactional round."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309547","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cffc724097075e7c6fa3b5","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"25","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"19811822-fa05-46b0-8ffa-2529f384b69e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"2241

live in an age of planetary instability. The climate crisis has effectively captured the public imagination. It seems that in the face of numerous environmental crises, even science and religion, despite all their irremediable differences and mutual biases, are sometimes able to think and act together. The interpenetration of these two distinct orders: ‘knowledge’ and ‘faith’ is a symptom of such a change. The example of Bruno Latour’s ecotheological argument presented in this study is an interesting testimony to the hybridization of the language of science and the language of religion. Since Latour’s ‘negotiations’ touch upon such unobvious interfaces as STS and humanities or science and religion, it is worthwhile for the pedagogy of religion to reach not only to theology, which is a constant point of reference for the traditional pedagogy of religion, but also to critical religious studies. Its theoretical potential could help integrate the topic of religion with new-materialist, post-secular, non-anthropocentric, post-humanist, and pro-ecological thought."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058309553","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"141-154","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.repozytorium.uni.wroc.pl/publication/145445","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af831","name":"Monika","lastName":"Humeniuk","uuid":"986C634D222D87798251BBD6574B4CD1F7226DA4A624481CC8792C3883AD18A9A2D1ECE9E301455672A94029A7065C86DA3F3959FCF08F8897CA6F0893074DCD","orcidId":"0000-0002-9888-3010","documentHash":"fdde5493-8523-4f08-93ef-0745ec16c217"}],"doi":"10.34616/145445"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62d011e340970733e796ef43","doi":null,"title":"Problemy gospodarcze i społeczne Polski i Europy : wybrane zagadnienia","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7875-788-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/permalink/48OMNIS_NLOP/1aot9i7/alma991053020818905066","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"bdb9fb1a-8ad5-4fce-adf0-749f4ae4955f","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8e8","mniswId":"58300","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","documentHash":"8c3a2f09-51a7-4959-9d77-e798733a17b1"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b6723"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Publiczny transport zbiorowy w województwach Polski - analiza porównawcza","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d0140840970733e796f599","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70941c878c28a0473b6723"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058309555","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"112-124","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/permalink/48OMNIS_NLOP/1aot9i7/alma991053024545405066","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b6723","name":"Anna","lastName":"Woźnica","uuid":"7D357F1F3E1BA5FB6AD17A21B30A0FED6C25D7D0E1C40512847AA1B8B1E4FF9679CD961FB59B1585A76510A4DB23BB673D5FC4C2C6BD939873B4D9BA08E3E5D8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3910-9743","documentHash":"7b19c219-9a70-446b-9e49-a41d814e2dbf"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["institutional markets","arms and military equipment market","market communication","promotion tools","advertisement"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The use of advertising instruments in the arms and military equiment market","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd66","mniswId":"498372","title":"Wiedza Obronna","doi":null,"issn":"0209-0031","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"a3539b16-3e7f-4e53-a3bc-37c36a12687a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"637ba51540970701ee008f92","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927d878c28a0473969bd"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The specificity of the market of arms and military equipment, and above all its dependence on the political, legal, technological, economic and cultural conditions, impact on the way of conducting activities related to market communication, as well as the hierarchy of the employed  instruments of promotion.

The research carried out in urban and rural areas showed significant differences in the behaviour of birds reflecting their timidity in the presence of humans, measured as the distance from the observer at which they took flight and subsequently landed on the water surface. These distances were four times greater in the non-urban areas. Total numbers of birds and bird density indicators were significantly higher in the urban areas, as was the average size of the assemblages, by 2,0-3,2 birds, depending on the date of the study. There were no significant differences in sex structure or reproductive rates between the study sites, with male predominance in all study areas. The analyses indicate progressive adaptation to urban environments by mallard ducks. This is achieved through behavioural changes, which do not significantly affect the course of natural selection or breeding processes in birds present in these environments, which remain similar to those observed in non-urban or low-urbanized environments typical for this species."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313103","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"13-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://zootechnical.com/api/files/download/1879124.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6368ee5840970778522c39ed","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Rataj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0b49778-8b4d-4ad5-88a1-43dd61697271"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909bc","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Piórkowski","uuid":"BDFEABFB72C1DBCC00E46B4719DD3A4164D6B3372D8E45467D1A11712508118C1319E274298D14A3DE9DECB2C252D694052F7FC57CC9E46DF1B0AB57C26616F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-2262-5023","documentHash":"fd1b32c0-e160-464d-ac6c-388d7f267ad9"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a0473908fb","name":"Marian","lastName":"Flis","uuid":"76F297A35A3E37F8012B55880DE3E1A67A866A7D07D5956377349B3BCF8A2B219D8C20028D5BF2C3C42FA6883BF0D5BC46CB73B5DD62A332E13718CE6573FA95","orcidId":"0000-0001-7429-3158","documentHash":"2be62a82-8a69-44f2-b824-89591b40dd82"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a0473908e4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Czyżowski","uuid":"E1BC3B725744238D1D60928414C5D96D6C69C366349F2F18D0B98A3461CA83E3FE3D4E598EE0C4C175E21625D033F485653E1E51124D28C2E8451DDF72D899C1","orcidId":"0000-0002-8587-246X","documentHash":"40174cb9-9f06-4847-8a2a-5cad4a22993c"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.8567"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9788382701357","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709418878c28a0473b6156"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Przestępstwa przeciwko wolności seksualnej w sieci: ochrona praw dziecka w przestrzeni Internetu","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":169,"publicationPlace":"Warszawa","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6380abad4097073310c202b3","editors":[{"objectId":"6380abad4097073310c202b6","name":"J.","lastName":"Kotowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d22bac3a-e0ee-4f3a-878c-99906dd99a3b"},{"objectId":"6380abad4097073310c202b5","name":"H.","lastName":"Elżanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c30a33a-ce24-4558-8ecf-bba1aa3b4695"},{"objectId":"5e709418878c28a0473b6156","name":"BŁAŻEJ","lastName":"KMIECIAK","uuid":"7DFE329F745092AC9FC0716B5CDDB1BAE91DDBB447A52AC3B22BBD57FCB8679877F6A272B726A30BBC88AC5FE7157A93A54F50784D406F667EC24BC5583170FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6347-1796","documentHash":"99f1a564-8650-481f-9659-55d57c7347aa"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e709418878c28a0473b6156","6380abad4097073310c202b5","6380abad4097073310c202b6"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058313107","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7ca","mniswId":"20500","name":"Difin","documentHash":"05e35b0c-7f9b-4fc5-b823-d4aa34bcb03a"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9912846868505606&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,Przest%C4%99pstwa%20przeciwko%20wolno%C5%9Bci%20seksualnej%20w%20sieci&offset=0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["listy pożegnalne","samobójstwa seniorów","pandemia COVID-19","samobójstwa altruisztyczne"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"634026394097074a2baa2b50","doi":null,"title":"Zapobieganie samobójstwom.

The purpose of this procedure is to inhibit cellular processes i.e. DNA repair. Low temperature at exposure has been shown to act in a radioprotective manner at the level of cytogenetic damage, but its mechanisms of action are poorly understood. The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of hypothermia at the level of formation and decay of NBS1, γH2AX, and 53BP1 foci, micronuclei, survival, cell cycle progression and oxidative stress in U2OS cells. The results show that hypothermia alone induced oxidative stress and foci. When applied in combination with radiation but only during the exposure time, it potentiated the formation of γH2AX and 53BP1 but not of NBS1 foci. When applied during irradiation and subsequent repair time, 53BP1 and NBS1 foci formed and decayed, but the levels were markedly lower than when repair was carried out at 37 °C. The frequency of micronuclei was elevated in cells irradiated at 0.8 °C, but only when analysed 20 h after irradiation which is likely due to a reduced G2 cell cycle block. Hypothermia reduced cell survival, both with and without radiation exposure.

Devonian has long been a problematic period for paleomagnetism. Devonian paleomagnetic data are generally difficult to interpret and have complex partial or full overprints– problems that arise in data obtained from both sedimentary and igneous rocks. As a result, the reconstruction of tectonic plate motions, largely performed using apparent polar wander paths, has large uncertainty. Similarly, the Devonian geomagnetic polarity time scale is very poorly constrained. Paleointensity studies from volcanic units suggest that the field was much weaker than the modern field, and it has been hypothesised that this was accompanied by many polarity reversals (a hyperreversing field). We sampled Middle to Upper Devonian sections in Germany, Poland and Canada which show low conodont alteration indices, implying low thermal maturity. We show that there are significant issues with these data, which are not straightforward to interpret, even though no significant heating or remineralisation appears to have caused overprinting. We compare our data to other magnetostratigraphic studies from the Devonian and review the polarity pattern as presented in the Geologic Time Scale. Combined with estimates for the strength of the magnetic field, we suggest that the field during the Devonian might have been so weak, and in part non-dipolar, that obtaining reliable primary paleomagnetic data from Devonian rocks is challenging. Careful examination of all data, no matter how unusual, is the best way to push forward our understanding of the Devonian magnetic field. Paleointensity studies show that the field during the Devonian had a similar low strength to the Ediacaran. Independent evidence from malformed spores around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary suggests that the terrestrial extinction connected to the Hangenberg event was caused by increased UV-B radiation, supporting the weak field hypothesis. A fundamentally weak and possibly non-dipolar field during the Devonian could have been produced, in part, by true polar wander acting to maximise core-mantle heat flow in the equatorial region.

To the best of our knowledge, the investigation of the impact of the number of heteroaryl groups at the non-K region of pyrene is reported for the first time. The obtained results for monosubstituted derivative (1) were compared to di- (2, 3) and tetra- (4) analogues previously reported by us in the literature. In addition, theoretical studies based on DFT and TD-DFT were performed to support interpreting the experimental results. A strong influence of the number of substituted heteroaryls at the non-K region of pyrene on the photophysical properties was noticed. Theoretical calculations revealed that an increasing number of substituted groups decrease the contribution of pyrene in the creation of frontier orbitals for HOMO from 88 to 72% and LUMO from 91 to 74%, with a simultaneous increase of 1-decyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole. The energy gap values follow the same trend, the highest was established for monosubstituted ΔE = 3.62 eV and the lowest for tetrasubstituted ΔE = 3.16 eV. Considering the results of TD-DFT calculations for monosubstituted pyrene, there are no differences in the character of transitions related to absorption and emission in reference to the number of substituted triazole groups at the pyrene core. Therefore, the increasing number of substituted heteroaryls results in red-shifted absorption and emission in the solution and in the solid state (up to 50 nm), increasing the quantum efficiency from 37 to 72% and lower efficient fluorescence lifetime from 9.25 to 2.03 ns."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313140","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1269","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2022.133797","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6639fbca4097076263a16fba","name":"Norbert","lastName":"Krzyżanowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fbdfefcb-e75e-4ee8-947e-0e8389b71138"},{"objectId":"6639fbca4097076263a16fb9","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Slodek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51a1a4f6-4094-4dad-9760-204fa653fc6e"},{"objectId":"5fc52e48085dcb1e6ae0ba55","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Zych","uuid":"12BE2F82F1FF4B39AA118C48747DA4AAB002D7503F0589049285DCE175FE2B11F1FEA1D8B61C3BB42ABC9E04524D74DA0542F5A78F0F83F29D45002B3FDA5B7D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"244181b1-a468-4522-9212-8a85c74bd1f2"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molstruc.2022.133797"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Human induced pluripotent stem cells","Methylmercury chloride","Mitochondria","Oxygen concentration"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Methylmercury (MeHg) is a well-known environmental toxicant that bioaccumulates in fish and shellfish. It readily crosses the placental barrier, making it a threat to correct fetal development. Despite being comprehensively investigated for years, this compound has not been assessed for its in vitro mitochondrial toxicity under different oxygen conditions. In this study, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were used to evaluate the dependence of the expression of genes associated with pluripotency and mitochondria on atmospheric (21% O2) and low (5% O2) oxygen concentrations upon MeHgCl treatment. We showed that the toxicity of MeHgCl was strongly related to an increased mtDNA copy number and downregulation of the expression of an mtDNA replication and damage repair-associated gene POLG1 (Mitochondrial Polymerase Gamma Catalytic Subunit) in both tested oxygen conditions. In addition, the viability and mitochondrial membrane potential of hiPSCs were significantly lowered by MeHgCl regardless of the oxygen concentration. However, reactive oxygen species accumulation significantly increased only under atmospheric oxygen conditions; what was associated with increased expression of TFAM (Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial) and NRF1 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1) and downregulation of PARK2 (Parkin RBR E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase). Taken together, our results demonstrated that MeHgCl could induce in vitro toxicity in hiPSCs through altering mitochondria-associated genes in an oxygen level-dependent manner. Thus, our work suggests that oxygen should be considered a factor was modulating the in vitro toxicity of environmental pollutants. Typical atmospheric conditions of in vitro culture significantly lower the predictive value of studies of such toxicity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313144","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d11fdc4097073a4bc63bd1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"241","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"bc988852-b6a3-4f96-98a8-0c84470e3a6a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"241","pagesFromTo":"113737","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651322005772?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62d11fdc4097073a4bc63bce","name":"F.","lastName":"Caloni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f03a117-3d7d-4e68-8438-d75b6c6f205d"},{"objectId":"62d11fdc4097073a4bc63bcc","name":"G.","lastName":"Lipka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c380f513-a57d-474c-802f-59c7e7eb7cab"},{"objectId":"5e709478878c28a0473bddbc","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Augustyniak","uuid":"433023612AB79D9B1F1A71FF58D098B1C32FB70E57CA924A92BAE6C67E55AA38C43D66BE5A45BB41C4139C093DB7CAC6F80FB6BA0513D5CCC43B32CA1E4EC36F","orcidId":"0000-0002-2853-3867","documentHash":"789842db-6063-4ec9-8a1f-f6bfb12786b1"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a0473971bd","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Kozłowska","uuid":"E8AD7263F4F21E3C0D905D60F910930AF8644EFACE8FDBB70E6B39C958F6E531AF64A286939D2D70FB8F90C2711386A10D0B69F869EAF521E93FFFFBD3268B82","orcidId":"0000-0002-4054-3216","documentHash":"b7f08877-6ca8-4969-b1b5-49c8f1a27cea"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396749","name":"Leonora","lastName":"Bużańska","uuid":"6445B014AE407813453431BD83C08DCA8DBEC8FADC685994B5CB8F1D258441F5C6664E4E53C22170AEE6BF993681EE4A6540EC69417C468F9BC5D980B703A1C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4433-9906","documentHash":"c42d54b5-11d3-4b3e-9585-86e08367f3f5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.113737"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Migracje","Postawy","System obronny sojuszniczy","Sytuacja kryzysowa","Bezpieczeństwo narodowe","Społeczności lokalne","Polska","Bezpieczeństwo międzynarodowe","Regiony przygraniczne","Pomaganie","Wojna hybrydowa","Nielegalni imigranci","Polityka migracyjna","Stan wyjątkowy","Przekroczenie granicy nielegalne","Unia Europejska (UE)","Prawo międzynarodowe","Ochrona granic","Granice"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["International law","Migration policy","Migration","Belarus","Borders protection","Crisis","State of emergency","European Union","Poland","Hybrid war","Crisis situation","Borders","National security","International security"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abfb4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Konstytucyjny obowiązek ochrony granic RP w świetle kryzysu na granicy z Białorusią","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a38e","mniswId":"200470","title":"Przegląd Prawa Konstytucyjnego","doi":null,"issn":"2082-1212","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"378862b6-eb2a-42e6-bb7f-4ef88424c81d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d547d84097075e7ceb2c73","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709386878c28a0473abfb4"]},"issue":"3 (67)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Obowiązkiem każdego państwa ustanawianym przez prawo wewnętrzne jest ochrona jego granic.

It is shown that the restoration of high-tech engineering, in countries affected by hostilities, is advisable to carry out using the CALS concept. The top priority CALS technology and systems have been identified. An opportunity to jump from Industry 2.0 to Industry 4.0. for countries in which mechanical engineering has suffered greatly as a result of hostilities has been shown. The principles of restoration and transformation of high-tech engineering by implementing the principles of CALS concept in the context of Industry 4.0 development have been developed. The infrastructure of the participants of the life cycle of machine-building products is proposed. A model for optimizing the production program of the defense-industrial complex has been built. The model takes into consideration the nonlinearity associated with the optimization of the production program, as well as the stochastic nature of changes in the model parameters. An adaptive approach is proposed that makes it possible to optimize the production program according to the model even for specialists without special mathematical training.

The new materials and processes are still analyzed in order to improve the efficient removal of organic matter as well as other pollutants from water intended for human consumption. The aim of the presented study was to evaluate the efficiency of using various combined processes: (a) coagulation and adsorption, (b) oxidation with ozone and coagulation, (c) oxidation with ozone, coagulation and adsorption, and (d) oxidation with ozone, UV irradiation, coagulation and adsorption for treatment of the modified surface water. In the presented study, the changes in pH, turbidity, color, organic matter content (evaluated as oxidizability, total and dissolved organic carbon content, UV 254 and 272 absorbances), and Ni2+, Cd2+, and Pb2+ ions content were determined during modified surface water purification. Supporting the coagulation process by adsorption with additional ozonation and UV irradiation of the water sample improved the treatment processes of modified surface water. Processes associated with coagulation increased the efficiency of removing color by 4–16% and reduced the value of UV254 and UV272 absorbance by 10–20%. Using ozonation did not significantly change the content of total organic matter. Heavy metal ions were mostly removed by coagulation and adsorption processes (40–60%). Including ozone, oxidation resulted in insignificant changes in the concentration of metal ions in the purified water (less than 5%). During the treatment of the tested, modified surface water, the best efficiency was observed after the use of coagulation and adsorption processes enhanced with ozone oxidation. The additional involvement of UV irradiation did not have a significant effect on the removal of the analyzed pollutants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313166","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.14","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/22/3763","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e7b5","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Sperczyńska","uuid":"A77268056D81CE0DCEEF9271EF250E5C801ACA4D12FAB23F6B77045059AC2E7F34250E8C1BCCC62BAFB8300143447F2E2897483D79CCC910D8AB417776F1AFA2","orcidId":"0000-0002-2389-2959","documentHash":"e05c65bb-1a45-4c65-8c98-0131495182d0"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e7b0","name":"Beata","lastName":"Karwowska","uuid":"AE405540B3F7B7A6154B0E22CBEE14745833EC0F1E532DC17574CE4F162BB64DF911A74C6E22B2F3CEE9E279B4167B86CB7EF95EBABC6A4F20DA9A9E03622964","orcidId":"0000-0003-2825-7644","documentHash":"6a13be8d-62fb-448d-9e4f-b73b5e205f60"}],"doi":"10.3390/w14223763"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f14","uid":"blMouyKiTtdLGWxhPCP8O2w","uuid":"1fbe631f-1aad-4d86-bdde-3d4b9105d777","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Fizjologii Zwierząt","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a0473909cf","5e709225878c28a047390ab5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"When incorporated into fruit sorbet matrix, are the fructans in natural raw materials more beneficial for bone health than commercial formulation added alone?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-2615","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cf012089-3ed8-4dde-a05c-d5b280240cb4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d130564097075e7c783cdf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a047390ab5","5e709225878c28a0473909cf","62d130564097075e7c783ce5","62d130564097075e7c783ce6","62d130564097075e7c783ce7","62d130564097075e7c783ce8"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Because of the serious consequences of osteoporosis, the prevention of this disease, which is also known as “the Silent Epidemic”, is considered essential to the maintenance of human health. It is crucial to maximize bone mass and strength during childhood and adolescence to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in later periods of life. The optimization of nutrition is one of the most important factors. Special attention should be paid to ensuring sufficient calcium intake, which is a problem in several population groups, and its bioavailability. We assessed the effect of fructans, taking into consideration their source (Jerusalem artichoke, yacon, commercial preparation) and the form of their addition to the diet (alone or as an ingredient of strawberry sorbet). A growing-female-rat model was used to assess the potential functional properties of these non-digestible carbohydrates in/without the “fruit matrix”, during calcium hypoalimentation. We showed that fructans have a protective effect during the inadequate supply of Ca, but their action is related to their source as well as the dietary matrix.

The new generation of the submillimeter telescopes, in particular ALMA, allows detection of extraterrestrial molecular spectra at unprecedented spatial and spectral resolutions. Some of the data presented here facilitated the recent definitive identification of urea in the interstellar medium (Belloche et al. Astron. & Astrophys. 628 (2019) A10:1-62). Its detection yields valuable insight into the mechanisms governing formation of complex prebiotic interstellar molecules. This paper reports spectroscopic analysis of the broadband rotational spectra of urea in the 210–500 GHz spectral range for the vibrational ground state and eight lowest excited vibrational states. The lowest excited vibrational state is only 61 cm−1 above the ground state and could be a useful temperature marker for astrophysical urea. The next two lowest pairs of excited states show significant interstate coupling, which has been successfully fitted with a Coriolis coupling model. Higher vibrational states also show evidence of significant coupling. Intensities of some rotational transitions of urea display nuclear spin statistical weights arising from the equivalence of the two ammonia groups, which enabled the assignment of symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational symmetry to the six lowest studied excited states. The vibrational energies of the new states have been determined from extensive relative intensity measurements and, together with vibrational symmetry, give insight into the highly anharmonic vibrational energy level structure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313179","journalIssue":{"objectId":"637cd7e44097073b7db5cac9","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"390","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"7ab0695f-0434-44e3-a8ec-ec9187702c74"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"390","pagesFromTo":"1117061-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022285222001230?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"637cd7e44097073b7db5cacc","name":"Ivan R.","lastName":"Medvedev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca88d2af-7d4b-43b9-bbe4-404d2aa4405a"},{"objectId":"637cd7e44097073b7db5cacb","name":"Thomas W.","lastName":"Chapman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39f1f33a-3b9a-4805-8457-afabec989a62"},{"objectId":"637cd7e44097073b7db5caca","name":"Daniel J.","lastName":"Tyree","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c4f8eee-af71-42af-8ae9-30d49ca545b8"},{"objectId":"5e7092ba878c28a04739b9ba","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Kisiel","uuid":"32D03844931AF0EE4C503CA32F82DF7806392DF4BE1ABAE5A13B0904950F963DBA6A40E9AAE0970F265791E95BC9018FC3FEA4A254754C4A1FCC81DB15E79F22","orcidId":"0000-0002-2570-3154","documentHash":"e8e5aa17-282d-44da-a7ee-9c9e8f884e01"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jms.2022.111706"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Tapered optical fibre","liquid crystals","liquid crystal composites","nanoparticles","optical sensor"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a5878c28a047399ccb","5e709401878c28a0473b4bab","5e7092a5878c28a047399ca5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Investigation of transmission properties of a tapered optical fibre with gold nanoparticles liquid crystal composite cladding","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547911e","mniswId":"15504","title":"Opto-electronics Review","doi":null,"issn":"1230-3402","eissn":"1896-3757","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9b4b7969-e701-4c6b-bd00-eafb1c74f177"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"637fd999409707772c26a586","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709401878c28a0473b4bab","5e7092a5878c28a047399ccb","5e7092a5878c28a047399ca5"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents a study of a hybrid structure based on the combination of a tapered optical fibre and gold nanoparticles dispersed in a liquid crystal material. Sensitivity to changes of the refractive index of the environment in which the structure is located, as well as the possibility of changing the refractive index of liquid crystals by external factors, such as temperature and electric field, were investigated. Electro- and thermally-induced changes of the refractive index of a liquid crystal through the rotation of a molecule director, which cause changes in the light propagated in a tapered optical fibre, were described. The most\nimportant issue in the article is to determine the influence of doping a liquid crystal with gold nanoparticles the concentration of which varies between 0.1 and 0.3 wt.%. The paper presents transmission measurements in a wide optical range depending on voltage, temperature, and frequency changes. Additionally, time courses of the obtained signal were measured. The study shows that the appropriate selection of nanoparticle concentration has a huge impact on the optical wave propagation. The experimental results show that the optical changes obtained for the investigated hybrid structure prefer it for use as an electrooptical switcher, filter, or sensor."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313184","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6362687d4097077852c3cbbe","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"30","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"30377c79-dd10-4fdf-9587-42d34441d445"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"e143936","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/143936/edition/125156/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bab","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Moś","uuid":"9FE69A6B065AC7CC93190206705F356507B9BF6EAF71547ED6BF5FC7658553B720B398719C7A0929E568CD5F3141C40AA54ABAA2AA69DBCC6677BA3C91E13AE7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1486-9263","documentHash":"0ca42072-1d6c-4267-997b-b14884105d2b"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ccb","name":"Karol","lastName":"Stasiewicz","uuid":"B567B635A554869C7D0D582CFE75D1D28DA330AE681A78A8A95304BC34378487C37490B423595A46D49D6C3E66F0DAB8FAB4264A545DF030FADBD18AB95C6142","orcidId":"0000-0002-7497-4380","documentHash":"e57873c7-526f-4c6d-91b7-765b4b2a95af"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ca5","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Jaroszewicz","uuid":"7CA191660DBEC04D0EEDDC929AD871BFA5B2F201541CB2EF9AC7A7375F70D3C63A1B5184B51CC84527503ED2A8729DE6F5914100D4C4461DC4E0AD2B7F37A272","orcidId":"0000-0001-8838-5846","documentHash":"de0509b7-faa0-4f67-a4ec-d3ef3e52fd7d"}],"doi":"10.24425/opelre.2022.143936"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["species richness","population trends","beta diversity","abundance dynamics","bird community","structure time laganalysis","Białowieża Forest"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a43","5e709232878c28a0473917e5"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec7","uid":"b8e-dSrkGa9KdyGzPNRLBaw","uuid":"1fe5fa7e-664f-448f-95c1-a19cc6a7664a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec7","parentUuid":"1fe5fa7e-664f-448f-95c1-a19cc6a7664a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec7","rootUuid":"1fe5fa7e-664f-448f-95c1-a19cc6a7664a","name":"Muzeum i Instytut Zoologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1ae1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Long-term changes in breeding bird community of a primeval temperate forest: 45 years of censuses in the Białowieża National Park (Poland)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e36","mniswId":"277","title":"Acta Ornithologica","doi":null,"issn":"0001-6454","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5256df7b-e321-4f90-ba06-68d0dcfbb6b0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6380bebf40970744cbdd51cd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709232878c28a0473917e5","5e709294878c28a0473984ef","5e70924e878c28a04739362a","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1ae1","5e709294878c28a0473984cc","5e7091f3878c28a04738da0d","5e709410878c28a0473b5a43"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W pracy omówiono długoterminowe trendy zmian liczebności 30 leśnych, pospolitych ptaków lęgowych na 7 stałych powierzchniach próbnych w Białowieskim Parku Narodowym w latach1975– 2019 (wschodnia Polska, dalej BPN, Fig. 1).Przeanalizowano zmiany w składzie ugrupowań ptaków lęgowych w trzech najważniejszych typach drzewostanów pierwotnych w BPN:łęgach (Fig. 2), grądach (Fig. 3) i borach (Fig. 4)"},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper reports the long-term numerical trends of the thirty common forest bird species and exploreschanges in the community composition in the three main types of old-growth stands in the Białowieża National Park(E Poland, hereafter BNP) over 45 years (1975–2019). We present recent (2015–2019) data on abundance of birds for theseven study plots and pool them with the time series collected since 1975. The numbers of individual bird speciesstrongly fluctuated, with most of the species showing alternating phases (the initial periods of population growth fol-lowed by the periods of population decline or stability). The numbers of 19 species increased; maximum growths by c.3–5% per year included Columba palumbus, Dendrocopos major, Sylvia atricapillaand Regulus ignicapilla. Among a fewdeclining species, Ficedula hypoleuca, Phylloscopus sibilatrixand F. p a r v aexperienced the strongest declines, respectivelyby 4.0%, 2.7% and 2.2% per year. Mostly the same species bred in the plots in the 1970s and in recent years, indicatinga stable species pool. The total abundance peaked around 2005, declining thereafter in deciduous stands, but increas-ing further (along with the species richness) in the coniferous stands. The similarity index between the study plots(beta-diversity) changed little over 45 years; ash-alder and lime-hornbeam stands remained most similar, while conifer-ous forests stood more apart. The changes found in the old-growth stands of BNP (mostly coniferous fragments) couldbe partly explained by natural modification of the habitat structure and the processes acting in the large geographicalscales, within or outside of the breeding grounds. The long-term studies such as the one in the BNP reported here, pro-vide a basis for the rates of natural turnover in the bird communities in pristine habitats, directly unaffected by humanimpact."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313185","journalIssue":{"objectId":"639337934097073c978a559d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"57","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"e5f6b943-c5ec-4ee8-a5b4-c9e1460760ee"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"57","pagesFromTo":"71-100","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3161/00016454AO2022.57.1.005","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a43","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Neubauer","uuid":"4F7CE0360C3AB7655635D6B86A69BC34DF142700BE1884C05F2BAADBD9248CF9A20E3FC1E3B95D0E53350B8399FA330BDC0B32209C12624A8151D94A6D3FE5B1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2123-0780","documentHash":"93bd9ef8-9c89-4a63-b4de-27e85eb3e9ff"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1ae1","name":"Marta","lastName":"Maziarz","uuid":"24547A53C8E61EDBA9BCA848856859DE3684229FEF5721D7F8EE41FDF745F29C322D0C2C1BA60AF0D5041FCED00DB1E319CF38D1714C3C6FAE7D0045F666752A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2921-5713","documentHash":"dca4b742-2ec9-4f11-829b-054ec27f49e6"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a0473984ef","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Czeszczewik","uuid":"DEA56AEE6492319FD97AD4A3C1AB7706285F41C9ABC5135C05953279B9415F8CD0D3590C39E23603D096AED4BD29ED97214190CE97A9D638CF35187AE04CD4F7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0523-1417","documentHash":"193889e8-7ec9-45a6-a881-9f4359ed8611"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a0473984cc","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Mitrus","uuid":"AB2E51F4CD83967893C7BB7F75FCCFCFF737F89CDF9CD1F15E8EC04AE396C08CE3B8B7F7FA377D2C5E7E53FC841AEE738884A5B68ACDBFFB517487BD6181A417","orcidId":"0000-0002-9864-5696","documentHash":"cdb13cfd-7118-426d-810a-53f2bbc621b2"},{"objectId":"5e70924e878c28a04739362a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Hebda","uuid":"AFF798CE9E7AA1FCE4DAB12CEAA0C0C7FBAF1BB7E37099EF90116C8C56DC76026A2B6EBE9AD116F20F9D9B9A81C7B333B771682E40741AC30C940F248F6C8E14","orcidId":"0000-0002-8668-1809","documentHash":"3fac8fab-ae4f-4011-b5af-5d2ad424969f"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473917e5","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wesołowski","uuid":"1DF50BCE411DF7914B74818E1E03F815C9D1675AF35D97ECE9617023C059D8B0BD6DFDDD1D0AD44095842794DE25CCEEBC572FD7E574C4CB712F4D108A70B9FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3088-7883","documentHash":"c681972d-e00d-493a-ad61-a97906c21348"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738da0d","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Rowiński","uuid":"97C95C6ECCC55B83F54D18A50D6F7979BAF04892809EF74ED7E0A896304ADB3AF1A4F596D4C60EAFECF8080F8A830414A33F0286E165D9888B08EB0F7982DBC7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1723-9128","documentHash":"068d70c3-b4ba-4e6a-87a2-a240a25b6c52"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9781003152828","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Tea as a Food Ingredient: Properties, Processing, and Health Aspects","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":396,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"637ddc314097077b7cec71e1","editors":[{"objectId":"637ddc314097077b7cec71e4","name":"Yongquan","lastName":"Xu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a42bbe0-367b-43e7-a258-39c0b50a84d3"},{"objectId":"637ddc314097077b7cec71e3","name":"Zhusheng","lastName":"Fu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ad0217f-cf5c-4ea8-92cf-ab0028c0e319"},{"objectId":"637ddc314097077b7cec71e2","name":"Junfeng","lastName":"Yin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b7ec41f-01a1-4e57-a28c-03c76c89f200"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["637ddc314097077b7cec71e2","637ddc314097077b7cec71e3","637ddc314097077b7cec71e4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tea is one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, and tea extract has been used in a variety of food products including beverages, bread, cakes, ice-cream, wine, biscuits, dehydrated fruits, and various meat and dairy products.

With contributions from leading scholars in the field, this book prioritises objective scientific knowledge and presents expert rethinking of the historical experience of urban planning in the former socialist countries of Eurasia. It draws on carefully selected examples of iconic cities of socialist modernism, from the post-Soviet space, Central Europe, and the Balkans. The book explores the ongoing transformation of these cities: from uniformed urban environment to chaotic post-modernist planning, from industrialisation to touristification, from deideologisation to making new and still highly contested heritage. Written in an accessible and engaging style, this book will be of interest to students and scholars in urban studies, human geography, sociology, social anthropology, spatial planning, and architectural practice."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313194","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003260769","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.4324/9781003260769"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny -

In this way we argue that, in fact, the non-existence of the aforementioned superselection principle is manifested always when localized measurements are performed, for example in state-of-the-art experiments with ultracold atoms confined in optical lattices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313207","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6377441740970701fd3b9d48","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"456","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"59a47b67-05e1-4057-bfa1-f37b69b3ab2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"456","pagesFromTo":"128198-1-2","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0375960122002808?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b1dd","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sowiński","uuid":"25FC05F8C78B7BFCA1EE93CE23EAB392BEA5A6BDA75865C8B3FCFCD299D8E7D048ABADF160FB491728589D780A3C50BA26B8A09CD1E011490DC8FC6D7A2D8F94","orcidId":"0000-0002-7970-4371","documentHash":"bd9162d2-1fc4-472b-b829-a9b2869d0aca"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.physleta.2022.128198"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66703-78-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","uid":"bIyN9cy073sy-77ulzW-Vmw","uuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","parentUuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","rootUuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","name":"Akademia im.

In this aspect, publications of Russian-language researchers are extremely sparsely in the world's leading databases. Objective – knowledge contained in publications in the Russian-language segment of research on the use of means and methods of physical activity for people with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nMaterial and Methods: The publications in the National Repository Academic Texts (Ukraine), Russian Science Citation Index and Scientific Electronic Library (Russia) databases are analysed. For primary analysis, 24883 sources were selected that match the search criteria.\n\nResults: The relevance of complex rehabilitation and recreation of patients with AD has been confirmed. The value of aerobic physical activity in combination with cognitive training has also been confirmed. An important place in the prevention and correction of cognitive impairment is the organization of monitoring the condition of the elderly. It is highlighted the promising indicators recommended for monitoring: the use of informative tests and gamification elements; ensuring the prevention of injuries.\n\nConclusions: The Russian-language segment of scientific research it subsides a bit to global trends in problem solving. However, the superiority of Russian-language scientific research resources on various aspects of the training of athletes with disabilities can be a good example for maintaining the health of people with Alzheimer's disease. The organization of monitoring of the health status of the elderly allows for timely detection of disorders and their correction at the level of functional disorders.

The plate is clamped and carries a concentrated force in its center. The improved shear deformation theory of the normal straight line to the neutral surface is elaborated. The deformation of this normal straight line is graphically presented for the exemplary sandwich structures of the plate. Two differential equation of equilibrium of the plate are obtained based on the principle of stationary potential energy. This system of equations is analytically solved and the maximum deflection of the example plates are derived. Moreover, the deformation of the normal strain line and the maximum deflection of the plate are calculated numerically (FEM).

We provide evidence for the earlier existence of this strait, in the Early–Middle Holocene and presumably since 1.3 ka cal. BP until glacier advance 0.7 ± 0.3 ka or earlier. Radiocarbon dating of mollusc shells from the ground moraines in the Hornbreen forefield indicate the existence of the marine environment at the contemporary glacierized head of Hornsund since 10.9 ka cal. BP or earlier due to glacier retreat. The gap in the radiocarbon dates between 3.9 and 1.3 ka cal. BP and the published results of 10Be exposure dating on Treskelen suggest the strait’s closure after glacier advance in the Neoglacial. Subsequent re-opening occurred around 1.3 ka cal. BP, but according to 10Be dates from Treskelen, the strait has again been closed since ca. 0.7 ± 0.3 ka or earlier. The oldest known surge of Hornbreen occurred around 1900. Analysis of Landsat satellite images, morphometric indicators characterizing the glacier frontal zones and previous studies indicate one surge of Hambergbreen (1957–1968) and five re-advances of Hornbreen in the 20th century (after 1936, between 1958 and 1962, in 1986–1990, 1998–1999, 2011). While the warmer Holocene intervals might be a benchmark for the effects of future climate change, glacier dynamics in post-Little Ice Age climate warming seems to be an analogue of glacier retreats and re-advances in the earlier periods of the Holocene."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313232","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6380ab1740970744cbdb4c4b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"32","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"b404f177-e41f-4b4f-9296-1f29ffaabfa9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"664-679","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/09596836221088232","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602b85fa9543c7410626de09","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Osika","uuid":"EB74042A3AE021E7A18C1A8BBE553CD1BC82B76C29235F1134231C61D323050EC825EA769B92BBD5F5B27F0EA7F9D9E0270F9455FB72ABDD86E77E0D21D59418","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e518190-d3be-4aa1-8d19-5522bc90f7a1"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f3b5","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szafraniec","uuid":"27C6957B8336E33DC9B348576A4F895BCC9CDB5E6E7283EE898FE1019E0D1FF805CCEDF283AEED7FAEB2C544562F8D50A32BA6EA4A956EFF0CB5AC81D588D39A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2170-5822","documentHash":"509fa929-50ae-4cab-961b-4edeb98f737a"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f076","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Jania","uuid":"C5EB10D76EA50D3529F3DC9C2992A8C5F7E2D849C9D7D9F935708AF0DC071EAE0E78B4CC097A628983449DFA5D74AFE7EF77423AC9F51EC4F564270E3363E0FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8531-7394","documentHash":"4cdf6236-2013-4763-82ca-ac18ab85b8d4"}],"doi":"10.1177/09596836221088232"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f19","uid":"bMAYoASr2iOhpM9vHhtf1iQ","uuid":"400f31c3-2a10-4925-9bbb-f05a4531fb79","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Przedklinicznych Nauk Weterynaryjnych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a0473909a4","5e709463878c28a0473bc0eb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Multidrug resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. isolated from cases of chronic rhinosinusitis in humans.

However, recently, CoNS are becoming more common bacteriological factors isolated from cases of chronic rhinosinusitis in humans. Moreover, most of them represent the multidrug-resistant or/and methicillin-resistant profile, which significantly increases the therapeutic difficulties. The aim of the study was to characterize profile of resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci isolated from cases of chronic rhinosinusitis in patients treated in a Medical Center in Warsaw in 2015–2016.\r\n\r\nThe study material was derived from patients with diagnosed chronic rhinosinusitis treated at the MML Medical Center in Warsaw. The material was obtained intraoperatively from maxillary, frontal, and ethmoid sinuses.\r\n\r\nIn total, 1,044 strains were isolated from the studied material. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were predominant, with the largest share of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Isolated CoNS were mainly resistant to macrolide, lincosamide, and tetracycline.

Angiogenesis, which was assessed using angiomaps, showed that the area of vessels in the ischemic center increased until day 7. OCT imaging revealed a heterogeneous scattering signal pattern in the ischemic area. On structural OCT images, we found presence of a core area of ischemia with a hyporeflective OCT signal and a halo of hyperreflective signal around the core.

The difficulty of creating a yield forecast system is in the correct choice of predictors that have the greatest impact on yield.\n\nTo build the model, moisture in the 100 cm layer of the soil, the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, humus, and soil acidity in the soil were used as input parameters. The amount of precipitation over 4 months, the average air temperature for the same period, as well as the presence of diseases, pests, and weeds were also taken into consideration. Data on 13 districts of the North Kazakhstan region in the period from 2008 to 2017 were used. The output parameter was the yield of spring wheat over the same time period.\n\nThe relative importance of input variables in relation to the output variable was used to determine the weight values of input variables.\n\nAn artificial neural network of error backpropagation was used as a method. The advantage of this method is that the quality of the forecast increases with a large amount of training data, as well as the ability to model nonlinear relationships between different data sources.\n\nAfter training the artificial neural network and obtaining predictive data, good results were achieved for predicting wheat yields (p=0.52, mean absolute error in percentage (MAPE)=12.02 %, root mean square error (RMSE)=3.368).\n\nThus, it is assumed that the developed model for forecasting wheat yields based on data can be easily adapted for other crops and places and will allow the

BLDC motors are often and willingly used in many drive devices due to their functional advantages. They are also used in advanced positioning systems, where their good dynamic performance parameters are used. The control systems use shaft position sensors mounted on motors, the structure of which is based on magnetic elements and Hall sensors. The aim of this article was to investigate the influence of the BLDC motor quality on the correct operation of the control semiconductor system. The article presents the effect of BLDC motor shaft observation system’s inaccuracies on the friction and current amplitudes of individual inverter keys. Waveforms of the controller phase currents are considered and recorded on a test bench that allows precise sensor position changes. In addition, the effect of sensor misalignment on power losses in individual inverter transistors is investigated. The article shows a significant influence of the motor shaft observation system’s assembly accuracy on the current amplitudes of individual driver transistors and their power losses, which makes it necessary to consider these parameters when constructing power electronic systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313255","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621679e52467f04ac0dc71a7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"42b00240-cbb1-44e9-b565-eef7bd2d61c4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1822","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/5/1822/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63809faf40970744cbda1796","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Gęca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"daedba3b-e285-4197-a9f7-01a5c172439b"},{"objectId":"63809faf40970744cbda1795","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Drzymała","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"72b25d97-ef37-4a2d-9140-c893240ee8d9"},{"objectId":"63809faf40970744cbda1794","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kolano","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e814a31-c69e-4c0f-96a2-4096c32641c4"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b3a","name":"Artur","lastName":"Moradewicz","uuid":"902C376D9768D9F22878A484D40C5242E1864728C14B8BBADF6CB072706516E36515EE012D8BA4E4B1F1574C806E935E6CBCC6725D856A6E783801F43896E91D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e22d62f-5708-42c3-9eb1-c0310ee88a85"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15051822"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hep-G2 and Hep-3B cell Lines","p53 status","Human hepatocellular cancer cells","Viability isobologram","Berberine and resveratrol treatments"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hepatocellular cancer cell lines, Hep-3B and Hep-G2 display the pleiotropic response to resveratrol and berberine","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476ec9","mniswId":"512","title":"Advances in Medical Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1896-1126","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e48dc062-25ee-4f33-9d37-aa7097ec7414"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"637cc7164097076055eaeb6c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6639fbab4097076263a16b0f","6639fbab4097076263a16b10","6639fbab4097076263a16b11","6639fbab4097076263a16b12","6639fbab4097076263a16b13","6639fbab4097076263a16b14","6639fbab4097076263a16b15","6639fbab4097076263a16b16","6639fbab4097076263a16b17","6639fbab4097076263a16b18","5e7091f7878c28a04738dc1a"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\r\nHuman carcinoma cells with different p53 status exposed to a combination of bioactive substances, resveratrol and berberine, revealed different responses in cell viability via p53-dependant apoptosis pathway activation.\r\nMaterials and methods\r\nUsing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay, we investigated various and opposing effects in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, Hep-G2 and Hep-3B with different p53-status.\r\nResults\r\nCells decreased in viability after treatment with dose-dependent concentrations of resveratrol and berberine. Hep-3B p53 mutants were more sensitive in comparison to the p53 wild type Hep-G2 cell line. A synergistic effect was observed after treatment of Hep-3B cells with a combination of resveratrol/berberine ratios in favor of resveratrol (2:1, 3:1). The results suggest that an effective concentration of berberine, in the presence of resveratrol, could be decreased even to 50% (half the IC50 for berberine) in cancer treatment. Combined treatment with berberine and resveratrol, at the investigated concentrations and fractions, significantly reduces the viability of wild type p53 Hep-G2 and null p53-mutant Hep-3B cells by 20% and 40%, respectively.\r\nConclusions\r\nStronger toxic effects on viability and proliferation were observed in Hep-3B cells what is consistent with the assumptions that null p53-mutants activate apoptosis canonical pathway.

In this paper, a market volatility-robust (i.e. counter cyclical) investment portfolio formulation procedure under the modified Markowitz’s framework with the use of sampling methods and genetic algorithms is established. In essence, the developed model relies on many input samples of rates of return that are further implemented in evolution simulations based on the survival-of-the-fittest principle in order to overcome the risk of obtaining sub optimal investment proportions. It is demonstrated that a similar portfolio composition approach, in comparison to Newton’s optimisation, produces more diverse allocations and allows for a more efficient mitigation of increased market volatility reverberations. For those reasons, the presented research contributes to existing allocation techniques and directly addresses the task of minimizing the adverse implications of market risk, what further allows for a rational investment decision-making and, importantly, holds capacity for further development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313260","journalIssue":{"objectId":"637ddfaf4097077b7cecb427","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"223b45e9-a83d-4c9b-a23e-6240bdf0b4bf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2022","pagesFromTo":"Article ID 594636, 1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5171/2022.594636","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ad52","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Dzicher","uuid":"DAA9B56F8475D5F8F8220E33B55BB5B6374A4E67CEB340A738119DEC132B002A782680B55D4F2D3E4C8293A015774D6495B6E6D7CB8E195C9D15CF1750416DAC","orcidId":"0000-0003-0917-3111","documentHash":"6f75c03f-9f1d-49c4-a26e-4101e9372411"}],"doi":"10.5171/2022.594636"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"<i>Lezioni di Fantastica: Storia di Gianni Rodari</i>.

The genetic correlation of strains was determined using multilocus sequence typing, and the method of Amplification of DNA fragments Surrounding Rare Restriction Sites. The presence of 49 different STs (including 12 not reported previously) was shown. All human isolates, 56% of E. faecium isolated from poultry and 40% isolated from wildlife, belonged to the hospital-adapted CC17. E. faecium CC17 were characterized by statistically higher resistance to aminoglycosides and penicillin, the presence of the aac(6′)-Ie-aph(2″)-Ia and hyl gene and mutations in gyrA and parC, compared to other strains (p > 0.05). E. faecium were classified into 73 genotypes grouped into clusters including isolates from the same host species.\r\n\r\nThe present study showed that the virulence, resistance, and genotype profiles of E. faecium were correlated with the individual host but not with the sequence type. The occurrence of E. faecium CC17 in both humans and animals proves the large circulation of the complex among various hosts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313272","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"173","pagesFromTo":"103925","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923250822000067?dgcid=coauthor","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62d134144097075e7c784839","name":"Beata","lastName":"Chudzik-Rząd","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3c2045c-5a76-4c51-ac0d-10a4cadb4a1f"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc0eb","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Trościańczyk","uuid":"E9505569798CF3BCCBA1BD9E29ECD13C53D6BD8194DE96CC6D2E4D771883B4F7376395A8A8D6BD3DBC4B3FC5D79B86667F01D3CCE60401996B7BFBFD2F82AFA9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6400-2131","documentHash":"4d3e9a1f-e19d-47c7-af16-a1e5dec2de54"},{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1d7d","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Łagowski","uuid":"86F96CC852E5C90024CC5EB08A42D2C75BA74540AC11AC46F6457CC2DE6CC316345224EE9E0A61C3C8CF51905E415CA014EA650431AE3C65C3B2E4D22A36AE44","orcidId":"0000-0002-7846-5444","documentHash":"aee102a0-a571-4fd1-9e3d-bb5df7f61494"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a98","name":"Marcelina","lastName":"Osińska","uuid":"B2F0A58A971F39693213E4ECD4E3EA2AD97B26E26077BBC82298E74A46A427241611146DA4F745B174348245D9176660216202455C0AF893CC882CF3B69E8146","orcidId":"0000-0003-0709-118X","documentHash":"cfcc544d-dd7a-43f9-8e4f-7abdf06e0387"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a64fb","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Gnat","uuid":"CCF8C2936F0CB9898F5C26FB6A213C47311D83F26065186D50EAD888D7E0AF38ACAADCDA646796F240C342BAF8485896897E51AE3084D62D898EE1FC379422FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-9872-0046","documentHash":"5aaab105-1b08-4968-af9e-9d2e415a44c4"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909a4","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Nowakiewicz","uuid":"13E6A9785337FE74ECD788C29CF75F18F32573930FB421B5E8708BD3D8B6A9DFE76144729C0B34379310B6C51BD6D31B15A48B1B2B61EB40B94A0EA7B5C03620","orcidId":"0000-0003-3961-5291","documentHash":"2616b5c5-8547-43ae-a76d-4a7f2db2856e"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.resmic.2022.103925"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CBN grinding","multi-criteria decision making","MCDM","TOPSIS","MAIRCA","EARM"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"6233590d2467f0713d56ab82","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Thai Nguyen University of Technology","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62d12aaf4097073a4bc6b15e","62d12aaf4097073a4bc6b15f","62d12aaf4097073a4bc6b159"]},{"id":"62d12aae4097073a4bc6b154","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Vinh Long University of Technology Education","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62d12aaf4097073a4bc6b15a"]},{"id":"5ffd33532467f0537ab0796c","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Nguyen Tat Thanh University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62d12aaf4097073a4bc6b15b"]},{"id":"6233590d2467f0713d56ab81","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Electric Power University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62d12aaf4097073a4bc6b15c"]},{"id":"62d12aae4097073a4bc6b157","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Research Institute of Mechanical Engineering","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62d12aaf4097073a4bc6b15d"]},{"id":"6233590d2467f0713d56ab80","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Economics -

It is even more important when it is necessary to choose a solution that meets many goals, which are in conflict. This paper presents the results of a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) study on CBN grinding of cylindrical-shaped parts on CNC milling machines. Three MCDM methods,  including TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), MAIRCA (Multi-Attributive Ideal-Real Comparative Analysis), and EAMR (Evaluation by an Area-based Method of Ranking) were applied in this work. Besides, MEREC (Method based on the Removal Effects of Criteria) and Entropy methods were used to determine the weights of the criteria. In addition, the Taguchi method with L18 orthogonal array (6^1+3^3) design was used for the design of an experiment, which has four input factors including the depth of dressing cut, the spindle speed, the feed rate, and the wheel diameter. Two criteria, including the surface roughness (SR) and the material removal speed (MRS) were selected as the response outputs. The reason for choosing these two criteria is because SR and MRS are two very important output factors of a mechanical machining process as well as of the CBN grinding process on a CNC milling machine. In particular, these two criteria are always in conflict with each other. Small SR requirements will require small values of the feed speed and the depth of cut. This will lead to the reduction of MRS. From the results of this study, the use of different methods for MCDM was evaluated. In addition, rankings of alternatives have been given according to MCDM methods.

The research uses data obtained from 102 randomly selected Polish enterprises to explore the relationship between the sector and (1) the preferred legal title to real estate (2) acceptance of short-term rental of real estate and (3) acceptance of space sharing. The relationships in all three areas were found. The sectors of production, hotels and restaurants, construction, and transport lean towards ownership. Enterprises operating in the sector of services and trade prefer rental. The sectors of production, hotels and restaurants and transport are skeptical about short-term rental. Services and trade and construction are open to such rental. The sectors of production and hotels and restaurants are skeptical about space sharing. Transport, trade, and construction are clearly open to such an opportunity. The research limitations are as follows: the research is limited to Polish randomly selected enterprises only, and the results cannot be generalized. The originality/value of this paper is revealed in the fact that this paper outlines a short-term rental and ownership perception from an entrepreneurial-managerial view. The novelty of the presented results consists in filling the gap by conducting the research considering the specification of rental and its narrowing down to a short period and space sharing in the context of the sector."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313284","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.28","pagesFromTo":"325-335","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.30657/pea.2022.28.41","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e8f3","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Tomski","uuid":"A190724C7B1128896E9CD47AAAE8C8F34E337F19D106C9FA2305E19E81B2E514160ECD14317E32D4A0267B53172FE43A65BE36572344AD1F8C57B312518F921C","orcidId":"0000-0002-8561-8445","documentHash":"be809d0a-6fdf-4bbd-8faf-b19aa0e316ed"}],"doi":"10.30657/pea.2022.28.41"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","uid":"bFdp5gORDGmB2AOTB2xubqg","uuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","parentUuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","rootUuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","name":"Instytut Metalurgii i Inżynierii Materiałowej im.

The analysis was carried out with aim of the variety of scanning and transmission electron microscopy techniques. Presented characteristics showed that the interface zone was continuous and of wavy morphology with locally visible melted zones under the wave vortices consisting of the joined materials. On the other hand, chemical compositions changes across the apparently sharp interface (metal/metal bond) in-between the waves showed copper-iron diffusion across the bonding interface. High-magnification observations of this interface confirmed the formation of a thin nanocrystalline interlayer of about 150 nm in thickness, composed of Cu and Fe mixed grains. Electron backscattered diffraction analysis evidenced the presence of annealing twins within the copper grains and also slight texturing of the copper grains toward <111>, being perpendicular to the plane of the weld. Moreover, for the first time, dilatometric measurements of Cu/P265GH steel clads were performed in the temperature range of 25–600 °C, revealing that the thermal expansion values were within the range of the reference materials—copper and steel. These preliminary studies showed that the obtained thermal expansion values of the investigated platers were exactly between the values for the reference materials Cu and P265GH steel."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313285","journalIssue":{"objectId":"637e2fb74097077b7cf0bd18","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"31","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"78379534-61eb-4d6d-8fbf-5343871bd648"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"7104-7113","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11665-022-07078-8.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"637e2fb74097077b7cf0bd1a","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Szulc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4afe5a03-c054-45d9-b8fb-07fb1d85eead"},{"objectId":"637e2fb74097077b7cf0bd19","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"00d9d505-ba84-4478-8d1d-dd2f9f90f737"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8e7e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Czaja","uuid":"5F12E2D264072B64A77968C65839818F301F79FB66FA5EA416B87C0833D662A88C24D935C3C63B3DA7F30113F36D1005BECBAAEBB8358F71027751C33C00C0DB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5011-9323","documentHash":"3c1d39a6-485f-46ff-af7c-7f2a4bf2b45a"},{"objectId":"5e70943d878c28a0473b8b64","name":"Marta","lastName":"Janusz - Skuza","uuid":"65F860C45214CC509F326A740F7CFFBC25150DD556422D424295F31B8D6E5B86C68E40ED33DFB25DACEBB52E5B2D7E2BC1B2AD50DE3FF19AA03173C6854D3F15","orcidId":"0000-0002-5434-6571","documentHash":"4ebe216f-a22d-4514-893f-788124c12d9a"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7f17","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Bigos","uuid":"6F686A78AF8FCB10EEE4BA0B46EA0706795896E2068211AD0F9DB97F0AD43EB662292725493622219C906F50AEFB1A05EAF697166C7624E26E0E5A9E6DCE6ED2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4197-7611","documentHash":"ba3020c6-e3f4-4b5b-800a-78e9ed7183a5"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0fd","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wojewoda - Budka","uuid":"E8D665A3E23F0D8B14B5EDC988750322A6E31155541F3B0606B8C9B27BE85D7311A514FFD5C31123E0772A698FA304420D02473CA061924F765B27BB55F744EB","orcidId":"0000-0001-6952-3270","documentHash":"d15ac8a9-953d-4250-aa3a-1ca2e5212342"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473aefa6","name":"Marek","lastName":"Faryna","uuid":"ABB72237B9D24FA6B1A45A4F9D54ACE23189360FC6E2801E756B8F0A1BFB014871F5A91627A089CD9A9AD8A39BFC5FF1362362140907362F6E7D36B73C8528C2","orcidId":"0000-0002-0537-5448","documentHash":"cff60d1b-9679-4a20-bc14-7f8cad93cc18"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aaf2e","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Terlicka","uuid":"76F2F6B9D35FD3B3605AE9102BB396400B6B3104FA7C7375FC648865A0FC74B5894FFE9333A8809C07411B804DD228B71B36715644694983B25585AA0A9E53EC","orcidId":"0000-0002-0099-3052","documentHash":"3f1c75b8-6659-49d4-8602-33f7f77ba100"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11665-022-07078-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Large Eddy Simulation","round jet","side-jets"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of the Mesh Topology on the Accuracy of Modelling Turbulent Natural and Excited Round Jets at Different Initial Turbulence Intensities","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","doi":null,"issn":"2076-3417","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"01301afc-a0dc-4e98-8fba-0ab08483b798"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-03","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6380bbd540970744cbdd0e13","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093af878c28a0473aefc5","5e709200878c28a04738e784"]},"issue":"Iss.21","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper is aimed at an assessment of the importance of the coordinate system (Cartesian vs. cylindrical) assumed for simulations of free-round jets. The research is performed by applying the large eddy simulation method with spatial discretisation based on high-order compact difference schemes. The results obtained for natural and excited jets at three different turbulence intensity levels, Ti=0.01%,0.1% and 1.0%, are compared. In the case of the natural jet, it is found that both instantaneous and time-averaged results are significantly dependent on the coordinate system only for the lowest Ti. In this case, in the Cartesian coordinate system, the errors introduced by an azimuthal non-uniformity of the mesh seem to have a larger impact on the solutions than the disturbances generated at the nozzle exit. The azimuthal non-uniformity of the mesh also has a substantial influence on the results of the modelling of the excited jets. In this case, the excitation is introduced as time-varying forcing, with the frequency corresponding to half of the preferred mode frequency and the amplitude equal to 5% of the jet velocity. Such an excitation leads to the formation of the so-called side-jets being revealed as inclined streams of fluid ejected outside the main jet stream. Primary attention is paid to the mechanism of the formation of the side-jets, their number and location. The results obtained on Cartesian meshes show that for very low turbulence intensity levels (Ti=0.01%), the number and direction of the side-jets are dependent on the non-uniform distribution of the mesh nodes along the azimuthal direction of the jet. On the other hand, when the cylindrical coordinate system is used, the number of the side-jets and their locations are random and dependent only on inlet parameters. It has been demonstrated that the mechanism of side-jet formation is the same in both coordinate systems; however, its random nature can only be predicted when the cylindrical coordinate system is used."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313289","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.12","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/21/11244","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473aefc5","name":"Karol","lastName":"Wawrzak","uuid":"15C0B424897D7E5FDB95BA5AAC3FFBB560A4F57A3DBD0A99C752873FA7D2B838F09669C87678BE662ADA8AAE176FFB530DD64BC90CFC85D27DFBFA2059F2D924","orcidId":"0000-0003-3513-663X","documentHash":"01efa9da-6c87-4771-b3a4-0b0a623a5298"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e784","name":"Artur","lastName":"Tyliszczak","uuid":"6E2749999F4CE02F9A228B63591DE3E59EF0D76C4F18AC05C95F0ADEDDCB9F7E7658BFAC6DB7282C91F101216D98B98A889405A4437FE165D9400F576FA35497","orcidId":"0000-0002-4844-0289","documentHash":"ceb14b61-b4b3-4d83-aee4-7ab0e6ba3afc"}],"doi":"10.3390/app122111244"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["niepełnosprawność intelektualna","stres psychologiczny","jakość życia","rodzina"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["family","intellectual disability","psychological stress","quality of life"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","uid":"bbhWY-GzmS7IoRMQpyKKYhw","uuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","parentUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","rootUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","name":"Uniwersytet Bielsko-Bialski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e8878c28a04739f115"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Rodzaje radzenia sobie ze stresem i jakość życia rodzin posiadających dzieci z niepełnosprawnością intelektualną","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd6a","mniswId":"495248","title":"Wychowanie w Rodzinie","doi":null,"issn":"2082-9019","eissn":"2300-5866","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"fa7c2d36-4fae-46bd-9d01-405e2dae28a3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63806eaf40970744cbd7f1f2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e8878c28a04739f115"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058313292","journalIssue":{"objectId":"634e71e2409707350c308eb6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"cb952b90-ceb0-43f8-ab7a-e574dc8990eb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"259-272","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.wychowaniewrodzinie.uni.wroc.pl/pl","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092e8878c28a04739f115","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Roszkowska","uuid":"F1F17F9FC3E55BAA9D312C50BD87E0070F49A4B9AD4E52C5925952E7CE5137DE768B2A2815D79CA9531F8928273AB07D4C754BB74D02CB5C14BA3F74FB1CD7F6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1132-8840","documentHash":"f5a3b612-0b2c-4642-b161-776d531157a3"}],"doi":"10.34616/wwr.2022.2.259.272"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de96","uid":"bAo34UoX0XIwK2rusa5QrAw","uuid":"3c9cd6a7-306c-491d-bf77-811eec2fdef5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de96","parentUuid":"3c9cd6a7-306c-491d-bf77-811eec2fdef5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de96","rootUuid":"3c9cd6a7-306c-491d-bf77-811eec2fdef5","name":"Instytut Badań Literackich Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e5878c28a04739ed7e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"\"Odezwę się po powrocie\".

The presented study attempts to identify contamination sources affecting water quality within the Kozłowa Góra reservoir catchment area (southern Poland). A total of 100 water samples were collected from surface water (the Brynica river, streams, and the reservoir) and groundwater (a Quarternary aquifer) in four time periods. During fieldwork, the physicochemical parameters were measured (temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, redox potential, and dissolved oxygen). The chemical analysis included the determination of major ions (HCO3−, SO42−, Cl−, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+), nutrients (NO3−, NO2−, NH4+, and PO43−), and total organic carbon. The study was complemented by isotopic analysis of sulphur and oxygen in sulphate, which enabled a more pre-cise identification of stressors affecting water quality in different parts of the catchment area. Chemical and isotopic results (δ34S = 4.38–13.99‰; δ18O 3.59–13.30‰) revealed that wastewater discharges and agricultural activities have a significant influence on the chemistry of the Brynica River and other streams. At some sampling points, a lower quality of water was manifested by elevated concentrations of NO3− (up to 22.6 mg/L) and several other ions (e.g., up to 114 mg/L for Cl−, up to 51.52 mg/L for NH4+, and 12.5 mg/L for PO43−). The quality of groundwater was deteriorated mainly by infiltration of sewage from leaky septic tanks. The level of groundwater contamination varied depending on the location, as higher concentrations of major ions and values of electrical conductivity were observed in residential areas. The Brynica river, streams, and groundwater recharge the drinking water reservoir, and thus its quality depends on these sources. A dilution of water and the presence of biochemical processes led to a reduction of contaminant concentrations in the Kozłowa Góra reservoir (down to 3.5 mg/L for NO3−, 32 mg/L for Cl−, 0.21 mg/L for NH4+, and <0.05 mg/L for PO43−) compared to water in the river and streams supplying the reservoir. The study revealed the role of wastewater discharge and agricultural activities in the evolution of surface water chemistry. The results will be used in further research on the origin and migration of other substances in water, including microcontaminants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313303","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6380a70e40970744cbda7bd3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"9ec0af2d-9a84-40ff-a84a-a4c75746195b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/6/846/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602b55579543c7410626dc5d","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Ślósarczyk","uuid":"125FDD57769C37E52464BECCBAC561BF09945BF863494B00991DDEC9E6DA6C1424CC4977BD2F4884F1E111D9BF4CE0DE99EADFB4B8FDFF4BF38F215AC7F04B35","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e6a7446e-c894-456c-9bd9-566b18d4bb39"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f401","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Jakóbczyk-Karpierz","uuid":"6920050979BB2934982326A1DF6EB5F851CB5BCC150430EA3DF4087FE2FAE6973DED1E076CEB76FF2D0A014FA1C78B3546F163677198ABB71EEFBEDD6D1CBA81","orcidId":"0000-0002-8493-5510","documentHash":"19012f4b-dbf4-4b79-8b17-b17f6f26832a"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f09a","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Witkowski","uuid":"D6C21600459BE6662E617976BC11E2C73B9114A10C34541B65C33725BFF8E75F0E059D246D13BD16BC274274CEE37527E27CFE176EF4D2B79DA34D4CA66110B8","orcidId":"0000-0002-1542-5373","documentHash":"347c3915-ce7c-4904-8e2e-387f90241d2a"}],"doi":"10.3390/w14060846"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet

study examined the suitability of polyethylene terephtal (PET) waste to provide an alternative modification to bitumen and reduce waste accumulation. The chemical structure and physical properties were evaluated for modified bitumen with different PET flakes content from 2 to 10 %. The effect of PET waste content on bituminous systems was analyzed using IR and 1H NMR spectroscopy, differential thermal (DTA) and thermogravimetric (TGA) analyses. The study of change in the microstructure as a result of bitumen modification was carried out using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Regularities of changes in the structural-group composition of bituminous binders after their modification with PET waste have been established. It is noted that the chemical interaction of the base bitumen with PET  flakes occurs due to the formation of associative bonds between the oxygen-containing components of the modifier and bitumen.\n\nThe influence of the modifier on the physical and mechanical properties was evaluated using standard methods (penetration, extensibility and softening point). Based on the physical and mechanical properties of bitumen, such as needle penetration depth (penetration), ductility and softening point, it was found that the optimal dosage of PET waste in terms of asphalt binder characteristics is 3 %. It has been established that PET waste and original bitumen interact both at the chemical and physical levels and can be considered as a suitable alternative for changing the properties of bituminous binders. Thus, the obtained samples of modified bituminous binders have improved physical and mechanical properties, which makes it possible to produce high-strength asphalt concrete pavements based on them."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058313310","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d53f754097074b28a94d32","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"6(117)","doi":null,"documentHash":"e750e8a7-08be-44c4-a04f-3b1013330952"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"6-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/257782/256865","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62d53f754097074b28a94d30","name":"Sofya","lastName":"Massakbayeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8668-472X","documentHash":"ae9144a1-2094-4b94-b845-7ea0c4dc6d4f"},{"objectId":"62d53f754097074b28a94d2f","name":"Aiganym","lastName":"Ismailova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4234-0615","documentHash":"9b58d0ea-f2a2-4480-b711-f96abda66ec8"},{"objectId":"62d53f754097074b28a94d2e","name":"Dana","lastName":"Yerzhanova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3671-0210","documentHash":"6440c5eb-9d8d-4bfb-b0c5-a1586e5c353f"},{"objectId":"62d53f754097074b28a94d2d","name":"Madeniyet","lastName":"Yelubay","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6209-5215","documentHash":"a91634e9-21a2-4653-b4dd-c1d56440326e"},{"objectId":"62d53f754097074b28a94d2c","name":"Gulzat","lastName":"Aitkaliyeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9872-6317","documentHash":"3d4b879d-7db1-4ef3-b635-cff627978eb3"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.257782"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODMxMzMxMA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
