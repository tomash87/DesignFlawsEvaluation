Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main driver of solar wind disturbances near the Earth. When directed toward Earth, the internal magnetic field of the CME can interact with the Earth’s magnetic field and cause geomagnetic storms. In order to better predict and avoid damage coming from such events, the optimized heliospheric model Icarus has been implemented. Advanced numerical techniques, such as gradual radial grid stretching and solution adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) are implemented in the model to achieve better performance and more reliable results.\r\n\r\nAims. The impact of a CME at Earth is greatly affected by its internal magnetic field structure. The aim of this work is to enable the modeling of the evolution of the magnetic field configuration of the CME throughout its propagation in Icarus. Thus, we used Icarus to implement a magnetized CME model that is more realistic than the already available simple hydrodynamics cone CME model, allowing us to study the evolution of the magnetized CME during its interactions with the solar wind. The focus of the study is on the global magnetic structure of the CME and its evolution and interaction with the solar wind.\r\n\r\nMethods. The magnetized CME model implemented in Icarus is the linear force-free spheromak (LFFS) solution that has been imported from EUHFORIA. Simulations with the spheromak model were performed for different effective resolutions of the computational domain. We applied advanced techniques such as grid stretching and AMR. Different AMR levels were applied in order to obtain high resolution locally, where needed. The original uniform medium- and high-resolution simulation results are also shown as a reference. The results of all the simulations are compared in detail and the wall-clock times of the simulations are provided.\r\n\r\nResults. We analyzed the results from the performed simulations. The co-latitudinal magnetic field component is plotted at 1 AU for both Icarus and EUHFORIA simulations. The time series at Earth (L1) of the radial velocity, density, and different magnetic field components are plotted and compared. The arrival time is better approximated by the EUHFORIA simulation, with the CME shock arriving 1.6 and 1.09 h later than in the AMR level 4 and 5 simulations, respectively. The profile features and variable strengths are best modeled by Icarus simulations with AMR level 4 and 5. The uniform, medium-resolution simulation with Icarus took 6.5 h wall-clock time, whereas with EUHFORIA, the most similar setup takes 18.5 h, when performed on 1 node with 2 Xeon Gold 6240 CPUs at 2.6 GHz (Cascadelake), 18 cores each, on the Genius cluster at KU Leuven. The Icarus simulation with AMR level 4 took only 2.5 h on the same computer infrastructure, while showing better resolved shocks and magnetic field features, when compared to the observational data and the referene uniform simulation results.\r\n\r\nConclusions. The results from different Icarus simulations in Icarus are presented using results from the EUHFORIA heliospheric modeling tool as a reference. The arrival time is closer to the observed time in the EUHFORIA simulation, but the profiles of the different variables show more features and details in the Icarus simulations. The simulations with AMR levels 4 and 5 offered the most detailed results. Considering the small difference in the modeled results and the large difference in terms of computational resources, the AMR level 4 simulation is considered to have displayed the most optimal performance. The gradients in the AMR level 4 results are sharper than those in the uniform simulations with both EUHFORIA and Icarus, while the AMR level 4 effective resolution is the most comparable to the standard resolution runs. The AMR level 3 simulation is 15 and 41 times faster than the Icarus and EUHFORIA uniform simulations, respectively; while the AMR level 4 simulation is about three and seven times faster than the uniform simulations, respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739664","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"683","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/03/aa47864-23/aa47864-23.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661e586140970762635c65cc","name":"Tinatin","lastName":"Baratashvili","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe7de4bb-a0a7-41ab-9175-c1aefe3da136"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202347864"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["religia, duchowość, religijność, formalizm, wartości"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["religion, spirituality, religiosity, formalism, values"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","uid":"bIyN9cy073sy-77ulzW-Vmw","uuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","parentUuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","rootUuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","name":"Akademia im.

vacancy (OV) plays important role in photocatalysis as well as in peroxymonosulfate activation. In this work, OV rich Fe2O3-CoFe2O4 heterostructures were synthesized using a combustion method and tested for visible-light assisted PMS activation. With the presence of visible light, the Fe2O3-CoFe2O4/PMS/Vis system can efficiently degradation of tetracycline (TC) with removal rate of 98.1% within 20 min. While only 79.1% TC can be removed in the Fe2O3-CoFe2O4/PMS system without the presence of visible light. The SO4•- and O2•- are the main free radicals for TC degradation in Fe2O3-CoFe2O4/PMS/vis system, while SO4•- is the main free radical in Fe2O3-CoFe2O4/PMS system. Besides enhancing the TC degradation, the presence of visible light can also increase the reusability and stability of Fe2O3-CoFe2O4. The mechanism for the visible-light-assisted PMS activation over Fe2O3-CoFe2O4 was proposed based on systematically characterization of the photoelectronic properties of Fe2O3-CoFe2O4 and analyzing the ROS formed during reaction. The results also revealed that the presence of visible light could help to keep the concentration of OV in Fe2O3-CoFe2O4, which is vital for maintain the catalytic performance of the Fe2O3-CoFe2O4 catalyst. Therefore, we propose that the presence of visible light can replenish the OV of Fe2O3-CoFe2O4 catalyst consumed by PMS activation in time. This work provides a new insight into the role of OV in metal oxides/PMS/vis system, which is beneficial to design better photocatalyst for photo-assisted PMS activation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739676","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"314","pagesFromTo":"1-6","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1944097076c144aa696","name":"Haitao","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1cdae48f-9208-4fb0-b13f-b9f6e549fff3"},{"objectId":"659fc1944097076c144aa695","name":"Tielong","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"454b188f-78b3-446e-85b8-e8eaad494985"},{"objectId":"659fc1944097076c144aa694","name":"Jinfeng","lastName":"Lu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3da18dc3-f168-40c2-9c86-836aebae1d33"},{"objectId":"659fc1944097076c144aa693","name":"Dmitry","lastName":"Moskovskikh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2bef170e-4bd7-4700-a209-1f128b5a7c44"},{"objectId":"659fc1944097076c144aa692","name":"Shuangjiang","lastName":"Luo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"74d91ec2-f6ba-4f27-933f-f17b064af548"},{"objectId":"659fc1944097076c144aa691","name":"Linjie","lastName":"Ni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07f1ac44-4f37-4b35-8a1b-7b740718e15a"},{"objectId":"659fc1944097076c144aa690","name":"Yingying","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e3166d35-b922-4767-85e4-5b741b4264e3"},{"objectId":"659fc1944097076c144aa68f","name":"Haiyan","lastName":"Zou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd46e270-bde1-4285-8544-ced55ba58fc0"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c3","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Czech","uuid":"DFBDEBF7C114925627DA9151532CF82BA9A33324F5242A90DBEC69067DEB26DE07BE7BA0DC9934E39EDB392BF55ED015F31CCE326B397F13DFE37731CA5EBDFC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4895-5186","documentHash":"496ba4f1-066f-4ca9-8a0f-0e382cf3890a"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390aff","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"4FCF45750A5D33DB0E506D0634C8E83F1F567E71FDA182424BC16D3A9B7D6C806B3E751DD8DEB8A95F81EFA82B94E668B6604C0E4D9479D418440B46FFBD3060","orcidId":"0000-0001-8546-7299","documentHash":"de8bb1e3-4bc1-43e6-aba8-d51f467ca81f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.seppur.2023.123586"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Quantifying the Expanding and Cooling Effects into the Double Adiabatic Evolution of the Solar Wind Through the Expanding Box Model","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547723b","mniswId":"1990","title":"Astrophysical Journal","doi":null,"issn":"0004-637X","eissn":"1538-4357","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6dd4b52-08ee-4b62-b195-3b6207fef891"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"673b142ffdbe832d85bc2cdc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673b142ffdbe832d85bc2cdd","673b142ffdbe832d85bc2cde","673b142ffdbe832d85bc2cdf","6325312975234038513dfa2b","673b142ffdbe832d85bc2ce0"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the fundamental problems in space physics is the expansion dynamics of the solar wind, strongly correlated with collective plasma reactions, such as wave instabilities that tend to relax kinetic anisotropies. The expansion is in general described through the double adiabatic or Chew–Goldberger–Low (CGL) theory, which sets the main ideas and plasma expansion’s major role in describing plasma cooling/heating dynamics. Here, using the expanding box model (EBM) we revisit the CGL description including plasma expansion. Our primary objective is to isolate the expanding effects into the conservation of the double adiabatic invariants, a key aspect of the CGL theory. Following the same approximations and assumptions as in EBM and CGL theory, we developed a CGL-like description in which the expansion modifies the conservation of the double adiabatic invariants. Our results show that the double adiabatic equations are no longer conserved if plasma cooling is introduced through the EBM, with explicit dependence on expanding parameters, magnetic field profiles, and velocity gradients. Solving the equations for different magnetic field and density profiles (obtained self-consistently through the equations), we compute the evolution of temperature anisotropy and plasma beta, which deviates from CGL predictions and empirical observations. This deviation is attributed to the plasma cooling effect induced by the expansion of the plasma. The results suggest that heating mechanisms even play a major role in counteracting plasma cooling during expansion."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739678","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"975","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7949","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673b142ffdbe832d85bc2ce0","name":"Felipe A.","lastName":"Asenjo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"820376da-77a9-44e9-9205-c60e3ae97d32"},{"objectId":"673b142ffdbe832d85bc2cdf","name":"Marian","lastName":"Lazar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb95aa70-3c25-4212-9fbd-1e354681de8d"},{"objectId":"673b142ffdbe832d85bc2cde","name":"Pablo S.","lastName":"Moya","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a94d022-a8c6-4110-a800-6d07474da1e1"},{"objectId":"673b142ffdbe832d85bc2cdd","name":"Sebastián","lastName":"Echeverría-Veas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32a24f99-31f0-45b6-8a99-b1c850560f4f"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.3847/1538-4357/ad7949"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sun: UV radiation – Sun: transition region – Sun: corona – Instrumentation: high angular resolutions"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"First perihelion of EUI on the Solar Orbiter mission","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477233","mniswId":"1982","title":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","doi":null,"issn":"0004-6361","eissn":"1432-0746","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f677d31f-f33f-4fa2-b4f3-7cca75d47be5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65a10fc14097076c14503c7e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a10fc14097076c14503c7f","65a10fc14097076c14503c80","65a10fc14097076c14503c81","65a10fc14097076c14503c82","65a10fc14097076c14503c83","65a10fc14097076c14503c84","65a10fc14097076c14503c85","65a10fc14097076c14503c86","65a10fc14097076c14503c87","65a10fc14097076c14503c88","65a10fc14097076c14503c89","65a10fc14097076c14503c8a","65a10fc14097076c14503c8b","65a10fc14097076c14503c8c","65a10fc14097076c14503c8d","65a10fc14097076c14503c8e","65a10fc14097076c14503c8f","65a10fc14097076c14503c90","65a10fc14097076c14503c91","65a10fc14097076c14503c92","65a10fc14097076c14503c93","65a10fc14097076c14503c94","65a10fc14097076c14503c95","65a10fc14097076c14503c96","65a10fc14097076c14503c97","65a10fc14097076c14503c98","65a10fc14097076c14503c99","65a10fc14097076c14503c9a","65a10fc14097076c14503c9b","65a10fc14097076c14503c9c","65a10fc14097076c14503c9d","65a10fc14097076c14503c9e","65a10fc14097076c14503c9f","65a10fc14097076c14503ca0","65a10fc14097076c14503ca1","6325312975234038513dfa2b","65a10fc14097076c14503ca2","65a10fc14097076c14503ca3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":" The Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar Orbiter consists of three telescopes: the two High Resolution Imagers, in EUV (HRI<jats:sub>EUV</jats:sub>) and in Lyman-<jats:italic>α</jats:italic> (HRI<jats:sub>Lya</jats:sub>), and the Full Sun Imager (FSI).

On 2022 March 26, Solar Orbiter reached, for the first time, a distance to the Sun close to 0.3 au. No other coronal EUV imager has been this close to the Sun.</jats:p>\r\n<jats:p><jats:italic>Results.</jats:italic> We review the EUI data sets obtained during the period 2022 March–April, when Solar Orbiter quickly moved from alignment with the Earth (2022 March 6), to perihelion (2022 March 26), to quadrature with the Earth (2022 March 29).

Several active regions were imaged at unprecedented cadences and sequence durations. We identify in this paper a broad range of features that require deeper studies. Both FSI and HRI<jats:sub>EUV</jats:sub> operated at design specifications, but HRI<jats:sub>Lya</jats:sub> suffered from performance issues near perihelion.

This process is complex and involves the generation of heat, which is still poorly understood especially in nanoconfined systems. In this article, scanning transitiometry was used to measure and evaluate the pressure-driven heat of intrusion of water into solid ZIF-8 powder within the temperature range of 278.15–343.15 K. The conditions examined included the presence and absence of atmospheric gases, basic pH conditions, solid sample origins, and temperature. Simultaneously with these experiments, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to elucidate the changing behavior of water as it enters into ZIF-8. The results are rationalized within a temperature-dependent thermodynamic cycle. This cycle describes the temperature-dependent process of ZIF-8 filling, heating, emptying, and cooling with respect to the change of internal energy of the cycle from the calculated change in the specific heat capacity of the system.

In the present study, a series of horizontally aligned sediment traps have been deployed at different heights within 1 m above the ground for a two-month period at various locations in an arid region (Sarakhs, Iran). MPs were isolated from sediments and were quantified and characterised according to size, colour, shape and polymer composition by established techniques. Most MPs were &amp;lt;250 μm in length, fibres were the most important shape, black and blue-green were the dominant colours, and polymer abundance decreased in the order polyethylene &amp;gt; nylon &amp;gt; polypropylene &amp;gt; polystyrene &amp;gt; polyethylene terephthalate. The distributions of sediment mass (range &amp;lt;0.01–9 g) and number of MPs (range = 0 to 21) were heterogeneous, both between sites and at the different heights sampled, and yielded median, vertically-averaged horizontal fluxes for the region of about 450 g m−2 d−1 and 2600 MP m−2 d−1, respectively. However, when data were pooled, the number of MPs normalised to sediment mass exhibited a significant inverse relationship with sediment mass, an effect attributed to the presence of ambient suspended MPs and sediment that are diluted by the suspension of soil and deposited MPs at higher wind speeds. The mechanisms of MP saltation and entrainment were not ascertained but a theoretical framework for threshold shear velocity based on regularly-shaped particles and density considerations is presented. Further experimental work is required to verify this framework, and in particular for fibrous MPs with different aerodynamic properties to soil particles. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739686","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"322","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653523004174","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc24f4097076c144aaee5","name":"Coen","lastName":"Ritsema ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"21089d78-4154-498c-9cd4-2d89b98490e9"},{"objectId":"659fc24f4097076c144aaee4","name":"Andrew","lastName":"Turner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e8d91f5-4ca8-4458-86d0-760066b4bf73"},{"objectId":"659fc24f4097076c144aaee3","name":"Abdolmajid","lastName":"Sameni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a94e61b-2b8f-4671-b6ac-a949b598e21e"},{"objectId":"659fc24f4097076c144aaee2","name":"Monireh","lastName":"Mina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ceeadad7-5db5-4328-893b-69a52385c411"},{"objectId":"659fc24f4097076c144aaee1","name":"Mahrooz","lastName":"Rezaei","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b7f13903-414e-4155-aa08-7756a862837d"},{"objectId":"659fc24f4097076c144aaee0","name":"Sajjad","lastName":"Abbasi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb4924b8-b520-4ed2-b2e6-d9fb6580beb9"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390aff","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"4FCF45750A5D33DB0E506D0634C8E83F1F567E71FDA182424BC16D3A9B7D6C806B3E751DD8DEB8A95F81EFA82B94E668B6604C0E4D9479D418440B46FFBD3060","orcidId":"0000-0001-8546-7299","documentHash":"de8bb1e3-4bc1-43e6-aba8-d51f467ca81f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138150"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dye adsorption","chitosan","Acid Red 88","adsorption kinetics","chitosan–silica hydrogel","biopolymer","adsorption equilibrium"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b3453","5e7092f8878c28a0473a02eb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evaluation of the Dye Extraction Using Designed Hydrogels for Further Applications towards Water Treatment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f0ef","mniswId":"27801","title":"Gels","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2310-2861","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3604b797-a19c-4f14-90a7-152feb5bc89d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66210d4f40970763236a5e4a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a02eb","5e7093ea878c28a0473b3453"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>In this work, novel chitosan–silica hydrogels were synthesized and investigated by various complementary techniques.

Background: Yttria-stabilized zirconia is increasingly chosen for the base of permanent prosthetic restorations. To achieve a good bond between the prosthetic cup and the veneer material, the material must be treated to achieve surface development. This is a mechanical process, during which an unfavorable transformation from the tetragonal into the monoclinic phase takes place, which leads to the weakening of the internal structure of zirconium dioxide, and later damages the prosthetic restoration. Methods: The tested material consisted of cylindrical samples of 3Y-TZP CeramillZi zirconium oxide, which were sintered after cutting out from the block. After sintering, the samples were subjected to the following types of processing: laser structuring, chemical etching and plasma etching. After the surface treatments, the samples were subjected to diffraction tests to determine the phase composition. Next, the wettability was tested to determine the surface free energy. Results: On the basis of the conducted tests, it was noticed that the applied treatments caused a phase transformation from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase. After the process of chemical etching, the range of the monoclinic phase for the sample was 5%; after plasma etching, it was 8%, and after laser structuring, it was 2%. In addition, post-surface free energy studies have shown that zirconia is wetted better with an apolar than a polar liquid. Conclusions: The obtained results indicate that the transformation was minimized with the treatments we applied; that is why they are called non-invasive methods. According to the literature data, depending on the parameters of the sandblasting process, the percentage of the monoclinic phase in the treated surfaces ranges from 22% to 52%, which confirms the above-mentioned

We find that two doubly degenerate subgap states exist for scalar impurities for all types of pairing, except for the spin-singlet s-wave state. For magnetic impurities, two or four subgap states may form depending on the order parameter symmetry. We find that the spin polarization of these states allows one to distinguish between spin-singlet and -triplet pairing; for example, only the spin-triplet states show opposite-energy subgap states with the same spin. We also calculate the quasiparticle interference patterns ssociated with the subgap states and find that they exhibit features that could distinguish between different types of pairing symmetries, especially a breaking of rotational symmetry for nodal states, which is stronger for the spin-singlet dxy and dx2 −y2 states than for the spin-triplet px and py states.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739698","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"108","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevB.108.134516","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65437fed40970749a8bf4947","name":"Cristina","lastName":"Bena","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92d15e3d-5808-45a1-a445-da6bc7763a82"},{"objectId":"65437fed40970749a8bf4946","name":"Catherine","lastName":"Pépin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ecc59fe-bd48-443d-af89-56c356e58b14"},{"objectId":"65437fed40970749a8bf4945","name":"Annica M.","lastName":"Black-Schaffer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6255b9b2-c023-481e-a8bb-2bb3bd0bda49"},{"objectId":"65437fed40970749a8bf4944","name":"Oladunjoye A.","lastName":"Awoga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"700a5e7b-e602-4c0b-9e4f-14aad0365165"},{"objectId":"65437fed40970749a8bf4943","name":"Adeline","lastName":"Crépieux","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9613387a-33a3-4f67-87bf-7a3619a8a389"},{"objectId":"65437fed40970749a8bf4942","name":"Louis","lastName":"Haurie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d6e58c0-4178-47ea-b24e-6132347769e2"},{"objectId":"65437fed40970749a8bf4941","name":"Emile","lastName":"Pangburn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f09fe7f-7ad7-4135-9971-e7c3d5b3958e"},{"objectId":"5e7094e0878c28a0473c5d7a","name":"Nicholas","lastName":"Sedlmayr","uuid":"ED7E07F043D312185C176EE0F4B3679C8429E3DA6157D38F338E9C403BD12AC5FE6B6A9B1F835A9FAC3E0C9548C8261A36F2B0F83869AD848518BA4103533D97","orcidId":"0000-0002-8166-7485","documentHash":"64ad43bb-8772-4e5b-9ea7-d904e73a4504"}],"doi":"10.1103/physrevb.108.134516"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0206"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The new high-pressure hexagonal Laves phase of the YbZn2 compound","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478447","mniswId":"10084","title":"Journal of Alloys and Compounds","doi":null,"issn":"0925-8388","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"37cda613-9b9d-4318-be81-d3f797a14da5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"641c53194097076d72c161d5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["645a1d714097076a7a4bbd81","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd82","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd83","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd84","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd85","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd86","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd87","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd88","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd89","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd8a","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd8b","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd8c","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd8d","5e7092f7878c28a0473a0206","645a1d714097076a7a4bbd8e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The new metastable high-pressure high-temperature synthesized hexagonal Laves phase compound YbZn2 was investigated.

The global coronal model COCONUT (COolfluid COronal uNstrUcTured) was originally developed to replace semi-empirical models such as the Wang-Sheeley-Arge model in space weather forecasting chains in order to improve the physical accuracy of the predictions. This model has, however, several simplifications implemented in its formulation to allow for rapid convergence in an operational setting. These simplifications include the assumptions that the plasma is fully ionised, sufficiently collisional, and that quasi-neutrality holds, so that it can be modelled as a single fluid. This means that all interactions with the low-concentration neutral fluid in the corona, such as collisions or charge exchange, are neglected.\r\n\r\nAims. In this paper, we have two goals. Firstly, we aim to introduce a novel multi-fluid global coronal model and validate it with simple cases (like a magnetic dipole) as well as with real data-driven applications. Secondly, we aim to investigate to what extent considering a single-fluid plasma in the global coronal model might affect the resulting plasma dynamics, and thus whether the assumptions on which the single-fluid coronal model is based are justified.\r\n\r\nMethods. We developed a multi-fluid global coronal model following the ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) COCONUT model, COCONUT-MF, which resolves the ion and neutral fluid equations separately. While this model is still steady-state and thus does not resolve unsteady processes, it can account for resistivity, charge exchange, and chemical (ionisation and recombination) and collisional contributions due to the presence of the neutrals in the fluid equations.\r\n\r\nResults. We present the results of the ion-neutral COCONUT-MF modelling for a magnetic dipole, a minimum of solar activity case (August 1, 2008), and a solar maximum case (March 9, 2016). Through comparison with the ideal MHD results, we confirm that the resolved multi-fluid solver features are physical and also demonstrate the higher accuracy of the applied upwind numerical flux scheme compared to the one used in the original MHD model. Subsequently, we also repeat the multi-fluid simulations while excluding the charge exchange and the chemical and collisional terms to evaluate the effect these terms have on the resulting plasma dynamics. It is observed in numerical results that, despite the very low concentration of neutrals, they still do affect the flow field to a limited but non-negligible extent (up to 5 to 10% locally), with a higher impact being seen in the case of the solar maximum. It is also demonstrated that the collisional terms are primarily responsible for the neutrals adopting the electromagnetic profiles of the ions, while the charge exchange and chemical terms yield the largest thermal effects of the neutrals on the ion plasma. Despite the fact that the coronal plasma is generally assumed to be collisionless, our results show that there is sufficient collisionality in it to couple the two fluids.\r\n\r\nConclusions. We present a novel multi-fluid global coronal model that can separately simulate the behaviour of the ion and neutral fluids. Using this model, we also show that in our set-up, in which the chromosphere is not considered and steady-state solutions are assumed, the presence of the neutrals affects the flow field, though to a limited extent. It is shown that this effect is larger when the flow field is more complex due to a higher magnetic activity. This analysis may change in the future when the global coronal model will be extended to include the lower atmospheric layers as well as terms to model coronal heating, radiation, and thermal conduction. To that end, the current model may need to be further calibrated to better represent the different layers of the atmosphere. We presume that the use of the proposed COCONUT-MF set-up will then be necessary and new numerical experiments will need to be performed in order to confirm this hypothesis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739706","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"678","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/10/aa46525-23/aa46525-23.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65aa76304097071977e4ce81","name":"Andrea","lastName":" Lani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d1523aa-477f-4d59-ac5e-f0a42575daa3"},{"objectId":"65aa76304097071977e4ce80","name":"Fan","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3585655f-ffd4-4848-84c0-e22c438dba49"},{"objectId":"65aa76304097071977e4ce7f","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Kuźma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"62b2f123-3257-4a5d-9ae3-3d4e10fa31e7"},{"objectId":"65aa76304097071977e4ce7e","name":"M.","lastName":"Brchnelova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38f9ad14-8a89-4a69-a46d-f1d539db560a"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202346525"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biocarbon","hydrothermal activation","pyrolysis","sawdust","structural characteristics."]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397cea"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of pyrolysis temperature and hydrothermal activation on structure, physicochemical, thermal and dye adsorption characteristics of the biocarbons","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775fa","mniswId":"3528","title":"ChemPhysChem","doi":null,"issn":"1439-4235","eissn":"1439-7641","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9d890aa9-b41f-4c57-91ad-3f005f815011"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ca0c6440970762634cb7d0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a0075","65ca0c6440970762634cb7d1","5e70928e878c28a047397cea"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>In this study, the possibility of using sawdust from mixed woods to obtain biocarbons in the pyrolysis and steam activation using microwave radiation as an energy source was investigated.

Investigating the early-stage evolution of an erupting flux rope from the Sun is important for understanding the mechanisms of how it loses its stability and its space-weather impact.\r\n\r\nAims. Our aim is to develop an efficient scheme for tracking the early dynamics of erupting solar flux ropes and to use the algorithm to analyse its early-stage properties. The algorithm is tested on a data-driven simulation of an eruption that took place in active region AR12473. We investigate the modelled footpoint movement and magnetic flux evolution of the flux rope and compare these with observational data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) in the 211 Å and 1600 Å channels.\r\n\r\nMethods. We used the time-dependent data-driven magnetofrictional model (TMFM) to carry out our analysis. We also performed another modelling run, where we stop the driving of the TMFM midway through the rise of the flux rope through the simulation domain and evolve it instead with a zero-beta magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach.\r\n\r\nResults. The developed algorithm successfully extracts a flux rope and its ascent through the simulation domain. We find that the movement of the modelled flux rope footpoints showcases similar trends in both the TMFM and relaxation MHD runs: the footpoints recede from their respective central location as the eruption progresses and the positive polarity footpoint region exhibits a more dynamic behaviour. The ultraviolet (UV) brightenings and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) dimmings agree well with the models in terms of their dynamics. According to our modelling results, the toroidal magnetic flux in the flux rope first rises and then decreases. In our observational analysis, we capture the descending phase of toroidal flux.\r\n\r\nConclusions.

For this reason, binary mixtures composed of arbidol hydrochloride and selected pharmaceutical excipients such as chitosan, polyvinylpyrrolione K-30 and magnesium stearate were prepared and subjected to differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry combined with Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (TGA-FTIR) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) analyses.

Additionally, a powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and an intrinsic dissolution rate study were performed for arbidol hydrochloride itself and in the presence of excipients. As a result of the study, it was revealed that arbidol hydrochloride may undergo polymorphic transformations and be incompatible with chitosan and magnesium stearate.

The physicochemical properties, morphology, and porous structure characteristics of the obtained materials were determined using low-temperature nitrogen sorption isotherms, X-ray diffraction (XRD), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and potentiometric titration measurements. The morphology and microstructure were imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The chemical characterisation of the surface chemistry of the adsorbents, which provides information about the surface-active groups, the elemental composition, and the electronic state of the elements, was carried out using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The adsorption properties of the mesoporous materials were determined using equilibrium and kinetic adsorption experiments for three selected cationic dyes (derivatives of thiazine (methylene blue) and triarylmethane (malachite green and crystal violet)). The adsorption capacity was analysed to the nanostructural and surface properties of used materials. The Generalized Langmuir equation was applied for the analysis of adsorption isotherm data. The adsorption study showed that the carbon materials have a higher sorption capacity for both methylene blue and crystal violet, e.g., 0.88–1.01 mmol/g and 0.33–0.44 mmol/g, respectively, compared to the polymer materials (e.g., 0.038–0.044 mmol/g and 0.038–0.050 mmol/g, respectively). The kinetics of dyes adsorption was closely correlated with the structural properties of the adsorbents. The kinetic data were analysed using various equations: first-order (FOE), second-order (SOE), mixed 1,2-order (MOE), multi-exponential (m-exp), and fractal-like MOE (f-MOE).</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739727","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1374","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/6/1374","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6711f395fdbe831eab26b089","name":"Szymon ","lastName":"Winter","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a3f9bed0-209f-4256-888e-ad35a1aa644f"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3453","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zienkiewicz-Strzałka","uuid":"BAD7C94BE8346F1128491D961657B49CEC0247CB901A33EF0C572B1EDD5C417AA77ECBB2E5001C305EDA9223834F999C3F511B13DFEB8AD29131943D93D9C1D5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0775-5417","documentHash":"9c86631e-2687-4353-92d1-408b4675d4c5"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ec","name":"Anna","lastName":"Deryło-Marczewska","uuid":"31DD4B3962D924B13870C1856501C9F7087C15D43C70E3B1BA51DA25D46DF02DD44484255BAE0346CD01F503D4D3D126600BC9872600002B92BD3B370B30F34B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0208-1257","documentHash":"c35e33bb-fefb-4874-af00-4ed42430f564"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02eb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Błachnio","uuid":"9E695AD6887C15E10A5BC7B76856E3747B78EC3C83F8AFDE38815EEB6CEC9580FF23DA1D2BF02240DF032CFC8DB1C9D36C4DF0C97BCE5309FB6C63EF9771E0E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-6281-9084","documentHash":"ced6f953-45ba-4712-ba96-3cfb334ed7e8"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0246","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Maciejewska","uuid":"EBE0A5423C49E0D0D55020F1AA543B1D8263F4FD40BA528A1CED4AA40A6EAC69E9672A48BDC94AF5F436CDA5725B435CB55E98BA49F1B0D054D132E21D1CC0CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3734-9965","documentHash":"8e2a4688-0346-4717-a60c-084e30371d15"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17061374"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["acid orange 8 adsorption","acid red 88 adsorption","chitosan–silica composite","orange G adsorption","adsorption kinetics"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b3453","5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ec","5e7092f8878c28a0473a02eb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis of Composite Sorbents with Chitosan and Varied Silica Phases for the Adsorption of Anionic Dyes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6645ee5f4097076263699b02","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a02eb","5e7093ea878c28a0473b3453","5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ec"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>In this work, various types of silica materials were used for the synthesis of chitosan–silica composites.

The polymer was preferentially grafted on the outer surface of silane linker-functionalized MSNs based on free radical polymerization. The successful chemical grafting of the polymer on the silica surface was confirmed by FTIR, NMR, TG, and elemental analyses. The polymer contents of the hybrid particles vary from 18 to 40 % as determined by thermogravimetric and elemental analyses. The polymer content was tailored by varying different reaction parameters including monomer concentration, linker content/type, and reaction time. Well-defined uniform core-shell structured spherical particles with an average particle size of 367 ± 25 nm and shell thickness of 29 ± 8 nm were observed in TEM analysis. According to XRD and nitrogen physisorption studies, the ordered mesopore structure of the core MCM-48-type MSNs was maintained after an extended polymer grafting process and surface coverage with a high content of polymer. No significant pore blockage was observed in porosimetry analysis. More than 75% of specific surface area, 68% of total pore volume, and the mean mesopore diameter were retained after successful grating of polymer on the outer silica surface. The pore volume thus can provide enough space to encapsulate high contents of cargo molecules for applications. The narrow pore width distribution of the main mesopores of silica determined by PALS analysis corresponds to the N2 sorption analysis and further confirms the uniformity of the mesopores. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739732","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11051-022-05666-2","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65b8d7384097073e10aa9f0d","name":"Dirk","lastName":"Enke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd78176e-c34e-4cb3-b76e-21bc2af18603"},{"objectId":"65b8d7384097073e10aa9f0c","name":"Stefan G.","lastName":"Ebbinghaus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b42101f-3324-441f-a79b-e9bf325449fe"},{"objectId":"65b8d7384097073e10aa9f0b","name":"Roger","lastName":"Gläser","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"024c8900-0283-4651-961d-96b23795004c"},{"objectId":"65b8d7384097073e10aa9f0a","name":"David","lastName":"Poppitz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e812a01-0b46-4f24-8ffe-daad9bef4bda"},{"objectId":"65b8d7384097073e10aa9f09","name":"Jörg","lastName":"Matysik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"187008a5-e425-412f-b228-236b71a37241"},{"objectId":"65b8d7384097073e10aa9f08","name":"Ahmed Gamal","lastName":"Attallah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"42a76fc6-af6b-4ed0-859c-2a3f8fe4ce76"},{"objectId":"65b8d7384097073e10aa9f07","name":"Marianne","lastName":"Wenzel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02a17995-6184-46e7-b3df-c14cdb302ba8"},{"objectId":"65b8d7384097073e10aa9f06","name":"Shewaye","lastName":"Yismaw","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de3e7211-fe23-4290-af40-2a143b2b552f"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0202","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Zaleski","uuid":"34B25F44EBD637AB52F4D593FB1469634CFB9B7042188EAB861775255F5C63D84A02BB1BF7FBBBBE58426223AC0129E744FBAA431413F8D8CD5EDB98BFE47D2B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7227-8189","documentHash":"a4dd6cc3-85b4-4b94-a544-faad3b6c3336"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11051-022-05666-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a0079"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Factors influencing the antioxidant properties of binary mixtures of quercetin and chlorogenic acid as well as quercetin and kaempferol","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775d2","mniswId":"3479","title":"Chemical Papers","doi":null,"issn":"0366-6352","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8d96c140-d000-4ca4-814e-3b8a05acb663"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6711f39ffdbe831eab26b141","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a0079"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Antioxidant properties are considered a measure of the ability of a given antioxidant or mixture to counteract or neutralize reactive oxygen species. Polyphenols commonly found in plants are compounds with antioxidant properties. The aim of the presented paper is to assess the antioxidant properties of selected polyphenolic compounds (i.e., chlorogenic acid, kaempferol and quercetin) and selected binary mixtures thereof. These properties were determined in the systems that differ not only in the contents of antioxidants but also of metal ions, hydrogen ions, water and the reaction solvents. The obtained results indicate both antagonistic and additive antioxidant effects in the tested systems, the magnitude or change of which depends on the differentiating factor used in the tests. The greatest impact on the antioxidant effect of the mixture is observed in the presence of metal and hydrogen ions in the system containing chlorogenic acid and quercetin. The relationships discussed in this paper reveal the complexity of the problem regarding the assessment of antioxidant properties, and the obtained results will develop social awareness of naturally occurring antioxidant mixtures.</jats:p>\r\n                <jats:p><jats:bold>Graphic abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739734","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"78","pagesFromTo":"6671-6684","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11696-024-03565-5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0079","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Olszowy-Tomczyk","uuid":"636D440396E59C5D7D0500BD7FA2896E6FD5F1FEC35FBD087A744714D846CC8561D50CA205CE597CC3F07A0AB87D57A1467338F360B4309228FA6BA4599DC2FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8344-8534","documentHash":"3362f244-42e0-40a7-af84-b88627c6b193"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11696-024-03565-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a04739feb0","5e709347878c28a0473a665f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis and study of the sorption potential of hydrotalcite modified biochars (LDH@BC) with respect to cerium(III) ions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775cb","mniswId":"3472","title":"Chemical Engineering Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1385-8947","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"89a565d0-e4d6-4fd9-8a85-2913c3124bf4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6711f387fdbe831eab26afa2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a665f","5e7092f5878c28a04739feb0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The innovative LDH@BC composites containing combination of metals: Zn/Al, Co/Al, Mg/Al, Ca/Al at the molar ratio 3/1 were synthesized using the co-precipitation method at constant pH. The composites were applied to remove Ce(III) ions from aqueous solutions. Batch experiments were conducted for determination of influence of solution pH, phase contact time, solution concentration and temperature. The kinetic and isotherm parameters were found using the non-linear regression method. As follows from the thermodynamic tests LDH@BC are more effective removal of Ce(III) ions at higher temperature and the sorption process is unforced and spontaneous. The leaching studies proved that 1 mol/L nitric acid is the best desorbing agent for Ce(III) ions deposited on the sorbent surface. Additionally, the composites were investigated applying the XRD and BET analyses (before sorption) as well as the ATR-FTIR, SEM-EDX, XPS methods (before and after the Ce(III) ions sorption). In summary, the introduction of hydrotalcite composed of Zn/Al, Co/Al, Mg/Al, Ca/Al as modifiers of biochar surface produced a potentially more cost-effective, and non-toxic cerium adsorbent for

Four collective coordinates are used to characterize the shape of the fissioning system: its elongation, left-right asymmetry, neck size, and nonaxiality. The potential energy landscape is computed within the macroscopic-microscopic approach, on the top of which the multidimensional Langevin equation is solved to describe the dynamics. Charge equilibration at scission and deexcitation of the primary fragments after scission are further considered. The model gives access to a wide variety of observables, including fission fragments’ mass, charge, and kinetic energy yields, fragment mean N/Z and postscission neutron multiplicities, and, importantly, their correlations. The latter are crucial to unravel the complexity of the fission process. The parameters of the model were tuned to reproduce experimental observation from thermal neutron-induced fission of 235 U, and next used to discuss the transition from the asymmetric to symmetric fission along the Fm isotopic chain."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739745","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"107","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.aps.org/prc/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevC.107.054616","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64900fb140970775642e438e","name":"Lile","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a950f12-1bcc-4abc-afb9-7fcb3f1f9df7"},{"objectId":"64900fb140970775642e438d","name":"Yong-Jing","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd7fb953-7916-4c4e-9755-2ae44d835bb1"},{"objectId":"64900fb140970775642e438c","name":"Zhi-Gang","lastName":"Xiao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b5bab5e2-b355-4fdd-9f12-f26755620918"},{"objectId":"64900fb140970775642e438b","name":"Christelle","lastName":"Schmitt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81c773fc-a6f0-4ccc-8c34-62a508b27bbf"},{"objectId":"5e7092f4878c28a04739fe61","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Pomorska","uuid":"C91F72F2CC07CB3D59E5DF0226D0F75BE1858092F925160B9BAFD93DF49DB3D8158EA9BEF13D79AEB0DE4B3F88067F0934A21CD059E4E5265C4AA172F2298082","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a709663f-99b3-4480-89c5-31de5a9599f3"},{"objectId":"5e7092f4878c28a04739fe60","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Pomorski","uuid":"7AD8CBF40CA837349769C9180E08AF91BD46A4201EC135C1AB48EEF83C570369F165E4E0EB6F2ED483AAF4E0718BD24C13FDFBA55A8AF5D094DFACBD7460292B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5557-6037","documentHash":"d339c5cd-6d01-4974-b07e-60e9f26b2f88"}],"doi":"10.1103/physrevc.107.054616"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electroreduction","methimazole","mechanism","carbimazole","zinc"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a6","5e7092f5878c28a0473a0087"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","parentUuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","rootUuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations of zinc/carbimazole and zinc/methimazole solutions were carried out to determine the effect of drugs on the hydration sphere of Zn2+ ions. It was shown that the electroreduction of Zn2+ in the presence of methimazole and carbimazole occurs in two steps and the first one determines the kinetics of the entire process. The presence of both drugs in the solution and the increase in the concentration of the supporting electrolyte reduce the degree of hydration of the depolarizer ions and the hydration of the electrode surface, what is a factor favoring the rate of electroreduction. Based on theoretical studies, the formation of stable complexes between Zn2+ and the molecules of both drugs in a solution was considered unlikely. However, active complexes can be formed between depolarizer ions and molecules adsorbed at the electrode surface. They constitute a bridge facilitating charge exchange during the electrode reaction, revealing the catalytic abilities of methimazole and carbimazole. In the range of cdrug ≤ 1 × 10−3 mol dm−3, carbimazole is a better catalyst, whereas in the range of cdrug ≥ 5 × 10−3 mol dm−3, it is methimazole. The effectiveness of both compounds in catalyzing the first stage of the electrode reaction increases with the increase in the NaClO4 concentration."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739747","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b493e6fdbe83691bc9eba1","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"29","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"dc0572d0-2da5-4b8e-ab3e-ca425607ba19"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/15/3455","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nieszporek","uuid":"CE187BADC1005F63DC0E7BA3B2A4A2BB98F060B4A50222EF56C8FF659D0A0992C8B611C779729E1EE0BD2FD8040D27DC4C32565497829CD1EE13811A4A59FF0E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4132-5499","documentHash":"dbbec7d2-d2a2-48de-9c4d-36dc2e907047"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0087","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Nieszporek","uuid":"C27B8182D7E7969BCE06972F4DA0E23E8CE4D9180043028D3B02EDD93A19C3E106132F233AE421CBF8F6615B2E528E537A3A8CF4A51F7ED41281FB0221D59319","orcidId":"0000-0001-8620-5418","documentHash":"4de6272e-9bce-458b-b87e-7c73f300a41d"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d90","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Pańczyk","uuid":"90D6997DB09C17A04ECF3311796BFF9B31C9DE33CFD8FAADE8C740B2683DB8ED48CA084D87E4709CF0C8B066B2A4EA62D9D6FF0DEF796D2453408182F37A534A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5487-119X","documentHash":"fd9d3a6f-ca1a-4fb5-bba9-ca0ea8f7ca09"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules29153455"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"66695cc54097074fa1a574ea","doi":null,"title":"Science and industry challenges and opportunities Edited by: prof. dr hab.

Its value depends not only on the mutual relations of individual compounds, but also on the presence of other components in the tested system, not only antioxidants.

This fact may disturb the ecological service of T. cordata related to the structure of its leaves, which is to provide acarodomatia (micro-shelters) for the predatory mites of the Phytoseiidae family. Phytoseiids are natural enemies of a variety of plant pests, widely applied in integrated pest management (IPM). Their occurrence is largely related to acarodomatia in which these mites hide, feed, reproduce, and develop. For the first time, the influence of PM deposition within spaces typically occupied by phytoseiids is investigated. Experimental populations of Euseius finlandicus were reared on T. cordata leaves in the progressive PM-pollution. The results showed that the values of life table parameters of the predator depended significantly on the level of PM deposition on leaves. Contrary to clean leaves from the control, the medium and high contamination intensities significantly reduced the daily (by 47% and 70%, respectively) and the total fecundity (by 62% and 77%, respectively) of females which, in turn, resulted in a decreased net reproductive rate (by 67% and 81%, respectively), intrinsic rate of increase (by 40% and 55%, respectively) and finite rate of increase (by 8% and 10%, respectively) of E. finlandicus. The pre-ovipositional period was prolonged, while the oviposition duration was shortened and the mites matured longer. In high pollution level the mortality of phytoseiids was boosted by 19% and some females were observed with pollutant lumps adhered to the idiosoma. Also, significant shares of juvenile forms (13%) and adult females (25%) made attempts to escape from highly contaminated experimental arenas. The implications of PM retention on the shelter vegetation are discussed in the context of IPM and ecological services."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739755","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-68570-w#article-info","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6731976cfdbe8303493af144","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Moniuszko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e2a0203-6637-4c52-87ad-f31d941f53f2"},{"objectId":"6731976cfdbe8303493af143","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"00401e43-edc0-4d54-9704-b047f95c2425"},{"objectId":"6731976cfdbe8303493af142","name":"Gulsamal","lastName":"Askarova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4dc19fff-96d9-4056-9136-7985fea7a8a9"},{"objectId":"6731976cfdbe8303493af141","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e32fd9f-feee-4edc-9371-de6a6d3a2045"},{"objectId":"6731976cfdbe8303493af140","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Przybysz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9506eed-f173-4114-a7b2-ea0291e3f4c1"},{"objectId":"6731976cfdbe8303493af13f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Puchalska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39b10152-f65e-49f3-bb05-05400b8e2abb"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a04739411c","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Wójcik-Gront","uuid":"5FFE1686B5FC530528EEAE738206E3CD5F50A5A6F17842B9DD50950FBBAD93996F4928207F7D0F1C405D18D8AFDB07E80114603C520A0EF98D55A6B116EB497F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7172-0529","documentHash":"683ac6af-19fa-47ba-90bd-2771602686d4"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-68570-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)","shock waves / methods: numerical","interplanetary medium"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"EUHFORIA modelling of the Sun-Earth chain of the magnetic cloud of 28 June 2013","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477233","mniswId":"1982","title":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","doi":null,"issn":"0004-6361","eissn":"1432-0746","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f677d31f-f33f-4fa2-b4f3-7cca75d47be5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e706634097076263088794","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e706634097076263088795","65e706634097076263088796","65e706634097076263088797","65e706634097076263088798","65e706634097076263088799","65e70663409707626308879a","65e70663409707626308879b","6325312975234038513dfa2b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Context. Predicting geomagnetic events starts with an understanding of the Sun-Earth chain phenomena in which (interplanetary) coronal mass ejections (CMEs) play an important role in bringing about intense geomagnetic storms. It is not always straightforward to determine the solar source of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) detected at 1 au.\r\n\r\nAims. The aim of this study is to test by a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation the chain of a series of CME events detected from L1 back to the Sun in order to determine the relationship between remote and in situ CMEs.\r\n\r\nMethods. We analysed both remote-sensing observations and in situ measurements of a well-defined magnetic cloud (MC) detected at L1 occurring on 28 June 2013. The MHD modelling is provided by the 3D MHD European Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) simulation model.\r\n\r\nResults. After computing the background solar wind, we tested the trajectories of six CMEs occurring in a time window of five days before a well-defined MC at L1 that may act as the candidate of the MC. We modelled each CME using the cone model. The test involving all the CMEs indicated that the main driver of the well-defined, long-duration MC was a slow CME. For the corresponding MC, we retrieved the arrival time and the observed proton density.\r\n\r\nConclusions.

In particular, ibuprofen and 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) were chosen as organic adsorbates. The surface of the mesoporous ordered silica phase containing free silanol groups was enriched with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane by post-synthesis functionalization. The textural properties of synthesized silica phases were evaluated by low-temperature nitrogen adsorption–desorption iso-therms, X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy as well as thermal analysis. The SBA-15 type ordered mesoporous silica functionalized with amino groups (SBA-15_NH<sub>2</sub>) was used as the highly porous adsorbent for analyzing the carrier-drug interactions and mutual affinity. The adsorption experimental data were analyzed and well-fitted using the Freundlich, Langmuir, and Temkin isotherms. Ibuprofen was better adsorbed on SBA-15 while MCPA showed greater adsorption affinity for SBA-15_NH<sub>2</sub>. The better adsorption of MCPA on the N-functionalized silica was the result of interactions (hydrogen bond formation) between SBA-15_NH<sub>2</sub> and the adsorbate molecule. The mesoporous silica phases were also tested as carbon paste electrode (CPE) modifiers. Electrochemical measurements were conducted using cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. The mechanism of the electrooxidation process was controlled by diffusion. Compared with the bare (graphite) electrode, the silica-modified elec-trodes greatly increased the oxidation peak current of MCPA and ibuprofen. The peak current was strongly correlated with the adsorptive properties of the silica modifiers. The CPE modified by amino-functionalized SBA-15 type mesoporous silica (SBA-15_NH<sub>2</sub>) showed a larger peak current and higher sensitivity for MCPA, while the CPE modified by pure silica phase electrode was much more appropriate for the detection of ibuprofen.</p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739759","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"312","pagesFromTo":"39-49","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375597412_Effect_of_the_SBA-15_N-functionalization_on_the_adsorption_of_organic_contaminants","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ca0c4740970762634cb4dd","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Świątkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6215805-5c6d-4cd5-90ad-c1cd1bed05b5"},{"objectId":"65ca0c4740970762634cb4db","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kuśmierek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"01e68b8c-3429-4361-a523-57091470082d"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3453","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zienkiewicz-Strzałka","uuid":"BAD7C94BE8346F1128491D961657B49CEC0247CB901A33EF0C572B1EDD5C417AA77ECBB2E5001C305EDA9223834F999C3F511B13DFEB8AD29131943D93D9C1D5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0775-5417","documentHash":"9c86631e-2687-4353-92d1-408b4675d4c5"},{"objectId":"5e70938f878c28a0473accd9","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Skrzypczyńska","uuid":"3BDEB2ABCAACB4116AE32CC963A286A588E1219BB0BA92414621F0881E8C9CAC4D1B7D085FAE13D63C5326A21FD2600DB3349FF16B29D783E26499AC77268CFD","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51e2d07b-a130-457f-a2fe-24456016bf88"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ec","name":"Anna","lastName":"Deryło-Marczewska","uuid":"31DD4B3962D924B13870C1856501C9F7087C15D43C70E3B1BA51DA25D46DF02DD44484255BAE0346CD01F503D4D3D126600BC9872600002B92BD3B370B30F34B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0208-1257","documentHash":"c35e33bb-fefb-4874-af00-4ed42430f564"}],"doi":"10.5004/dwt.2023.29947"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["metody oceny wód"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65269a5b4097075dd4eb7609","doi":null,"title":"Funkcjonowanie i ochrona wód płynących","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7867-868-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://repo.pw.edu.pl/info/book/WUT4a93b0c0dfbf4921ac520d9b5beaf6be/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"5fa92c10-58d7-4d7e-a040-74847f9ec726","publisher":{"objectId":"607feeff2467f04cc92959fd","mniswId":"79200","name":"Wydawnictwo volumina.pl Daniel Krzanowski","documentHash":"aab2b16f-0d43-428f-9ff5-112a2fb73556"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Niemonitorowane a jednak ocenione części wód","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cb336d40970762635849c1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65cb336d40970762635849c2","5e7092f2878c28a04739fb2a","65cb336d40970762635849c3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Ramowa Dyrektywa Wodna (RDW) określa szczegółowo, w jaki sposób należy przypisywać stan każdemu zidentyfikowanemu typowi jednolitej części wód poprzez monitorowanie różnych elementów biologicznych i fizykochemicznych.

The concentrations [Bq/kg] of radionuclides (40K, 137Cs, 226Ra, 210Pb and 228Th) in tea leaves before and after brewing were measured using γ-ray spectrometry with high-purity germanium (HPGe). The concentrations [mg/kg] of the studied elements (Fe, Cr, Cu, Mo, Al, Mn, Ni, P, V, Cd and Pb) were determined using a microwave-induced plasma optical emission spectrometer (MIP-OES). The results presented here will help to expand the database of heavy metals and radioactivity in teas. With regard to the potential health risk, the percentage of leaching of individual elements in different types of tea infusions was determined, and the assessment of the consumption risk was estimated. Since the calculated exposure factors, namely the HQ (Hazard Quotient) and THQ (Target Hazard Quotient), do not exceed critical levels, teas can still be considered health-beneficial products (most of the radionuclides as well as elements remain in the leaves (65–80%) after brewing)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739764","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/5/742","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6711f3f8fdbe831eab26d0dd","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Ronda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba152aa4-eaf5-4d77-9ff1-ccfbec6bb011"},{"objectId":"6711f3f8fdbe831eab26d0dc","name":"Bartłomiej Michał ","lastName":"Cieślik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9d84f62d-855f-4528-92a3-195834de884f"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af205","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Orzeł","uuid":"A4127EB101831B04F731C63FBFD30987EF96E04E85B4A18B58C7008E7D83B103E17F4B0C06E49413682BE2B999169D79540D394CE85D6374EC693B23DA7FCD44","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08e01a08-112f-4651-ac56-dc4f2edb9b44"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00b2","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Grządka","uuid":"F29410F394B82CD762B1770FAD9457802019DC3A5D6F58D7E12DCA614F0AE5ABB10A70C8A2B8D5C40E753B732719906417FB36E7B14A9B058DC85D9593916575","orcidId":"0000-0003-2037-6227","documentHash":"e04455f2-0569-4f1e-b193-3f16368bd757"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods13050742"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["uranium","stripping analysis","determination","solid lead–tin microelectrode"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Novel Eco-Friendly and Highly Sensitive Solid Lead–Tin Microelectrode for Trace U(VI) Determination in Natural Water Samples","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"Sensors","doi":null,"issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-3210","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"80ff8bca-a845-44fd-adcb-a436c0342b72"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"642d19544097075f2145f979","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70935e878c28a0473a84ff","5e7092f5878c28a0473a0092"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>For the first time a solid state lead–tin microelectrode (diameter ϕ 25 µm) was utilized for U(VI) ion determination by adsorptive stripping voltammetry. The described sensor is characterized by high durability, reusability and eco-friendly features, as the need for using lead and tin ions for metal film preplating has been eliminated, and consequently, the amount of toxic waste has been limited. The advantages of the developed procedure resulted also from the utilization of a microelectrode as a working electrode, because a restricted amount of metals is needed for its construction. Moreover, field analysis is possible to perform thanks to the fact that measurements can be carried out from unmixed solutions. The analytical procedure was optimized. The proposed procedure is characterized by two orders of magnitude linear dynamic range of U(VI) determination from 1 × 10−9 to 1 × 10−7 mol L−1 (120 s of accumulation). The detection limit was calculated to be 3.9 × 10−10 mol L−1 (accumulation time of 120 s). RSD% calculated from seven subsequent U(VI) determinations at a concentration of 2 × 10−8 mol L−1 was 3.5%.

study presents the preparation and flammability characteristics of polymeric composites based on the epoxy resin Epidian® 601. The triethylenetetramine (TETA) and commercial curing agents based on polyamines (IDA and PAC) were used as crosslinking compounds. Moreover, two flame retardant compounds were added to this composition, the commercial Fire Retardant (FR) and triphenyl phosphate (TP). The chemical structure of the composites and the course of curing processes were confirmed by the ATR/FT-IR (Attenuated Total Reflection-Fourier Transform Infrared) analysis. The influence of different amounts of FR or TP on the flammability and thermal resistance was discussed in detail. After the flammability test the samples were also studied to assess their thermal destruction. In addition, the composites were subjected to the swelling tests, solvent resistance, and microscopic observations. The DSC curves revealed that all materials were characterized by good thermal properties. All materials were temperature resistant up to 300°C. Furthermore, the measurements of the hardness of the composite demonstrated that the material EP601 + TETA + 10%FR is the hardest. The addition of FR and RP influenced the flammability of the composites increasing the thermal resistance. The ageing tests in methanol, acetone, hydrochloric acid, and potassium hydroxide were also carried out. © 2023 IUPAC &amp; De Gruyter.

But still there is a gap in \r\nthe literature for research on novel catalysts and their properties modifications devoted to strategies to \r\nreduce deactivation of the catalysts caused by the coke formation. In the present work a series of \r\nhydroxyapatite supported nickel catalysts promoted by alkali metals (Li, Na, K and Cs) were tested. \r\nThe surface and structural properties of the catalysts were well characterized by physicochemical \r\nmethods. Activity and selectivity were measured at 600 oC for 20 hours’ time-on-stream test. Resistance \r\nto coking was measured with Magnetic Suspension Balance. The stability of the catalyst was improved \r\nby the addition of promoters, which reduced the rate of coking. In particular, the cesium-promoted \r\nNi/HAp catalyst significantly inhibited coke deposition, while slightly reducing methane conversion \r\nand selectivity to hydrogen."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739772","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a009c","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Cichy","uuid":"451213A0428EC877A08C92FCB673EEC49EBEBA6D0EA2EC9B7F57381F53253464AC0E37F6036A14A9192BDF5B384858AFDA5F4E47214A0A3910AE16E946DFF40E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7217-2758","documentHash":"87fba201-d207-469a-92a1-44044afb9957"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0099","name":"Witold","lastName":"Zawadzki","uuid":"CF9199089076931682833973A2F4A05F991520714245FCDCF2C00FFD7C85B5B6E3A9BBDF3BDC877F9B4C242DB44C9ABD9B6230D30AC9BF4B981ACACAF1B8240F","orcidId":"0000-0002-4180-5791","documentHash":"1553821f-7dfe-4c91-a52b-27bdd6d6b054"}],"doi":"10.37190/ppmp/182856"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"66695cc54097074fa1a574ea","doi":null,"title":"Science and industry challenges and opportunities Edited by: prof. dr hab.

modeling of expanding plasmas is crucial for understanding the dynamics and evolution of various astrophysical plasma systems such as the solar and stellar winds. In this context, the Expanding Box Model (EBM) provides a valuable framework to mimic plasma expansion in a non-inertial reference frame, co-moving with the expansion but in a box with a fixed volume, which is especially useful for numerical simulations. Here, fundamentally based on the Vlasov equation for magnetized plasmas and the EBM formalism for coordinates transformations, for the first time, we develop a first principles description of radially expanding plasmas in the EB frame. From this approach, we aim to fill the gap between simulations and theory at microscopic scales to model plasma expansion at the kinetic level. Our results show that expansion introduces non-trivial changes in the Vlasov equation (in the EB frame), especially affecting its conservative form through non-inertial forces purely related to the expansion. In order to test the consistency of the equations, we also provide integral moments of the modified Vlasov equation, obtaining the related expanding moments (i.e., continuity, momentum, and energy equations). Comparing our results with the literature, we obtain the same fluids equations (ideal-MHD), but starting from a first principles approach. We also obtained the tensorial form of the energy/pressure equation in the EB frame. These results show the consistency between the kinetic and MHD descriptions. Thus, the expanding Vlasov kinetic theory provides a novel framework to explore plasma physics at both micro and macroscopic scales in complex astrophysical scenarios."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739785","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/9/10/448","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65aa6ee74097071977e4c6b1","name":"Marian","lastName":"Lazar ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f1c3b115-7e33-4b1d-83c1-39163bb5f316"},{"objectId":"65aa6ee74097071977e4c6b0","name":"Pablo S.","lastName":"Moya","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a256e88b-7a05-431a-94bc-96d416f3a55e"},{"objectId":"65aa6ee74097071977e4c6af","name":"Sebastián","lastName":"Echeverría-Veas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b197e82-f031-4e66-b7f6-9df9d8638448"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.3390/universe9100448"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["świeżo tłoczony sok marchwiowy","zimna plazma","stabilność mikrobiologiczna","wartości odżywcze","stabilność koloidalna","potencjał dzeta"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"WPŁYW OBRÓBKI ZIMNĄ PLAZMĄ ATMOSFERYCZNĄ NA JAKOŚĆ ŚWIEŻEGO SOKU TŁOCZONEGO Z MARCHWI","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b57","mniswId":"27301","title":"Żywność.

Simulation results indicate that the Janus hairy particles trapped in the interface region have different configurations characterized by the vertical displacement distance, the orientation of the Janus line relative to the interface, and the particle shape. The Janus hairy particles present abundant morphologies, including dumbbell-like and typical core–shell, at the interface. The shape of adsorbed particles is analyzed in detail.

Thus, this paper presents the results of research on the synthesis of eco-friendly composites and their properties. For their preparation, unsaturated polyester resin based on post-consumer recycled poly (ethylene terephthalate) was filled with walnut (Júglans régia L.) shell powder. After the filler incorporation, the deterioration of gloss and mechanical properties were observed. The flexural strength and modulus are significantly affected by the filler amount. Distilled water, 1% sodium hydroxide, toluene, and acetone were used as solvents in the chemical resistance test. Changes to the structure and properties of composites after 49 days of immersion in solvents were investigated. The immersion in water has no significant effect on the pure resin, but for its composites, the plasticizing effect of water was observed. The results show that all specimens show resistance toward toluene. In acetone, the resin and its composite shrink and fall into pieces, but the most destructive is an alkaline environment. After the immersion test, a huge increase in mass and a deterioration of gloss and mechanical properties were observed.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739801","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"4389","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/15/22/4389","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a66b8","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Pączkowski","uuid":"05035E8110F71DA2DC226BA1854573E0314E23FBCEB6344FFD9EF29F28F04330D10CED55974F14B2FB95E1EC14EEA9406BB0E7304B753434BDB1C7164207076B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1704-1648","documentHash":"32f553f0-6d16-42eb-91be-acf1d2235b21"}],"doi":"10.3390/polym15224389"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"649c20c24097071386c52c16","doi":null,"title":"Nauka i przemysł - metody spektroskopowe w praktyce, nowe wyzwania i możliwości","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-227-9700-6","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://bazawiedzy.umcs.pl/info/book/UMCSbda2ca3b628b480791bc95e8127ecc83/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"cc7ab50e-f734-4b00-a588-b4fced87fbbf","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8f4","mniswId":"59500","name":"Uniwersytet Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej w Lublinie","documentHash":"d938889a-f872-4771-bf34-8062ee136ee9"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Adsorpcja niesteroidowych leków przeciwzapalnych na kompozytach alginianowo – węglowych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"656880aa40970749a8d286a2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709349878c28a0473a66bb","5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ec"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060739803","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"394-397","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bazawiedzy.umcs.pl/info/article/UMCSecaac594a47f4b2b84d67a0ed23d8c11/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a66bb","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wasilewska","uuid":"9E5DC40DC643ACB82A7C1FE20E7B15DE359AD548B051E8945570E1358DC224F4CCC4CE971487BBDE50AA53C1EA688FC74DC9CD9AD907366357E6C536F98DB131","orcidId":"0000-0001-5747-1178","documentHash":"e62cb234-a1e6-4930-9d80-b591dfedd917"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ec","name":"Anna","lastName":"Deryło-Marczewska","uuid":"31DD4B3962D924B13870C1856501C9F7087C15D43C70E3B1BA51DA25D46DF02DD44484255BAE0346CD01F503D4D3D126600BC9872600002B92BD3B370B30F34B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0208-1257","documentHash":"c35e33bb-fefb-4874-af00-4ed42430f564"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64a933b34097075481552605","doi":null,"title":"Nauka i przemysł - lubelskie spotkania studenckie.

Jednakże brakuje pełnych danych \r\nna temat właściwości fizykochemicznych tej substancji aktywnej jak i jej preparatów\r\nz różnymi substancjami pomocniczymi. Z tego względu celowe było przeprowadzenie \r\nbadań fizykochemicznych dla chlorowodorku arbidolu, a także badań tej substancji po \r\nzmieszaniu z substancjami pomocniczymi. Na ogół badania fizykochemiczne przepro\u0002wadza się z zastosowaniem metod spektroskopowych (spektroskopia w podczerwieni\r\nz transformacją Fouriera – FTIR, spektroskopia Ramana) i metod termicznych \r\n(różnicowa kalorymetria skaningowa – DSC, analiza termograwimetryczna – TGA) oraz\r\nstosuje się metody termiczne sprzężone ze spektroskopowymi, np. termograwimetria \r\nsprzężona z podczerwienią z transformacją Fouriera (TG-FTIR). Interpretacja widm \r\nspektroskopowych (FTIR i Ramana) badanych mieszanin oparta jest na porównaniu\r\nz widmami składników. Jeżeli w widmach mieszanin brak jest charakterystycznych \r\npasm pochodzących od substancji aktywnej lub nastąpiła zmiana ich intensywności czy \r\nich poszerzenie, a także gdy pojawiły się nowe pasma nie należące do składników, \r\nmożna wówczas przypuszczać, że doszło do zmian w strukturze substancji aktywnej. \r\nPonadto, bardzo często dochodzi do nakładania się pasm składników mieszaniny, co \r\nutrudnia interpretację widm mieszanin. Z reguły w takich przypadkach stosuje się \r\nmetody chemometryczne. Natomiast do potwierdzenia wyników spektroskopowych \r\nwykorzystuje się metody termiczne, najczęściej DSC. Bardzo przydatne jest też\r\nzastosowanie metod sprzężonych TG-FTIR, w przypadku których uzyskuje się \r\ninformacje o produktach rozkładu składników i mieszanin.

The natural sorbent Nitrolite was impregnated with Aliquat 336 using a new warm impregnation method. After the impregnation process, Nitrolite adsorbed platinum(IV), palladium(II), and gold(III) ions from the chloride solutions. The values of the sorption capacity for palladium(II) and platinum(IV) ions were 47.63 mg/g and 51.39 mg/g, respectively, from the 0.1 M HCl model solution. The sorption capacity for gold(III) ions was estimated to be 73.43 mg/g from the 0.1 M HCl model solution.

The properties of tooth enamel (color, contact angles, surface roughness, surface topography, elemental composition) were examined before (control) and after the plasma treatment. As shown by the results, the plasma treatment time is a key parameter that can induce desired features, such as whitening or improved wettability. However, with prolonged plasma treatment (20 min), the enamel surface may be permanently damaged. The cold-plasma-treated samples were characterized by a higher value of the brightness L* parameter and thus a lighter color, compared to the CAP-untreated teeth. It was also evidenced that the plasma treatment increased the hydrophilicity of tooth surfaces, and the contact angles effectively decreased with the time of the CAP treatment. The tooth surface also became much more heterogeneous and rough with much greater amplitudes in heights. The surface of the primary teeth after the CAP treatment lost its homogeneity, as evidenced by the SEM micrographs. The analysis of the elemental composition revealed only minor changes after the plasma process, which may suggest that the observed morphological changes in the enamel surface are mainly physical and are not a consequence of chemical reactions between the enamel and the reactive components of the cold plasma. Plasma treatment of teeth opens up new possibilities of using this method as an alternative to whitening or pre-treatment before other dental procedures.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739813","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"5173","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/21/5173","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e29b","name":"Nobuya","lastName":"Hayashi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11b3295d-12aa-4524-95a4-d6d0ef849f09"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e29a","name":"Tomoyuki","lastName":"Murakami","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3719ad07-785f-4c25-96dd-abdfe381a813"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e299","name":"Narumol","lastName":"Matsuyama","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ebbc6c0d-c267-4522-85e5-8973f116bc3f"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e298","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Mazur-Lesz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e49abd85-e777-444a-90b4-3529e11deb00"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e297","name":"Monika","lastName":"Machoy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3feb2bcc-e202-46f7-8509-5a8f26a240c2"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e296","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Zarzeczny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c30477a2-572a-4542-81e7-b1c5364e5e88"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e295","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Terebun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ee07f23-25cc-43d3-b18c-669b0043ba13"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e294","name":"Marta","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f1892aae-5287-4ddf-8445-a07fc6e33abe"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e293","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Starek-Wójcicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"45344a43-66af-4d08-80f4-2a0595c82633"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e292","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pawlat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57a4a1e3-3ffc-4bf4-9cdc-509298cca9e5"},{"objectId":"67c6e2fafdbe830b4ec3e291","name":"Michał ","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95516ad3-3ceb-4839-ac1a-6c25eba455ba"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00b2","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Grządka","uuid":"F29410F394B82CD762B1770FAD9457802019DC3A5D6F58D7E12DCA614F0AE5ABB10A70C8A2B8D5C40E753B732719906417FB36E7B14A9B058DC85D9593916575","orcidId":"0000-0003-2037-6227","documentHash":"e04455f2-0569-4f1e-b193-3f16368bd757"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17215173"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["micellization process","thermodynamic functions","sugar-based surfactant","temperature effect"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Thermodynamic Studies of the Micellar Properties of a Surfactant Used for Membrane Protein Solubilization and Stabilization","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ca0c5340970762634cb5f7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0242"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>The effect of temperature on the micellar properties of the alkylglucoside surfactant n-octyl-β-D-thioglucopyranoside (OTG) used for membrane protein solubilization has been investigated.

Basing on the obtained results it is stated that critical micelle concentration of OTG is much lower compared to that of the earlier studied n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (OGP). The standard Gibbs free energy changes indicate that the tendency of OTG molecules to form aggregates increases with temperature increase. However, this increase is not so evident as in the case of some other sugar-based surfactants. The small temperature effect on the aggregation properties of OTG in water is probably connected with the presence and strength of the hydrogen bonds between the water molecules and sugar units, or the type of linkage between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of the studied surfactant. In addition, the presence of S-linkage in the OTG molecule despite its high enzymatic stability also causes the hydrophobicity increase of the studied surfactant (compared to OGP), which directly influences its micellization process.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739815","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/8/6618","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0242","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":"8DE9C1FD538F2B2CAF5386CDE9B6FD6B4EC39F5C0AB8B01495279A1CED3350C2FE1FDD7D09013AB05CBD7383F11905E040A28D7C7BE00622728AA07EC6FB6850","orcidId":"0000-0003-0668-133X","documentHash":"9eabb4c2-3c9c-4f68-97b7-267820383955"}],"doi":"10.3390/su15086618"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67a4e65bfdbe8362a56bccdb","5e709327878c28a0473a3c26","5e7092ea878c28a04739f178","5e709328878c28a0473a3f1a","5e70946c878c28a0473bca53"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ag-In-Zn-S alloyed nanocrystals as photocatalysts of controlled light-mediated radical polymerization","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775c6","mniswId":"3467","title":"Chemical Communications","doi":null,"issn":"1359-7345","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7be9b09c-cd53-490b-8f13-759541d1ecd1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66fe6219fdbe8364a4027339","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67a4e65bfdbe8362a56bccdb","5e7092ea878c28a04739f178","67a4e65bfdbe8362a56bccdc","5e70946c878c28a0473bca53","5e709327878c28a0473a3c26","67a4e65bfdbe8362a56bccdd","5e709328878c28a0473a3f1a"]},"issue":"32","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We report on the first case of the use of nonstoichiometric ternary (Ag–In–Zn–S) semiconductor nanocrystals as photoinitiators and photocatalysts of methyl methacrylate (MMA) polymerization.

Heliospheric MHD models typically use spheromaks to represent the magnetic structure of CMEs. However, when inserted into the ambient interplanetary magnetic field, spheromaks can experience a phenomenon reminiscent of the condition known as the \"spheromak tilting instability,\" causing its magnetic axis to rotate. From the perspective of space weather forecasting, it is crucial to understand the effect of this rotation on predicting Bz at 1 au while implementing the spheromak model for realistic event studies. In this work, we study this by modeling a CME event on 2013 April 11 using the European Heliospheric Forecasting Information Asset. Our results show that a significant spheromak rotation up to 90° has occurred by the time it reaches 1 au, while the majority of this rotation occurs below 0.3 au. This total rotation resulted in poor predicted magnetic field topology of the ICME at 1 au. To address this issue, we further investigated the influence of spheromak density on mitigating rotation. The results show that the spheromak rotation is less for higher densities. Importantly, we observe a substantial reduction in the uncertainties associated with predicting Bz when there is minimal spheromak rotation. Therefore, we conclude that spheromak rotation adversely affects Bz prediction in the analyzed event, emphasizing the need for caution when employing spheromaks in global MHD models for space weather forecasting."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739820","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"270","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad0df4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65afad2f409707197781695e","name":"Anwesha","lastName":"Maharana","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba01f306-e67e-429d-b1f2-c8b11dc178af"},{"objectId":"65afad2f409707197781695d","name":"Nicolas","lastName":"Wijsen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f61e566-1d0d-46ce-b28b-23b42f0c9513"},{"objectId":"65afad2f409707197781695c","name":"Eleanna","lastName":"Asvestari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a2172f3-ca84-4ad4-b740-1e44e89bc553"},{"objectId":"65afad2f409707197781695b","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Kilpua","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db109995-0df6-4a38-94a7-09e96db2b04c"},{"objectId":"65afad2f409707197781695a","name":"J.","lastName":"Pomoell","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14bc5146-d422-41ed-87ea-8854e24e1268"},{"objectId":"65afad2f4097071977816959","name":" Ranadeep","lastName":"Sarkar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"787e2878-6299-45bc-b1ae-bb253ebc67ce"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.3847/1538-4365/ad0df4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PET","Nanoplastic","Surface","Degradation","ReaxFF","Molecular dynamics"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Surface chemistry of degraded polyethylene terephthalate (PET): Insights from reactive molecular dynamics study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477156","mniswId":"1525","title":"Applied Surface Science","doi":null,"issn":"0169-4332","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6b1a871d-474e-41fa-bd55-783bef013932"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6645ee884097076263699fd5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a6","6711f3b7fdbe831eab26bd16","6711f3b7fdbe831eab26bd17"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) samples were analyzed using reactive molecular dynamics simulations.

Material properties, such as density, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio, were determined through stress–strain curve analysis. These results aligned well with experimental data. The PET samples were subjected to mechanical cleaving by applying external forces to generate PET surfaces. These surfaces were further investigated to assess their chemical composition and the quantity and types of radical ends formed on them. Benzene radicals and dioxolane residues were the most abundant species identified on these surfaces. In addition, the samples underwent shock compression to induce more extensive chemical transformations, resembling naturally degraded nanoplastics. This led to the discovery of various crosslink connections within the bulk material, with many appearing as new chemical linkages or radicals on the surfaces. Notably, there was a significant production of carbon dioxide observed during both the mechanical cleaving and shock compression of PET samples. An important conclusion is that the chemically degraded PET surfaces are significantly different from the original material."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739822","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"654","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016943322400206X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6711f3b7fdbe831eab26bd17","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Wolski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f6e52e7-464a-4426-9007-ec1b7e81ea2f"},{"objectId":"6711f3b7fdbe831eab26bd16","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Panczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f3782b8-4456-40c9-b08e-b6aae05e4654"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nieszporek","uuid":"CE187BADC1005F63DC0E7BA3B2A4A2BB98F060B4A50222EF56C8FF659D0A0992C8B611C779729E1EE0BD2FD8040D27DC4C32565497829CD1EE13811A4A59FF0E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4132-5499","documentHash":"dbbec7d2-d2a2-48de-9c4d-36dc2e907047"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apsusc.2024.159493"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bio-based polymers","phenols","porous polymers","SPE","ibuprofen","aspirin","vegetable oils","paracetamol","terpenes and terpenoids","salicylic acid."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0247"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"New Bio-Based Polymer Sorbents out of Terpene Compounds or Vegetable Oils: Synthesis, Properties, Analysis of Sorption Processes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479331","mniswId":"16369","title":"Polymers","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2073-4360","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5c4f8b81-6463-4e5b-8c64-d1384b8f9293"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63b6c3124097076214e5ce43","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0247"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This research presents a synthesis and characterization of new bio-based polymer sorbents.

Tests of sorption ability were carried out by a dynamic solid phase extraction method using a mixture of four phenols or single-component pharmaceutical solutions (salicylic acid, aspirin, ibuprofen, paracetamol, and ampicillin). The performed studies revealed that the terpene-based polymers possessed betterdeveloped porous structures (420–500 m2/g) with more uniform pores than oil-based ones. However,the surface of the oil-based sorbents was more acidic in nature. The sorption tests showed that both the porosity and acidity of the surface significantly influenced the sorption. Recoveries of up to 90% were obtained for 2,4 dichlorophenol from C-DVB, L-DVB, and Ro-DVB. The lowest affinity to the\r\npolymers exhibited phenol (5–45%), aspirin (1–7%), and ampicillin (1–7%).

In recent years, the production and use of surfactants have been steadily increasing, so that their concentration in environmental water samples is rising. At the same time, it is known that organic compounds, such as surfactants, often hinder the voltammetric determination of trace elements by stripping. Non-ionic (Triton X-100, Brij 35, Tween 20, Tween 60, Tween 80), cationic (CTAB, CTAC, DTAB, HPC) and anionic (DSS, SDS) compounds were selected to investigate the effect of surfactants on the voltammetric signal of cadmium. At the same time, the extent to which the addition of Amberlite resins to the analysed solution eliminates the interfering effect of surfactants was tested. Three types of Amberlite resins XAD-2, XAD-7 and XAD-16 were selected for the study and the ratio of resin weight to solution volume was determined. Finally, the determination of cadmium in surfactant-enriched environmental samples was carried out. The recoveries obtained between 95.5 and 107%, with RSD between 3.4 and 6.2%, confirm the validity and correctness of the proposed procedure All measurements were carried out by anodic stripping voltammetry using a CNTs/SGC electrode modified with a bismuth film as the working electrode.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739828","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"59","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.journalssystem.com/ppmp/Investigation-and-elimination-of-surfactant-induced-interferences-in-anodic-stripping,170717,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657043944097071b8e60bf29","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wawruch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e2e2022f-09cb-4384-a5ca-2b4aa6d5ff68"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0091","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Grabarczyk","uuid":"B24CA952A822B53951AFA8FB42C4AAAA19C20217D30BF175CB1E27B117BD67A558DBEB2697443412DDCA9B076AF269484D2A19009FEE5C2DFAC78A6079BE7DF1","orcidId":"0000-0002-0952-050X","documentHash":"f05882f9-1693-420a-8371-c9cbefccea17"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a008a","name":"Cecylia","lastName":"Wardak","uuid":"FAD5C85E74559A5682EC839BE79E9A9C43796401C2AA1D76F5A22B8C1852B07390DFB1E5F62AC42BDF54E1B97DBCDFDD7AE929E7F96EC24884C71CD14953A1E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5785-3237","documentHash":"255fb411-39fb-4d18-8922-59568baed0b2"}],"doi":"10.37190/ppmp/170717"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Instability of Langmuir-beam waves: Kappa-distributed electrons","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547927f","mniswId":"16119","title":"Physics of Plasmas","doi":null,"issn":"1070-664X","eissn":"1089-7674","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"bcb5eafe-02f4-45b9-abc7-91146d086654"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65aa714e4097071977e4c6b8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65aa714e4097071977e4c6b9","65aa714e4097071977e4c6ba","6325312975234038513dfa2b","65aa714e4097071977e4c6bb"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In space plasmas, electron populations exhibit non-equilibrium velocity distributions with high-energy tails that are reproduced by the Kappa power-laws and contrast with the Maxwellian distributions often used in theoretical and numerical analyses. In this work, we investigate typical electron beam-plasma systems and show the influence of Kappa tails on the linear dispersion and stability spectra of Langmuir-beam waves. The most common scenarios invoke instabilities of Langmuir waves at the origin of radio emissions in solar flares and interplanetary shocks. However, the parametric domain of these instabilities is narrow (i.e., energetic beams but with very low density, n b / n e ≲ 10 − 3 ), making their analytical and numerical characterization not straightforward, while the approximations used may lead to inconclusive results. Here, we provide exact numerical solutions of the Langmuir-beam mode, which distinguish from the classical ones (unaffected by the beam), and also from electron beam modes destabilized by more energetic and/or denser beams. Langmuir-beam solutions are only slightly modified by the Kappa distribution of the beam component, due to its very low density. However, if the main (core) population is Kappa distributed, the instability of the Langmuir-beam mode is strongly inhibited, if not suppressed. New analytical solutions are derived taking into account the more or less resonant involvement of the electron core and beam populations. As a result, the analytical solutions show an improved match with the exact solutions, making them applicable in advanced modeling of weak (weakly nonlinear) turbulence. © 2023 Author(s)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739832","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://watermark.silverchair.com/082106_1_5.0159486.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAABYgwggWEBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggV1MIIFcQIBADCCBWoGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMq9PUDMnUY2Bdtp7VAgEQgIIFO661jKIofVt9FwG_lL6cZrH8u5WFvH8O5BrO3wNlwVI8u-FULl98yJxQf1-Xg7zmvJFFe7uIR7jp6EwbzqFECqfiDDtCexrVQBzVwJAGddUJ9c-kv0xthJTgXGb0xqG72esXENFEKy_jkr9KjaiSAFZqT1bLPJ5aYBgp8WT0vvgy7iSV9rSoPm9s036XNjOwV9EKibsGxlCrYMPGGwmNb7ahl7MWJJmXE1I2_0HWnRtOHftDwQlZYIR1ceFWys5iYtpZCP2loQsd7pm0mMDGVt918QcfWtGSW3RcojdgCL9baOKgNy9OgK0Ev5_Q9TTDowWSJS4s22OnDiwOCFF0XqtAjPqVbIstirzBjpiSu14uRm2WJ1AyhFibQew6f_ywUveDH_L3Ie4X_U2DoIZg1qotqe0M9jSfJZ5MgPXlJ83cj9eTfmfzJ7W3AzH0JZgSmO2wEKmnj7o8ToTYci3_USvHpkiGYRI-rRJEF3zJo7G12ErAyKIHK_PhvZtfjIFDFNIZdrKI1C7BCg50hZsYKQkTDjU2Z0sh9Swt1v5qrdni9anBdREVOQml70w78lMuBLonuoMg63fJ9YijryhCK89rbiXfK_WvwQpSqTcc_qEBK9vVcUnFHyZjAbx5uvP2OF-nyWnCStW1w6rdq2hcOPKTrUfoOmNNxi8fljuMwFsA0fWKuZV6RhQ38gY2DgmnaI89ZnlB-NI9TpK1yUDJBAFdDM8Vzi8hoAinPFKGkJ73P0c4GVaSUaO_gN3nTatwLv3eSpv-lGz8DKXTawfGG5-JDQSlLOtgiDsUiEpxlMoJXV_ye2IMQKyfJZWYLhVaNPrFzGBBMYxcGrOUhRMN3tCaxWsKgfD3F7LDCRqjmBzBTJnbxqw9mlvd75BQemqlbUEvaEdlWq9SBw0zuuHfpGfyB0aUidR8qSWUSKj4R289Ywp1sE-BDSAdeqLb6nzTQSt1204slBOqQ8U99_8l9SWqT4IOro3ZZt4sT5RfGdF2QGKUDkgpJg4RDsNB7BlXLD0KYAdVg1r6QtUQsJdQudnVTk_JOcZd8xLJ8OiPUCe2UvSqxgroCRR3oibLhbBvEznwLFUhv6qyRnnO1G0szkk1iwL-d-23SmIco11sXbUVH4VeNKfQZteDieurhMDss4Is6gv4H_f5-ykHdIe94o9Of_oLYKRcmNrirVLiMGsCTyDxaDUJ7fOU_hpjmE521OzyJkKYS__ps_MbNgu_H8G9LXd-CYqcKVpe28KkUYa8OwfYltPG07l0-UnrfXTSiHhxK-Lq9bihs2QN8fRp_YeIZXIeoRZDcwW5pr8e6Q7BSXiBNSrktM6C4xiJDzogugTfgKVGlywen4zQbEMf5pSv-iZFBVtDQNmk0St-Ju9CHWb0a7xVvs0ZBcVqX5E-kwO2dKJaNiShjfjtzeggYjuagLdWST6_ak6uxTFJZt3ch2s8khbE9vG4w8yXthSpMqx1oboz6iMGJ2g_XqekSeeI5_FXyUfx6cpJMZDUzZZ4eRAWY1jSglFHsYhbYqQXXkn2rpiiXtzfkpdVMNT_rXotB58DH192V0BvX7LauUHTef7xfNkDyRggIaeSTiql8Qx_q8698jNhbHUeNOv3aUlYzvQ1hh_pEFKkR4Ja187WFeZfZFr2INqY8R2ivGoyyybcT9ODG3QRAytrcgJShB2EdxplRGwq0Zq4EQitwbKvboC8_bFcxXYhFeaHReTItqCBfZJ6Ete6Hi_5CkpqX3pj_hXaANO8BqKLtplGuR_CFwqv8SXHC7KOr9k","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65aa714e4097071977e4c6bb","name":"Shaaban Mohammed ","lastName":"Shaaban","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5679b025-8eca-404b-a293-c580fdfed1bf"},{"objectId":"65aa714e4097071977e4c6ba","name":"Rodrigo A.

This study addresses the challenge by focusing on the advancement of latent heat thermal energy storage (LHTES) using phase change materials (PCMs) encapsulated within industrial waste foundry sand (WFS). WFS, a problematic by-product, is repurposed as a supportive matrix for NaNO3 and solar salt PCMs, tailored for effective integration into high-temperature industrial processes. The paper provides a thorough mechanical and thermal examination of the WFS-salt PCMs, highlighting their improved thermal stability, performance, and compatibility with direct thermal energy systems. The composite PCMs demonstrated melting points well-suited for industrial waste heat applications and achieved an energy density of 542.0 ± 8.3 kJ/kg for NaNO3 and 516.0 ± 4.5 kJ/kg for solar salt, An experimental cascade PBLHS, based on these CPCMs, with a capacity of 262 MJ, designed to mimic an industrial heat source at 450 °C, was systematically tested to assess its energy density and efficiency over repeated charging/discharging and free cooling cycles. Its overall system efficiency is found to be 68.5%.

Employing a sustainable carbon cycle via photocatalysis presents a promising technology for simultaneously managing the greenhouse effect and the energy dilemma. However, the efficiency of energy conversion encounters limitations due to inadequate carrier utilization and a deficiency of reactive sites. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in efficiently addressing the aforementioned challenges. This review article commences with an overview of SAC types, structures, fundamentals, synthesis strategies, and characterizations, providing a logical foundation for the design and properties of SACs based on the correlation between their structure and efficiency. Additionally, we delve into the general mechanism and the role of SACs in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Furthermore, we furnish a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in SACs concerning their capacity to enhance efficiency, long-term stability, and selectivity in CO2 reduction. Carbon-structured support materials such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), and graphene-based photocatalysts have garnered significant attention due to their substantial surface area, superior conductivity, and chemical stability. These carbon-based materials are frequently chosen as support matrices for anchoring single metal atoms, thereby enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity. The motivation behind this review article lies in evaluating recent developments in photocatalytic CO2 reduction employing SACs supported on carbon substrates. In conclusion, we highlight critical issues associated with SACs, potential prospects in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, and existing challenges. This review article is dedicated to providing a comprehensive and organized compilation of recent research findings on carbon support materials for SACs in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, with a specific focus on materials that are environmentally friendly, readily accessible, cost-effective, and exceptionally efficient. This work offers a critical assessment and serves as a systematic reference for the development of SACs supported on MOFs, COFs, g-C3N4, graphene, and CTFs support materials to enhance photocatalytic CO2 conversion."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739848","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6617adb9409707791fcdf6e6","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"323","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"a1a438c6-2c3b-481b-bdba-2bdaee8a9d8d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"323","pagesFromTo":"103068-1-36","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000186862300235X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6617adb9409707791fcdf6ee","name":"Juan","lastName":"Yang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85eb45cf-d8c2-44d5-8695-0246aff2e8e3"},{"objectId":"6617adb9409707791fcdf6ed","name":"Qinqin","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ec2a5a2-f0bf-4807-86ef-83e2e377b32a"},{"objectId":"6617adb9409707791fcdf6ec","name":"Maria","lastName":"Yaseen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"567d64ba-dc66-4cd9-a70a-5bb4d8f7ce48"},{"objectId":"6617adb9409707791fcdf6eb","name":"Ahmad","lastName":"Naveed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05e2eddb-fe1c-4eea-927b-2b6fa1955c24"},{"objectId":"6617adb9409707791fcdf6ea","name":"Rao","lastName":"Shaosheng","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89a043bf-4620-4a75-be3c-7400cc521dca"},{"objectId":"6617adb9409707791fcdf6e9","name":"Rai Nauman","lastName":"Ali","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed2cc0ad-ddbd-43d5-8823-9121da38d020"},{"objectId":"6617adb9409707791fcdf6e8","name":"Waqar Ahmad","lastName":"Qureshi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34acaf54-8596-4708-845f-2cf214233236"},{"objectId":"6617adb9409707791fcdf6e7","name":"Syed Najeeb-Uz-Zaman","lastName":"Haider","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"54cd177a-0806-4788-b7ee-bc36ae74834f"},{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d5203151","name":"Amjad","lastName":"Ali","uuid":"8ED7FD74E0F5809A45A1AFF22F9960D69A6216028DF2A6163FAC9B0726DA4BDA37C1427C6DEB58B38DF8E6643987F36B5EF185254E4CFFF2BD9D2B2D50B35266","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"21ca1d35-da10-4b3e-b21c-a4f640f949d5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cis.2023.103068"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5ce","5e709225878c28a04739099e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cold gelation of whey protein isolate with sugars in an ultrasound environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d13","mniswId":"6696","title":"Food Hydrocolloids","doi":null,"issn":"0268-005X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"968b7285-5931-4945-9d76-4d3dc3b0d4a1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"646756bb4097076e9cc0168f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5ce","65e5a1c64097076263cf9503","5e709225878c28a04739099e","65e5a1c64097076263cf9504","65e5a1c64097076263cf9505"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Dispersions of whey protein isolate (9.5% protein) with 1.5% of sugar (glucose, mannose or xylose) were preheated, and ions-induced gelation was performed in an ultrasound environment at room temperature. Depending on the used sugar, sonication increased, decreased or did not change the rheological properties of gels (storage modulus, hardness and ultrasound viscosity). That was contrary to the formation of Maillard reaction compounds, which probably by occupation of active sides of proteins, induced the formation of a weaker three-dimensional gel network. For most samples, sonication increased the value of the contact angle, switching their surface character from hydrophilic to hydrophobic one. The surface free energy of the obtained gels decreased after sonication, and such surfaces were less susceptible to wetting. The increase in the value of the contact angles corresponded to the increase in the roughness of the gels after sonication. The relationship between the surface roughness and the wettability can be attributed to the surface wetting state (Wenzel state, Cassie-Baxter state, and transition state). For the gels surfaces with lower roughness, the liquid was more susceptible to penetration to the surface due to large adhesive forces (Wenzel model) and for higher roughness, the liquid was more susceptible to resting on the “air micro cushions” (Cassie-Baxter model). The ultrasound-induced cold-gelation for the preparation of natural protein/sugar gels can offer a potential approach to develop new functional products with tailor-made attributes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739850","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"139","pagesFromTo":"108510","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268005X23000565?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e5a1c64097076263cf9505","name":"Salvador","lastName":"Perez-Huertas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4225d17-8d36-44d0-8b33-cf3fe06c13c3"},{"objectId":"65e5a1c64097076263cf9504","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Terpiłowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12ecf436-f657-498d-85c0-920afaf461cb"},{"objectId":"65e5a1c64097076263cf9503","name":"Katsuyoshi","lastName":"Nishinari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30b8f58e-3fa1-460a-b419-e6927c7de976"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5ce","name":"Marta","lastName":"Tomczyńska-Mleko","uuid":"3B3A2BA8838E0EF18C5BDC3FBE696E690E80FCAE086E54B78F9A3A571D1BEA631AB456720E1100431350B6377C74D72D52BE8EE1E8017616FC6396C4487A0CDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6870-1060","documentHash":"a0f545da-1ca1-4def-bfc4-e1488b6965ef"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a04739099e","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Mleko","uuid":"B27FEDD0287F54B7DC4920F40FB447439467A8FCB656952E3D4ED660CDF5AA4E0F8474BB952CBAB4DCA5ACF59D33A3A79DF2FC98201DF45EFE3A6CE239E063CA","orcidId":"0000-0002-4704-0777","documentHash":"8acc1acf-f9af-4b89-aa81-b8a34de4b035"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foodhyd.2023.108510"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Phthalates","Phthalic acid esters","QuEChERS","Food contamination","Lettuce."]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fast and reliable determination of phthalic acid esters in soil and lettuce samples based on QuEChERS GC–MS/MS","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d0f","mniswId":"6692","title":"Food Chemistry","doi":null,"issn":"0308-8146","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fbfaf7a2-0f1a-4862-bf5b-dc2e67514105"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"659fc1f54097076c144aaa42","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659fc1f54097076c144aaa43","5e7092f5878c28a0473a007b","5e709227878c28a047390aff","659fc1f54097076c144aaa44","5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Phthalates are commonly used as plasticizers, and solvents in industry and households. We propose an application of the QuEChERS method for the determination of six PAEs in the soil and lettuce (roots and leaves) by GC–MS/MS. The QuEChERS method validation procedure was performed and good linearity (>0.997), recovery (97.2–99.1 %), very low detection limits (0.09–0.43 ng/g), and satisfactory inter- and intraday precision (∼4%) were obtained confirming that QuEChERS GC–MS/MS applied for PAEs determination in the environmental samples is a cheap and environmentally friendly method. In general, the higher the number of carbon atoms in PAEs, the higher the percentage noted in the lettuce roots. At higher PAEs concentration (60 ng/g) the main bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) sink were roots whereas at lower concentrations (30 ng/g) most of DEHP was noted in lettuce leaves implying that the fate of PAEs was governed not by the chemical structure of PAEs but rather partitioning (logKow).\r\n\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739852","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"440","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814623028406","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1f54097076c144aaa44","name":"Yanzheng","lastName":"Gao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d9b2701-d401-4bad-b72d-2a215f1095b3"},{"objectId":"659fc1f54097076c144aaa43","name":"Artur","lastName":"Sokołowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b5791c3-4052-4daf-8943-1cfbfe8df807"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c3","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Czech","uuid":"DFBDEBF7C114925627DA9151532CF82BA9A33324F5242A90DBEC69067DEB26DE07BE7BA0DC9934E39EDB392BF55ED015F31CCE326B397F13DFE37731CA5EBDFC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4895-5186","documentHash":"496ba4f1-066f-4ca9-8a0f-0e382cf3890a"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a007b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dybowski","uuid":"FFA4C018543DB4B62D060A3561321A67F3452A8F0159838BC95B51BCB9E4DDEA0BD65D0E6BF435B74DB7804953502EE95B7176AB172BA46DE1C39BADB4CCC629","orcidId":"0000-0002-1028-759X","documentHash":"18910c9b-5445-4c0d-be99-d3e2f0b38bc4"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390aff","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"4FCF45750A5D33DB0E506D0634C8E83F1F567E71FDA182424BC16D3A9B7D6C806B3E751DD8DEB8A95F81EFA82B94E668B6604C0E4D9479D418440B46FFBD3060","orcidId":"0000-0001-8546-7299","documentHash":"de8bb1e3-4bc1-43e6-aba8-d51f467ca81f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2023.138222"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["High-order computational fluid dynamics","Flux reconstruction","High-speed flows","Unstructured grids","Simplex meshes"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Development of an implicit high-order Flux Reconstruction solver for high-speed flows on simplex elements","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777a0","mniswId":"4242","title":"Computer Physics Communications","doi":null,"issn":"0010-4655","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9379ab5b-3454-49e1-9b87-f82d369e3302"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6597fcbb4097076c14a7fc6d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6597fcbb4097076c14a7fc6e","6597fcbb4097076c14a7fc6f","6597fcbb4097076c14a7fc70","6597fcbb4097076c14a7fc71","6325312975234038513dfa2b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, a significant emphasis is placed on the extension of high-order Flux Reconstruction (FR) schemes to cater to high-speed flows, specifically those involving high Mach numbers.

The proposed FR solver provides more accurate detection of complex flow features over relatively coarser meshes when compared to their low-order peers (particularly in presence of shock waves), is fully implicit and able to simulate compressible flow problems governed by the Euler or Navier-Stokes equations on triangular and tetrahedral meshes. In order to simulate cases with shocks, a shock-capturing scheme previously developed for quadrilateral elements, was extended to tackle supersonic and hypersonic simulations. Extensive verification of the resulting FR solver (up to order, a.k.a P6, for the solution polynomial and order a.k.a Q2 for the geometrical representation) has been performed on benchmark test cases with flow speeds ranging from subsonic to hypersonic, up to Mach 9.6.

To evaluate their quality, among others, the test of methylene blue adsorption (MB value) using a filter paper is recommended. However, one can consider it as a rough test. In this paper we wished to evaluate its quality by comparison with a more precise spectrophotometric method, i.e., to perform adsorption isotherms of methylene blue from aqueous solutions, as well as determine other parameters characterizing the aggregates. For this purpose, methylene blue adsorption on samples of limestone and dolomite natural aggregates having various grain sizes were studied to assess quality (fine particles content) of the manufactured aggregates. To determine the amount of adsorbed dye two methods were used: the methylene blue stain test and the dye adsorption from its solutions at various concentrations under static conditions. From the linear form of Langmuir adsorption isotherms of methylene blue, the monolayer capacity was determined, and then the specific surface areas of all fractions of aggregates. The structural (N2 adsorption/desorption), textural (SEM/EDS) and crystallographic structure of the aggregates were studied. It was determined that the MB values for 0–2 and MBF for 0–0.125 mm aggregates fractions fulfill the criteria set out in the specifications required for pavement construction. A very good repeatability of the adsorbed amount of methylene blue on the dolomite and limestone aggregates were obtained by these two different methods. These results confirm the reliability of the method blue test used typically in industrial conditions. The measured specific surface areas of limestone and dolomite using N2 adsorption (SBET) are smaller than SMB determined by methylene blue adsorption from aqueous solutions. This is because in aggregates, apart from calcite and dolomite, there is a small admixture of quartz and clay minerals. During N2 adsorption in dry condition, the external surface of the grains is determined, while in the aqueous solution of methylene blue, both the external and inner surfaces of clay minerals are determined. © 2023, The Author(s)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739855","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10450-023-00393-z","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657044494097071b8e60d1d0","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Rek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"74b93a70-a6de-4f93-b7bc-a40c9d412f5e"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a0419","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Huber","uuid":"FDA2EC0B4064CBD577FD584008919BA17C93A9F0580C3A0B4A9F677972AE03F3401487AFDF96C79A0BEB96AB55E43CAA98628ED1C5566E710E25E5797575F7AC","orcidId":"0000-0001-7583-6230","documentHash":"12fab005-2a07-48ca-9a78-6f361b5db91c"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0241","name":"Lucyna","lastName":"Hołysz","uuid":"8FE7AD90C48E39C974B5B31C2A6C751A28160CF0736B99E46BA34ED997D7190D23E42704A01E9DC73A690B947B1FC311967655F92CBDE6F2F28E5D902A9DC18E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6479-0919","documentHash":"8a60f794-6438-4c5c-96c5-c308f5554205"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a023c","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Terpiłowski","uuid":"BB5CF56156DBC508342880DFD126F84136435238AC56C16DE5ABCFA8E04CDECAD1B5DED736FBFDD392229837A11BD2FB2D8EFB86342E5E3EA7F99C500F87FBE3","orcidId":"0000-0002-8078-3644","documentHash":"f494b4f1-1288-46a2-a462-c905489859e7"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10450-023-00393-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Coumarin","cysteine","fluorescence","glutathione","Michael addition","probe","thiol detection"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fluorescent Coumarin-based Probe for Detection of Biological Thiols","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778b9","mniswId":"4781","title":"Current Organic Chemistry","doi":null,"issn":"1385-2728","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"74886d4b-ef65-4502-85bd-498a5ef9cd01"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ca0c5040970762634cb5be","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a0067"]},"issue":"15","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nature-derived thiols such as cysteine, homocysteine, and reduced glutathione play diverse and important roles in both plant and animal cells.

We report the most precise test of P, T and CP invariance in decays of ortho-positronium, performed with methodology involving polarization of photons from these decays. Positronium, the simplest bound state of an electron and positron, is of recent interest with discrepancies reported between measured hyperfine energy structure and theory at the level of 10−4 signaling a need for better understanding of the positronium system at this level. We test discrete symmetries using photon polarizations determined via Compton scattering in the dedicated J-PET tomograph on an event-by-event basis and without the need to control the spin of the positronium with an external magnetic field, in contrast to previous experiments. Our result is consistent with QED expectations at the level of 0.0007 and one standard deviation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739858","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/325822","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6784f37afdbe831a380a24a7","name":"Meysam","lastName":"Dadgar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88487efb-ff96-4ae5-aee3-3c7e03c518f1"},{"objectId":"6784f37afdbe831a380a24a6","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Dulski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5868630-b62c-4aa0-bfcf-ad9543adfade"},{"objectId":"6784f37afdbe831a380a24a5","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kacprzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"167565a8-ef41-4b84-b781-cbedceb5f8d5"},{"objectId":"6784f37afdbe831a380a24a4","name":"Juhi","lastName":"Raj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9cce1e4e-e35a-4b79-a513-e67ec40173b1"},{"objectId":"6757b5ecece3984d1d4b555e","name":"Pooja","lastName":"Tanty","uuid":"44D813A3DB9E66C4867AF4480CE3E4A6AAC77F3DA23E1E1CB3E3443DC05BACEA781CBEE2A53C12ABBAB9F3E68E07A7756D6BA2481258311D2AF7AD1B0F667F7B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"119aa9ab-4f13-46a4-8c39-4dd81f943f6c"},{"objectId":"6753c138ece3984d1d4a9009","name":"Ermias Yitayew","lastName":"Beyene","uuid":"76E0EF3C5E3FF4118E06FABB11DE2AB362C06547C66C9F548AEDBF668F978456873521CDA320C7B107880CCE38093503371E8C470EA6925603073A0FFF10AAA3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89223abf-e817-463a-932c-537077775859"},{"objectId":"6753c138ece3984d1d4a8ffd","name":"Muhammed Tevfik","lastName":"Kaplanoglu","uuid":"9D6D6716C722A0CBACE05C009886847F567D418AC95221C4DF8351E57BEE0C03F7B46A9BDB587223C1BDB00B0B0F6BBF2E170E62C68EE6981534715890137737","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce5f8f32-b55f-41de-9db5-68961c436a66"},{"objectId":"660547044097076263375f1d","name":"Muhammed Tevfik","lastName":"Kaplanoglu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4ff68d4-b386-496b-b563-3542379f389b"},{"objectId":"660547044097076263375f1c","name":"Roman Y.","lastName":"Shopa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e048e973-6a25-4131-b80d-8b13ef72795a"},{"objectId":"660547044097076263375f1b","name":"Kavya Valsan","lastName":"Eliyan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8649703a-3d61-4b75-8a7b-955e753e5d3d"},{"objectId":"65b10e0540970719778ebc56","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Wiślicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2030f43-ba68-4660-a39d-2bc6d2e3211b"},{"objectId":"65b10e0540970719778ebc55","name":"Kavya","lastName":"Valsan Eliyan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fced9e91-ca0f-44ea-ad58-473d7c1f3d13"},{"objectId":"65b10e0540970719778ebc54","name":"Keyvan","lastName":"Tayefi Ardebili","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1a36a50-c770-4f8e-8887-0f1ab61dbd72"},{"objectId":"65b10e0540970719778ebc51","name":"Ewa Ł.","lastName":"Stępień","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05c6d2c6-d167-48a3-8acd-51886a906f61"},{"objectId":"65b10e0540970719778ebc4e","name":"Roman Y.

manure treatment aimed at usage as agricultural soil fertilizers is a prerequisite ecological pollution control strategy. In this work, livestock manure-based fertilizers were collected from 71 animal farms across 14 provinces in China. The contamination levels and potential ecotoxicological risks of residual steroid estrogens (SEs): estrone (E1), estriol (E3), 17α-estradiol (17α-E2), 17β-estradiol (17β-E2) and xenoestrogen (XE) bisphenol A (BPA), were investigated. The results showed that the occurrence frequencies for SEs and XE ranged from 66.67% to 100%, and the mean concentration varied considerably across the study locations. The total content of SEs and XE in Hebei province was the highest, and swine manure-based fertilizers concentrations were higher than the levels reported in other animal fertilizers. Compared with farm level manure, manure-based fertilizers are processed by composting, and the micropollutants quantities are significantly reduced (mean: 87.65 - 534.02 μg/kg). The total estradiol equivalent quantity (EEQ) that might migrate to the soil was estimated to be 1.23 μg/kg. Based on the estimated application rate of manure, 38% of the fertilizers risk quotients exceeded 0.1, indicating medium to high risks pressure on terrestrial organisms. Nonetheless, the estrogenic risk was lower in manure-based fertilizers than in manure. This study highlights the significance of proper treatment of livestock manure and designing an optimal manure fertilization strategy to mitigate the risks posed by SEs and XEs to the agroecosystems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739863","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"344","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37473553/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1a24097076c144aa720","name":"Yanzheng","lastName":"Gao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"20303df7-fe95-4af7-9538-fba97b7be75c"},{"objectId":"659fc1a24097076c144aa71f","name":"Dyaaaldin","lastName":"Abdalmegeed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"361891ca-87e5-48e8-9efc-dcb6e41d58ff"},{"objectId":"659fc1a24097076c144aa71e","name":"Wanting","lastName":"Ling ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"185e79ea-3e6f-4112-96e8-660e9a057f8b"},{"objectId":"659fc1a24097076c144aa71d","name":"Xian","lastName":"Zhou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e786c4ab-aca5-42fc-b483-3e1388bf85cd"},{"objectId":"659fc1a24097076c144aa71c","name":"Fredrick Owino","lastName":"Gudda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"151fc8d8-2d22-43a9-b602-77bd69648420"},{"objectId":"659fc1a24097076c144aa71b","name":"Michael Gatheru ","lastName":"Waigi ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a318de5-a841-4f82-ad59-8216464a6c2c"},{"objectId":"659fc1a24097076c144aa71a","name":"Evance Omondi ","lastName":"Mbao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f59c28f8-ca42-4086-9943-d4ee00076593"},{"objectId":"659fc1a24097076c144aa719","name":"Xuwen","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"145dab62-b16f-47f3-93e2-374063a0b26a"},{"objectId":"659fc1a24097076c144aa718","name":"Emmanuel Stephen ","lastName":"Odinga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e82bec52-6752-446c-b721-87e81b1042ea"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c3","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Czech","uuid":"DFBDEBF7C114925627DA9151532CF82BA9A33324F5242A90DBEC69067DEB26DE07BE7BA0DC9934E39EDB392BF55ED015F31CCE326B397F13DFE37731CA5EBDFC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4895-5186","documentHash":"496ba4f1-066f-4ca9-8a0f-0e382cf3890a"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390aff","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"4FCF45750A5D33DB0E506D0634C8E83F1F567E71FDA182424BC16D3A9B7D6C806B3E751DD8DEB8A95F81EFA82B94E668B6604C0E4D9479D418440B46FFBD3060","orcidId":"0000-0001-8546-7299","documentHash":"de8bb1e3-4bc1-43e6-aba8-d51f467ca81f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.118609"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Adsorption","Cd(II)","composite","Cu(ІІ)","Fe(ІІІ) ions","immobilization","in situ","Pb(ІІ)","poly [5-(p-nitrophenylazo)-8-methacryloxyquinoline","silica gel."]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"New organo-mineral materials based on silica gels modified in situ with nitrogen-containing polymers: synthesis and adsorption properties for Pb(ІІ), Сu(ІІ), Cd(II), and Fe(III) ions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ee8","mniswId":"14540","title":"Molecular Crystals and Liquid Crystals","doi":null,"issn":"1542-1406","eissn":"1543-5318","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"bb9da08f-948a-47c9-80e1-8207ecba4fc4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657043bd4097071b8e60c450","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["657043bd4097071b8e60c451","657043bd4097071b8e60c452","5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ee","657043bd4097071b8e60c453"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Three new organo-mineral composite materials were obtained by in situ immobilization of polymers containing azo-, nitro-, and oxyquinoline groups in various combinations on the surface of silica gel.

Here, we report the adsorption process of a heterocyclic organic compound (nitrogenous base) on a microporous carbon (C) in the presence of a colloidal silver solution (AgNP solution) as an accompanying substance. Analysis of the potential colloid–biomolecule interaction as well as the subsequent phenomenon of changes in the morphology of the colloidal system in the presence of selected nucleotides was investigated. Adenosine nitrogenous base (Anb) was selected as a model molecule of the building block of DNA and RNA. The adsorption process of nucleotides from one- and two-component systems was monitored by cyclic UV-VIS measurements for obtaining time-dependent profiles and estimating the kinetic characteristics of uptake. We demonstrate the temperature-dependent course of the adsorption process with visible nucleotide-AgNP morphology determinants. The experimental adsorption kinetics were analyzed using selected theoretical models (intraparticle diffusion model, multiexponential equation, and many others). On the other hand, obtained Anb/C and Anb/AgNP/C composites were characterized by various techniques suitable for material surface and morphology characterization: high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM and TEM/EDX), N2 physisorption measurements, and thermal analysis (thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)/differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
