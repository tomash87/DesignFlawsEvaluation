The current state of pharmacological knowledge precludes the withdrawal of azole drugs, as no other active substances have yet been developed that could effectively replace them. Therefore, one of the anti-yeast strategies may be therapies that can rely on the synergistic action of natural compounds and azoles, limiting the use of azole drugs against candidiasis. Synergy assays perperformed in vitro were used to assess drug interactions Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index. The synergistic effect of fluconazole (1) and three synthetic lactones identical to those naturally occurring in celery plants—3-n-butylphthalide (2), 3-nbutylidenephthalide (3), 3-n-butyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrophthalide (4)—against Candida albicans ATCC 10231, C. albicans ATCC 2091, and C. guilliermondii KKP 3390 was compared with the performance of the individual compounds separately. MIC90 (the amount of fungistatic substance (in µg/mL) inhibiting yeast growth by 90%) was determined as 5.96–6.25 µg/mL for fluconazole (1) and 92–150 µg/mL for lactones 2–4. With the simultaneous administration of fluconazole (1) and one of the lactones 2–4, it was found that they act synergistically, and to achieve the same effect it is sufficient to use 0.58–6.73 µg/mL fluconazole (1) and 1.26–20.18 µg/mL of lactones 2–4. Based on biological research, the influence of the structure on the fungistatic activity and the synergistic effect were determined."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059453070","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"77","pagesFromTo":"555-567","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ptchem.pl/storage/pages/June2023/Olejniczak.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a4","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Olejniczak","uuid":"507AF22784924A1321C0B04ED147A454E0FD2CDC781E6D79C498BD95AE12D572CF80FDACA3192B4518C1E0916646269EB765F8A058889AF50C4F3E790E9C4FDC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6156-5820","documentHash":"14b4b072-bb81-4d65-b169-3af2a6bdbb03"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"658d59d34097076c1457f7da","doi":null,"title":"Towns on the edge in medieval Europe: the social and political order of peripheral urban communities from the twelfth to sixteenth centuries","year":2022,"volume":"244","isbn":"978-0-19-726730-1","ismn":null,"issn":"0068-1202","url":"https://omega.umk.pl/info/book/UMK489f82dec8da4bd4ba3d24bba33552b3/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"200f2b6e-acd4-4a04-a4a5-8e467a4225f1","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75c","mniswId":"1800","name":"Oxford University Press","documentHash":"271d88b1-5188-4c4a-9b77-7569c26422a0"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Urban legislation as an instrument for the formation and regulation of socio-economic life in 14th-century Prussian and Irish towns","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e841734097076263141732","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f1a48e47523405869ccc31a","65e841734097076263141733"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059453072","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"93-119","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://omega.umk.pl/info/article/UMK3de38d98ea39426fbb5b3f59af7da840/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e841734097076263141733","name":"Julia","lastName":"Możdżeń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e1060dfa-40a9-4760-a30d-d5ba3710704f"},{"objectId":"5f1a48e47523405869ccc31a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maleszka","uuid":"0A30C022C13B0EA9BB293B592F0057BE2937BCA3942E75DD5A02C18F28846795AE3E5ECF966880AD5E4085F69D694D0B38CF12325F81E3670809E31B628AC064","orcidId":"0000-0002-2338-6554","documentHash":"ab4211ab-dfa6-4197-b10c-d7c987a44a4c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Bezpieczeństwo ekonomiczne państwa","Bezpieczeństwo narodowe","Inicjatywa Trójmorza","Współpraca gospodarcza","Geopolityka","Globalizacja","Polityka"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65e823da4097070499512adc","doi":null,"title":"TRÓJMORZE BUDOWANIE REGIONU.

Traditionally used sweeteners based on sugars, such as sucrose or glucose-fructose syrup, are known for their multidirectional negative impact on human health. With the development of research into artificial sweeteners and natural sucrose alternatives, more and more consumers are turning to healthier options to satisfy their sweet tooth. Among the potential new sweeteners of natural origin, dihydrochalcones deserve special attention. These compounds belong to polyphenols and are present in plants. In the daily diet of people, their source may be citrus fruits, strawberries and apples. Dihydrochalcones, like other polyphenols, have a high and diverse healthpromoting effect, e.g. antioxidant, antimicrobial or anticancer.

In our work, cardiovascular consequences refer to higher mean blood pressure (MBP) and pulse pressure (PP) on ABPM, as well as to left atrial enlargement (LAE), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) on ECHO. The study group consisted of 101 consecutive patients admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases and Hypertension to verify the diagnosis of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). Each patient underwent full polysomnography, blood tests, ABPM and ECHO. Both selenoprotein-P and renalase levels correlated with different ABPM and ECHO parameters. We found no correlation between the peroxiredoxin-5 level and none of the tested parameters. We point to the possible application of SELENOP plasma-level testing in the initial selection of high cardiovascular-risk patients, especially if access to more advanced examinations is limited. We further suggest SELENOP measurement as a possible indicator of patients at increased left ventricular hypertrophy risk who should be of particular interest and may benefit from ECHO testing."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059453088","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.1187 [15 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/6/1187","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e0fb4097076263e831c3","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Januszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddb3eaee-04a6-4470-87bd-1e3636e194e7"},{"objectId":"5ebee441752340254fc4446a","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Czerwińska","uuid":"C40A11BFF4DBE74600B5A02438D401A570DC385594CBBCD9ED2F104F11ACEABEEC205FA3DEB49B664AA6E3A6CD1C7EA9A308C3078D06CBBEABFABA35D47E72CB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0917-2971","documentHash":"64403a56-a17a-41a7-9a9a-535599ec06b7"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46e7","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Gać","uuid":"7C623C664249C7F2E9429F39BE3807EF40E01176F160F5888C8CC8BEFB4ACD2FB6DFA650BDA38D0E909F5324A3A07444DF6FDA59AF72D13ABA218D98D48509A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8366-0239","documentHash":"200bcb0c-102d-40bd-a86a-2a309102a1ac"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1f18","name":"Helena","lastName":"Martynowicz","uuid":"4E05962BA4513F438D25F4C100113C716C9B79792E33B8A72EE8445868166C063EC9258EFF44D5689E91CFD57F798439E01DCE55B1860946C1DF48C85DF710A2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1283-8460","documentHash":"06ae6407-b4b0-40a3-8a63-3ab9b0fa1e28"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1eee","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Poręba","uuid":"FBC0CF8DA48A626576FB4D809D93B3C1E9248B5AB24EF083B41459AD2904FFB64C3CB1937F9511356EF75FB721FCC4473E355D644AFB0EAD5DE1C8F51293A416","orcidId":"0000-0002-7217-7070","documentHash":"04697c74-eed8-42f7-95e1-badd682f02f6"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a13f8","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Markiewicz-Górka","uuid":"C100561289B7E95B8FFA2BE8586C362CC631738570A6BF90FE96920C8F73A07C28EBA73329D220478290D4D7540B4CC37D4AB78B119BC9BB6815A844068F2B40","orcidId":"0000-0001-7379-5746","documentHash":"725a40e2-146f-4c3e-9b6a-0477546ff99c"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12ef","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Jaremków","uuid":"10ABB17ECDFA6E6D4FB9E9868FF4F7D8AD2F499BA5D6F3366BC4E4B3F56FC18A76EFE3F7ED5B39BE574B7ECF2E06EF33D00443968AF46DA6F9522E40496110B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7829-8711","documentHash":"78845a56-a0b4-4fd1-b475-e198a542ece7"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986a6","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Pawlas","uuid":"08DA53E49DEFDC0D815ABB4632568D15DB3EBA94A59358DF9276AF8911866E1FD5AB07D934708DC70E0687BD879BD66CFFADA0406FD0A6B22471C27875E18F94","orcidId":"0000-0001-5485-7649","documentHash":"a834e4aa-e8fd-48ec-b563-0635338ae1f5"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e508","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"CD71868FC2D388FEA87DCFCFCA0D64D78F08A5C9B1CE4F6EEC31FE1E616B99C9AB5C7869D136364AE6528645197395647BE88502530F9ACF38F458501918360A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6610-2008","documentHash":"7e30072c-efe4-4b6a-b5ac-d5fd1ebbd5a6"}],"doi":"10.3390/antiox12061187"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-231-4935-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"Pogoda i klimat regionów południowobałtyckich od końca XIV do początków XVI w. w źródłach narracyjnych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":299,"publicationPlace":"Toruń","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e82a514097076263127818","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092bd878c28a04739bd99"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059453090","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8fa","mniswId":"60100","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","documentHash":"4013d6fe-c00f-48d0-afcc-434feb04ef71"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://szukaj.bu.umk.pl/permalink/48OMNIS_UMKWT/tpqpll/alma991017064405206926","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bd99","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Oliński","uuid":"C30B16DB0CE89476B4C59357105F34B05D50B19BE609A942E84EE8885A3FBCA76AFD437B660FEA337E3E10B1D7142AD7291B046D0095ED9E4E8F07629C0BCDD2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1428-0800","documentHash":"19a6a7a0-bca9-4a12-9d88-84d76f56badc"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["meadow species","habitat conditions","management","Silaum silaus","population studies"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Silaum silaus (L.)

However, they are gradually being overgrown or transformed into\r\narable fields due to their abandonment and the intensification of economic activities. This leads\r\nto a drastic decline in biodiversity and the disappearance of many rare species, e.g., Silaum silaus.\r\nResearch on Silaum silaus populations was conducted in the years 2020 and 2022. Data were obtained\r\nfrom two Natura 2000 sites. The Ja´cmierz site is located in a dispersed range of Silaum silaus in southeastern Poland. The site at Zagórzyce is located in a dense range of the species in the south-western\r\npart of the country. Research on the habitat conditions was conducted on two permanent study\r\nsurfaces with the dimensions of 10 × 10 m. This research included a soil study and measurements\r\nof herbaceous vegetation. To determine the habitat conditions, use was also made of Ellenberg\r\necological indicator values. At each site, 10 phytosociological relevés were conducted with the\r\nBraun-Blanquet method. In each study year, the manner of land use was determined. For detailed\r\npopulation study, one permanent surface of the dimensions 10 × 10 m was marked out, on which each\r\nyear the generative and vegetative specimens were counted and biometric studies were conducted\r\non 30 randomly chosen generative specimens. The species occurred in two different meadow\r\ncommunities (Arrhenatheretum elatioris, Molinietum caeruleae), which were characterised by different\r\nhabitat conditions, and the greatest differences were evident in the chemical properties of the soil\r\nand in the method of management. The meadows at Ja´cmierz were mowed twice a year, while at\r\nZagórzyce mowing was performed once every two years. The communities were also varied in terms\r\nof flora, characterised by a high species richness and a high Shannon–Wiener index. Silaum silaus\r\nhad significantly greater numbers and an over four times higher cover coefficient at Ja´cmierz. The\r\nlargest differences in the analysed traits of the species occurred in the case of generative traits. It was\r\nobserved that management practices at Ja´cmierz had a strong influence on the condition of specimens\r\nand the population size of Silaum silaus, which was much better preserved at this site."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059453092","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6696303bfdbe83399d20cd16","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d36e1467-66a1-4199-aeef-bc4b5117ecc1"},{"objectId":"6696303bfdbe83399d20cd15","name":"Agata","lastName":"Stadnicka-Futoma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc970ce0-6005-4a79-85d9-14e0bafab137"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0db","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Jaźwa","uuid":"5CE1054D6E01A15B43F47CF2185E4FB0C4681A4C1B1022EE30B15A577D69F75E6E8DE913E8FB0C21691BEF365779923D00DE3610F419BFA970B300B441F83BD6","orcidId":"0000-0002-5556-6891","documentHash":"6dfe4b0f-de97-4da0-938c-6da12bed9555"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16051844"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["inrush current limiting","finite element analysis (FEA)","LSPMSM start-up","energy loss limiting"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9e4","5e7093b1878c28a0473af36a","5e7092d3878c28a04739d71e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A New Method of Reducing the Inrush Current and Improving the Starting Performance of a Line-Start Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65df206c40970762632a088b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9e4","5e7092d3878c28a04739d71e","5e7093b1878c28a0473af36a"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a new method of reducing the inrush current and improving the starting performance of a line-start permanent-magnet synchronous motor (LSPMSM). The novelty of the proposed method relies on the selection of the time instant of the connection of the stator winding to the grid, for which the smallest values of the amplitudes of inrush currents are obtained. To confirm the effectiveness of the developed method of limiting the inrush current, simulations and experimental studies were carried out. The algorithm and dedicated computer code developed by the authors for the analysis of transient coupled phenomena in the LSPMSM were used to study the impact of the time instant of connection of the winding to the grid on the motor start-up process. The algorithm was based on a field model of coupled electromagnetic and thermal phenomena in the studied motor. To verify the developed model of the phenomena and the proposed method, experimental research was carried out on a purpose-built computerised test stand. Good concordance between the results of the experiments and simulations confirmed the high reliability of the proposed model, as well as the effectiveness of the developed approach in limiting the inrush current and improving the starting performance of LSPMSMs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059453093","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d88e5b4097071e546d408e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"07341add-7883-436a-8e12-aba8ad2cdf95"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1040-1  -  1040-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/5/1040","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af36a","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Barański","uuid":"F4C92A2A3B768B15715DA305109181E947134FC65F96313EB1923B83CBF9091B07B0C8D77807527E1251F91942CD1F100115A2774B55B4DC15B8D47706956120","orcidId":"0000-0001-9070-7234","documentHash":"663a175b-9efe-4976-acb7-74700b165551"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9e4","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Jędryczka","uuid":"6FDE8C0F10D6253D309515AB9C2AFAA6DD3E93DAE9FD48FF2630D3CB6DEED134DCDDA61D0C4EE94ED9D925BBFCDE10E75BC99BE89927A52D5D0089F81029F9EF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5427-059X","documentHash":"392fe22d-07f9-43a0-90c6-3cc6cb6aafde"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d71e","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Szeląg","uuid":"9C159BF9C0E2315520060C7350C9C15F579112775EB0E6960CD2FC46A5F96994D7533BA76243BBAF10F04E256C52BFC00AB2DD46DA54EC6A1C0A5C8CD5DC3B40","orcidId":"0000-0001-5569-9574","documentHash":"3ceec979-190a-4c76-8320-c2aac7a3e283"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17051040"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dapagliflozin","heart failure","quality of life","randomized trial"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Compared with placebo, dapagliflozin significantly increased (improved) the mean KCCQ physical and social activity limitation scores at 8 months (placebo-corrected mean difference 1.94 [95% CI: 0.73-3.16] and 1.84 [95% CI: 0.43-3.25], respectively). Dapagliflozin also increased each of the individual components that comprise the physical and social activity limitations domains at 8 months, with the largest improvement seen in \"hobbies or recreational activities\" (placebo-corrected mean difference: 2.76 [95% CI: 1.06-4.46]) and \"doing yardwork, housework, or carrying groceries\" (placebo-corrected mean difference: 2.59 [95% CI: 0.76-4.42]). The proportion of patients with a 5-point improvement from baseline to 8 months in the KCCQ physical and social activity limitation scores was greater with dapagliflozin than with placebo (ORs: 1.23 [95% CI: 1.09-1.40] and 1.19 [95% CI: 1.05-1.35], respectively).\r\n\r\nConclusions: In patients with HFrEF, dapagliflozin, compared with placebo, improved physical and social activity limitations as measured by KCCQ.

However, NRS are prone to several sources of bias, which limit their validity. We aimed at comparing AIT effects between RCTs and NRS and evaluate the reasons for discrepancies in study results. In this analysis, we compared NRS on AIT (including subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy, SCIT and SLIT, respectively) with SLIT and SCIT RCTs from published meta-analyses, assessing the Risk of Bias (RoB) for each study and the certainty of evidence from NRS and RCTs using the GRADE approach. We found: (1) very serious RoB in the 7 NRS included in the meta-analysis showing a large difference between AIT and controls (standardized mean difference [SMD] for symptom score [SS], -1.77; 95% CI, -2.30, -1.24; p < .001; I2 = 95%) with very low certainty evidence; (2) serious RoB in the 13 SCIT-RCTs reporting a moderate-to-high difference between SCIT and controls (SMD for SS, -0.81; 95% CI, -1.12, -0.49; p < .001; I2 = 88%) with moderate certainty evidence; (3) low RoB in the 13 SLIT-RCTs reporting a small benefit (SMD for SS, -0.28; 95% CI, -0.37, -0.19; p < .001; I2 = 54.2%) with high certainty evidence. Similar results were reported for medication score. Our evidence is sufficient to conclude that the magnitude of effect estimates of NRS and RCTs directly correlate with the degree of RoB and inversely with the overall evidence certainty. NRS, which are more affected than RCTs by bias resulting in low certainty evidence, showed the largest effect size. Sound NRS are needed to complement RCTs.

The properties of melaphyre glasses modified with 25 % and 50 % of calumite were determined after the post-melting and directional crystallization process. The produced glasses were subjected to microstructural analysis using light LM and scanning electron microscopy SEM. Their chemical composition was determined using XRF spectroscopy. After melting and directional crystallization, the glasses' structural tests were performed using FTIR spectroscopy and XRD phase analysis. The characteristic temperatures and the thermal stability of the glasses were determined with thermal analysis (DTA/TG) and dilatometric tests, which analysis was also valuable to determine the parameters of the directional crystallization process of melaphyre glasses. The results showed that unmodified melaphyre glasses demonstrate a low crystallization ability and do not crystallize even at 900 °C, while incorporating calumite into their composition increases their crystallization ability. The study showed that calumite significantly influences the chemical and structural characteristics of melaphyre glasses, which gives it the chance to be successfully used as a raw material for producing glass crystalline materials or mineral fibres. Notably, the findings underscore the potential utility of calumite as a proficient raw material for fabricating glass crystalline fibrous or insulating materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059453110","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.50","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027288422303568X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebeda60752340254fc4183b","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"82B57640C1539D5B3673DA8834BABC9F837548FA21D56612D71C31FF5F2D58F900D46F21E5ADACE371CE7E2C8AB3FC92DED16B4E26FB89080CD124F68075C0BA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e9d329d8-5b53-4f29-9f8f-f11ab22eee43"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b895f","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Jasiński","uuid":"D5226E35C753C8D74B91C6E46998AB44D62D04B5A65BF01F810E018B50D748A693AC36A80439796819CD9391950A66D4B3BF33D396F48BC5CE3255FE03274E5F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-5788","documentHash":"f6bdc10b-744d-4ab5-910c-34e9c4252b01"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e85a","name":"Józef","lastName":"Iwaszko","uuid":"1048C59189D85E1DD212FCA1DCA37B47AC85CE08DB17E071AAFB2C9EC1F02CE0E66F3531A1C6B7EB84EFB779623F071DD18CEC23310CC2D102E3A8BC824BE06D","orcidId":"0000-0002-5660-9531","documentHash":"af6ba26f-1e32-4208-8319-e23ae8ebfff0"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e82d","name":"Monika","lastName":"Zajemska","uuid":"F2DCD6C55A5B664B9D9CD3B347F17C4ED32A2CD47B149F1192786FC00C86B3737D18C85CD7027945C4FCAC92CCB036E8949D9FC1090D1079C00AA853619FAD04","orcidId":"0000-0002-4743-4258","documentHash":"f9fe8932-6521-4e29-81ed-ef90ba0755fd"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e80e","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Lubas","uuid":"F0A9C1AC238E37074CFB1E32809AE62EC0C34C65AB887A92535DE66661E2EB1DB079AE72C05E9483EB5D73FBF0821C8F7CFB908219E23D94F494DC1107169A01","orcidId":"0000-0003-3213-3978","documentHash":"ef85f02c-ec9b-464d-a263-5f971edfa790"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ceramint.2023.11.112"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Abiotic stress","Ascorbate peroxidase","Biostimulant","Metal ion toxicity","Nitrogen uptake","Photosynthetic rate","Soil conditioner","Super oxide dismutase","Water deficit","Yield"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Management of excessive soil H+ ion induced toxicities by application of organic seaweed amendment enhances photosynthesis and resource use efficiencies in rice (Oryza sativa)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b10","mniswId":"5839","title":"Environmental Research","doi":null,"issn":"0013-9351","eissn":"1096-0953","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"89b2afcc-5bb8-4346-b010-c59bf20aec6b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8be","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e82d8d409707626313b8bf","65e82d8d409707626313b8c0","65e82d8d409707626313b8c1","65e82d8d409707626313b8c2","65e82d8d409707626313b8c3","65e82d8d409707626313b8c4","65e82d8d409707626313b8c5","65e82d8d409707626313b8c6","65e82d8d409707626313b8c7","5e709231878c28a0473916a6"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Globally, soil acidification is a serious environmental issue that reduces commercial agricultural production. Rice is subjected to nutritional stress due to acidic soil, which is a major impediment to rice production. Since acid soil threatens rice plants with soil compaction, nutrient loss, and plant stress-induced oxidative cell damage that results in affecting the photosynthetic system, restricting the availability of water, and reducing overall plant growth and productivity. Since contemporary soil acidification management strategies provide mediocre results, the use of Sargassum wightii seaweed-based biostimulants (BS) and soil amendments is sought as an environmentally friendly alternative strategy, and therefore its potential isevaluated in this study. BS was able to mediate soil quality by improving soil pH and structure along with facilitating nitrogen phytoavailability. BS also increased the activity of the antioxidant enzyme system, superoxide dismutase ((48%), peroxidase (76.6%), and ascorbate peroxidase (63.5%), aggregating the monaldehyde-mediating accumulation of osmoprotective proline in roots, that was evident from rapid initiation of root hair growth in treated seedlings. BS was also able to physiologically modulate photosynthetic activities and chlorophyll production (24.31%) in leaves, maintaining the efficiency of plant water use by regulating the stomatal conductance (0.91 mol/m/s) and the transpiration rate (13.2 mM/m/s). The BS compounds were also successful in facilitating nitrogen uptake resulting in improved plant growth (59%), tiller-panicle number, and yield (52.57%), demonstrating a resourceful nitrogen use efficiency (71.96%) previously affected by stress induced by acid soil. Therefore, the study affirms the competent potential of S. wightii-based soil amendment to be applied not only to improve soil quality, but also to increase plant production and yield."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059453113","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"247","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935124000835?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8c7","name":"Sengottayan","lastName":"Senthil-Nathan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9675bf7e-f22b-4a21-8413-35fd2a0134c0"},{"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8c6","name":"Guilherme","lastName":"Malafaia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d44979cb-e545-4cf6-820e-3791eb72b89e"},{"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8c5","name":"Narayanan","lastName":"Thulasi-Raman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6eee8a5f-6c4b-4c25-bbc8-d55ce5a26613"},{"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8c4","name":"Ramakrishnan","lastName":"Ramasubramanian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1054701-c34a-47f0-b3ce-8a6107a8fdab"},{"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8c3","name":"Arulsoosairaj","lastName":"Deva-Andrews","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7f05566-cec1-4b08-84b4-531b52f05d58"},{"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8c2","name":"Pauldurai","lastName":"Malarvizhi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6fad5b18-b149-43c1-9025-d8bc652e0138"},{"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8c1","name":"Ponnusamy","lastName":"Murugan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"034e7b47-f4cf-4a6d-9c75-c5a20a024444"},{"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8c0","name":"Ganesh-Subbaraja","lastName":"Pavithra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26617f0a-f066-4543-8426-f64bfd5edaed"},{"objectId":"65e82d8d409707626313b8bf","name":"Kanagaraj Muthu-Pandian","lastName":"Chanthini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6707a531-a035-437c-a882-9b38e9b77cda"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a0473916a6","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Proćków","uuid":"70701C5C678163514436375EF8CAD6D3DB2B353579CDC817CDB9CDC66060DA03F8247EF622FD5202713335D60FD7F634D7DE07E31CA1363A9333A985C3EC803F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4100-3438","documentHash":"3f63635c-e25d-4333-ba43-89dbe7f84a86"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.envres.2024.118179"},{"mainLanguageName":"francuski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63cacd7c4097071a964a4956","doi":null,"title":"Noblesse Française, noblesse Polonaise - 20 ans après","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"979-10-353-1898-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://nouveautes-editeurs.bnf.fr/annonces.html?id_declaration=10000000825791","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"7dee0ce5-6b0d-4712-9c02-49b386c96903","publisher":{"objectId":"63cacd7c4097071a964a4957","mniswId":null,"name":"La Geste","documentHash":"64590fac-40de-417e-8598-eeaf8f1edd19"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"La dimension éducative du voyage de la noblesse et de l’aristocratie polonaises à l’époque moderne : l’état de la recherche","mainLanguage":"fra","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e841be4097076263141efe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092bf878c28a04739beb7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"fra","content":"Les fréquents voyages des jeunes nobles et magnats à l’époque moderne ont\r\nsuscité l’intérêt accru des chercheurs pour les pérégrinations dans les pays d’Europe\r\noccidentale.

aim of the work was to develop a mathematical model using equations of fluid mechanics that describe the dynamics of air flow in a part of the compost aerating system integrated with a stationary

The results of the simulation show that adjusting the flow resistance along the entire length of the compost aerating duct, depending on the distance from the connection of the duct with the fan's pressure conduit pipe through gradually increasing the air outflow area by increasing the number of repeatable gaps, yields a uniform pressure distribution above the grate. The process parameters used for computation were relevant to composting a subscreen fraction separated from mixed municipal waste using 80 mm mesh screen (Fr<80 mm) under real conditions. Microsoft EXCEL 2010 software and STATISTICA version 13.3 by StatSoft wer used for numerical and statistical analysis of the test results. The research results are presented in four tables and five figures and discussed in the text of the article. During tests performed in real conditions, various variants were tested for reactor filling level and air outflow active surfaces in subsequent grate parts (Fc (i)). It was found that the target waste layer thickness i.e. 3.0 m and Fc (i) changes, in accordance with the values of the developed model, result in a stable pressure distribution pd, amounting to 1506 Pa and 1495 Pa at the grate front and end part."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455585","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eee30840970749973dcac5","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"50","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"26ca0c19-dbe5-4c30-a8c0-15d203ddb483"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"50","pagesFromTo":"87-94","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Model numeryczny do symulacji parametrów hydraulicznych układu napowietrzania zapewniającego równomierne natlenienie pryzmy kompostowej"}],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/149435/edition/130465/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ae79","name":"Robert","lastName":"Sidełko","uuid":"79721133D6DF425FB2BC00DBF73D4C870D39EB8354F3DA4493A8D78108904225E3DFDD5B9B8664871FA73B4C97EC68CF9C768EA1F1A821EAAA084EFD4376281C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4555-5638","documentHash":"4905aacb-5fad-4e83-ba2d-1ecd6976c812"},{"objectId":"5e709253878c28a047393ce5","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Boruszko","uuid":"F48F00FA41CB68DEB1ADD72F45D6AA2B85C9A8D222981DF5F31435964A6CDF4A19A8F895D1016C8F8A68841EAAF8506F03715781055035E03C212BE20E1C82BF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5160-8938","documentHash":"a9356d40-d0d6-476e-805e-bdf592866606"}],"doi":"10.24425/aep.2024.149435"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["early intervention","network analysis","phenomenology","psychopathology","psychosis"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

However, it remains unknown which dimensions of psychopathology are most closely related to the occurrence of PLEs. In this study, we aimed to analyze the association of PLEs with various domains of psychopathology.\r\nMethods: A total of 1100 nonclinical adults (aged 18-35 years, 51.4% females) with a negative history of psychiatric treatment were surveyed. Assessment of psychopathology was performed using self-reports. Symptoms associated with PLEs were explored as continuous variables and based on clinically relevant thresholds using two separate network analyses.\r\nResults: In both network analyses, PLEs were directly connected to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms, manic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Anxiety symptoms were associated with PLEs only in the network based on threshold scores. Importantly, edge weight for the connection of PLEs and OCD symptoms was significantly higher compared to edge weights of all other direct connections of PLEs with psychopathology in both networks. Edge weight for the connection between PLEs and manic symptoms was significantly higher compared to edge weights for direct connections of PLEs with depressive and ADHD symptoms in the network based on continuous scores of psychopathological symptoms.

It affects every age group and is associated with many negative health effects. As an example, there is a relationship between obesity and allergic and immunological diseases, such as asthma, psoriasis, food allergies, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. Obesity undeniably affects their development. In addition, it causes adverse changes in the course and response to therapy in relation to patients without excessive body weight. The treatment of diseases associated with obesity is difficult; drugs are less effective and must be used in higher doses, and their use in patients with obesity is often associated with higher risks. The main form of treatment of all obesity-related diseases is a change in eating habits and increased physical activity, which leads to a decrease in body fat mass. The positive effect of reducing BMI has been confirmed in many independent studies. This paper reviews various types of research documents published since 2019. It aims to systematize the latest knowledge and highlight the need for further research for effective and sustainable treatment options for obesity, its complications and obesity-related diseases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455591","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"art.3813 [11 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/17/3813","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1d54097076263e84c82","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Kozubek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65505705-cd83-4999-836d-56fbcb46ffb2"},{"objectId":"6630e1d54097076263e84c81","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Morąg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f214f5dc-db2c-4279-819d-28f52455557d"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1174","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Gomułka","uuid":"FA4F7F7EA2E1AD36B46DC6F3282C4EEA4B50804AD7D2CA4954FC09F8AE8A6497A2AEF820ADA66414240C4B8227F194D9A81380D4F8BA1BBCAFEEDEF62D77A83F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7218-2961","documentHash":"57d02210-0ea8-4390-9228-7f359fe262ca"}],"doi":"10.3390/nu15173813"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["metabolic acidosis","CKD","bicarbonate","chloride"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The aim of this study is to identify the prevalence of various acid–base disorders in patients with advanced CKD using point-of-care testing (POCT) and to determine the relationship between POCT parameters. Methods: In a group of 116 patients with CKD in stages G4 and G5, with a mean age of 62.5 ± 17 years, a sample of arterial blood was taken during the arteriovenous fistula procedure for POCT, which enables an assessment of the most important parameters of acid–base balance, including: pH, base excess (BE), bicarbonate (HCO3−), chloride(Cl−), anion gap (AG), creatinine and urea concentration. Based on this test, patients were categorized according to the type of acidosis-base disorder. Results: Decompensate acidosis with a pH &lt; 7.35 was found in 68 (59%) patients. Metabolic acidosis (MA), defined as the concentration of HCO3− ≤ 22 mmol/L, was found in 92 (79%) patients. In this group, significantly lower pH, BE, HCO3− and Cl− concentrations were found. In group of MA patients, AGMA and HAGMA was observed in 48 (52%) and 44 (48%) of patients, respectively. The mean creatinine was significantly lower in the AGMA group compared to the HAGMA group (4.91 vs. 5.87 mg/dL, p &lt; 0.05). The AG correlated positively with creatinine (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.01) and urea (r = 0.53, p &lt; 0.01), but there was no correlation between HCO3− and both creatinine (r = −0.015, p &gt; 0.05) and urea (r = −0.07, p &gt; 0.05). The Cl− concentrations correlated negatively with HCO3− (r = −0.8, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: The most common type of acid–base disturbance in CKD patients in stages 4 and 5 is AGMA, which is observed in patients with better kidney function and is associated with compensatory hyperchloremia. The initiation of renal replacement therapy was significantly earlier for patients diagnosed with HAGMA compared to those diagnosed with AGMA. The more advanced the CKD, the higher the AG."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455592","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art.3367 [15 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/21/3367","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e71f4097076263e892c6","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Gołębiowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a31c49b8-cc5b-4034-b550-bc9dd5754a15"},{"objectId":"6630e71f4097076263e892c5","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Jerzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b1959a7-576a-4928-8b5e-786bb0636b05"},{"objectId":"6630e71f4097076263e892c4","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Powązka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"67dafd04-8501-4748-876b-b1022d37ac98"},{"objectId":"6630e71f4097076263e892c3","name":"Wiktoria","lastName":"Rożek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ca053e2-4c52-49d2-a058-46f2aeffdfec"},{"objectId":"634f612b752340623bbe65c4","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Stojanowski","uuid":"156F59FC531A36CC0D557277ABBA16B0FB926B35B1FE1C6542793F9130AF64DB620B5CAD2D35EAA91295FE3C784507516013411336DB0CA173836ED1CDDB2360","orcidId":"0000-0002-0527-2190","documentHash":"f86fa7da-fcb1-452e-93c7-cb5949431fdc"},{"objectId":"5ebee2b8752340254fc43db2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Olczyk","uuid":"7206F87101967A6A7F2903CBF86FF6AE4C563E02610DD632BD2A18396AE89F16D9534DB928EDF673345ACB3D2139E4924EBBFAC98379E57DD46BDE0120823DAA","orcidId":"0000-0002-9447-9459","documentHash":"815db780-748c-431e-b7bb-bec9fb80ec47"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d1e","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Konieczny","uuid":"9AAED56CCD4B7072561C6E8D1ACA8D8968BC35B5D55F436F010CDCD1A49155E89F007EC5E929BF18E976997234CD055068A3E1367B4F0EC73E9CA13E098E6B01","orcidId":"0000-0002-4966-9771","documentHash":"8e530ada-89d9-44f3-b1ff-c4ee8b92e408"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af914","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Letachowicz","uuid":"B82A5F4BA40194D70D7799EDB1FCD51EE006FC0FDE64FA355214C024D9FBEDAC98D18D31281B989EDD456D44B26284D3A704D7D07C9B4C417A69A23A822B34B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-2747-8851","documentHash":"c6ccc9aa-9748-4eb8-b0d0-935c78177a79"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af754","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Gołębiowski","uuid":"CB5DED134C28CA2E746394D64B3F8F7892A36B583817C9116510BD71915BECF3855BDDCBB50B6ADBC5D9D6DDF327A7964372357CE153FE22BF53CE719D178D95","orcidId":"0000-0001-5477-2020","documentHash":"595d2d34-3d7b-4037-aa45-a0219cd2e42c"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1ef3","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Kusztal","uuid":"F4D7CF65E6FE7C78DABCAFDA4CF34C5955A0703F8D921724C6AA2E063480F8721B303C833A6DBA8C6872FD733C3D83F249DD22FB3E8DB2BE0093487F9CCC8047","orcidId":"0000-0002-6502-0374","documentHash":"c96caacf-6cda-4a71-aea9-768bed2c85e6"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1ef2","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Banasik","uuid":"66917C7D13323ED86738ED747F3C2CB8C1D3278378A52E1B1A970A3EA190C8A0588C78ED38D01371C85156A708A22761678B3DA8D312F46A67D27D027E5C40CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-0588-1551","documentHash":"a7356292-279f-4bda-add0-1e5efa82a7c8"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1354","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":"24BD21FEF2D2C8CA3880ADF08AA3B3D165FA3F8DE2FB61B86CDB2AA8DF8817AE7760984796CF9BA0161C5D4A7C13EE580B1DBF8BEBD37D39EBB784E641B3B2A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-2632-2409","documentHash":"d503f845-e3f0-4f29-af55-9660bae3a658"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1293","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Zmonarski","uuid":"3518673B3362089FA41A4758F55026F8813BC4345DA9BFC11713E7CEB9056CEBC11BF9AFCE3F555C630967DEC6FE54BA55AD63A4673E830C01E91C0B8DE6E3A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0764-4939","documentHash":"f49034b4-ba57-4727-bfef-3c2f1b987884"}],"doi":"10.3390/diagnostics13213367"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Diptera","Dipterological meeting","Słopnice","Beskid Wyspowy Mts","Poland"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sprawozdanie z XV Konferencji Dipterologicznej pt. \"Biologia i systematyka muchówek\" oraz XLI Zjazdu Sekcji Dipterologicznej PTE -

of inequality can be used to illustrate inequality between and within groups, but the choice of the appropriate measure can have different implications. This study focused on the Mean Logarithmic Deviation, the measure proposed by Theil and based on the techniques of statistical information theory. The MLD was selected because of its attractive properties: fulfillment of the principle of monotonicity and the possibility of additive decomposition. The following study objectives were formulated: (1) to assess the degree of inequality in the population and in the distinguished subgroups, (2) to determine the extent to which education and age influence the level of inequality, and (3) to ascertain what factors contribute to changes in the level of inequality in Poland. The study confirmed an association between the level of education and the average income of the groups distinguished on this basis. The education level of the household head remains an important determinant of household income inequality in Poland, despite the decline in the “educational bonus”. The study also found that differences in the age of the household head had a smaller effect on income inequality than the level of education. However, it can be concluded that the higher share of older people may contribute to an increase in income inequality between groups, as the income from pension in Poland is more homogeneous than the income from work in younger groups. Moreover, the current paper seeks to situate Theil’s approach in the context of scholarly writings since 1967."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455598","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/6/773","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739be5a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Muszyńska","uuid":"EBF56C7C847A4CFE73E168DD8811A4ED55C8BB4FAC4408359959CB35A154DC07547A30F4F39AAEFEE69CABD86D4C6EB9144859C08E33791FB3D7D62A6E075019","orcidId":"0000-0002-9436-4336","documentHash":"bcfa9db2-c69a-40dd-9d84-852fda58dc71"},{"objectId":"5e70921b878c28a04739000d","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wędrowska","uuid":"265A63B86ACB3C72F7717C53376CAACD486EB1D233B743B182C7413D4236F2C990BCD4F5B9A09966CCA50C2633AEB9C902CAA4386CE9A93C2732A396E1BBD3D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3902-0896","documentHash":"76daddcb-4ea9-47b2-8a4a-0697911ea24f"}],"doi":"10.3390/e24060773"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mechanical properties","metallographic analysis","steel for cold upsetting","thermovision investigation","wire rod rolling"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analysis of the Uniformity of Mechanical Properties along the Length of Wire Rod Designed for Further Cold Plastic Working Processes for Selected Parameters of Thermoplastic Processing","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":"10.3390/ma","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8475d9fb-a844-4cfe-87c7-25090cd02fd3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eec2e640970749973b4b65","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709202878c28a04738e818"]},"issue":"Iss.4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study presents the results of research, the aim of which was to analyze the uniformity of the distribution of selected mechanical properties along the length of a 5.5 mm diameter wire rod of 20MnB4 steel for specific thermoplastic processing parameters. The scope of the study included, inter alia, metallographic analyses, microhardness tests, thermovision investigations, and tests of the wire rod mechanical properties (yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, relative reduction in area at fracture), along with their statistical analysis, for three technological variants of the rolling process differing by rolling temperature in the final stage of the rolling process (Reducing Sizing Mill rolling block [RSM]) and by cooling rate using STELMOR® cooling process. The obtained results led to the conclusion that the analyzed rolling process is characterized by a certain disparity of the analyzed mechanical properties along the length of the wire rod, which, however, retains a certain stability. This disparateness is caused by a number of factors. One of them, which ultimately determines the properties of the finished wire rod, is the process of controlled cooling in the STELMOR® line. Despite technological advances concerning technical solutions (among them, increasing the roller track speed in particular sections), it is currently not possible to completely eliminate the temperature difference along the length of the wire rod caused by the contact of individual coils with each other. From this point of view, for the analyzed thermoplastic processing parameters, there is no significant impact by the production process parameters on the quality of the finished steel product. Whereas, while comparing the mechanical properties and microstructure of the wire rod produced in the different technological combinations, it was found that the wire rod rolled in an RSM block at 850 °C and cooled after the rolling process on a roller conveyor at 10 °C/s had the best set of mechanical properties and the smallest microstructure variations. The wire rod produced in this way had the required level of plasticity reserve, which enables further deformation of the given type of steel in compression tests with a relative plastic strain of 75%. The uniformity of mechanical properties along the length of wire rods designed for further cold plastic working processes is an important problem. This is an important issue, given that wire rods made from 20MnB4 steel are an input material for further cold plastic working processes, e.g., for the drawing processes or the production of nails."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455599","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.17","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/4/905","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e818","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Laber","uuid":"DF5D4262978B1098DD0DE943D055604F63A1F7D74F6B4EEE36C0C5301BAD577C068F3E72893E0593D7834E1BECC97116F6D90A6FF101C397C5037AA30DEEFE82","orcidId":"0000-0003-2287-3665","documentHash":"17ec45ce-4b33-480a-aa22-2348f3ff3560"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17040905"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","vaccines","people living with HIV","sirtuins"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Expectations also concerned the effectiveness of vaccines in inducing a strong immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the length of post-vaccination immunity. This topic seems to be especially important in the case of immunocompromised people, such as those living with HIV (PLWH). The aim of the study was to examine the concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies against the S1 subunit of the virus’ spike protein as a marker of humoral response and the concentration of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as an indicator of cellular response in PLWH undergoing combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and uninfected people (control group) several months after the COVID-19 booster. Concentrations of selected enzymes from the group of sirtuins (SIRT1,-3,-6) that participate in the course of HIV infection were also examined. Concentrations of IgG and IFN-γ were statistically significantly lower in PLWH compared to the control group. Correlations between IgG and IFN-γ concentrations were found both in PLWH and in the control group. Only the concentration of SIRT-6 was significantly lower in PLWH compared to the control group. Vaccination for COVID-19 enabled good long-term humoral and cellular immunity in both HIV positive and uninfected people.

The purpose of this study was to examine if behavioral, clinical, and vascular variables are linked with CI in individuals with HD. (2) Methods: Initially, 47 individuals with chronic HD volunteered to participate in the trial, but only 27 patients ultimately completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Computerized Cognitive Assessment Tool (CompBased-CAT). We collected information on smoking, mental activities, physical activity (Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity, RAPA), and comorbidity. The oxygen saturation (rSO2) and pulse wave velocity (PWV; IEM Mobil-O-Graph) of the frontal lobes were measured. (3) Results: Significant associations were discovered between MoCA and rSO2 (r = 0.44, p = 0.02 and r = 0.62, p = 0.001, right/left, respectively), PWV (r = -0.69, p = 0.0001), CCI (r = 0.59, p = 0.001), and RAPA (r = 0.72, p = 0.0001). Those who actively occupied their time during dialysis and non-smokers achieved higher cognitive exam results. A multivariate regression study demonstrated that physical activity (RAPA) and PWV had separate effects on cognitive performance. (4) Conclusions: Cognitive skills are related to inter-dialysis healthy habits (physical activity, smoking) and intra-dialysis activities (tasks and mind games). Arterial stiffness, oxygenation of the frontal lobes, and CCI were linked with CI.

A total of 21 stroke survivor-caregiver dyads were recruited for this study between May 2022 and September 2022. Data were collected through semistructured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. In this study, four themes were identified: (1) poor relationship quality of the dyads, (2) dyadic incongruence in managing stroke, (3) a slow and tiring dyadic self-care process and (4) happy cooperation in coping with dyadic self-care.\r\n\r\nDiscussion and conclusion: Healthcare professionals should give greater consideration to the contradictions and disparities that may arise between stroke survivors and caregivers during the self-care process. It is crucial for them to provide personalized and tailored support and interventions that can assist these individuals in achieving a more optimal balance in their dyadic self-care.\r\n\r\nPatient/public contribution: Patients were involved in the formulation of interview questions for this study.

High gravity equipment achieves intensification by substituting gravity with much higher centrifugal force. Rotating Packed Bed is the leading example of high gravity solutions, strongly facilitating gas-liquid mass transfer. However, cylindrical packings come with certain drawbacks, such as dry spots, that can be overcome with new solutions, such as baffle-based packing geometries. However, when baffles are arranged too close to each other, liquid bridges are formed between them, which may lead to decrease in mass transfer efficiency. This work is concerned with improvement of a Zickzack-like internal by the means of visual studies with the use of high-speed camera.

In the approach, denoted as AROFRAG (from aromatic fragmentation), a set of predefined elementary subsystems, such as naphthalene and biphenyl in the first model and larger PAHs in the second and third models, is generated with appropriate weights with the aim of reproducing the structure of the original molecule. The energies of the molecules are approximated as weighted sums of the energies of these subsystems. For symmetric cases, e.g., fullerenes, the point-group symmetry is preserved during the decomposition. The AROFRAG is used in conjunction with the molecule-in-molecule (MIM) technique to obtain an accurate description of the electronic energies. The new approach has been applied for selected graphene structures and fullerene doped with boron and nitrogen atoms, for which isomerization energies were calculated, as well as for several nanotubes and regular fullerene molecules. The combination of the third AROFRAG model and the MIM approach leads to the reproduction of electronic energies with a few milli-hartree accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of the original method."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455615","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e99b5c409707132d319b49","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"20","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"ea080ebf-fc15-498f-bec4-6617552893a5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"1078-1095","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00875","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602e51b99543c7410626f0ce","name":"Emran","lastName":"Masoumifeshani","uuid":"F013A64FAB074E20EC55292D58BCF3C7BE8DADB3AE86B690BE15898F80710138F9114BF902D58B713286EC9532E2AB8AEF776C937ABC95C120A7CAC5CDEE450E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb139105-1d18-4957-85ee-ffb92d5fc4ec"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a79e8","name":"Tatiana","lastName":"Korona","uuid":"242ABBBFFEE77CCA753799D7B8C238857B5C19A13A99A15DB63FA009FDB68B26C173F02128CE211E08D4F2CED4034DC9169B6AC2B08B385E6DFE1FE414E50273","orcidId":"0000-0001-7169-3412","documentHash":"70bf9799-3acd-4aa1-b984-bab520635bcf"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00875"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gradient-boosted tree","turning","tool life","cutting  tool wear","support vector machine","machine vision"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Machine vision-based gradient-boosted tree and support vector regression for tool life prediction in turning","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478161","mniswId":"8587","title":"International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0268-3768","eissn":"1433-3015","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"91b9fec0-ca77-430e-b382-9ff8e68fd6b9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9961b40970762631d5ec6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e9961b40970762631d5ec7","65e9961b40970762631d5ec8","65e9961b40970762631d5ec9","65e9961b40970762631d5eca","65e9961b40970762631d5ecb","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","65e9961b40970762631d5ecc","65e9961b40970762631d5ecd"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the essential elements of automated and intelligent machining processes is accurately predicting tool life.

The experimental investigation on the CNC machine is conducted to study the applicability of the proposed tool wear monitoring system. Experiments are performed using workpiece material made of alloy steel and PVD-coated cutting inserts, and flank wear is monitored. An imaging system consisting of an industrial camera, lens, and LED ring light is mounted on the machine to capture tool wear zone images. Images are then processed by algorithms developed in MATLAB<sup>®</sup>. Boosted tree methods and the SVM methodology have 96% and 97% prediction accuracy, respectively. Validation tests are carried out to determine the accuracy of proposed models. It is observed that the prediction accuracy of boosted three and SVM is good, with a maximum error of 5.89% and 7.56%, respectively.

A questionnaire composed of 11 questions was distributed to 232 patients, of which 225 were qualified for the study. The chi-square test of independence (χ2) was used to analyze the association between parameters of interest and groups of patients. The strength of studied relationships was measured with Cramer's V.\r\n\r\nResults: Patients showed limited knowledge of implants. Of the respondents, 75.6% heard about dental implants; however, 40% considered the dental implant as a set of a screw with a fixed crown. The major concern was the high cost (69.4%), followed by the need for surgery (31.2%). The Internet was the most popular source of information. The source of treatment financing has a strong correlation to the willingness to undergo treatment.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The study group demonstrated not a satisfactory extent of knowledge regarding dental implants. Dental professionals should make an effort to provide sufficient information to patients to avoid misunderstandings about the treatment.

Given the unique fluid homeostasis functions of the kidneys, dysregulation of the renal lymphatic system underlies the development of self-propagating congestive pathomechanisms. In this review, we outline the roles of the renal lymphatic system in heart failure (HF).\r\n\r\nRecent findings: Studies have uncovered several pathomechanisms involving the renal lymphatic system in congestive states, such as impaired interstitial draining by the renal lymphatic system, impaired structure and valves of renal lymphatics, lymphatic-induced increase in renal reabsorption of water and sodium, and development of albuminuria with proteinuria-induced renal lymphangiogenesis.

There are certain risk factors (CVRFs) that contribute to CVD. Risk factors associated with lifestyle such as tobacco consumption are particularly essential. Renalase is a recently discovered flavoprotein that may be involved in the progression of cardiometabolic diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the relation between CVRFs and blood renalase concentration (BRC). The study group consisted of 96 people (51% women) who were hospitalized in the internal medicine department. CVRFs were measured using the AHA Life 7 scale. The E3109Hu ELISA kit was used to assess BRC. We found higher BRC in groups with a lower number of CVRFs (p &lt; 0.05). We found a negative correlation between BRC and the number of CVRFs (r = −0.41). With the regression analysis, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical activity (LoPE) were independently associated with lower blood renalase concentration. ROC analysis indicated the highest accuracy of BRC &lt; 38.98 ng/mL in patients with ≥5 CVRFs. In conclusion, patients with a higher number of CVRFs had lower BRCs.

It manifests with acute pain and neurological deficits, leading to severe and permanent complications. This study aimed to assess changes in health-related quality of life and functional status following long-term intensive neurorehabilitation in a patient after severe sport-related head injury with a related SEH. The 60-year-old male patient experienced bilateral weakness of lower limbs, loss of sensation, and sphincter dysfunction. A laminectomy was performed, followed by a slight superficial and deep sensation improvement. The patient underwent intensive neurological rehabilitation treatment. The proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) method, PRAGMA device exercises, and water rehabilitation were provided. The study outcomes were assessed using the validated questionaries World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL-14) for health-related quality of life as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) for functional status. A beneficial clinical improvement was observed following the intensive rehabilitation using PNF techniques, training with a PRAGMA device, and water exercises in the case of SEH. The patient’s physical condition significantly improved, with an increase in the FIM score from 66 to 122 pts. (by 56 pts.) and in the HAQ score from 43 to 16 pts. (by 27 pts.). Additionally, the QOL level increased after rehabilitation, with an increase in the WHOQOL-BREF from 37 to 74 pts. (by 37 pts.) and a decrease in unhealthy or limited days, as assessed using the HRQOL-14, from 210 to 168 (by 42 days). In conclusion, the improvement in QOL and functional level in the SEH patient were associated with high-intensity rehabilitation, simultaneous integration of three therapeutic modalities, and committed patient cooperation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455631","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.2984 [16 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/8/2984","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1314097076263e8385b","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Miś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"570497fc-8d72-4dee-ace8-3f039659a1a8"},{"objectId":"6630e1314097076263e8385a","name":"Adam","lastName":"Druszcz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd128c15-c528-4c5c-a804-262b3ca0c61b"},{"objectId":"5e7093f6878c28a0473b40eb","name":"Jan","lastName":"Gnus","uuid":"655642784CB773AABA5A68078F951399A77BDA249B4DBB3D86A1927FE1F28C53333A954158D2C640340837DF8479B029DB22CB8D36AC59490941E0F5D8197EF5","orcidId":"0000-0002-6220-950X","documentHash":"d3331983-d6f2-431d-9aea-b9b3fda732d2"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e543","name":"Luba","lastName":"Ślósarz","uuid":"40E15311E971D6A3B97A54F95EE73F5F969CDDE0CF7068DABA7462C9CA8359964C62D58DC9B8158E3E1666CB2A0EFC8D55F732190494AE246F7F41854C2950FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-0507-6595","documentHash":"85f3f4ac-2e2c-4ceb-86d1-f8169dec4697"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12082984"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Wilkins Freeman’s novel Pem-broke (1994). Even though it is set in the third decade of the 19th century, the year of publication suggests that it just as well refers to the condition of New England after the Civil War. Hit by a complex crisis, concerning demography, economy, and mores, after 1865 the region entered a stage of decadence. Wilkins Freeman diagnosed its symptoms, such as the collapse of interpersonal communication and the hypertro-phy of individual will, showing that the portents of the decline of Puritan heritage had its roots in the first half of the century. With time, the symbolic system of New England culture collapsed and gave way to a new social order."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455635","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ca0e1b4097071d94858ea7","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"13","doi":null,"documentHash":"9554b510-ac07-4626-94a4-44d8d7747b4a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"370-377","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.ur.edu.pl/tematyikonteksty/article/download/8220/7087","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ea1c27409707132d3e15bc","name":"Marek","lastName":"Wilczynski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2fa1188-ab92-4ec7-8777-a357d4bc07be"}],"doi":"10.15584/tik.2023.23"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coal mining monitoring","large foreign objects detection","machine vision","multi-layer perceptron","gray wolf algorithm"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A new machine vision detection method for identifying and screening out various large foreign objects on coal belt conveyor lines","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bdc9","mniswId":"4160","title":"Complex & Intelligent Systems","doi":null,"issn":"2199-4536","eissn":"2198-6053","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"bb30b3e4-3bd3-4efa-ade5-6f784685a287"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e998e340970762631d5f63","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e998e340970762631d5f64","65e998e340970762631d5f65","65e998e340970762631d5f66","65e998e340970762631d5f67","65e998e340970762631d5f68","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Large foreign object transporting by coal mine conveyor belt may lead to production safety hazards. To reduce safety accidents during coal mining, a large foreign object detection method based on machine vision is proposed in this paper. An adaptive weighted multi-scale Retinex (MSR) image enhancement algorithm is proposed to improve the captured image quality of the belt conveyor line. An improved multi-scale template matching algorithm is designed by combining the frame difference and area methods to screen and identify large foreign objects mixed in coals. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network optimized by the Gray Wolf algorithm is introduced to identify the large objects. Experimental results show that the identification accuracy reaches 98.8% for the large foreign objects. Furthermore, industrial field test is carried out in the Gaoyang coal mine, and the filed test results demonstrate that the identification accuracy of the proposed method is more than 95%. Hence, the proposed method meets the industrial detection requirements and can be used in practices for detecting the large foreign objects."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455638","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e99940409707132d3163c2","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"9","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"12577c8f-285e-497f-b130-ffd2d364c319"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"5221-5234","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40747-023-01011-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e998e340970762631d5f68","name":"Xinhua","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eacff1f6-1980-4d62-b8c1-8fea78eb0cf9"},{"objectId":"65e998e340970762631d5f67","name":"He","lastName":"Lu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"20dfb20a-9466-4046-aae4-bfc767e9503d"},{"objectId":"65e998e340970762631d5f66","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Gardoni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f4c404d-a65b-4fb4-a803-d2c18d8ad7d3"},{"objectId":"65e998e340970762631d5f65","name":"Xu","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2e89698-9a7b-4783-8100-688ca4283897"},{"objectId":"65e998e340970762631d5f64","name":"Lili","lastName":"Dai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb10bbc5-5e34-4c2b-9fd4-df20bf9b3325"},{"objectId":"643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","name":"ZHIXIONG","lastName":"LI","uuid":"702756DCCCD3492C7F8BEE876ECFF5320F12A813CAE78A9EF23A2EFD6E44E8974DA4C0167114F64ABED373F069177BE3B59258C22EAA67DBD18E6C027CAFAFBA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59b058ba-526e-4828-8f00-3046d9f8887c"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.1007/s40747-023-01011-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","uid":"bX41kHc85ivocrWE0ISfROw","uuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","parentUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","rootUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","name":"Politechnika

A randomized controlled trial involving 111 participants aged 17–19 years was conducted. Participants were randomly assigned to either the football juggling learning (FJL) group or a control group. The FJL group underwent 70 sessions of football juggling learning, while the control group engaged in their normal daily activities without any exercise intervention during the same time frame. Both groups were assessed for EF performance and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans before and after the experiment. The executive function test included three tasks, namely, inhibition, working memory, and shifting. The results showed significant improvement in inhibition and shifting in both groups, and the FJL group showed greater improvement in these aspects of EF compared to the control group. Additionally, in comparison to the control group, the FJL group exhibited increased functional connectivity within the frontal, temporal, and cerebellar regions from the pre-test to the post-test. Notably, enhanced functional connectivity between the right superior temporal gyrus (posterior division) and left cerebellum 6 was identified in the FJL group and was associated with improved EF performance induced by football juggling learning. These findings shed light on the potential causal relationship between motor skill learning, EF, and brain plasticity. Importantly, our study provides preliminary evidence supporting the use of motor skill learning, such as football juggling, as a potential avenue for cognitive enhancement."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455642","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eedaa440970749973cdda6","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"387a9e1d-2269-4d73-8d91-1854a57994b6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"art. 1362418, s. 1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2024.1362418/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eedaa440970749973cddad","name":"Aiguo","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e737837c-b05e-4877-96c8-f3efcd65f201"},{"objectId":"65eedaa440970749973cddac","name":"Yifan","lastName":"Shi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5eb7badb-1b35-4c3d-a44e-0cda016e2d48"},{"objectId":"65eedaa440970749973cddab","name":"Zhiyuan","lastName":"Sun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0da6c903-8f8d-483d-b231-e4b05972cd59"},{"objectId":"65eedaa440970749973cddaa","name":"Dandan","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90651786-1b91-4e3f-88d8-b0c8313ed5ba"},{"objectId":"65eedaa440970749973cdda9","name":"Lina","lastName":"Zhu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a094b4c9-d978-4276-a192-0fd79e1b1135"},{"objectId":"65eedaa440970749973cdda8","name":"Xiang","lastName":"Gui","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4fe37a0a-d909-4aea-ae50-b6ed04739a81"},{"objectId":"65eedaa440970749973cdda7","name":"Xiaoxiao","lastName":"Dong","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4453d085-2fa1-4a30-9e16-3ea969e00e15"},{"objectId":"5e70937f878c28a0473ab330","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Klich","uuid":"3CA8A46CE2EE2B21222D941230183D766E4E4936AD03AFBC7B4A56AC4674943ED54AED9ECF2F8EA65FCAB21765E02581754ABF537FD84E0CDC5D8CB238F55847","orcidId":"0000-0002-8182-2975","documentHash":"7fe3c140-e490-44a5-b442-23b617a3c9e7"}],"doi":"10.3389/fnhum.2024.1362418"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["acute kidney disease","acute kidney injury","allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","augmented renal clearance","hyperfiltration","random forest classifier","tubular damage"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Markers of kidney damage: kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, interleukin (IL)-18, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) may ease early diagnosis of AKI. The aim of this study was to assess serum concentrations of KIM-1, IL-18, and NGAL in children undergoing HSCT in relation to classical markers of kidney function (creatinine, cystatin C, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) and to analyze their usefulness as predictors of kidney damage with the use of artificial intelligence tools. Serum concentrations of KIM-1, IL-18, NGAL, and cystatin C were assessed by ELISA in 27 children undergoing HSCT before transplantation and up to 4 weeks after the procedure. The data was used to build a Random Forest Classifier (RFC) model of renal injury prediction. The RFC model established on the basis of 3 input variables, KIM-1, IL-18, and NGAL concentrations in the serum of children before HSCT, was able to effectively assess the rate of patients with hyperfiltration, a surrogate marker of kidney injury 4 weeks after the procedure. With the use of the RFC model, serum KIM-1, IL-18, and NGAL may serve as markers of incipient renal dysfunction in children after HSCT."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455646","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.15791 [14

Human macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL, also known as hMGL/CLEC10A/CD301) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) specific to glycans containing terminal GalNAc residue, such as Tn antigen or LacdiNAc but also sialylated Tn antigens. Macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL) exhibits immunosuppressive properties, thus facilitating the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Hence, MGL is exploited by tumors and some pathogens to trick the host immune system and induce an immunosuppressive environment to escape immune control. The aims of this article are to discuss the immunological outcomes of human MGL ligand recognition, provide insights into the molecular aspects of these interactions, and review the MGL ligands discovered so far. Lastly, based on the human fetoembryonic defense system (Hu-FEDS) hypothesis, this paper raises the question as to whether MGL-mediated interactions may be relevant in the development of maternal tolerance toward male gametes and the fetus."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455649","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.17078 [27 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/23/17078","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739ceb9","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Szczykutowicz","uuid":"2F0C43D0FE8AF13E49F5AB52E8A6D54F63CC7CA7EBF066F1DECB2C5D19F2331246960BCA3704842A9214FB77B9AF8371F3AEB2D010FD88BA29710491359AADC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6746-6591","documentHash":"b718a2ec-dc56-4880-a20c-a30188984295"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms242317078"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["essential thrombocythemia","gene mutations","hematooncology","myelofibrosis","myeloproliferative neoplasms","next-generation sequencing","polycythemia vera"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The search for mutations in these three genes is required for the diagnosis of MPNs. Nevertheless, the progress that has been made in the field of molecular genetics has opened a new era in medicine. The search for additional mutations in MPNs is helpful in assessing the risk stratification, disease progression, transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), or choosing the right treatment. In some cases, advanced technologies are needed to find a clonal marker of the disease and establish a diagnosis.

NRFX is considered an emergent pharmaceutical contaminate. This review's objective is to evaluate empirical data on NRFX's removal from aqueous medium. The environmental danger of NRFX in the aquatic environment was validated by an initial ecotoxicological study. Graphene oxide/Metal Organic Framework (MOF) based composite, followed by Magnesium oxide/Chitosan/Graphene oxide composite gave the highest NRFX adsorption capacities (Qmax) of 1114.8 and 1000 mg/g, respectively. The main adsorption mechanisms for NRFX uptake include electrostatic interactions, H-bonds, π–π interactions, electron donor-acceptor interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and pore diffusion. The adsorptive uptake of NRFX were most suitably described by Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second order implying adsorbate-to-adsorbent electron transfer on a monolayer surface. The thermodynamics of NRFX uptake is heavily dependent on the makeup of the adsorbent, and the selection of the eluent for desorption from the solid phase is equally important. There were detected knowledge gaps in column studies and adsorbent disposal method. There's great interest in scale-up and industrial applications of research results that will aid in management of water resources for sustainability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455659","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016123001802?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef84e4097076263b981ab","name":"Christopher Chiedozie","lastName":"Obi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"331d858d-b5a0-4a4b-aeaf-b2237ddf3376"},{"objectId":"65eef84e4097076263b981aa","name":"Ebuka Chizitere","lastName":"Emenike","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d41904a4-17ef-4cb5-983f-82e7f7988099"},{"objectId":"65eef84e4097076263b981a9","name":"Kingsley O.","lastName":"Iwuozor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76aef4ce-1feb-4314-9aa7-56b3efa29702"},{"objectId":"65eef84e4097076263b981a8","name":"Chinenye Adaobi","lastName":"Igwegbe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61de60b9-0e05-4c23-8619-77428e40befb"},{"objectId":"65eef84e4097076263b981a7","name":"Paschal Enyinnaya","lastName":"Ohale","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f4e0dd5-eb60-494c-bf3a-e8a1e086713c"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900b8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Białowiec","uuid":"BDF818D6D6BB69D5CB05F525C0A728054D812F8C0CBC79878F9420A7D0179A7016B66891425C5163C20A634E1DFADC9AE9B75400AF4ECBB91B18B2827927D69A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5871-2129","documentHash":"81d1531c-2c4b-477c-b00c-645c599311ea"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.mex.2023.102180"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Psychological flexibility (PF), considered a specific mental toughness, has not been examined with regard to its relationship with anxiety in women after childbirth. We aimed to compare levels of anxiety, PF, and pain in women depending on the mode of birth, parity, and the magnitude of risk of developing an anxiety disorder. We also investigated the association of anxiety with PF and pain.\r\nMethods: A total of 187 women after childbirth completed validated questionnaires for anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety, Numerical Rating Scale for anxiety [NRS-A]), PF, and pain (Numerical Rating Scale for pain). Specific postpartum anxieties were assessed with a numerical scale from 0 to 10. The relationship of anxiety with PF and pain was examined. Women at low and high risk of developing anxiety disorder were compared in terms of PF, anxiety, and pain.\r\nResults: On the second postpartum day, women after cesarean birth demonstrated significantly greater anxiety on NRS-A and pain than those after vaginal birth. Primiparous women experienced significantly greater anxieties and pain compared to multiparous women. The higher the PF patients demonstrated, the less anxiety and pain they had. Patients at high risk of developing an anxiety disorder had a lower level of PF (P < .001) and higher levels of anxiety (P < .001) and pain (P < .01) than patients at low risk of developing an anxiety disorder. No difference in the anxiety of getting COVID-19 was observed between the groups (P > .05).\r\nConclusions: PF is an important psychological construct related to the mental and physical condition of women after childbirth. Increasing PF in women after childbirth may be considered as an important goal of preventive and intervention measures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455661","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"107-116","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmwh.13445","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e54a4097076263e8816f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Prokopowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"10f87f5b-c5c1-4f22-ac0e-61dae0b570de"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1ae1","name":"Izabella","lastName":"Uchmanowicz","uuid":"211CD83378E70AE49C511D80E5EB3C2443B5DDAA743ABA27E86AC1A53C36C36762757E03D23046BCE0EE016488EF4D52333CE89C10996CA090DEF7E0DF9E7BB4","orcidId":"0000-0001-5452-0210","documentHash":"23bc999d-ab0f-486b-9c1d-7bab9caa1f5a"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739de7c","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Stańczykiewicz","uuid":"364BD4F348A01C9FDA2EA2CAB8DD43415A45C22F3CBF7A6DD7EEF68173A592CFE1BD91880C29D6064588F9146495B8832EAE64DBD8CB73596B024D2B3BBB5AA0","orcidId":"0000-0001-9221-3502","documentHash":"7c352a2f-3a08-421d-b62e-1fee69e7bf89"}],"doi":"10.1111/jmwh.13445"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["green taxes","efficiency","sustainable development","green processed","green energy","SDGs"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Exploring the causal relationship among green taxes, energy intensity, and energy consumption in Nordic countries : Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9934740970762631d5aeb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e9934740970762631d5aec","65e9934740970762631d5aed","65e9934740970762631d5aee","65e9934740970762631d5aef","65e9934740970762631d5af0","65e9934740970762631d5af1","5e709203878c28a04738e98f"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Improving energy efficiency and minimizing environmental concerns through environmental laws and green taxes are regarded as the primary motivating factors of climate change policy. This analysis clarifies the significance of green taxes in lowering energy use and intensity from 1994 to 2020. As part of our contribution to the literature on energy economics, this study examines how green taxes interact with energy intensity and consumption in four Nordic nations. Environmental policies and sustainable development goals (SDGs) are driving new research into the effects of green taxes on energy consumption and intensity. According to the outcomes of fully modified ordinary least square (FMOLS), panel dynamic ordinary least square (PDOLS), and panel quantile regression, a green tax helps to reduce total energy consumption. It increases energy efficiency by motivating governments, companies, and citizens to encourage innovation in environment-related technology. When it comes to creating a more sustainable environment, the study argues that regulations that ensure the displacement of non-renewable resources while increasing energy efficacy should be implemented."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455663","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/14/5199","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9934740970762631d5af1","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Wysokińska-Senkus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a2d4df2-57e7-444a-af57-f2a311fe36bb"},{"objectId":"65e9934740970762631d5af0","name":"Ricardo Cosio","lastName":"Borda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f1b17a4-30ef-4631-9a3e-cbb659c7e4fb"},{"objectId":"65e9934740970762631d5aef","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Senkus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"826769bd-e75b-4528-9276-ff205a6b5cbf"},{"objectId":"65e9934740970762631d5aee","name":"Zeeshan","lastName":"Hamid","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bfc9e07-e1be-4451-ad05-df979602a7d7"},{"objectId":"65e9934740970762631d5aed","name":"Adnan Ahmed ","lastName":"Sheikh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6eddd6c7-b3a4-4d28-a85d-9b0ba697add8"},{"objectId":"65e9934740970762631d5aec","name":"Nihal","lastName":"Ahmed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2c32bb4-3782-4288-9d5f-a8c84358aa41"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e98f","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Glabiszewski","uuid":"45F57E2EFA1301368B19DF5297C7ED11A1B220F57C25A96C00F4FA58CA3354A493400269A5E4E011149E9C5480FED02F32482192661EAAB7ED426299AF9D1FDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6469-8466","documentHash":"e552f442-aec7-4b37-8d67-0c5759b99c78"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15145199"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

As the demand for HHAs increases, there is a need to promote HHAs' job satisfaction and retention. In this cross-sectional community-partnered study, we examined whether mutuality (e.g., quality of the HHA-patient relationship), is associated with job satisfaction among HHAs caring for adults with HF. Mutuality was assessed with the Mutuality Scale, which measures overall mutuality and its four domains (reciprocity, love and affection, shared pleasurable activities, and shared values). Our final sample of 200 HHAs was primarily female. The mean overall mutuality score was 2.92 out of 4 (SD 0.79). In our final model, overall mutuality and each of the four domains were associated with increased job satisfaction; however, only the shared pleasurable activities domain was significant (aPR: 1.15 [1.03-1.32]). Overall, mutuality may play a role in promoting job satisfaction among HHAs.

This solution is known as the frequency Ω-counter and its main disadvantage is the need to perform calculations on large data sets and numbers. The presented solution is the first that integrates high resolution, multichannel frequency counter together with a computing module in one integrated circuit. This allows to significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred outside the chip, which speeds up the operation and increases the counter’s capabilities. The entire design was described using hardware description language (HDL) and implemented in a Kintex-7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device manufactured by AMD (formerly Xilinx), targeting low consumption of logical resources to fit multiple mea\u0002surement channels in one chip. The described hardware computing module operates on-the-fly without having to store all timestamps in memory. The amount of data to be calculated (up to 100,001 timestamps), the duration of the measurement gate time (up to 1 s), and the precision of the result representation can be adjusted."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455668","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eae1cd409707216edaa96a","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"229","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"1d9761c4-0ba8-4f9e-83d9-b9483eec3e7d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"229","pagesFromTo":"114404","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224124002896?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eae1cd409707216edaa96b","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Beczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4344e9a-05f0-4940-b889-0012fbe05adf"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3371","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":"064670DCC195A8601CC1B7E823E9C543D33F9C99A354B88F26B9E0382835EA1C650E975D748E6C82D3150B846D36DEE2FE6D74D2AA9C1BC02C988F1022E6B186","orcidId":"0000-0001-5744-5981","documentHash":"f154dfbc-d5bb-4fc6-a5c3-6bc101bdffbf"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2024.114404"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["pomiary geodezyjne","geometria tokarki","instrumenty geodezyjne","światłowody"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["geodetic measurements","lathe geometry","geodetic instruments","optic fibers"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Geodezyjne pomiary odchyłek geometrycznych łoża tokarki z zastosowaniem światłowodowego sygnalizatora celu","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abfaad204581b62ebb00","mniswId":"201148","title":"Przegląd Geodezyjny","doi":null,"issn":"0033-2127","eissn":"2449-9412","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"65c589c2-5892-4b01-bcf4-49025afd1ada"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eaf1e940970762632c2be7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eaf1e940970762632c2be8","5e7091fc878c28a04738e249","5e7091fc878c28a04738e24a"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem badań było opracowanie oraz przetestowanie metod geodezyjnych pomiarów tokarki z wykorzystaniem techniki światłowodowej.

work applies the coupled JINTRAC and QuaLiKiz-neural-network (QLKNN) model on the ohmic current ramp-up phase of a JET D discharge. The chosen scenario exhibits a hollow profile attributed to core impurity accumulation, which is observed to worsen with the increasing fuel ion mass from D to T. A dynamic D simulation was validated, evolving j, , , , nBe, nNi, and nW for 7.25 s along with self-consistent equilibrium calculations, and was consequently extended to simulate a pure T plasma in a predict-first exercise. The light impurity (Be) accounted for Zeff while the heavy impurities (Ni, W) accounted for Prad. This study reveals the role of transport on the hollowing, which originates from the isotope effect on the electron-ion energy exchange affecting . This exercise successfully affirmed isotopic trends from previous H experiments and provided engineering targets used to recreate the D q-profile in T experiments, demonstrating the potential of neural network surrogates for fast routine analysis and discharge design. However, discrepancies were found between the impurity transport behaviour of QuaLiKiz and QLKNN, which lead to notable hollowing differences. Further investigation into the turbulent component of heavy impurity transport is recommended."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455673","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf16","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"63","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"d026af48-e5ab-4135-ab6f-f410b349547a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"63","pagesFromTo":"66014","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/acc083","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f3b","name":"J.","lastName":"Mailloux","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32df896f-7038-4d8f-8835-47278b4ae5bf"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f3a","name":"C.F.","lastName":"Maggi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e293cac6-9f34-44b5-8d01-e28a6f2b9769"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f39","name":"E.","lastName":"Lerche","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e3d65e0a-d23c-4222-8cf8-95d72c25ba6d"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f38","name":"F.","lastName":"Koechl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34157044-5424-4a6c-b269-12157549f700"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f37","name":"D.B.","lastName":"King","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"91b1d7f0-238e-4396-9793-57aa0f348a7a"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f36","name":"D.L.","lastName":"Keeling","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1c86ece-e233-4e02-a532-959bcbc91aa5"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f35","name":"A.","lastName":"Kappatou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8925c1f0-c469-430f-ab1c-421cb8c933db"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f34","name":"J.","lastName":"Hobirk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a10f1649-2536-449f-8b84-7b5ca9c4e491"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f33","name":"J.","lastName":"Garcia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81b2e37b-ab87-4682-84b8-5fab86df6a43"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f32","name":"F.J.","lastName":"Casson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0d3b4303-359f-48d6-9044-38b0441de8cc"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f31","name":"C.","lastName":"Bourdelle","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"299d6eb0-d7ad-430c-b941-629aa64e142b"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f30","name":"C.D.","lastName":"Challis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23c88e29-370a-422f-8c0d-6d0fc3e5a417"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f2f","name":"J.","lastName":"Citrin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"790b87e4-b64f-4ca5-b02b-ef7a2ca8a8b0"},{"objectId":"65eb0f2f409707216ede2f2e","name":"A.","lastName":"Ho","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b53ed17-6e91-42ed-90ea-833e2e129d21"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/acc083"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Continental

As methods, these movements have engendered the metaphysical questions that different new and feminist materialist practices engage. The volume follows these four movements as method-question-actions in four parts, each of which is preceded by an introductory framing-essay.

The analysis evaluated the clinical procedures performed, including the type and material of the prosthetic, the type of cement used, laser setting parameters, retrieval time, and retrieval success.\r\n\r\nResults: Out of the 52 abutments, 50 were successfully retrieved without causing any damage (>95%) using either an Er,Cr:YSGG laser (N = 6) or an Er:YAG laser (N = 46). In one case, a crown was partially sectioned to prevent any negative impact of laser irradiation on the adhesive strength between the post and tooth, and in another case, a fracture occurred during debonding. The restorations consisted of 13 lithium disilicate and 39 zirconia units, including six veneers, 38 single crowns, and three fixed partial dentures (FPDs). The retrieval time varied depending on the restoration type, material thickness, cement type, retention form/fitting of the abutment and restoration, ranging from 2.25 ±0.61 minutes for veneers, 6.89 ±8.07 minutes for crowns, to 25 ±10 minutes per abutment for FPDs. Removal of a zirconia crown required more time, 7.12±8.91 minutes, compared to a lithium disilicate crown, 5.86 ±2.41 minutes. The debonding time was influenced by the laser settings as well as materials and types of prosthesis.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Erbium lasers present a safe and effective alternative to invasive methods for removing ceramic restorations, without causing harm to the abutment or prosthesis. Laser-assisted debonding allows for recementation of the restorations during the same appointment, making it a conservative and viable option for ceramic crown retrieval in clinical settings.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455676","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"art.e0295957 [17 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0295957","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1324097076263e8387c","name":"Sompop","lastName":"Bencharit","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a24464d-fbbd-41cf-ac63-d8cd692978d7"},{"objectId":"6630e1324097076263e8387b","name":"Janina","lastName":"Golob Deeb","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f55bb40-315c-44e2-a09c-9912837dec13"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b5340","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Grzech-Leśniak","uuid":"153AD1060005A953869F6F88C8174621DDE1ABDE181BCF9F14958AF9C428E39E1888677841FAC0C2FD72C5922BEDB24C79D9ABC2B3B8566EAD5F3814D9B00682","orcidId":"0000-0002-5700-4577","documentHash":"8e6d520c-6817-4985-8517-ebc7c43fa01d"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0295957"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["photodynamic therapy","nanotechnology","cancer","combined cancer therapy","quantum dots","photodynamic diagnostic"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Based on our previous studies, we discovered that O-lkyl naringenin derivatives and their oximes exhibit antimicrobial activity against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The current study was aimed at determining the modulatory effect of these compounds on the adhesion of selected representatives of the intestinal microbiota: Escherichia coli, a commensal representative of the intestinal microbiota, and Enterococcus faecalis, a bacterium that naturally colonizes the intestines but has disease-promoting potential. To better reflect the variety of real-life scenarios, we performed these studies using two different intestinal cell lines: the physiologically functioning (“healthy”) 3T3-L1 cell line and the disease-mimicking, cancerous HT-29 line. The study was performed in vitro under static and microfluidic conditions generated by the Bioflux system. We detected the modulatory effect of the tested O-alkyl naringenin derivatives on bacterial adhesion, which was dependent on the cell line studied and was more significant for E. coli than for E. faecalis. In addition, it was noticed that this activity was affected by the concentration of the tested compound and its structure (length of the carbon chain). In summary, O-alkyl naringenin derivatives and their oximes possess a promising modulatory effect on the adhesion of selected representatives of the intestinal microbiota."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455681","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.1076 [16 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/12/6/1076","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e7144097076263e891cc","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kozłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c09413b1-6e06-482c-b33c-eee6e009d36f"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1415","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Baczyńska","uuid":"0D49D163A479AA0A702E2563AFDA45C981F362482AD5AEB17FC48CABE708AB8526838A63F448F2E850FCA34A25F7A75018FADB2DC1A0BA433D955F86DFFAC7EC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6781-6758","documentHash":"98a2219c-71f1-479b-8d91-5922e86c538d"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12e4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Duda-Madej","uuid":"3C6469857A9ED0355051163521948C95EAEB974D4E0ACD3C6E2E7C7F0D64A04C0022E8BBEEEC0418DD1AB3F4F9E30F7C927DCA0E49141EAD9A08E841A6B85654","orcidId":"0000-0001-8559-1695","documentHash":"732a5ebd-f75b-45c6-b9ac-2eb76d581a3e"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739cee9","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krzyżek","uuid":"5A5C5F448947827DF3503BE1405F215971A9C18E1588FAC86EF24280230857EE557E200D625E69FE067ACF2840002582334FF87ED3D7B0AF2AFA67E13E8E7E21","orcidId":"0000-0002-3117-8894","documentHash":"ef5bdcd2-d5cf-473c-87be-8d50ad063953"}],"doi":"10.3390/antibiotics12061076"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARi)","Alpha blockers","Benign prostatic hyperplasia","Bladder cancer"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

We sought to examine the effect of 5-ARi on new BCa diagnoses in a large US database.\r\n\r\nMethods: Men ≥ 50 y/o with a prescription for 5-ARi after BPH diagnosis were identified in the IBM® Marketscan® Research de-identified Databases between 2007 and 2016 and matched with paired controls. Incident BCa diagnoses were identified after BPH diagnosis and/or pharmacologic treatment. Multivariable regression modeling adjusting for relevant factors was implemented. Sub-group analyses by exposure risk were performed to explore the association between 5-ARi and BCa over time. Administration of alpha-blockers (α-B) w/o 5-ARi was also examined.\r\n\r\nResults: In total, n = 24,036 men on 5-ARi, n = 107,086 on 5-ARi plus alpha-blockers, and n = 894,275 without medical therapy for BPH were identified. The percentage of men diagnosed with BCa was 0.8% for the 5-ARi, 1.4% for the 5-ARi + α-B, and 0.6% for the untreated BPH group of incident BCa (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56 - 1.47), and 1.08, 95%CI 0.89 - 1.30, respectively). This was also true at both shorter (≤ 2 yr) and longer-term (> 2 yr) follow up. In addition, α-B alone had no change in BCa risk (HR 1.06, 0.86-1.30).\r\n\r\nConclusions: We did not find any diminished risk of new BCa in men treated with 5-ARi (i.e., chemoprotective effect). The current report suggests that 5-ARi do not change a man's bladder cancer risk.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455683","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"2783-2791","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00345-023-04551-4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e3b","name":"Michael L.","lastName":"Eisenberg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a6a991c-eee4-45c9-b62e-89294128737b"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e3a","name":"Nicolas","lastName":"Seranio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"306403e4-0296-4a41-a750-d79bf167e2b3"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e39","name":"Wade","lastName":"Muncey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"841006e2-4a6e-4329-bf08-c7fb8880eba8"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e38","name":"Rajesh","lastName":"Nair","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0f769f0-0a8b-471a-819e-059962c757c1"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e37","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Soria","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fb9fd92-afa2-4cdf-b96b-3b17a7c12d0d"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e36","name":"Benjamin","lastName":"Pradere","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eececbb7-890a-4c7b-95ac-bf7a8e0fb9d1"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e35","name":"Evan","lastName":"Mulloy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e6575e8-7a23-4102-aab9-850ea165387d"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e34","name":"Shufeng","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4bf519b-f5e9-4a1d-aa1a-6a542b63079f"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e33","name":"Satvir","lastName":"Basran","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7672d841-bde4-4efc-8834-893ff5873a0f"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e32","name":"Frank","lastName":"Glover","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65c2a624-876b-43e8-81bf-161bdc05552f"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e31","name":"Federico","lastName":"Belladelli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8741c18f-d037-4c50-950c-54e045ad95f4"},{"objectId":"6630e4864097076263e86e30","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Del Giudice","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"91b20c5b-e9d9-4f59-9d6d-0e7d0e21faf8"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8eee","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":"FE9C4D23724D3D055D045282F9AD75FAB018A19DA85AE822459B00807DB4C4694A93AFC06467CDCBCF4A964D57A95272B7F072D375AB7EFF177F7F6C2609DCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1727-2283","documentHash":"98c9e9c8-1a51-4d6a-b2af-f010aba6a0be"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00345-023-04551-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Artemisia herba-alba","glucose uptake","hyperglycemia","hyperinsulinemia","insulin resistance","oxidative stress"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ethanolic Extract of Artemisia herba-alba Ameliorates Hyperinsulinemia and Hyperglycemia-Induced HepG2 Cells Through Cell Survival Promotion, Oxidative Stress Mitigation, and Insulin Signaling Restoration","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547da8b","mniswId":"21855","title":"Current Bioactive Compounds","doi":null,"issn":"1573-4072","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d2244463-e714-4c82-ae33-96020c8f6651"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eeff564097076263b9a35e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eeff564097076263b9a35f","602f9be49543c7410626f682","5e709422878c28a0473b6cc8","5e7091fc878c28a04738e29a","61e785b87523406748fb8694","65eeff564097076263b9a360"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: In recent years, diabetes and its risk factors were linked to an augmented occurrence of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which are considered major causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetes mellitus subjects. Hyperinsulinemia (HI) and hyperglycemia (HG) are recognized as insulin resistance-inducers, which can trigger several alterations in cellular biogenesis besides inflammatory signaling activation. As a folk medicine in many countries, Artemisia herbaalba has been preclinically studied for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and showed beneficial effects on hyperglycemia. Methods: In the current work, we explored the potential mechanisms underlying the antihyperglycemic behavior of the ethanolic extract of A. herba-alba and its bioactive compounds. Results: Obtained data demonstrated that ethanolic extract of A. herba-alba enhances HepG2 viability and proliferation, decreases considerably the apoptosis, through the regulation of pro-and anti-apoptotic pathways implying p53, p21 and Bcl-2 genes expression and Pan caspases activation under IR concentration at the lowest concentrations. A. herba-alba extract treatment additionally exhibited a potential antioxidant effect, evidenced by the significant decrease in total intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the improved mitochondrial transmembrane potential in HG/HI-challenged HepG2 cells (p < 0.001). Furthermore, A. herba-alba positively upregulated Irs1 and Irs2 as well as Akt/Pi3K pathway compared to insulin-resistant untreated cells, and subsequently stimulated glucose uptake in response to insulin infusion, as a consequence of its signal transduction restoration. Conclusion: Overall, the obtained data highlighted the beneficial effects of A. herba-alba ethanolic extract in ameliorating insulin signaling and liver cells metabolic balance, and shed the light for its use as a promising and safe therapeutic lead for the management of type 2 diabetes and underlying metabolic failures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455685","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"77 - 93","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/128963","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eeff564097076263b9a360","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb493987-c171-4881-9344-6e24334be083"},{"objectId":"65eeff564097076263b9a35f","name":"Yasmina","lastName":"Bourebaba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03c1ab00-9aa5-47f5-a1d1-4f64109e10d6"},{"objectId":"61e785b87523406748fb8694","name":"LYNDA","lastName":"BOUREBABA","uuid":"E9E482563FE63E31FD25D3D5B3F1FE97F8C784FB74495DAFBEE514285948D7708ABC57D70A7A7210E8AB66B1FA91DAC4CF304A8A8A5BB6233A578F342B73A0C1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"963e7a14-47c1-4f88-ba64-cc93c7c9718d"},{"objectId":"602f9be49543c7410626f682","name":"Malwina","lastName":"Mularczyk","uuid":"5144D17724771F33080F54F9A1B0C2802518F9139120BCFB6EC3D0136EFC666C6554E5114824F93A877C3185E285A8F9A8C9F725023DDF84525E6113F5C3990E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8189-9545","documentHash":"a4fa34dd-fb26-4f62-8062-9fff72784ecc"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cc8","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"KORNICKA-GARBOWSKA","uuid":"FB251AF6CDC68A7B2BD091B986BD0B657263E06AC054EF862478A7BE819360443931EC06C7D139FF7724DC0E8FD2661566B5070F37A9F45AE65C450D0C74284A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2311-5789","documentHash":"71f86337-2b0a-4908-9ad6-f352ecd3d55a"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e29a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Marycz","uuid":"232BD10216D5623A2C97AEE2B23109CFB6C3A3BD5B79AA43203A222A1A37A575D9EBD9FFFDABB7F4C32C3CDC7BA67C6A7DE4A8F0D86DC6A5DF0F1CF93573FCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3676-796X","documentHash":"927d7659-0c17-40c1-bed6-9f2cf8d61940"}],"doi":"10.2174/1573407219666230120103107"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biocidal surfacesWound healingQuaternization"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a047395424","63a67239752340219799cdbe","5e709269878c28a04739540c","6289a029752340212cca7ee4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate based hydrogel with intrinsic antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model of a major wound infecting human pathogen","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c1c","mniswId":"6320","title":"European Polymer Journal","doi":null,"issn":"0014-3057","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"efda0e03-fe16-49cf-ae98-7395f9c1133e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2024,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eec50d4097076263b8241e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6289a029752340212cca7ee4","5e709269878c28a04739540c","63a67239752340219799cdbe","5e709269878c28a047395424","67334da6fdbe830349a2adb8","67334da6fdbe830349a2adb9","67334da6fdbe830349a2adba","67334da6fdbe830349a2adbb","67334da6fdbe830349a2adbc","67334da6fdbe830349a2adbd","67334da6fdbe830349a2adbe","67334da6fdbe830349a2adbf"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Wound dressings represent the first important defense line against potentially life -threatening infections. Successful materials should unify efficiency, simplicity of production with the ease of application. Cationic polymers based on quaternary ammonium salt moieties along the polymer chain promise high efficacy against growth of relevant pathogens including drug -resistant strains. We present a novel and easy -to -handle wound dressing material based on the well-defined copolymers of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA) and 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA), using quaternization with 1,6-dibromohexane for hydrogel formation. The material obtained from this robust approach was perfectly biocompatible with human dermal fibroblasts and revealed an auspicious degree of intrinsic antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa as a model pathogen for hospital -acquired infections. Formation of bacterial biofilms was prevented in early- and late -stages and even planktonic cells were killed upon gel contact. The rheological properties of the hydrogel materials were comprehensively characterized in both dry and swollen states. Excellent biological performance and appropriate viscoelastic properties qualify the hydrogels from our production approach as truly promising novel wound dressing materials with long-lasting and contact -active bactericidal activities. We believe that this charmingly simple procedure and the mechanical properties of the hydrogel may open new avenues towards cost-effective next -generation first -line wound -care materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455687","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eec50d4097076263b8241f","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"205","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"3eb80ef3-211f-4afc-9b4f-d9e368d73fc2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"205","pagesFromTo":"112758-112765","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67334da6fdbe830349a2adbf","name":"Frank","lastName":"Rosenau","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8749daa-8510-48d9-8e20-05d040f0b5ab"},{"objectId":"67334da6fdbe830349a2adbe","name":"Agata","lastName":"Przekora","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8da93f4-6045-4e41-a2fd-bbf7981deb06"},{"objectId":"67334da6fdbe830349a2adbd","name":"Tanja","lastName":"Weil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"36b41a4c-f823-4b82-a49a-e98fa7bd5fb4"},{"objectId":"67334da6fdbe830349a2adbc","name":"Tilmann","lastName":"Herberger","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"01180e4c-116a-4873-961a-fa6783ea00f1"},{"objectId":"67334da6fdbe830349a2adbb","name":"Miroslav","lastName":"Slouf","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"636a6f20-6efe-4fa6-a83b-474d29a32e28"},{"objectId":"67334da6fdbe830349a2adba","name":"Jan","lastName":"Duniec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"87c7624b-8bdf-45ad-90af-1f4912f0139a"},{"objectId":"67334da6fdbe830349a2adb9","name":"Marta","lastName":"Trzaskowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"320f787f-282c-44c8-9ff5-3735229e1fd1"},{"objectId":"67334da6fdbe830349a2adb8","name":"Ann-Kathrin","lastName":"Kissmann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ad5b985-e93f-43f9-baca-1d9911a82686"},{"objectId":"63a67239752340219799cdbe","name":"Hitesh","lastName":"Katariya","uuid":"CCC312015EF4151BA96E14056DAFC5BA8FFA96A62558F1EB72FD0B12392907F3103927E97A304ECD08381495AB8681C350FF33273E1ECC6DBD13A74FCAAE10B0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b8c0c4c-195e-45ac-add0-18f2b9db3462"},{"objectId":"6289a029752340212cca7ee4","name":"Ahmet","lastName":"Cetinkaya","uuid":"79A0C39A3A72706322D8EB7BB8FBABC960CF7F83C7D2B4BBBBF76BE4AFB08D51ABCEF57C305FB402C65395759F78757767E7F17CBDD77EFE89BA06A52A9AEA0D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fa2ab74-0267-4d9a-b2da-7e8d52148b60"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a047395424","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pietrasik","uuid":"60C28E8F2047AD91AF929416ADDD3E362229628674A513911ECB77F68C5D0FA56D795A7854D2E4C1B1B2F8D5205EF0271B27E64C40FFFAF16CC6D3DD8560B21E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7438-9627","documentHash":"e70bc56a-906e-4c3f-9dbc-48135e442bbe"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a04739540c","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Lipińska","uuid":"4D88C0BA6FCBC7A9AF9761267F716C9C9EF4026A70CB680B239A751545CFD818BF2C7713868832A365B6B644EB6E38BFBBA293C62313F3075C2339A6EE0024BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6581-5126","documentHash":"9b27bc9d-e949-46e9-b625-e519974ef266"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2024.112758"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Finland","Paris Peace Conference","history of cartography","manuscript maps","borders"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918e878c28a04737e44c","uid":"bOsTJEvmlvq1TPV2NgBPXuw","uuid":"75fdfd10-8c3b-4407-8102-72c611142d0e","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Nauk o Ziemi i Gospodarki Przestrzennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e90"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cartographic sources on Finland in Polish documents prepared for the Paris Peace Conference","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a298","mniswId":"200147","title":"Polish Cartographical Review","doi":null,"issn":"2450-6966","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"6cd451e4-50f7-4df0-bdfc-ef157dcd40c1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9d2a0409707132d37e80c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e90"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article reinstates an understanding of cartography far beyond that of a strictly geographical\ndiscipline, primarily concerned with the depiction of space in various aspects of societies.

CP remains a problem for up to 21.3% of renal transplant recipients (RTRs). Our research aimed to establish the possible association between serum levels of neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the presence and intensity of CP in RTR.Methods: The study was performed on a group of 129 RTRs, who were divided according to the presence or absence of pruritus in the previous 3 days. The assessment of pruritus was performed with the use of a numeric rating scale (NRS), 4-Item Itch Questionnaire (4IIQ), and Itchy Quality of Life (Itchy QoL). A total of 129 blood samples with a volume of 9 ml were drawn from RTRs during the monthly routine control. Serum levels (pg/mL) of NT-4 and BDNF were measured by the ELISA.Results: Pruritic RTRs have statistically significantly higher serum concentrations of NT-4 serum level compared to non-pruritic RTRs (229.17 +/- 143.86 pg/mL and 153.08 +/- 78.19 pg/mL [p = 0.024], respectively). Moreover, a statistically significant difference between pruritic and non-pruritic RTRs with healthy controls was shown (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Although there was a numerically higher serum concentration of BDNF in pruritic RTRs (32.18 +/- 7.31 pg/mL vs. 31.58 +/- 10.84 pg/mL), the difference did not reach statistical significance. No statistically significant difference was also seen in BDNF serum levels between RTRs and healthy controls. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant, positive correlation between serum concentration of NT-4 and NRS score (p = 0.008, r = 0.357).Conclusions: The results indicate higher NT-4 serum concentration in RTRs with pruritus compared to RTRs without pruritus. Furthermore, the study revealed a statistically significant, positive correlation between the serum concentration of NT-4 and NRS score."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455691","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"2785-2796","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13555-023-01029-4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"634a1b297523402e34127229","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Tyczyńska","uuid":"91AD06F3BBDE63F469495935C172A64684E78E2468957D1E852D397138633AAC48A7A88E525290A335B019AE318DA616654304029CABE850BCBD5C4205E23EE6","orcidId":"0000-0002-7589-8404","documentHash":"ecc18197-ea9e-48f7-99c8-b4667572a0f3"},{"objectId":"5ebed479752340254fc3fe74","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":"953EA17B3EEB96D211EDAD12A32003E63501AE6C8C8A145A9D2AAAA036ED034093277AE7E6C67B7F2F758CBBE21B482F948146F58906D5B6DB12DB142786C0E3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4722-8531","documentHash":"40b209b2-c09b-4418-af1e-9f9342da2c19"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf6d3","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Nowicka-Suszko","uuid":"6EF9BE82B81BF610F12BE7B56B917722CCE3D14123E11190D920906210CEEB742A2B5F56D0409FBBA00007B6EE8369DAA0DE883CE3C8BCB5B06C8E67F2A35868","orcidId":"0000-0001-7502-3504","documentHash":"fbe79003-8ddf-45cf-bdaf-12a22a8631ca"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af71d","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Augustyniak-Bartosik","uuid":"1FF9D1FBCC323208504FEBE7154D0D29BC908D605E0594CCC95C9314700ADFEDE638EEA87EB59B51E5F8090D47F56B7B1E030EB902A9C5239FD412A37CF154FA","orcidId":"0000-0003-3969-396X","documentHash":"e3c879d6-9eaa-4bb2-8042-18eacb7b1487"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1375","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Szepietowski","uuid":"BFD55FB7279B9CE2DAE7D9EFAF01C474DAEE7B50FDB68898A3D2A2D0C28321A5F4FE19CB55BA9C55BF78966C75801D554A4A7A4917DC51DB31C2E704BDF467AB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0766-6342","documentHash":"230cd8c8-61bf-41ea-9ec1-60bff6453cd6"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1354","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":"24BD21FEF2D2C8CA3880ADF08AA3B3D165FA3F8DE2FB61B86CDB2AA8DF8817AE7760984796CF9BA0161C5D4A7C13EE580B1DBF8BEBD37D39EBB784E641B3B2A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-2632-2409","documentHash":"d503f845-e3f0-4f29-af55-9660bae3a658"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1303","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Janczak","uuid":"24CDBE257A3D733C9E967F8AC4967AE5BEC1348F600A657C3A00C52AF0570C29F0BD748422CD792FC047F1743E3E9366706AFE5F8A7D785C0566224F5080D1A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4671-9128","documentHash":"c262b5e5-a18a-4c32-ae69-ec4095471dd2"}],"doi":"10.1007/s13555-023-01029-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["econometric micromodel","econometric forecasting","small industrial enterprise","financial liquidity","debt recovery efficiency"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Financial liquidity and debt recovery efficiency forecasting in a small industrial enterprise","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d248","mniswId":"17941","title":"Risks","doi":null,"issn":"2227-9091","eissn":"2227-9091","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cd24296f-d3db-479a-a478-0927c4f65a4a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9938e40970762631d5e03","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c0878c28a04739bf6b"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Rational small business management necessitates the development of a system for recording important internal information.

An\r\neconometric model was used to build forecasts for both of these characteristics in a small business.\r\nAn iterative method of forecasting from structural-form equations was used, which guarantees\r\nsynchronization of forecasts under feedback conditions. The current use of the reduced form of\r\nthe model to build such forecasts results in divergent forecasts that are not useful in small business\r\nmanagement. They can also lead to wrong decisions.

Worldwide, 50 million people have the disease, and it is estimated that there will be 150 million by 2050. Today, healthcare for AD patients consumes 1% of the global economy. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, AD begins in the brain by accumulating and aggregating Aβ peptides and forming β-amyloid fibrils (Aβ42). However, in clinical trials, reducing Aβ peptide production and amyloid formation in the brain did not slow cognitive decline or improve daily life in AD patients. Prevention studies in cognitively unimpaired people at high risk or genetically destined to develop AD also have not slowed cognitive decline. These observations argue against the amyloid hypothesis of AD etiology, its development, and disease mechanisms.

Almost all reports questioning the relation between BCC and rosacea are focused on rhinophyma.\r\n\r\nAim: To examine the possible connection of BCC and rosacea.\r\n\r\nMaterial and methods: 110 patients with BCC located on the face treated surgically in the Dermatosurgery Unit in 2020-2021 were included in the study. A trained dermatologist assessed the presence or absence of concomitant rosacea and assessed its severity according to the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA).\r\n\r\nResults: Fifty-one (46.4%) subjects with BCC and concomitant clinically diagnosed rosacea were found. In our group 35.5% of women had BCC located on the cheeks, while in men most cancers were located on the nose (55%, n = 11), however this difference has not reached statistical significance.\r\n\r\nConclusions: The incidence of rosacea in our population was undoubtedly higher, comparing to the normative population. Both rosacea and BCC share the same risk factors - UV exposure, the potential association should not be neglected.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455697","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"40","pagesFromTo":"642-646","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Basal-cell-carcinoma-and-rosacea-coincidence-r-nor-relationship-,7,51238,1,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e7044097076263e89027","name":"Kevin","lastName":"Janczura","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d476fa45-cac0-49b7-9661-07d291ac3206"},{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1d1f","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Stefaniak","uuid":"1654B28F82AF4B2D1120FBE66867F4ECE4D70764280CBC2B11AA64DB45D722AFA1EC2B657B6912639CFA9893763A0171DECC9F5F793A22E567F1E629B3AAF29A","orcidId":"0000-0002-3714-8434","documentHash":"050058a1-1e3f-433e-b918-d5d0d05595ca"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af822","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Chlebicka","uuid":"3A66954A70E0E262BA260F8410A9B57260B4AF4B88FBA25C11E4FFC9BE50263C080807FEA1B20033767FF80DB3D5EF25C3BE5F9BD711FFED26EE2037DC2F59CB","orcidId":"0000-0001-8120-7270","documentHash":"35f7dfd8-0fdb-40d3-a716-ce7cf74ef604"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af18f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"5F4F866FC2794B3DAE2C9374681489C84E8A2AEFC97AC24E773B575875359BA4B1766909A0D1FBE5C7891A671C9C33DE2E668B0F9ACE611DF18971821E298528","orcidId":"0000-0002-6210-1080","documentHash":"de97893c-82c7-4e5a-9a80-27cff0fbba27"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1a75","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bieniek","uuid":"5ECE69B4DBDC70EC7B524F437D00E5827325E101E44BA5B5B8BDD25C7A762983F10586EAF0B7007E5165424966EEA6FF88CBD6936CA0F9C0B94A07D4D66BFC38","orcidId":"0009-0001-3520-6207","documentHash":"354cb741-1898-4b50-bd89-37ab2e8f301e"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1375","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Szepietowski","uuid":"BFD55FB7279B9CE2DAE7D9EFAF01C474DAEE7B50FDB68898A3D2A2D0C28321A5F4FE19CB55BA9C55BF78966C75801D554A4A7A4917DC51DB31C2E704BDF467AB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0766-6342","documentHash":"230cd8c8-61bf-41ea-9ec1-60bff6453cd6"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2ee","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Matusiak","uuid":"85FA73E2536180BFB173C3B85994BC01CDE06A1A5CBC9BB48D93E17F5647C043B8E25796E6684841FC6CF41073B1B4003BCF44AC00B7C9BF7BE081FA30B5DAA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2067-4929","documentHash":"29f687b4-e28f-4241-a46f-01a9f3449417"}],"doi":"10.5114/ada.2023.130523"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cancer cell lines","Drug resistance","Electrochemotherapy","High-frequency nanosecond pulses","Multi-drug cocktails","Pulsed electric field"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

In this work, we utilized conventional microsecond electroporation protocols (0.8 - 1.5 kV/cm × 100 μs × 8, 1 Hz) and the new modality of nanosecond pulses (4 and 8 kV/cm × 500 ns × 100, 1 kHz and 1 MHz), which are compressed into a high frequency burst. Sensitive and resistant lung, breast and ovarian human cancer cell lines were used in the study. In order to overcome drug-resistance, we have investigated the feasibility to use anticancer drug cocktails i.e., bleomycin and cisplatin combinations with metformin, vinorelbine and Dp44mT. The different susceptibility of various human cancer cells lines to electric pulses was determined, the efficacy of ECT was characterized and the type of cell death depending on the combinations of drugs was investigated. The results indicate that synergistic effects of PEFs with drug cocktails may be used to overcome drug-resistance in cancer, while the application of nsPEF provides more flexibility in parametric protocols and modulation of cancer cell death.

The therapy with intravenous iron, however, continues to generate important clinical questions for cardiologists.\r\n\r\nRecent Findings\r\nIn the current paper, we discuss the class effect concept for intravenous iron formulations beyond FCM, based on the experiences of nephrologists who administer different intravenous iron formulations in advanced chronic kidney disease complicated with ID and anemia. Furthermore, we discuss the neutral effects of oral iron therapy in patients with HF, because there are still some reasons to further explore this route of supplementation. The different definitions of ID applied in HF studies and new doubts regarding possible interactions of intravenous iron with sodium-glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors are also emphasized.\r\n\r\nSummary\r\nThe experiences of other medical specializations may provide new information on how to optimally replenish iron in patients with HF and ID."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455701","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"300-307","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11897-023-00611-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63c8b939752340715150f1e0","name":"Marat","lastName":"Fudim","uuid":"3FAEF94742023D8CEC26380918AB62CC6822303EA4ECA1E191C82923C20FA77D3B96A556D620138038C22D02F606C37566229581A74C59B8A8E5CF7504692443","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27f3cdf3-3747-4693-a35e-ff65531663dc"},{"objectId":"5e7094ac878c28a0473c161b","name":"Jan","lastName":"Biegus","uuid":"3F1772885467EA82C05C16361FF52ED06D518044AE616D76D4EE084E1AA2CA30E7FD4E9D492D556CB258C2AB5521D546BF8766BD1779E8A6EC211AE547D9D0C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9977-7722","documentHash":"65fd753d-b33d-4d55-b945-facfa1203461"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8f05","name":"Michał","lastName":"Tkaczyszyn","uuid":"AB176CF0906FBC5FD31E58AB81F692CDCDFCAB3CC3EEB416D9B64AA99B413AF4D54A7593FC0C1E4D3306AD9C83FBFD18AAB1AB4634AF18F334D4DE75784A5E83","orcidId":"0000-0001-5426-5432","documentHash":"c3977be3-10e8-45bd-b25b-26c0f4dc74b5"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1458","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ponikowski","uuid":"4BA43AD81191E72DA939FC5D83BEA90B9477144E13175E0C90F36EE4CB3FEE9042BB27EBF84E4EC7BA5B8F74BCDAD927438A7A29631A6A4168BC1347284129FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3391-7064","documentHash":"85c7bbe3-e979-4c59-ab11-59e57cb9e09e"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11897-023-00611-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["grass turf of football fields,","retention,","water needs,","water potential,","irrigation dose"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6413"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Retention and Water Needs of Natural Grass Turf of Football Fields","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479623","mniswId":"17987","title":"Rocznik Ochrona Środowiska","doi":null,"issn":"1506-218X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"d1ed472f-be34-4b28-847d-543794f0ac14"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eb0ebb409707216ede2bec","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6413"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper contains a detailed assessment of three full-size football fields constructed in 2019-2022 to meet\nthe basic conditions for proper operation and maintenance.

With human aortic sections (n = 22) and sera from geriatric subjects (n = 79), we analyzed the relationships that could be observed between this protein and other parameters related to metabolic diseases. As a result, we observed a relatively high (r~0.8, p < 0.05) positive correlation between SRA and LECT2 and a negative correlation between EGFR and LECT2 (r~−0.4, p < 0.05). We observed LECT2 expression in macrophages, myocytes, and other aortic cells, with a tendency to be overexpressed in developed atherosclerotic plaques. We conclude that LECT2 exerts its chemotactic effects not only as a protein synthesized in the liver and secreted and circulating in the blood but also as a locally expressed protein within atherosclerotic plaque development. The LECT2-EGFR correlation suggests an association of this protein with loss of normal renal function. This fact can be associated with LECT2 amyloidosis, although it should be verified whether in the geriatric population there is indeed a widespread accumulation of LECT2 with the progression of aging or whether it is rather a marker of general deterioration of renal function."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455706","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.7544 [9 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/24/7544","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1964097076263e8436b","name":"Adam","lastName":"Słomczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e63873d-f1a3-4114-9043-c7ce8d3f7546"},{"objectId":"6630e1964097076263e8436a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Nowaczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b572a70-0bba-49c3-ab99-f4e866f6cbab"},{"objectId":"6630e1964097076263e84369","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wojnicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2082bf6-7c6c-4771-9ab8-1a3d0e336615"},{"objectId":"6630e1964097076263e84368","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zatyka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c22bec2-23d4-4807-b267-8045c2fc1e56"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9e50","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"KUZAN","uuid":"BBA11067B54654B974AD360773A7532A6629E866AD888E5D484EF4C198F0D4E06157B74089AA1BC149D728DF3A0A38F32090C5D3B90DC28C3B46B9E04B263FAC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4264-8174","documentHash":"4c5771b7-12bb-4e34-a3fa-9dc43a0accde"},{"objectId":"5e7093ca878c28a0473b0c98","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Królewicz","uuid":"782E6AF716D31951962AAEEF60F86249050B3C2D4357581BEDCBA2949009B095E1ACDA317DEA505F3FAEBBA6E3B89F6959D0847B524D16B2F2CF5B9147ECA980","orcidId":"0000-0003-2558-5191","documentHash":"4741caaa-0f1a-4064-8700-e92e0a189a66"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b85","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Maksymowicz","uuid":"67F45FC720B8235F73EC69E6987099874F2F88DBDA806EA8EE792123D7AD376DE0AD075261C29EDD32A8C264C82C8C7BA8BA26B27F4B5F7D92F411C911225AAC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4876-1733","documentHash":"9d612378-4ad0-416a-b504-6aa4ea3c30e4"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a133b","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Lindner-Pawłowicz","uuid":"586A8A2E345936E7A58A46B759362D5C796CDA1505C466F63E22D50163238C42258307B9E3923CB82AA4597827A05CFBE6EA57CAA92DDBCD2DB91AF4364E1571","orcidId":"0000-0003-1732-1188","documentHash":"c883c231-b289-4d85-904f-0f8151b8a1bb"},{"objectId":"5e709233878c28a04739195c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Sobieszczańska","uuid":"82A3B6C8401D69C250606DF7F88C94E9E83D812AA30A10809C5D35C4BD286C2D90C8C4439144B85363AE6C40658377CF5FD84BE2017E0754FBE81A4F7493ABE0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4374-9866","documentHash":"650d4f30-df49-49c2-98f4-54a2ab876b57"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12247544"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["colon cancer","irinotecan","melatonin","celastrol","wogonin"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of various combination therapies of irinotecan with melatonin, wogonin, and celastrol on drug-sensitive colon cancer cells (LOVO cell line) and doxorubicin-resistant colon cancer stem-like cells (LOVO/DX cell subline). Melatonin is a hormone synthesized in the pineal gland and is responsible for circadian rhythm. Wogonin and celastrol are natural compounds previously used in traditional Chinese medicine. Selected substances have immunomodulatory properties and anti-cancer potential. First, MTT and flow cytometric annexin-V apoptosis assays were performed to determine the cytotoxic effect and the induction of apoptosis. Then, the potential to inhibit cell migration was evaluated using a scratch test, and spheroid growth was measured. The results showed important cytotoxic effects of the drug combinations on both LOVO and LOVO/DX cells. All tested substances caused an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in the LOVO cell line and necrotic cells in the LOVO/DX cell subline. The strongest effect on the induction of cancer cell death was observed for the combination of irinotecan with celastrol (1.25 µM) or wogonin (50 µM) and for the combination of melatonin (2000 µM) with celastrol (1.25 µM) or wogonin (50 µM). Statistically significant improvements in the effect of combined therapy were found for the irinotecan (20 µM) and celastrol (1.25 µM) combination and irinotecan (20 µM) with wogonin (25 µM) in LOVO/DX cells. Minor additive effects of combined therapy were observed in LOVO cells. Inhibition of cell migration was seen in LOVO cells for all tested compounds, while only irinotecan (20 µM) and celastrol (1.25 µM) were able to inhibit LOVO/DX cell migration. Compared with single-drug therapy, a statistically significant inhibitory effect on cell migration was found for combinations of melatonin (2000 µM) with wogonin (25 µM) in LOVO/DX cells and irinotecan (5 µM) or melatonin (2000 µM) with wogonin (25 µM) in LOVO cells. Our research shows that adding melatonin, wogonin, or celastrol to standard irinotecan therapy may potentiate the anti-cancer effects of irinotecan alone in colon cancer treatment. Celastrol seems to have the greatest supporting therapy effect, especially for the treatment of aggressive types of colon cancer, by targeting cancer stem-like cells."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455708","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.9544 [21 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/11/9544","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e20d4097076263e8531d","name":"Christian D.","lastName":"Muller","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4086b807-df9d-4e47-bf87-90f89cc9751e"},{"objectId":"6630e20d4097076263e8531c","name":"Fathi","lastName":"Emhemmed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9aee501d-c7be-4b27-aa93-902a83befb0f"},{"objectId":"6630e20d4097076263e8531b","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Frąszczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a40d95cf-b02b-4c03-a8d9-a67928979f67"},{"objectId":"6630e20d4097076263e8531a","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ba54c70-2474-4838-854e-a4d9bb8ade18"},{"objectId":"6630e20d4097076263e85319","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szyjka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75e6cf6b-e707-4bae-b718-f0418dbda1b4"},{"objectId":"6630e20d4097076263e85318","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Siwiela","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a5f92c9-dc1f-4d34-a9b9-6685a9f630fe"},{"objectId":"6630e20d4097076263e85317","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Bęben","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4dc5842c-d199-455c-8b04-19a8098368af"},{"objectId":"5fc4c148085dcb1e6ae0b8e3","name":"Anna","lastName":"Radajewska","uuid":"EF8151305BE9B1DB9E0A70A130716A1BBA616A67355057C7F3E19D2823631207D8D36905CB495A2CB945A83EE5288A22D3EB8B8A772F28096565B8CED8F29B1B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1639-3155","documentHash":"2073a152-dc24-45d0-89bf-5fb02f7524de"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af702","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Gębczak","uuid":"45EF9D6A2ACE41D4AE0F343AE41BE8A8DF09477DD0920D9A3FA96AAC8521753AEACFE7B32CCD54279AB8AC1C99D46978767578C6AE0DC98B2EA56C84AD0DFEB3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2670-0569","documentHash":"c8e92da1-8bd7-4502-bcad-83c51fcbe72d"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1bb9","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Barg","uuid":"A2223320DB3FC3193ABA8BFD1667A4EB09484D732075C73329C9195BA837F4ACA5753B445563B691A2A6D46322B44133036FF4FD017A7B15B40ABD49BF2108D6","orcidId":"0000-0002-7069-5026","documentHash":"c49fc4ef-1db3-491f-b044-bdab9983d560"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b44","name":"Helena","lastName":"Moreira","uuid":"AB2DA07A1FBAF51009FB599E8FB51F19A4945E47611E271E70B8FAE71559F8DBF6E20310D797374A122BC4B4DBA19CC2933FDD726D3303EC0FFED4C856455934","orcidId":"0000-0002-8084-3686","documentHash":"965bdeb9-30d8-4361-bf59-1aaced56ff84"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms24119544"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zapalenie nerwów wzrokowych","zapalenie rdzenia kręgowego"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The etiology of this condition is linked to the interactions of multiple genes and environmental factors. The earlier age of onset of schizophrenia, the higher frequency of negative symptoms in the clinical presentation, and the poorer response to antipsychotic treatment in men compared to women suggests the involvement of sex hormones in these processes. This article aims to draw attention to the possible relationship between testosterone and some clinical features in male schizophrenic patients and discuss the complex nature of these phenomena based on data from the literature. PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were searched to select the papers without limiting the time of the publications. Hormone levels in the body are regulated by many organs and systems, and take place through the neuroendocrine, hormonal, neural, and metabolic pathways. Sex hormones play an important role in the development and function of the organism. Besides their impact on secondary sex characteristics, they influence brain development and function, mood, and cognition. In men with schizophrenia, altered testosterone levels were noted. In many cases, evidence from available single studies gave contradictory results. However, it seems that the testosterone level in men affected by schizophrenia may differ depending on the phase of the disease, types of clinical symptoms, and administered therapy. The etiology of testosterone level disturbances may be very complex. Besides the impact of the illness (schizophrenia), stress, and antipsychotic drug-induced hyperprolactinemia, testosterone levels may be influenced by, i.a., obesity, substances of abuse (e.g., ethanol), or liver damage."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455712","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.6492 [27 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/7/6492","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1c44097076263e84a86","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Piasny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c05f1b9-0618-4e47-81ca-76f30d70bd8d"},{"objectId":"6630e1c44097076263e84a85","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Błaszczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bd32144-f2a7-4d3e-9e1f-e1c000062b5d"},{"objectId":"6630e1c44097076263e84a84","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Gaweł-Dąbrowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e550305c-fcb1-4c1c-b632-8b0cc4cc5eb5"},{"objectId":"6630e1c44097076263e84a83","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Tomkalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ecb9494-0f31-43e0-bc18-6e651d0c6d10"},{"objectId":"6630e1c44097076263e84a82","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Jawień","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"87e40e14-3c40-4e2d-a5f3-66df3a5438d5"},{"objectId":"6630e1c44097076263e84a81","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"458ef349-2ba7-423b-9185-0ae84782b879"},{"objectId":"5e7094df878c28a0473c5c5a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Danielewski","uuid":"FC8CCD0D5813FBE009C76B05786436721B670B99350029141AC595B88CD819F77D34707B79961F39C6FF0775D71CFFD48DA075F25F1383C6C5B4109FAB390C00","orcidId":"0000-0002-2671-5747","documentHash":"58b7e921-aa73-4e81-bbc8-608abb3f65b8"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8eea","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Szeląg","uuid":"164DAE29F1AD10EEAB7DDC46DD2CBC3465E3C8F2531FA1E83EC7C7383AADF42ABBBDC7167DB6E0D813F615BB918C5A842761DB8CE6B58A97961F8352C108A12C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9302-2115","documentHash":"6d2fc20c-fd7e-420a-81e2-11686fe9c295"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b88","name":"Anna","lastName":"Merwid-Ląd","uuid":"2B398D053394CF0C4F6392C7D9E72AD4174CDE31C4405537658188E4A9CA03DBFA406EFD1AD8369F1398BCFC6C58A5A9E1D42CDAF7A02FE9B42C633ABD96A6E2","orcidId":"0000-0002-4597-0241","documentHash":"e4b1f315-8332-4187-bbf7-14d1781de931"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b70","name":"Adam","lastName":"Szeląg","uuid":"1D229BBBE8D20B71CABFC287B57250B388B84BC624D8AF13605E511D7180926C5CB97D9435EBEC25D6057B10F13028220869FC14B1D86D3D232579397BFC0A76","orcidId":"0000-0001-8104-5267","documentHash":"4b21b3b1-7605-4e74-8458-2b3b302b8d9d"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a136c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Matuszewska","uuid":"D346FD0E959E0EAE93C2C17D2851C64DC47E91C4352B2503B8BD21A8AAE745C77586E923252EFB9567D6548FFA6B616E3799099E14F3FCCFF6FA1698E5473FD9","orcidId":"0000-0003-1082-0793","documentHash":"ed88d812-2fb3-48a6-a09e-1b1a173f485d"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398df3","name":"Benita","lastName":"Wiatrak","uuid":"15B10EC052D1999E98426EE856EC5E778993B5E37DE32980441D40DABD0E5B80EDF18CEB00D591C7A791684F74B9E0D4213F23D2AD58A5F03B9DA80052D1EFDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1404-2274","documentHash":"1e070791-706d-4bdd-8d0f-a10a4a576fdd"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms24076492"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["thymic stromal lymphopoietin","epithelium","allergy","asthma"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

It is primarily produced by epithelial cells and functions as a potent immune system activator. TSLP acts through interaction with its receptor complex, composed of the TSLP receptor (TSLPR) and interleukin-7 receptor alpha chain (IL-7Rα), activating downstream complex signalling pathways. The TSLP major isoform, known as long-form TSLP (lfTSLP), is upregulated in the airway epithelium of patients with allergic diseases. More research is warranted to explore the precise mechanisms by which short-form TSLP (sfTSLP) regulates immune responses. Understanding the dynamic interplay between TSLP and the dysfunctional epithelium provides insights into the mechanisms underlying allergy and asthma pathogenesis. Targeting TSLP represents an important therapeutic strategy, as it may upstream disrupt the inflammatory cascade and alleviate symptoms associated with allergic inflammation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455714","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.12725 [19 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/16/12725","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e23c4097076263e858d8","name":"Florin-Dan","lastName":"Popescu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"248fa59e-7f67-4b12-bf5b-cf400bd4a80a"},{"objectId":"6630e23c4097076263e858d7","name":"Darío","lastName":"Antolín-Amérigo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0b42a9a-4e9e-4d6d-adb5-3ce0c497eea7"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd642","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Smolińska","uuid":"5A546961FBDD8CE15E543FC87A721507DC6670A59AA2CF59A99EE03F38A0D2CA8C8B01E67D55DA5B45757A589BC0021A98896AC6A92662EECD0D6E04A2FCB52A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6736-2696","documentHash":"3c50a5b1-f02c-4d60-bbf6-baeb68e98ad0"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a128f","name":"Marek","lastName":"Jutel","uuid":"A78748B9708FABEC4F609A25EA33E7A6FC529862CB0F56DFFB4850E30D545C8D8C437618E5BB1B295640D5DE0811C600463703ADACDAB92A595C1DF30A2F11B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1555-9379","documentHash":"f4fbdcc1-b6e7-48dc-a4e0-8a41369de034"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms241612725"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Every year, dozens of new, previously unknown drugs appear on the illegal market, posing a significant threat to the health and lives of their users. Synthetic cathinones are one of the most numerous and widespread groups among NPS. The purpose of this work was to identify and summarize available data on newly emerging cathinones in very recent years.\r\nMethods: Various online databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, but also databases of government agencies including those involved in early warning systems, were used in search of reports on the identification of newly emerging synthetic cathinones. In addition, threads on various forums created by users of these drugs were searched for reports on the effects of these new substances.\r\nResults: We have identified 29 synthetic cathinones that have been detected for the first time from early 2019 to mid-2022. We described their structures, known intoxication symptoms, detected concentrations in biological material in poisoning cases, as well as the countries and dates of their first appearance. Due to the lack of studies on the properties of the novel compounds, we compared data on the pharmacological profiles of the better-known synthetic cathinones with available information on the newly emerged ones. Some of these new agents already posed a threat, as the first cases of poisonings, including fatal ones, have been reported.\r\nConclusions: Most of the newly developed synthetic cathinones can be seen as analogs and replacements for once-popular compounds that have been declining in popularity as a result of legislative efforts. Although it appears that some of the newly emerging cathinones are not widely used, they may become more popular in the future and could become a significant threat to health and life. Therefore, it is important to continue developing early warning systems and identifying new compounds so that their widespread can be prevented."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455715","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"25-46","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11419-022-00639-5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e4f24097076263e87937","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Kuropka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25cc0ac5-dd03-4ff8-b25e-201e49c612e9"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Szpot","uuid":"C0DD6021DF77CCF3DC6E35941E7AD532C9CF9E10BB0744B0F1B2DAEC2062CDAA348B9D49D148FD5480E1E057906E027FDEBC40888CD430841AE2816B0788C200","orcidId":"0000-0002-5352-3492","documentHash":"8f789c6c-3d19-4c38-ba3c-7176f398d2da"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1f0f","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"ZAWADZKI","uuid":"A503182E6481542437338034E0BE421E7C439271BBECF2167AFD04AE6AF8BAE0541FE861CD6BF2F981D76476181370A82533D1268C24EF669F25122174AE3ABA","orcidId":"0000-0003-2146-9724","documentHash":"4310342d-a7a3-4928-81e6-34a1ca07b42a"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11419-022-00639-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["personality traits","counterproductive work behaviors","Structural Equation Modeling SEM"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The impact of personality traits on subjective categories of counterproductive work behaviors in Central European environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479995","mniswId":"19677","title":"Transformations in Business and Economics","doi":null,"issn":"1648-4460","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"50e49332-0ac3-4c01-a565-2cb0a8614496"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978dd40970762631b3338","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c3878c28a04739c2af","5e70920c878c28a04738f23e","65e978dd40970762631b3339"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of the article is to determine how the \r\npersonality traits (Extraversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, \r\nAgreeableness and Openness to experience) influence the extent of subjective categories of counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs) in Central European socio-economic environment. To meet that research objectives primary survey information from 454 professionally active people in Poland was obtained. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze the empirical data. The proposed theoretical model was intended to determine \r\nhow particular types of personality impact on subjective categories of CWBs (Abuse against others, Theft, Sabotage, Withdrawal). The empirical analysis confirmed that personality traits affect strongly \r\ncounterproductive work behaviors. The highest influence on the Withdrawal was attributed to Agreeableness, whereas the Abuse against others was mostly influences by Extraversion. The Sabotage was mostly affected by Openness to experience and, finally, the Theft by Extraversion.

Lymph node metastasis is a poor prognostic factor for PCa. Previous studies have found that Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) is overexpressed in various cancers, including PCa. We examined GOLPH3 expression in PCa cells from primary tumor and, as the first, also in metastatic lymph nodes to assess its potential as a new risk factor for PCa progression.\r\nMethods: The study included 78 patients diagnosed with lymph node-positive PCa confirmed in the postoperative material. All the patients underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) with extended lymphadenectomy. The clinical data of the patients were retrospectively analyzed, and their histopathological specimens were selected for further analysis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed and the expression of GOLPH3 was assessed by an experienced uropathologist using an immunoreactive scale (IRS). A correlational analysis of the obtained data with the clinicopathological data of patients was performed.\r\nResults: A positive IHC reaction for GOLPH3 was observed in all samples. IRS score for GOLPH3 expression was higher in the metastatic lymph nodes than in the prostate (not statistically significant; p=0.056). Several significant correlations were identified in connection with GOLPH3 expression levels in the prostate and metastatic lymph node tissues. No significant correlations were found between GOLPH3 expression and patient characteristics (e.g. BMI, EAU risk group, or preoperative PSA level), pathological features, or postoperative outcomes. However, we found that lymphovascular invasion (LVI) tended to be more common in patients with a higher percentage of GOLPH3-positive cells (p=0.02). We also found a positive association between the intensity of GOLPH3 staining in metastatic lymph nodes and the EAU classification. Finally, we found a significant negative correlation between the GOLPH3 expression and the efficacy of RP – the higher the expression of GOLPH3, the lower the efficacy of RP was (p<0.05).\r\nConclusion: GOLPH3 is expressed in both prostate and metastatic lymph nodes, with higher expression in metastatic lymph nodes. High GOLPH3 expression was associated with the occurrence of LVI, higher-risk group in the EAU classification, and lower efficacy of the RP, but there was no significant correlation with other

With this paper we present specific insights into the process of the\r\ninstitutionalization of cashlessness in Poland. The process is analyzed from the perspective of Small and Medium\r\nEnterprises (SMEs). We advance the idea that the institutional field of cashlessness is emerging with similar\r\npressures. In this field—as we argue using the concept of Powell and DiMaggio—SMEs experience a coercive\r\ninstitutional isomorphism. We show that the complex impact of interlocked social interactions, financial sanctions,\r\nnarrations, values and norms are creating the matrix for SMEs’ decision whether to implement cashless payments\r\ninto their business. The analysis is based on 74 individual in-depth interviews with SMEs owners. The paper is\r\ngrounded in qualitative research design and the theory of neo-institutionalism.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455724","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"115-138","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://polish-sociological-review.eu/The-Institutionalization-of-Cashless-Poland-nValues-Norms-Sanctions-and-Grand-Narrations,147559,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a61c6","name":"Marta","lastName":"Jakubowska","uuid":"A162A038B8E8D88258DDE379355CD33C8649AD91D2CE2A6F4551906A2970672D0703337946520C576D0CF83B8154293A53D79B7B642E87EE6E5125A1A63EC891","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c2eca3c-c91e-452b-b29c-91958369c311"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c0bc","name":"Michał","lastName":"Polasik","uuid":"9AF8FCAA72DA20642AC20702F3F5B8A78DE47B5E929CA98134A107F9856DAC2B98BF787DB86B0AA3CE2E3AE05BC471ACF3F126BFAD26C8BE2AAF9389C2692025","orcidId":"0000-0002-7790-4839","documentHash":"8db666e5-a8ca-4b2b-903f-0ed498e425b0"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a04739447a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szalacha-Jarmużek","uuid":"C7F02D666081A11EAD590BA81E4391DEE9FE070D9575A395E04CA59A179EFF60DBC231BBFB6A1B575E0F48D30961FD9660089C40AC3341BFB8B4CEF76F162AE3","orcidId":"0000-0001-6445-8385","documentHash":"2e3ff9ab-2575-4fc6-9379-842dc893fd85"}],"doi":"10.26412/psr217.07"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["VEGF-C","heart failure","lymphangiogenesis","edema","outcomes"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Improvements in liver parameters, glucose tolerance, and a decrease in fasting insulin levels were observed, although they were less pronounced in the lipedema group than in the overweight/obesity group. Kidney and thyroid functions were similar before and after the LCHF diet in both groups.

Its activity is essentially determined by polyphenols, although specific compounds are not finally indicated. The available plant material comes from different subspecies and locations, which can lead to differences in chemical composition and potency. For this reason, we conducted a detailed analysis of the polyphenol content and antioxidant activity of 52 different C. incanus teas from Turkey, Albania, Greece, and unspecified regions. We focused special attention on ellagitannins, which have not been properly determined so far. Besides oxidative stress, hyperglycemia is an essential component of cardiometabolic diseases. Therefore, in subsequent experiments, we evaluated the ability of C. incanus extracts and individual polyphenols to inhibit α-glucosidase. Using statistical methods, we analyzed how differences in chemical composition affect activity. The results showed that C. incanus is a rich source of ellagitannins (2.5–19%), which dominate among polyphenols (5.5–23%). Turkish-origin products had higher ellagitannin content and a greater antioxidant effect (FRAP, ABTS) than Albanian and Greek products. In contrast, the flavonoid and phenolic acid contents and DPPH values were at similar levels in all products. An in-depth analysis of their composition indicated that all groups of polyphenols are involved in the antioxidant effect, but a significant contribution can be attributed to ellagitannins and flavonoids. C. incanus extracts showed a high capacity to inhibit α-glucosidase activity (IC50 125–145 μg/mL). Ellagitannins were the most effective inhibitors (IC50 0.7–1.1 μM), with a potency exceeding acarbose (3.3 mM). In conclusion, C. incanus, due to the presence of ellagitannins and flavonoids, exhibits powerful antioxidant and α-glucosidase inhibitory effects."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455731","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.553 [18 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/12/3/553","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2454097076263e85a74","name":"Andrzej Bolesław","lastName":"Dryś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7cb9f7b0-8761-419c-8968-fc971b6eecb6"},{"objectId":"6630e2454097076263e85a73","name":"Aneta ","lastName":"Starzec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"28d647ee-aae6-474c-b779-3cc50d2f4316"},{"objectId":"6168e7a875234017e053d4af","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Kunachowicz","uuid":"CBDF7ABCAF29C2A2CAE24440325C36BD16C5FAFC629EDFEE58D84B1393F6C5286DDCA02969ACE9ED20EAE21538A693264DBF8E66192E9087EE734C8475240E33","orcidId":"0000-0001-6416-9989","documentHash":"c1e41f28-be5b-4f7c-84cb-9a6c46e06311"},{"objectId":"5e70930b878c28a0473a1c1d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Włodarczyk","uuid":"FCA14F3FD208C876AFAA1FD322D8155D1F322BDAC0B80F88220A5F97E0C3F475689D860A3AEB9C25E17C6C3718B82CE4C8A7B85AEC5273DE1FCF7E606888B2DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8437-2711","documentHash":"11650ad4-0c34-4b31-8229-162d8f82d947"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1451","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kepinska","uuid":"ECD08E0CA5513168886467EF3B2A433D6D11E0942A67AC3270250874F2BC9978B7E674DDBE381BC91D2C1F101F3E0603BE6D3385278ED7EFB3E08229C449CEB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-0935-5663","documentHash":"0bdefeef-c176-4bc5-8182-b0508c362129"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1402","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Fecka","uuid":"655743FF76D9F4CAD7FCF441611B2DB417786253116AC4754B02E2D884BBD481F8AA0BDB4D7A11D964299F6595539B517CD71E6DDDEF762E6292B43C92C81DA7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1139-4581","documentHash":"0c89a490-95cc-487b-8b4f-ab3d6789c0c9"}],"doi":"10.3390/antiox12030553"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the association of SM perfusion response to exertion with exercise capacity in this clinical condition.\r\n\r\nMethods: Echocardiography and SM microvascular perfusion by contrast-enhanced ultrasound were performed at rest and immediately post-exercise test in 77 HFpEF patients in NYHA class II and III, and in 25 subjects with normal exercise tolerance (stage B). Exercise reserve of cardiac function and SM perfusion was calculated by subtracting resting value from exercise value.\r\n\r\nResults: In addition to decreased cardiac functional reserve, HFpEF patients demonstrated significantly reduced SM perfusion reserve as compared to HF stage B, with the degree of impairment being greater in the subgroup with more profound left ventricular (LV) diastolic abnormalities (E/e’ > 15 and TRV > 2.8 m/s).\r\n\r\nSM perfusion reserve was significantly associated with exercise capacity (beta = 0.33; SE 0.11; p = 0.003), cardiac output reserve (beta = 0.24; SE 0.12; p = 0.039), resting E/e’ (beta = −0.33; SE 0.11; p = 0.006), and patient frailty expressed by the PRISMA 7 score (beta = −0.30; SE 0.11; p = 0.008). In multivariable analysis including clinical, demographic and cardiac functional variables, SM perfusion reserve was in addition to patient frailty, sex and LV longitudinal strain reserve among the independent correlates of exercise capacity.\r\n\r\nConclusions: SM perfusion reserve is impaired in HFpEF, and is associated with reduced exercise capacity independent of clinical, demographic and “central” cardiac factors. This supports the need to consider the SM domain in patient management strategies in HFpEF."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455738","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"395","pagesFromTo":"art.131553 [7 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527323016157","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6655a1624097074fa1fde326","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Jasic-Szpak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e9daf7be-315d-4f3f-9252-3a3e4d9d69c8"},{"objectId":"6655a1624097074fa1fde325","name":"Adam","lastName":"Serafin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"042f8b19-e5ea-4bd3-939f-b9a2ea4f42a9"},{"objectId":"6549af3840e3ff4ef3f4df70","name":"Tom","lastName":"Marwick","uuid":"8A1A28EF04A1446D8C908ADBCFC953C8E5BE7935CCBED3DA117964B8EA9FA9BB286631B4BDA3C6C8A5C1145B5640CC5F80DFAE9706D21CF417A0923D257FC62F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61670872-6418-4363-8213-b5e1a7bb312c"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b94","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kosmala","uuid":"35CFAA8FCBCB6569FC22C6416FD5FD5C6D02E2958A2C7F24E2100527D8575697E8D65CF8F56E06EEB3D696C4B2B50705C5E5B9AEF629E9536B6702B0D5408574","orcidId":"0000-0003-3807-8201","documentHash":"1933b9d1-f1fd-4a39-ae15-8780a5234aa5"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1458","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ponikowski","uuid":"4BA43AD81191E72DA939FC5D83BEA90B9477144E13175E0C90F36EE4CB3FEE9042BB27EBF84E4EC7BA5B8F74BCDAD927438A7A29631A6A4168BC1347284129FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3391-7064","documentHash":"85c7bbe3-e979-4c59-ab11-59e57cb9e09e"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a13ad","name":"Monika","lastName":"Przewłocka-Kosmala","uuid":"664F57F43D188C2FC08ECCBA2B9253B8B9C6F931121177C3F673CAFC1F69D8F37FCD64282022A41A36A23C4AB191624AD3E1B8BA0A3BC57EEB1F6D675D325A4C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4054-6521","documentHash":"c9e8e216-5cbb-407a-8dce-dcd020f77588"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijcard.2023.131553"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["3D printing","ABS","PETG","PLA","simulated body fluid conditions","thermal properties"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65e9a95e40970762631fbc24","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-52382-3","title":"Innovations in Biomedical Engineering 2023","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-52381-6","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-52382-3","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"7ca27c42-0e85-4f82-9251-7115c06b36ff","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"60c33973-5a43-42c3-837b-37350f500ce1"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Assessment of the Surface Properties of Printouts Made in FDM Technology Subjected to Process Electrocorrosion in the Simulated Body Fluid Solution","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eee83640970749973e35ed","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709211878c28a04738f741","5e7093af878c28a0473aefdc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Printing in three dimensions has recently become a very popular method of supporting the work of medics.

The possibility of using individual polymers for 3D printing should be carefully examined. The focus here should be on the analysis of filaments before the printing process, but it is also necessary to check the physical properties of the finished printout after the hydrolytic degradation process. In the presented study, printouts obtained in the FDM technology from three materials were used, which were subjected to the electrocorrosion process in the Simulated Body Fluid solution for a period of 30 days under constant conditions. Through microscopic examinations and roughness measurements, the degree to which the degrading solution influenced the surfaces of the analyzed samples was determined.

One of the innovative methods of soil stabilisation is the use of nano-additives. The paper presents the influence of nanosilica on the bearing capacity under the footing under undrained conditions. For this purpose, a simple and quick unconfined compression test was used to evaluate the undrained shear strength of selected silty soil. Tests were conducted for soil without additives and with nanosilica contents of 1, 3 and 5%. All samples were compacted to the maximum dry density in a Proctor apparatus, and strength tests were conducted after 7 days of curing. The results clearly show an increase in undrained shear strength with increasing nanosilica content. Based on these data, a parametric analysis of the bearing capacity under the strip footing was performed for 4 variants of nanosilica content and for 9 loading cases. Thus, the impact of stabilisation in a practical engineering issue was presented. For all load cases the optimal dimensions of the foundation were determined. In addition, for the selected case, calculations were made for a fixed foundation dimension. All computations were performed in accordance with Eurocode 7 with GEO5 software."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455742","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"69","pagesFromTo":"269-284","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/146080/edition/128468/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaf1a840970762632c2a70","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Mońka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"044849e9-1cc1-4992-8bb4-e8daad3cf627"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5cf3","name":"MATYLDA","lastName":"TANKIEWICZ","uuid":"40B2EF114F4249DAA462A65695E760AD0ADEEA6B73257393223E7F86977FE41ADB6E670789018B1BB1FB1D741B3CBBEB59F481B566240BAA5C2660088948607D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3523-028X","documentHash":"d44888f1-47fd-47b5-9523-87fac87fe589"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395d3f","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":"64D0A3C69EE4F7DA0DD35D7BD8DC9437E9D46A84AB521BB9DA2DAA8CA3A917B7F982BC2DEB5738422084B80B11810CDB88460B9F5A1DA0960AD6D6C409DD2B6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0106-3527","documentHash":"2132c0d0-846b-47a4-bd7d-bd54f95f36cf"}],"doi":"10.24425/ace.2023.146080"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sulfur and sulfate fertilizers","ryegrass","soil organic matter","water-soluble organic carbon","humic acids","glomalin-related soil proteins"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Effect of Various Forms of Sulfur on Soil Organic Matter Fractions and Microorganisms in a Pot Experiment with Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e776","mniswId":"25607","title":"Plants","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2223-7747","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9b5e2d0-7e4e-4b87-9cc1-37b3d46db596"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eef85c4097076263b981f7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709273878c28a047395eab","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1fc","5e709274878c28a047395f71","65eef85c4097076263b981f8","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1b6","65eef85c4097076263b981f9","65eef85c4097076263b981fa"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article focuses on the agronomic evaluation of the supplementation of mineral NPKMg fertilizers with elemental sulfur, magnesium, potassium, or ammonium sulfates in pot experiments with ryegrass growing in a sandy Arenosol with very low sulfur content. A benefit evaluation was carried out on the basis of biomass production, crop nutritional status, and changes in the content of soil organic matter fractions. Furthermore, the total number of bacteria, nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and fungi was estimated using the qPCR technique in soil samples after 60 days of ryegrass growth. The combined application of NPKMg and sulfur or sulfate fertilizers significantly increased the summary yield of three cuttings of fresh ryegrass biomass in the range of 32.3% to 82.7%. The application, especially in the form of sulfates, significantly decreased the content of free phenolic acids. Furthermore, compared to the control, i.e., soil with NPKMg applied alone, an increase in the content of glomalin-related proteins and a decrease in the amount of water-soluble organic carbon compounds were observed. Neither the number of DNA marker copy numbers of the total bacterial community nor the nitrogen-fixing bacteria were noticeably different. In turn, the total number of genetic markers for fungi was significantly higher in soils with potassium or ammonium sulfates compared to the control soil. The general results suggest that the application of sulfur fertilizers with NPKMg mineral fertilizer can benefit crops and support soil fertility due to the stabilization of aggregates and the decrease in water-soluble organic compounds."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455743","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/12/14/2649","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef85c4097076263b981fa","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Pietr","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f4cae26-5b42-409a-b69b-03a52a9afcc1"},{"objectId":"65eef85c4097076263b981f9","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Milo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ee8dff6-d567-49a9-940b-2ffd597993c9"},{"objectId":"65eef85c4097076263b981f8","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Kucińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b940209-6b5b-4dac-9989-2f17a5915869"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395f71","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Oksińska","uuid":"870FF55B19992749DF8D4597C1D9D8678C099BA0DC19DE3FA4F0773682723154708F56A535E84CE78063A229017BCA7D8540A4D603DC6EE546858A714222B539","orcidId":"0000-0002-1545-481X","documentHash":"66eff10e-00b3-40be-b724-0b7ca2e7a3cd"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395eab","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Magnucka","uuid":"919142B2C3D213BB1811C988263637C9A7DD5778842A21FCAD9689A4BBAE2964E5AEC6D8E45DF48BB961FC0890EA1835EAEF5D0CC4B7E3C80D7B2BD9524879ED","orcidId":"0000-0001-5439-4795","documentHash":"55a4e58f-0b74-4bad-a41f-4d840094b2ff"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1fc","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kulczycki","uuid":"8554FEB39F06A1EDBDF8EC351F553046798FED6B61759C52B5123B2FEEEE8C90D8808A619FB83A657AB6B0CF46CACE574A1A26339D042650B10E1F2678706F66","orcidId":"0000-0003-3411-6661","documentHash":"8948b225-5b86-42b5-8cdc-49f2fcca62ae"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1b6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pawęska","uuid":"F4F579FD34D2BE4EEDDC53252244652FD415A4570BE2932C21207F2E95F7CBE9D2F3DBB9BC48494F0EB2427EAD88E0AEB82AF4072F0AC4B7604105AC060B0D03","orcidId":"0000-0001-8617-1596","documentHash":"4c81679e-e7ba-492d-988d-b0de5728eccb"}],"doi":"10.3390/plants12142649"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Serious Game","Citizenship","Active Learning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64390edd4097076e1e3a84ab","doi":"10.21125/edulearn.2022","title":"EDULEARN22 Proceedings","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-84-09-42484-9","ismn":null,"issn":"2340-1117","url":"https://doi.org/10.21125/edulearn.2022","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"15c1fb7a-960a-4ad9-998a-449d103a6311","publisher":{"objectId":"63e3614f40970712ff255a61","mniswId":null,"name":"IATED","documentHash":"4c0e836f-7c0a-471f-9e50-8670ee1a3d8a"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Blended Mobility in JEU: an Evaluation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9979040970762631d5f42","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e9979040970762631d5f43","65e9979040970762631d5f44","5e7093d2878c28a0473b15df","65e9979040970762631d5f45","65e9979040970762631d5f46","65e9979040970762631d5f47","5e70920c878c28a04738f13a","65e9979040970762631d5f48","65e9979040970762631d5f49","65e9979040970762631d5f4a","65e9979040970762631d5f4b","65e9979040970762631d5f4c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"JEU: Let's play together for the European Union is a project financed by Erasmus+ under contract n.º 2019 - 1 - FR01 - KA201 – 062510. The project, created by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) and Higher Education Institutions (HEI) from seven European countries, aims to contribute to the creation of a more inclusive and respectful European society by raising the awareness and empowerment of youth and their teachers to European citizenship, gender equality and environmental protection. Over a three-year period, two serious games were developed for middle-school and high-school pupils. The games were tested in classrooms in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal, Poland, and Germany.\r\nThe project, started in October 2019, was impacted by the SARS-COV-2 virus and resulting COVID-19 pandemic. The consecutive lockdowns imposed throughout Europe made it impossible to organize some of the planned activities. However, the easing of travel restrictions in most European countries from late 2021 meant that one of the planned mobilities, for Porto, was possible in January 2022. 42 students and 14 staff members from the participating organizations gathered in Porto for ten days of intensive game development. Prior to the Porto mobility, the NGOs presented a series of online sessions to prepare the students on the specific topics they would be working at. In Porto, students were teamed in multicultural and interdisciplinary groups. Each group was supervised by a staff member from one of the participating organizations. A technical expert, a content expert, and an educational expert were also present to help the students. Each group was tasked with coming up with a serious game on one of the three topics: fighting extremism; plastic soup; and gender discrimination in public spaces. The best game concept, as selected by an independent jury, will be developed by the consortium to become a complete educational tool for high-school students.\r\nAt the end of the mobility, a survey to the participating students and staff was conducted. The objective of the survey was to evaluate the mobility. The aspects to be valued were the quality of the technical and content specific workshops/seminars before the physical mobility took place, the mobility itself and the educational experience in which the HEI students took part.

Hyperactivation of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP1B) has been associated with several metabolic malfunctions ranging from insulin resistance, metaflammation, lipotoxicity, and hyperglycaemia. Liver metabolism failure has been proposed as a core element in underlying endocrine disorders through persistent inflammation and highly fibrotic phenotype. Methods. In this study, the outcomes of PTP1B inhibition using trodusquemine (MSI-1436) on key equine metabolic syndrome (EMS)-related alterations including inflammation, fibrosis, and glucose uptake have been analyzed in liver explants collected from EMS-affected horses using various analytical techniques, namely, flow cytometry, RT-qPCR, and Western blot. Results. PTP1B inhibition using trodusquemine resulted in decreased proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6) release from liver and PBMC affected by EMS and regulated expression of major proinflammatory microRNAs such as miR-802 and miR-211. Moreover, MSI-1436 enhanced the anti-inflammatory profile of livers by elevating the expression of IL-10 and IL-4 and activating CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in treated PBMC. Similarly, the inhibitor attenuated fibrogenic pathways in the liver by downregulating TGF-β/NOX1/4 axis and associated MMP-2/9 overactivation. Interestingly, PTP1B inhibition ameliorated the expression of TIMP-1 and Smad7, both important antifibrotic mediators. Furthermore, application of MSI-1436 was found to augment the abundance of glycosylated Glut-2, which subsequently expanded the glucose absorption in the EMS liver, probably due to an enhanced Glut-2 stability and half-life onto the plasma cell membranes. Conclusion. Taken together, the presented data suggest that the PTP1B inhibition strategy and the use of its specific inhibitor MSI-1436 represents a promising option for the improvement of liver tissue integrity and homeostasis in the course of EMS and adds more insights for ongoing clinical trials for human MetS management."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455747","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/iji/2023/3803056/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eefe764097076263b99d82","name":"Nabila","lastName":"Bourebaba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e0faeff-5dc4-4ae3-839c-041159979035"},{"objectId":"61e785b87523406748fb8694","name":"LYNDA","lastName":"BOUREBABA","uuid":"E9E482563FE63E31FD25D3D5B3F1FE97F8C784FB74495DAFBEE514285948D7708ABC57D70A7A7210E8AB66B1FA91DAC4CF304A8A8A5BB6233A578F342B73A0C1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"963e7a14-47c1-4f88-ba64-cc93c7c9718d"},{"objectId":"5ec353c57523406cb1a7eb00","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zyzak","uuid":"F8B8E464C1271DABC65D6CE060665DA96F4CC3F470047E5068231B15AB0704D4519AEBA3EDDA02FA12E1C773178ABB07F524CE7AB5809AEFAB8359EBE4928C98","orcidId":"0000-0001-5960-9695","documentHash":"3ac6626e-db40-4d20-82a7-6fbd83e551d2"},{"objectId":"5e70944a878c28a0473b9c1f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Serwotka-Suszczak","uuid":"3F32F72CF3AEC0297EE325A12FCD83D83F06FEAFAA81F6DE3973FF16E88DD20D1ACB4AD7D1D63CC722A1BC92F30DF5427FFD97D1D9E3A69464E7CA9D76030ECC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4553-0908","documentHash":"a1749336-dc96-4d9a-a499-0adb765be110"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e29a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Marycz","uuid":"232BD10216D5623A2C97AEE2B23109CFB6C3A3BD5B79AA43203A222A1A37A575D9EBD9FFFDABB7F4C32C3CDC7BA67C6A7DE4A8F0D86DC6A5DF0F1CF93573FCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3676-796X","documentHash":"927d7659-0c17-40c1-bed6-9f2cf8d61940"}],"doi":"10.1155/2023/3803056"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1OTQ1NTc0Nw=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
