The scale of its impact is quite wide, starting with the shaping public opinion and ending with the impact on the values, ideals and worldview of recipients. In most cases, the concept of impact, especially language impact, refers to communication understood in terms of its purposefulness and planned effectiveness.\nIn this article, we have presented that the lexical level of a language has an inexhaustible resources in terms of influencing readers' awareness. The strength of the influence of a given lexical unit is determined by its semantic structure, stylistic specificity, and paradigmatic and syntagmatic connections. An important role in terms of impact is also played by precedent phenomena, the correct identification of which proves that the author and the reader have a common mental and verbal base. The reader, by correctly identifying a precedent phenomenon, becomes some kind of member of the \"team\", a group of like-minded people who understand each other.\nThe given examples showed that the headings of which the influencing power is higher, due to the use of the mentioned lexical resources and precedent phenomena, makes them more expressive, playful. They evoke emotional and semantic associations in the reader in order to engage him to read the text."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661702","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"143-156","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b18e6","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wasiluk","uuid":"3044A9877039154867BFD67AF691303C4305F4F7341AFE972801C01FD9159A5540EFB9E1044BC2E3711386F3604E0866F4143BE3F63177CB7E3822E8F7FE4F2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-8994-8177","documentHash":"e5ffbe02-eec1-4e26-822b-786165eee42d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Carnivora","Mammal fauna","Rodentia","Pomerania region","owl pellets","Soricomorpha","Chiroptera"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a047392248"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Small mammals in the diet of the barn owl Tyto alba and the tawny owl Strix aluco in localities in north-western Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac24ad204581b62ebbab","mniswId":"201409","title":"Fragmenta Faunistica","doi":null,"issn":"0015-9301","eissn":"2391-5846","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6fc9b21-b565-4a6d-aa24-58ec04d9f1bd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682504a5fdbe83139258eefd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392248","682504a5fdbe83139258eefe","682504a5fdbe83139258eeff","682504a5fdbe83139258ef00"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Analysis of food composition of two owl species (Tyto alba and Strix aluco) in 14 study sites in the years 1998–2024 revealed the presence of 22 species of small mammals.

Using peripheral blood samples from patients with relapsed/refractory CLL in ELEVATE-RR (NCT02477696; median 2 prior therapies), we report clonal evolution data for patients progressing on acalabrutinib or ibrutinib (median follow-up, 41 months). Paired (baseline and progression) samples were available for 47 (excluding 1 Richter) acalabrutinib-treated and 30 (excluding 6 Richter) ibrutinib-treated patients. At progression, emergent BTK mutations were observed in 31 acalabrutinib-treated (66%) and 11 ibrutinib-treated patients (37%; median variant allele fraction [VAF], 16.1% vs 15.6%, respectively). BTK C481S mutations were most common in both groups; T474I (n = 9; 8 co-occurring with C481) and the novel E41V mutation within the pleckstrin homology domain of BTK (n = 1) occurred with acalabrutinib, whereas neither mutation occurred with ibrutinib. L528W and A428D comutations presented in 1 ibrutinib-treated patient. Preexisting TP53 mutations were present in 25 acalabrutinib-treated (53.2%) and 16 ibrutinib-treated patients (53.3%) at screening. Emergent TP53 mutations occurred with acalabrutinib and ibrutinib (13% vs 7%; median VAF, 6.0% vs 37.3%, respectively). Six acalabrutinib-treated patients and 1 ibrutinib-treated patient had emergent TP53/BTK comutations. Emergent PLCG2 mutations occurred in 3 acalabrutinib-treated (6%) and 6 ibrutinib-treated patients (20%). One acalabrutinib-treated patient and 4 ibrutinib-treated patients had emergent BTK/PLCG2 comutations. Although common BTK C481 mutations were observed with both treatments, patterns of mutation and comutation frequency, mutation VAF, and uncommon BTK variants varied with acalabrutinib (T474I and E41V) and ibrutinib (L528W and A428D) in this patient population.

The detailed habitat maps identify critical areas for protection, enhancing ecosystem services, and supporting nature-based solutions that positively impact residents’ health and social cohesion. A total of 372 sources were analyzed and 467 habitat types were identified primarily from phytosociological surveys.

Fifty-nine months post-inoculation, 30 % of trees exhibited decline symptoms, while 70 % displayed extensive cankers and lesions, 28.3 times larger than those on controls. Infected trees responded by forming tyloses, blocking water transport around the inoculation site. Following infection, increased deposition of polyphenolic compounds was observed in both barrier and reaction zones. Histopathological observations and FTIR measurements revealed enhanced local deposition of suberin, lignin, lignin-related compounds, and tannins within the lumens of ray parenchyma cells, and the cell walls of both libriform fibers and vessels. Proteomic analyses suggest that host trees are employing a salicylic acid-based defense strategy. At the tissue level, these analyses indicate a shift in metabolic pathways, with downregulation of lignin biosynthesis and upregulation of flavonoid and stilbenoid biosynthesis, as evidenced by increased chalcone synthase abundance. Our groundbreaking use of submicron-computed X-ray tomography on woody tissues could pave the way for the widespread adoption of non-destructive 3D scanning technology in plant-fungal interaction research. The findings of this study demonstrated the aggressiveness of O. quercus towards adult Q. petraea and its contribution to the widespread syndrome of oak decline."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661730","journalIssue":{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dd1","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"224","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"814236b5-e73d-47eb-b0a2-4529309a312c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"224","pagesFromTo":"109948","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0981942825004760?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24ddc","name":"Jaroslav","lastName":"Ďurkovič","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4390233b-e661-485a-a4a2-d94cef236073"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24ddb","name":"Martin","lastName":"Černý","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"16a012db-ef63-4bee-9277-67bca8e683a1"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dda","name":"Tomáš","lastName":"Toma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9410fcec-90f2-4b99-8dd4-9e6494fde931"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dd9","name":"Ján","lastName":"Kováč","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c152b144-67b3-49fb-852e-4366ea8e51ec"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dd8","name":"František","lastName":"Kačík","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba3fe69d-e389-45e3-83e5-b5cf21e92b40"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dd7","name":"Vladimír","lastName":"Račko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7413f41-6961-4808-a110-2fbd48a8aed8"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dd6","name":"Zlatan","lastName":"Radulović","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad22cd4e-1d1b-44a5-9c1d-fd61129ca192"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dd5","name":"Vesna Golubović","lastName":"Ćurguz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68d41f00-0095-4cab-a743-a17003bbee10"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dd4","name":"Slobodan","lastName":"Milanović","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"441363dc-e4c9-410a-b0a5-283458b7716d"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dd3","name":"Dragan","lastName":"Karadžić","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4d522fd-d45d-4e67-9540-ff64c6b1b9af"},{"objectId":"682442cffdbe836c41b24dd2","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Milenković","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd546f9f-6a91-43e4-a3e8-f3a82165b6d7"},{"objectId":"5e7093ba878c28a0473afd95","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sikora","uuid":"107ABF2FD2CC3E7458734E9A029445CAF3DB8ACB2A23AFCB20AA57906011B3F05BAF5B814809E8549A2FA30A70752AE11E40171FA6219D4ACE6FC3BF86C0C3E6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3215-5934","documentHash":"35b3b181-708f-4387-afbc-cdc1f0e7257b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.plaphy.2025.109948"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Network extension planning towards resilient urban critical infrastructures using deep reinforcement learning","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477150","mniswId":"1519","title":"APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING","doi":null,"issn":"1568-4946","eissn":"1872-9681","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d6682289-a2a9-4f76-b79c-2480e8a12e1d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68245d24fdbe836c41b5245d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68245d24fdbe836c41b5245f","68245d24fdbe836c41b52460","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As cities continue to grow, expanding metro networks becomes essential for optimizing urban transportation efficiency. Therefore, scientific strategic planning of metro networks is indispensable. This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to discover the optimal planning strategy for metro network extension. The model integrates multi-source data into the reward function while customizing the state and action spaces to reflect the unique characteristics of metro networks. A policy network is developed using an Encoder-Decoder framework, with the parameters being updated by an Actor-Critic framework based on policy gradient. A comprehensive performance index is proposed to evaluate the vulnerability and service capacity of planned networks. The proposed method is validated through a case study on the Hangzhou metro system. The results demonstrate that the proposed DRL can result in optimal planned networks that outperform the actually implemented network with a maximum Performance Improvement Percentage of 19.87 %. The DRL-based optimization framework proposed for metro network extension planning is anticipated to enhance adaptability towards urban development and increase resilience."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661732","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68245d24fdbe836c41b5245e","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"176","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"304fbe90-b819-4c06-946b-99498dbbc3f1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"176","pagesFromTo":"113163","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1568494625004740?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68245d24fdbe836c41b52460","name":"Limao","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fab4dbd0-05bb-47f0-84f4-5416ef0316d9"},{"objectId":"68245d24fdbe836c41b5245f","name":"Qiong","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2cfb4859-da7b-466d-b9c0-4430741fde23"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2025.113163"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-9984-48-433-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Economic Science for Rural Development: Proceedings of the 25th International Scientific Conference 2024","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":420,"publicationPlace":"Jelgava","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68250288fdbe83139258e852","editors":[{"objectId":"68250288fdbe83139258e853","name":"Anita","lastName":"Auzina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02d5a184-4715-4e67-920b-a4c12b92142f"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["68250288fdbe83139258e853"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661746","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5ec00487ad49b31cced82396","mniswId":null,"name":"Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies Faculty of Economics and Social Development","documentHash":"acd6efca-d8ac-419d-99e0-2fb9c2e6c9a0"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.esaf.lbtu.lv/sites/esaf/files/files/lapas/Krajums_Nr_58_12092024.pdf","numberInSeries":"58","authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-67033-64-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df04","uid":"bTekJS7sOItLzJ3Tu1sRSog","uuid":"163ff4e6-d377-4559-accd-7672d40726db","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df04","parentUuid":"163ff4e6-d377-4559-accd-7672d40726db","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df04","rootUuid":"163ff4e6-d377-4559-accd-7672d40726db","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Techniki Pancernej i Samochodowej","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709381878c28a0473ab616","5e70938d878c28a0473ac88e"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Eksploatacja, logistyka, badania sprzętu wojskowego -

One common result of these changes is cystic endometrial hyperplasia (CEH), which often leads to pyometra. Another, though rarer, condition is pseudo-placentational endometrial hyperplasia (PEH), characterized by abnormal proliferation of the endometrial glands and stroma, forming placental-like structures without the presence of pregnancy. Case presentation: An 8-year-old female Golden Retriever, healthy and intact, was presented for a routine ultrasound examination to confirm pregnancy after natural breeding 25 days earlier. Two previous pregnancies of this bitch have resulted in small but live litters. The ultrasound examination revealed multiple bilateral thickenings of the uterine horns, with ampullary-shaped enlargements measuring approximately 2.5 × 3.0 cm 25 days after breeding. The endometrium was conspicuously thickened, hypoechogenic, and either homogeneous or with scattered hyperechoic markings and faint striations. The mucosal surface ranged from regular to slightly irregular, and a small amount of hyperechoic condensed fluid was present in the lumen of the horns. No embryos were observed. Based on these findings, two primary diagnoses were considered: PEH or embryonic resorption sites, with a possible segmental uterine inflammation. A diagnosis suggestive of PEH was established through histopathological examination of the uterus after ovariohysterectomy, supported by consistent ultrasound findings that showed no progression or changes over

intricate nature of prefabricated construction supply chain management (PCSCM) presents ongoing challenges in production scheduling, inventory control, and logistics coordination. Recent advances in quantum computing (QC) offer compelling approaches to address these multifaceted issues by enabling significantly faster and more precise optimization. This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes existing QC research in the supply chain context, particularly focusing on quantum algorithms that target the PCSCM lifecycle. Our analysis identifies three key domains: production, inventory, and transportation, in which QC can outperform classical methods, as evidenced by enhanced scheduling flexibility and cost minimization. However, our findings also highlight crucial bottlenecks, including quantum hardware limitations, organizational readiness gaps, and a lack of specialized interdisciplinary talent. We propose a framework of strategies to guide QC adoption, such as specialized algorithm development, collaborative research partnerships, and standardized data protocols. These insights offer promising future directions for leveraging QC to streamline operations and boost sustainability in the prefabricated construction sector."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661753","journalIssue":{"objectId":"682460dafdbe836c41b58add","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"120","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"138d0a64-08d2-46f8-8690-ee0597cfcfad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"120","pagesFromTo":"103043","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1566253525001162?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682460dafdbe836c41b58ae1","name":"Zhengze","lastName":"Zhu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a049cb3-d962-43ee-aa76-d72fc5b63845"},{"objectId":"682460dafdbe836c41b58ae0","name":"Zheng","lastName":"Ma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d579729-ff98-4b1b-a493-5acbd62bcca2"},{"objectId":"682460dafdbe836c41b58adf","name":"Yue","lastName":"Tan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a05ce14f-9437-49c2-b97d-8da5b9f6dc00"},{"objectId":"682460dafdbe836c41b58ade","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e524fcb8-8286-4f28-b6fb-b05c8c16a09d"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2025.103043"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pharmacogenomics,","Deep computational analysis,","Artificial intelligence,","Pharmacovariants;","Functional assessment;","Machine learning;","High throughput DNA sequencing;"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","uid":"bm3qIJZlNw1U92UVKrOsP_w","uuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","parentUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","rootUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Białymstoku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa250","5e709375878c28a0473aa209","5e7094ee878c28a0473c7347","5e7093ed878c28a0473b3713"]},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f833","uid":"bWuzLWCgoKVIVkdNBCpiq-w","uuid":"8c78162e-c6fb-4f40-9f6b-d888ed8ebf69","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Instytut Informatyki (od 1.10.2019 r.)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922d878c28a0473912d3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Pharmacovariome scanning using whole pharmacogene resequencing coupled with deep computational analysis and machine learning for clinical pharmacogenomics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f62","mniswId":"7769","title":"Human Genomics","doi":null,"issn":"1473-9542","eissn":"1479-7364","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"95fc4634-b841-4ec4-98ff-c49b8c45fa33"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64b804fe4097073a1529cf1c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ee878c28a0473c7347","67f7ab89fdbe837d214aefe6","67f7ab89fdbe837d214aefe7","67f7ab89fdbe837d214aefe8","67f7ab89fdbe837d214aefe9","67f7ab89fdbe837d214aefea","67f7ab89fdbe837d214aefeb","5e70922d878c28a0473912d3","5e709375878c28a0473aa250","5e7093ed878c28a0473b3713","5e709375878c28a0473aa209","67f7ab89fdbe837d214aefed"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background This pilot study aims to identify and functionally assess pharmacovariants in whole exome sequenc-\ning data. While detection of known variants has benefited from pharmacogenomic-dedicated bioinformatics tools\nbefore, in this paper we have tested novel deep computational analysis in addition to artificial intelligence as possible\napproaches for functional analysis of unknown markers within less studied drug-related genes.\nMethods Pharmacovariants from 1800 drug-related genes from 100 WES data files underwent (a) deep compu-\ntational analysis by eight bioinformatic algorithms (overall containing 23 tools) and (b) random forest (RF) classifier\nas the machine learning (ML) approach separately. ML model efficiency was calculated by internal and external cross-\nvalidation during recursive feature elimination. Protein modelling was also performed for predicted highly damag-\ning variants with lower frequencies. Genotype–phenotype correlations were implemented for top selected variants\nin terms of highest possibility of being damaging.\nResults Five deleterious pharmacovariants in the RYR1, POLG, ANXA11, CCNH, and CDH23 genes identified in step (a)\nand subsequent analysis displayed high impact on drug-related phenotypes. Also, the utilization of recursive fea-\nture elimination achieved a subset of 175 malfunction pharmacovariants in 135 drug-related genes that were used\nby the RF model with fivefold internal cross-validation, resulting in an area under the curve of 0.9736842 with an aver-\nage accuracy of 0.9818 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.99) on predicting whether a carrying individuals will develop adverse drug\nreactions or not. However, the external cross-validation of the same model indicated a possible false positive result\nwhen dealing with a low number of observations, as only 60 important variants in 49 genes were displayed, giving\nan AUC of 0.5384848 with an average accuracy of 0.9512 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.99).\nConclusion While there are some technologies for functionally assess not-interpreted pharmacovariants, there is still\nan essential need for the development of tools, methods, and algorithms which are able to provide a functional pre-\ndiction for every single pharmacovariant in both large-scale datasets and small cohorts. Our approaches may bring new insights for choosing the right computational assessment algorithms out of high throughput DNA sequencing\ndata from small cohorts to be used for personalized drug therapy

are a large group of substances belonging to sterols—compounds naturally occurring in the tissues of plants, animals, and humans. The most well-known animal sterol is cholesterol. Among phytosterols, the most significant compounds are β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol. At present, they are mainly employed in functional food products designed to counteract cardiovascular disorders by lowering levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol, which stands as their most extensively studied purpose. It is currently understood that phytosterols may also alleviate conditions associated with the gastrointestinal system. Their beneficial pharmacological properties in relation to gastrointestinal tract include anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activity. Also, the anti-cancer properties as well as the impact on the gut microbiome could be a very interesting area of research, which might potentially lead to the discovery of their new application. This article provides consolidated knowledge on a new potential use of phytosterols, namely the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal diseases. The cited studies indicate high therapeutic efficacy in conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, IBD or liver failure caused by hepatotoxic xenobiotics, however, these are mainly in vitro or in vivo studies. Nevertheless, studies to date indicate their therapeutic potential as adjunctive treatments to conventional therapies, which often exhibit unsatisfactory efficacy or serious side effects. Unfortunately, at this point there is a lack of significant clinical study data to use phytosterols in clinical practice in this area."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661760","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8247/17/5/557","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682508defdbe83139258fd10","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Chłopecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce9ee251-103c-42a1-8871-67dd433d460b"},{"objectId":"682508defdbe83139258fd0f","name":"Kijan","lastName":"Crowley","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25ef50b7-6244-4a58-922a-3439a9e68726"},{"objectId":"682508defdbe83139258fd0e","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bajguz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aea7672d-51e7-4668-a154-1ed3f257eeeb"},{"objectId":"682508defdbe83139258fd0d","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Miszczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3a6d954-ce0b-4c75-a4f4-68db9d66a96a"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abf38","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kiraga","uuid":"BE40454D912F7E4E3D33BEE59875C416344C001D7ED98387F01D5F543F924C28D41C7EDBBBB88423A50DC70048C65C7C740EC36588D13C8C3A6AD3EA0539CB31","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e59bf7ff-2ad8-4c88-abeb-1252b66c9dbc"}],"doi":"10.3390/ph17050557"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["opinions of medical university students","healthcare financing","healthcare organization","work factors","workforce","working conditions"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Future healthcare professionals on working conditions in Poland: perspective of medical university students","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2b","mniswId":"14213","title":"Medycyna Pracy","doi":null,"issn":"0465-5893","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a834da15-2048-4057-90af-2c4e93d47cc5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-06-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6824856dfdbe831392581713","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e1878c28a04739e9f6","6824856dfdbe831392581714","5e709450878c28a0473ba524"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Students of medical universities, future employees, will have an impact on the shaping healthcare system. It is important to know and understand their opinions on the factors affecting working conditions and, consequently, changes necessary to improve effectiveness of health care. Students’ expectations can contribute to the changing working conditions for graduates and bring added value to health system redefinition. \r\n\r\nMaterial and Methods: The study used factor analysis to check whether its use was justified. Reliability analysis was performed and structure indicators were determined for each question. The anonymous survey was conducted from September 2017 until March 2018; 1205 students were randomly selected for the sample. \r\n\r\nResults: Eighty percent of the students declared interest in healthcare changes, >50% reported that the main factors influencing the work were competencies, financing, medical equipment and organization. Over 90% of the respondents indicated too long wait times for an appointment with a specialist and admission to hospital as the reason for the low efficiency of healthcare, whereas >80% of the survey participants considered insufficient funding to be a barrier. The need for changing the financing scheme was underlined by >90% of the students, and of health priorities by about 80%. Approximately 71% of the respondents were in favour of limiting the role of government in decision-making processes and introducing changes into the education system. \r\n\r\nConclusions: Students’ views on organizational and financial factors of working conditions can contribute to improvement in systemic solutions at both micro and macro levels. Limiting the role of politicians in planning and implementing reforms can motivate employees to be more creative and decisive. Analysis of opinions can bring added value to health policy and systemic changes and should be extended by further research results after the COVID-19 pandemic. Students’ interest in healthcare reform encourages reflection on enriching education with managerial skills."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661763","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"75","pagesFromTo":"321-332","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://medpr.imp.lodz.pl/Future-healthcare-professionals-on-working-conditions-in-Poland-perspective-of-medical,187809,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6824856dfdbe831392581714","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Strzelecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dca71b74-f91a-4902-bb90-47c7721f5f25"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba524","name":"Anna","lastName":"Rybarczyk-Szwajkowska","uuid":"D8E3E2E072926E6537095B8FB7B1C8262CF45818A1928CCB02AF2FED8680F204E0FDDE8526B9982CEDA8CCF69DCD60BE3449CB5BAC9FF69A56A7641FD4CBF723","orcidId":"0000-0002-8751-130X","documentHash":"9394cb96-bf5e-4f97-b151-93f8e8a6a082"},{"objectId":"5e7092e1878c28a04739e9f6","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Rydlewska-Liszkowska","uuid":"259F471E39034C2783B9399E8019185807CF2EF70E53ED672610938882521665C81DE291FB64625BFC5118FD770EEA07A600472FF56C89E6EAF7446973E05AEF","orcidId":"0000-0003-0891-6315","documentHash":"a2ced689-05cf-4335-8b19-b085abfa410b"}],"doi":"10.13075/mp.5893.01453"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["freeze drying","color","microbiological evaluation","pulsed electric field","edible insects","chemical composition","structure"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b66d0","682507bafdbe83139258f780","5e709487878c28a0473bf096","5e70923b878c28a04739221b","5e7092bc878c28a04739bb46"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Pulsed Electric Field Treatment Effect on Drying Kinetics and Chosen Quality Aspects of Freeze-Dried Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) and Yellow Mealworm (Tenebrio molitor) Larvae","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682507bafdbe83139258f77f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682507bafdbe83139258f780","5e7092bc878c28a04739bb46","5e709487878c28a0473bf096","5e70941c878c28a0473b66d0","682507bafdbe83139258f781","682507bafdbe83139258f782","5e70923b878c28a04739221b"]},"issue":"18","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Freeze drying is employed as one of the most effective preservation techniques, allowing dried material to be obtained characterized by high-quality properties. However, it also stands out as being one of the most energy-intensive methods and, consequently, expensive processes. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine how the application of pulsed electric field (PEF) at 5 and 20 kJ/kg impacts the drying kinetics and the final quality of freeze-dried insects, including chemical composition, physical properties, and microbiological quality. For PEF-treated samples, a comparable content of protein (35.7–37.4 for H. illucens, 45.4–48.0 for T. molitor) to the untreated sample (35.8 for H. illucens and 48.0 for T. molitor) was noted. There were no significant distinctions found in the rehydration and hygroscopic characteristics across most tested samples. However, microtomography of freeze-dried H. illucens and T. molitor larvae unveils notable alterations in their internal structures influenced by both their species and the pre-treatment applied. The PEF-treated and freeze-dried H. illucens larvae exhibited a notably darker color (34.7–34.9) compared to the untreated sample (42.1), while a relatively consistent lightness for T. molitor larvae was observed. The performed study outlines that PEF treatment did not enhance the freeze-drying process of insect biomass and did not exhibit suitable microbiological quality for food purposes. Only fungi exhibited greater susceptibility to the effects of PEF treatment in comparison to bacteria, resulting in a reduction of 1.9 to 2.6 log cycles. Furthermore, PEF treatment did not negatively affect valuable compounds such as protein or fat.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661765","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/18/10251","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682507bafdbe83139258f782","name":"Sergiy","lastName":"Smetana","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51911c78-700e-4370-904b-41f9dd2b37cf"},{"objectId":"682507bafdbe83139258f781","name":"Parniakov","lastName":"Oleksii","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec9ccc9b-caf1-4722-86df-f4dacc3e771d"},{"objectId":"682507bafdbe83139258f780","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Bogusz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2057914-343c-42b7-9e48-a56cfb7a1f70"},{"objectId":"5e709487878c28a0473bf096","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Rybak","uuid":"23CE32C58512E32A4B96EAE0AE9ECB2BF23310D66D220B65BFBB79CD39E7F53ECA83523B7822465B1A3A51369BA847D9FDD6BA28CDC2F09E8BE6E1DD13CE7440","orcidId":"0000-0003-3595-0818","documentHash":"4fdd131f-d106-4642-a4be-de7994ac4305"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66d0","name":"Artur","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"010FA8DE122350EBAD6F8A5062022838B6FEB5B2764C1582A1AAD62DC8DBE403926FE7E8B140F4750DA9C02F135814EFF2586301F745BD350DA7A1164E3AB545","orcidId":"0000-0003-4058-6010","documentHash":"f81f2de6-4a40-4a79-a412-0f00a3c570b2"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bb46","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pobiega","uuid":"3231AADA75EB512A5688122B41E2DFE88D86F3DE4A6B997988CE034ED561C7394C06732EE1FF7FF623D42A2EC59E35C7B4371CBEB5D9A49A154386AA2758F0B2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3532-8666","documentHash":"f2873c2c-ae2f-4119-9627-3aa99c51372d"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a04739221b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Nowacka","uuid":"E85B587CB83FA262B33EC648A56233E393FCEE2E993B8374949D817101C99BFE915F89BFEA3B24894CF241C78C82241C2FCAD33FFB0DBE868B6365630E5D17A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4689-6909","documentHash":"4ecb9480-c3af-4d13-9055-38f9ae2905e5"}],"doi":"10.3390/app131810251"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["multifactorial stress; GE interaction; crop domestication"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Thirteen substances have already been considered in FGE.80 and its revision and in FGE.96 [FL-no: 10.005, 10.024, 10.025, 10.050, 10.061, 10.069, 10.070, 10.072, 10.169,13.009, 13.012, 13.161 and 16.055]. The remaining flavouring substance 3a,4,5,7a-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethylbenzofuran-2(3H)-one [FL-no: 10.057] has been cleared with respect to genotoxicity in FGE.217Rev3 and it is considered in this revision 2 of FGE.80. The substance [FL-no: 10.057] was evaluated through a stepwise approach that integrates information on the structure–activity relationships, intake from current uses, threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) and available data on metabolism and toxicity. The Panel concluded that [FL-no: 10.057] does not give rise to safety concerns at its levels of dietary intake, when estimated on the basis of the ‘Maximised Survey-derived Daily Intake’ (MSDI) approach. Besides the safety assessment of the flavouring substance, the specifications for the material of commerce have also been considered and the information provided was com plete for [FL-no: 10.057]. However, for the flavouring substance [FL-no: 10.057] in the present revision and for eight substances evaluated in previous revisions, the ‘modified Theoretical Added Maximum Daily Intakes’ (mTAMDIs) values are above the TTC for their structural class (III). For four substances previously evaluated in FGE.80Rev1 and in FGE.96, use levels are still needed to calculate the mTAMDI estimates.

However, they tend to agglomerate and sediment, which is an unfavorable phenomenon. An effective strategy to prevent this is to modify the surface of the particles with polymeric compounds, which can increase compatibility and stability in the electrolyte system. To reduce agglomeration and sedimentation, a method was developed to modify aluminum oxide and silica particles using aluminum carboxylate, which chemically combines with inorganic particles that have hydroxyl groups on their surface through an alkoxide bond. This method allows the introduction of oligooxyethylene groups to the ceramic surface, thus obtaining more stable systems. The effectiveness of this modification was confirmed through dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of particle size in liquid organic solvents, which are potential solvents for liquid electrolytes in lithium-ion cells. The modified nanosilica and aluminum oxide particles were then used as additives to solid polymer electrolytes made of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). This led to higher conductivity values compared to the use of unmodified fillers. The obtained values of lithium transference number for solid polymer electrolyte with PEO/CF3SO3Li and nanosilica or aluminum oxide modified with aluminum carboxylate are equal to 0.32-0.40."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661776","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"130","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00339-024-08007-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68249cf4fdbe83139258c878","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kruk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39565b59-a268-4273-b230-471d0cbe94ab"},{"objectId":"68249cf4fdbe83139258c877","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Monikowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a71237f3-86cd-4c3b-b662-8a7483645289"},{"objectId":"68249cf4fdbe83139258c876","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Czerwiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b1f1cb8-eb41-4e16-8821-48bdd947f3f7"},{"objectId":"634a1b297523402e3412727a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Słojewska","uuid":"4349ACA4A35A906875EE3223082A18029F0C5FD16E85BD0A1C1491549AE8250A854D1F4674C9B37CC60174D0A66D46B05F4136215C72C649311B244DDF0B03B3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"799f4619-cebc-4994-831b-a051fb694c0b"},{"objectId":"5e709327878c28a0473a3c1b","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zygadło-Monikowska","uuid":"BEDD3F11D43CA2514BBB9CE0E534902194AA0DE746D316DF219D7BB2329F7EEF8A37100B68C6A9ABE105310D88E2466AC14187A49FBCF95D4E189C5DADCD9304","orcidId":"0000-0003-0478-9160","documentHash":"6200b471-928f-427b-8191-97ae33288186"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00339-024-08007-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Eco-Regions","sustainable food systems","biomarkers","sustainable and healthy diet","workshop","somatic health","indicators","Biodistrict","INSUM"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6825084ffdbe83139258face","6825084ffdbe83139258facf","5e70923b878c28a047392235","5e70923d878c28a047392294","6825084ffdbe83139258fad0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Identifying Future Study Designs and Indicators for Somatic Health Associated with Diets of Cohorts Living in Eco-Regions: Findings from the INSUM Expert Workshop","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","doi":null,"issn":"2072-6643","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"249ff7e0-f443-46aa-b5c4-21f8cf400d2e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6825084ffdbe83139258facd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6825084ffdbe83139258face","6825084ffdbe83139258facf","6825084ffdbe83139258fad0","5e70923b878c28a047392235","5e70923d878c28a047392294","6825084ffdbe83139258fad1","6825084ffdbe83139258fad2","6825084ffdbe83139258fad3","6825084ffdbe83139258fad4","6825084ffdbe83139258fad5","6825084ffdbe83139258fad6","6825084ffdbe83139258fad7","6825084ffdbe83139258fad8","6825084ffdbe83139258fad9","6825084ffdbe83139258fada","6825084ffdbe83139258fadb","6825084ffdbe83139258fadc","6825084ffdbe83139258fadd","6825084ffdbe83139258fade","6825084ffdbe83139258fadf","6825084ffdbe83139258fae0","6825084ffdbe83139258fae1"]},"issue":"15","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Diets, but also overall food environments, comprise a variety of significant factors with direct and indirect impacts on human health. Eco-Regions are geographical areas with a territorial approach to rural development, utilizing organic food and farming practices, and principles and promoting sustainable communities and food systems. However, so far, little attention has been given to quantifying aspects of the health of citizens living in these sustainable transition territories. The project “Indicators for Assessment of Health Effects of Consumption of Sustainable, Organic School Meals in Eco-Regions” (INSUM) aims to identify and discuss research approaches and indicators that could be applied to effectively measure the somatic, mental, and social health dimensions of citizens in Eco-Regions, linked to the intake of organic foods in their diets. In this paper, we focus on the somatic (physical) health dimension. A two-day workshop was held to discuss suitable methodology with an interdisciplinary, international group of experts. The results showed the limitations of commonly used tools for measuring dietary intake (e.g., relying on the memory of participants), and nutritional biomarkers (e.g., variations in correlations with specific intakes) for research understanding dietary intake and the health effects of diets. To investigate the complexity of this issue, the most suitable approach seems to be the combination of traditional markers of physical and mental health alongside emerging indicators such as the microbiome, nutrigenomics, metabolomics, or inflammatory biomarkers. Using new, digital, non-invasive, and wearable technologies to monitor indicators could complement future research. We conclude that future studies should adopt systemic, multidisciplinary approaches by combining not only indicators of somatic and mental health and social wellbeing (MHSW) but also considering the

Intraoperative fluid management is one of the most important factors affecting optimal perfusion in the microcirculatory area in patients that undergo flap surgery. While insufficient fluid administration in the intraoperative period leads to flap complications and organ dysfunction, volume load can cause complications such as edema in the denervated flap tissue, the opening of the sutures, or fat necrosis. The Infrared Fluorescent Angiography Perfusion Evaluation Device (SPY) is one of the many noninvasive techniques that evaluate the well-being of microcirculation at the tissue level. This device monitors and scores the perfusion distribution in the flap area. This retrospective study aimed to investigate the effect of fluid resuscitation in head and neck free flap transfer surgery on flap quality and patient outcomes according to the change in SPY scores. Material and Method: This study included 39 ASA I–II patients who were aged 18–60 years and underwent simultaneous free flap reconstruction of the head and neck between 2015 and 2021. Patients’ blood pressure, body temperature, hemoglobin, pH, and lactate values were recorded at both baseline and end of the operation. Also, the SPY “Infrared Fluorescent Angiography Perfusion Evaluation Device” scores, the amount of intraoperative fluid and transfusion, bleeding and urine output, and the duration of mechanical ventilation, anesthesia and surgery, and the duration and amount of drainage, the length of stay in hospital and intensive care unit, and the presence of flap infection, detachment, necrosis and loss, and re-exploration rate were recorded for the patients. Results: The difference between the first and last measured SPY values was observed to be positively correlated with the length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit and the duration of drainage. There was a positive correlation between the length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit and the duration of drainage, the amount of drainage, as well as the duration of anesthesia and the duration of surgery (p < 0.001). A positive correlation was found between the amount of drainage and the amount of crystalloid solution administered (r = 0.36, p < 0.05). In patients with flap infection, the difference between SPYfirst and SPYlast, the duration of anesthesia, and the duration of surgery were significantly higher. The amount of crystalloid solution given and bleeding and the duration of anesthesia and surgery were found to be significantly higher in mechanically ventilated patients (p < 0.05). Conclusions: It has been concluded that SPY-guided fluid management can be beneficial in preventing morbidities, such as extended hospital and intensive care stay, by reducing flap infection, mechanical ventilation duration, and drainage, with early diagnosis of insufficient perfusion."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661780","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9721/12/10/255","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68243abcfdbe83139256a42d","name":"Bulent","lastName":"Sacak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95642815-6fc3-4dbf-b3f0-b83370ab4678"},{"objectId":"68243abcfdbe83139256a42c","name":"Tumay","lastName":"Umuroglu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95815658-94c0-4dac-b6e7-b85049b68ef8"},{"objectId":"68243abcfdbe83139256a42b","name":"Ilhan","lastName":"Erdem","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64bb94de-5a6d-47cb-90a9-c2ea4437ed0f"},{"objectId":"68243abcfdbe83139256a42a","name":"Gul","lastName":"Cakmak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3af014aa-43dd-4eda-af93-aee147d65dc5"},{"objectId":"68243abcfdbe83139256a429","name":"Kemal T.","lastName":"Saracoglu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"652ba82d-28c9-499f-8dad-14dd036bcd26"},{"objectId":"68243abcfdbe83139256a428","name":"Gamze Tanirgan","lastName":"Cabakli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c34a7fc-fc9b-458d-babb-1f0e6ee50f94"},{"objectId":"68243abcfdbe83139256a427","name":"Ayten","lastName":"Saracoglu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"04d25a51-4d0a-441d-b135-df7f5680e975"},{"objectId":"5e709204878c28a04738eb55","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Ratajczyk","uuid":"17930450FBB104FD799CC5124664080A9CBB263D28D25F704582E6799AF29C8016B2BDB8612FCF984BF3E944A7B5FFA6130A07B558D5466B9134CD21ED0061D5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51773ffc-f762-4cc4-955d-949ab4263c86"}],"doi":"10.3390/diseases12100255"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","5e7093a2878c28a0473ae2d9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Characterisation and application of electrodes with hydrogenated titania nanotubes modified with M13 bacteriophages","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a8b","mniswId":"12673","title":"Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry","doi":null,"issn":"1432-8488","eissn":"1433-0768","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ee44a083-0fb3-4ee3-b7dc-2f36525cc775"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682487cafdbe836c41b8fdc7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682487cafdbe836c41b8fdc9","682487cafdbe836c41b8fdca","682487cafdbe836c41b8fdcb","5e7093a2878c28a0473ae2d9","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The sponge-like hydrogenated titania nanotubes (S-TiO2-NTs) modified with M13 bacteriophages were investigated for bacterial detection.

Several strategies are used in this field, among which chemical post-polymerization modification has recently been the most explored. Particular attention revolves around polymer-L-cysteine (Cys) conjugates. Cys, a natural amino acid, contains reactive thiol, amine, and carboxyl moieties, allowing hydrogen bond formation and improved tissue adhesion when conjugated to polymers. Conjugation of Cys and its derivatives to polymers has been examined mostly for hyaluronic acid, chitosan, alginate, polyesters, polyurethanes, poly(ethylene glycol), poly(acrylic acid), polycarbophil, and carboxymethyl cellulose. It was shown that the conjugation of Cys and its derivatives to polymers significantly increased their tissue adhesion, particularly mucoadhesion, stability at physiological pH, drug encapsulation efficiency, drug release, and drug permeation. Conjugates were also non-toxic toward various cell lines. These properties make Cys conjugation a promising strategy for advancing polymer applications in drug delivery systems and tissue engineering. This review aims to provide an overview of these features and to present the conjugation of Cys and its derivatives as a modern and promising approach for enhancing polymer tissue adhesion and its application in the medical field.\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661784","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/22/12177","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebecab5752340226956f905","name":"Marta","lastName":"Chrószcz-Porębska","uuid":"FF08AC2CC609A5CC8C19248E904FA699CBE71A233B5EF982FBB413EB8055FDE8B50C73EAD9536ABCBF338925A797B02941D752402B165C330731716DBA52F9C8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c39e47a-c7bd-4ee0-979f-93436b381765"},{"objectId":"5e709466878c28a0473bc229","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gadomska-Gajadhur","uuid":"A74088921344B2D82E8C150687AB91FB821DA7DD0D753AB3D945D1FA1A98717F06417BCB5A00799217410D8DC2152A3D0639CD3398EF66B3D257C95176792238","orcidId":"0000-0001-7686-1745","documentHash":"0281389b-b7b7-49df-8dce-b5cbbf162f61"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms252212177"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["glassware","computer vision","coating resistance","quality inspection","non-contact measurement"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6825059dfdbe83139258f399","5e70923d878c28a0473923d9","6825059dfdbe83139258f398"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Vision Inspection Method for the Quality Assessment of Paint Coatings on Glassware","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66ec8bf7fdbe835f93a64b16","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a0473923d9","6825059dfdbe83139258f396","6825059dfdbe83139258f397","6825059dfdbe83139258f398","6825059dfdbe83139258f399"]},"issue":"18","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Image analysis is becoming increasingly popular in many industries. Its use is perfect for, among other things, assessing the quality of products on or off the production line. Highly automated, high-performance systems can be used for this purpose. However, there are situations in which automated vision systems cannot be used on the production line due to the specific nature of the process. One such situation is testing the resistance of paint applied to glass when washing in\nautomatic dishwashers. It is carried out outside the production line, and typical production vision systems are not used here. An attempt was made to develop a cheap and easy-to-implement research method enabling quantitative measurement of paint loss on glass when testing the coating’s resistance\nto automatic washing. For this purpose, analysis of images taken during the study was carried out. The developed method is based on taking a series of photos of the tested object between each stage of the wash resistance test. The obtained photographic material is then analyzed by measuring the size of paint losses expressed in the number of pixels. Then, the percentage of paint loss is calculated.\nThis method is cheap to implement and highly accurate. Statistical analysis of the results confirmed the method’s accuracy at 98%."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661785","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/18/4566","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6825059dfdbe83139258f399","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Boruszewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"01251d10-26a0-4dd1-a044-6e8cc8a9e1ee"},{"objectId":"6825059dfdbe83139258f398","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Betlej","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"560f5a15-45d5-4fb4-bd79-3d50d0b9cd3d"},{"objectId":"6825059dfdbe83139258f397","name":"Andrzej ","lastName":"Chochół","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7b18584-8bd5-47be-902c-8a86b17ec746"},{"objectId":"6825059dfdbe83139258f396","name":"Damian","lastName":"Dubis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35d23dba-4942-4218-a49f-86601c290435"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d9","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Borysiuk","uuid":"5840C22A72165009AF83E02CBB32F2E8C13A364E0B8236856B64167F577A6D500105B5C0CE0193E901FDF203D5CF7BB01787FAC44F2CC76B12A002615128F0D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7508-9359","documentHash":"dda98cac-82d2-4ed6-9cb5-7c3d52b92d1d"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17184566"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-3-031-37935-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Syncytia: Origin, Structure, and Functions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":485,"publicationPlace":"Cham","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65952ab94097076c148fffb7","editors":[{"objectId":"6825048afdbe83139258edec","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Uosef","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"04ddf3cc-873b-4d7f-ab00-fc352ce96253"},{"objectId":"6825048afdbe83139258edeb","name":"Malgorzata","lastName":"Kloc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94d445ed-e968-44b3-811c-15fd1ef7ebdd"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6825048afdbe83139258edeb","6825048afdbe83139258edec"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661790","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-37936-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-37936-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hordeum vulgare","total antioxidant capacity","microspore embryogenesis","metabolism","oxidative stress"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","uid":"bmfkTgrYux51kKuOA70Q27Q","uuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","parentUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","rootUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","name":"Instytut Hodowli i Aklimatyzacji Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b467a","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4946"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebee621752340254fc44d1b","5e709316878c28a0473a29b0","5e709315878c28a0473a2861"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

After stress pretreatment the anthers were cultured in the presence of 10 mg L−1 GA (Gm) or on control medium (Cm) and compared with respect to activity of selected antioxidant and respiratory enzymes and endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content. The anthers from Cm and Gm differed in the strategy against H2O2 overproduction, in that the total peroxidase (POX) activity and the number of POX isoforms were significantly higher in Gm- than in Cm-cultured material. High POX activity on Gm paralleled with H2O2 decrease, suggesting the utilization of this chemical for the POX-mediated cell wall formation and reconstruction during growth of multicellular structures. The total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity on Cm and Gm were at similar level for most of the culture period but the activity of MnSOD was dozen times higher on Gm and this coincided with high activity of fumarase and cytochrome c oxidase. It indicates close interplay between efficient antioxidative protection and high metabolic rate accompanying efficient androgenesis. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of POX and other antioxidative and defense enzymes in protein fraction of GA used in the experiments, however as revealed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay, the Gm and Cm displayed similar total antioxidant capacity. Thus, the effect of GA on androgenic cultures of barley can be linked to its influence on the activity of anther antioxidant system, rather than its native antioxidative properties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661792","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"153","pagesFromTo":"145-157","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/319292","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6557064240970749a873f8da","name":"J.","lastName":"Zimny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4be04a2-3fa7-49f0-8cd7-e3adc0eeacda"},{"objectId":"6557064240970749a873f8d9","name":"S.","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c517f08-f5f6-42d9-a9d0-0b62aaae78fc"},{"objectId":"63e1033840970740cdcaff19","name":"R.","lastName":"Konieczny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a93536c2-f192-43dd-87b4-57cc66ca0ddd"},{"objectId":"63e1033840970740cdcaff18","name":"W.","lastName":"Bąba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1472e917-9c81-4e4f-92ce-aa414869cec2"},{"objectId":"63e1033840970740cdcaff17","name":"I.","lastName":"Gašparíková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65657f0e-ade8-440b-8f48-3d9b4026b456"},{"objectId":"63e1033840970740cdcaff16","name":"M.","lastName":"Sebela","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d9e2b13-268f-43e2-8750-a39603659857"},{"objectId":"63e1033840970740cdcaff12","name":"K.","lastName":"Makowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"019a1b3c-d7c7-4a77-b5c8-a95de468994b"},{"objectId":"63e1033840970740cdcaff11","name":"A.","lastName":"Klajmon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"844528e3-7172-4ed4-ae73-43fd3913a0ee"},{"objectId":"5ebee621752340254fc44d1b","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Klajmon","uuid":"345E167661EC59D02D06C10B6FA41D5C24BA5CF205E24A68AEE1B25866DD68DC21B02A8B28A12E11D3DB86C4B70E913F39538245FB01EF8AD8A06CB56ABC5469","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18f7a1cd-4f30-4442-b09a-b88384617415"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4946","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"E3D3CBF163AAAD16660FD67BEA7CA804AE359E446829DBEFE9A11EDFA0B1FF5A72A185C1C3A109E32F1B3A077547686B0A7B1BF3614AC2A5339F994751923A06","orcidId":"0000-0002-5136-6059","documentHash":"dd7dd693-3a87-4734-a967-100916a1451b"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b467a","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Zimny","uuid":"76E7D9811E9B8C256B58AA701919E2E4E6D638E27A6B9AED71EF05F2EFEAF46A6055D8C2D0F6EAAB8E1F4BFC4EC7A39488B3A779DBA7BEB57825947C70AB0BC4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1521-0874","documentHash":"23520b2b-2009-4e55-946c-f30c133d8421"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b88","name":"Marta","lastName":"Libik-Konieczny","uuid":"68E0F0823BFA6BB243B69BEAC7746CE8FB6D4D28207E1B34E232A46024C6F205E22B00B6FB939C138C926CA71825A3DDAB75AFF1E65ABC106C0728F529440059","orcidId":"0000-0003-0378-2960","documentHash":"668cb7b8-9929-41c5-b5a7-be932cb34905"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a29b0","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bąba","uuid":"CCB17581569A76A138DEB9A9DF0708F0527B171743C6F3347952409F341E2BE29FD10B1ED75F53CB58349B2D3852D670231360AF0C2691F2E06E148879B19C61","orcidId":"0000-0001-7428-0429","documentHash":"abf998f8-0325-4dfb-b503-9d093593f90c"},{"objectId":"5e709315878c28a0473a2861","name":"Robert","lastName":"Konieczny","uuid":"11E99AC3F8FB3A365DEFA37752063B8B464C8F827DE75BE5B8E8E1E0D99CE1E3460F3738C07247DD4812CDE00CB00CDE95408C8A513F320EAD77AC2D296FF584","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a5548230-5e29-4c95-97a1-b5b1abafbb4f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11240-023-02451-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aminokwasy  niebiałkowe,  biofarmaceutyki,  kwas  pipekolowy,  patogeneza,  systemiczna  odporność nabyta"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The solutions used in modernly managed, well-organized, subsidized, and ethically militarized systems become a point of reference and a model for organizations that encounter perturbations in the management of the organization’s human resources. The most important of them are certainly the sense of trust of subordinates in their superiors and the leaders’ responsibility for the level of staff development. The aim of the research undertaken was to verify the thesis that can be formulated in this affirmative sentence: “A modern commander should be honorable, self-confident, and have the ability to influence his subordinates and shape friendly interpersonal contacts in the group he reports.” The literature search in the field of leadership and questionnaire research were aimed at answering the main research question: “What mental properties and behavioural features should characterize a responsible leader in military organizations?”. The work uses the diagnostic survey method, and the interview was conducted using a multi-factor survey questionnaire on a 30-person study group consisting of professional soldiers aged 25–40. The adopted age range of the study group corresponds to the period of active military service, from the age of graduation to the year of termination of active military service. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire is composed of two scales, creating a total of 37 randomly ordered statements in the form of single-choice questions. To analyze the distribution of answers, ranks were used to assess the degree of their compliance with the respondents’ beliefs. Based on the conclusions from the conducted research, we have grounds to believe that professional soldiers expect their leader to be helpful to his subordinates and to ensure that the soldiers are motivated to act and perform their tasks. An important behavior that is expected from the commander is the desire to have a common mission in achieving the goal. Based on the research results, it was found that an undesirable feature is the inconsistency of commanders when pointing out the mistakes of their subordinates, who do not devote interest and time to learning how to avoid mistakes and to improve the competence of their subordinates."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661803","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eee88c40970749973e38f3","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"6","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"bc216867-03a3-48ba-8ec3-140b6d1a324e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"6","pagesFromTo":"3394","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ojs.piscomed.com/index.php/HRMS/article/view/3394","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a7071","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"PIETRAKOWSKI","uuid":"21AAED61A99E80392EE7139A3FD853370A2DC6BEA807FC9A37FF097736F75A355A261B09C31DB9E143FC1443EBC85B82363DBA0DE6061EFB8BDF070D6DDA3D7D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6670-4383","documentHash":"a0ab5917-1e15-4a92-886c-3b6efeb3aae4"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f630","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Nagody-Mrozowicz","uuid":"33EE7835463389D0A474DDD7D3D66F13D568AB506B9276D6A685F1E08A6E682DE439A43E51A4F2CAF81E117214A951736D01B5E5AFC1F563FCAD9D3DD7FE2892","orcidId":"0000-0002-9211-5256","documentHash":"ddae246c-ee9f-48cd-a173-62aa273f9737"}],"doi":"10.18282/hrms.v6i4.3394"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła

Platelets secrete adhesion molecules and cytokines, interact with leukocytes and endothelium, and express toll-like receptors involved in a direct interaction with pathogens. Platelets express A2A and A2B subtypes of receptors for adenosine. The activation of these receptors leads to an increase in cAMP concentration in the cytoplasm, thereby resulting in inhibited secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and reduced cell activation. Therefore, platelet adenosine receptors could be a potential target for inhibiting platelet activation and thus down-regulating inflammation or immunity. The biological effects of adenosine are short-lasting, because the compound is rapidly metabolized; hence, its lability has triggered efforts to synthesize new, longer-lasting adenosine analogues.

First, with the use of the specific tunneling energy, advancing speed and cutter wear as objective functions, a BO-CatBoost prediction model for shield construction parameters and various objectives was constructed, and the key influencing factors were identified via the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. Then, a BO-CatBoost-NSGA-III model was developed to obtain Pareto solutions under different scenarios involving the adjustment of the key influencing factors. Finally, adopting the Wuhan Metro as the background, the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of the constructed algorithm were verified. The results indicated that (1) the developed BO-CatBoost algorithm is superior to 9 other algorithms. The R2 values of the proposed approach were 0.976 and 0.901–0.976 on the test set.

One of the most well-known fermented products is bread. It plays an important role in human nutrition because of the valuable compounds it contains. The growing population leads to an increase in global bread consumption and other bakery products. Simultaneously, in developed countries, declining consumption trends are observed. Understanding the complex interplay between socio-economic dynamics, food production policies, and the dietary patterns of society is crucial for shaping effective strategies that align with the principles of a sustainable and resilient food system. The aim of this study was to determine bread consumption trends in Poland. Data were obtained from the Household Budget Surveys carried out by Statistics Poland. The study considered the period from 1978 to 2020 and was performed in three dimensions: socio-economic groups, the number of people in households, and income quintile groups. A decreasing trend in bread consumption was observed within the analyzed period in all three socio-economic groups. Based on the analysis of the relationship between bread consumption and income level per capita, the same observation was made. There was no correlation between the amount of bread consumed and the number of people in the household. The obtained data are determined by many factors, including prices of bread, demographic changes, dietary patterns, and education in the field of human nutrition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661816","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"7776-7787","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.4383","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682488b0fdbe83139258172a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Berłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44b86ab8-6809-4815-894b-9a75eb33dcde"},{"objectId":"682488b0fdbe831392581729","name":"Wiktoria","lastName":"Liszkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b65407f1-7e4c-44b1-a427-c4f98230e73c"},{"objectId":"682488b0fdbe831392581728","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Motyl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c4b0ce3-e056-4675-bf58-08f20d561c60"},{"objectId":"682488b0fdbe831392581727","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Dziugan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"86220c73-6c0c-4bdb-a954-db26a0f7a9e5"},{"objectId":"682488b0fdbe831392581726","name":"Bogusława","lastName":"Dobrowolska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a78bc32c-1186-462e-a048-9f3af5683fc6"},{"objectId":"682488b0fdbe831392581725","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sadowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8eb253cc-5af7-4335-aac5-0aca4641567f"},{"objectId":"5e7092e1878c28a04739e9f6","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Rydlewska-Liszkowska","uuid":"259F471E39034C2783B9399E8019185807CF2EF70E53ED672610938882521665C81DE291FB64625BFC5118FD770EEA07A600472FF56C89E6EAF7446973E05AEF","orcidId":"0000-0003-0891-6315","documentHash":"a2ced689-05cf-4335-8b19-b085abfa410b"}],"doi":"10.1002/fsn3.4383"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła

In an era of dynamic urbanization, especially in densely populated regions such as the Greater Istanbul Metropolitan Area, land degradation (LD) is a widespread and multifaceted phenomenon. Hence, there is a need for monitoring LD to track the direction of urban sprawl and respond rationally. In this context, the purpose of this study was to investigate the magnitude and directions of LD in Istanbul from 1984 to 2022. The originality of the study lies in the development of the CAI_A index, which is a quantitative measure of the degree of anthropogenic impact. This study utilized Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 satellite imagery from 1984, 2002, and 2022, employing a maximum likelihood classification method to determine land cover and land use changes. The results show that the area of LD by anthropogenic activity has increased by an average of nearly 40 percentage points in each district of Istanbul over the past four decades, significantly impacting both natural and semi-natural areas. Furthermore, a noteworthy observation was made regarding forests in the northern part of the study area, which demonstrated stability and resilience to LD. The results of the study are important for the urban environment because they facilitate a better understanding of the impact of human activities on mitigating LD in the context of climate change, among other things. Moreover, the results identify specific areas in need of targeted monitoring and remedial actions regarding LD. Research Highlights Istanbul's urbanization has been consistent since 1984. Urban expansion primarily contributes to agricultural land degradation. Land degradation clusters near settlements and on the southern coast. State forests are crucial for preserving natural areas and resisting degradation.

Smart/intelligent construction technologies encompass a range of innovations, including building information modeling (BIM), the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and professional decision support based on artificial intelligence (AI). This article explores the current state of these technologies in the construction sector and anticipates future developments and their implications worldwide.\nA new industry paradigm referred to as “Construction 5.0” is emerging that aims at capitalizing on the achievements of Construction 4.0 in the pursuit of additional objectives, including environmental sustainability, human/societal welfare, and infrastructure resilience in the face of climate change and increasingly common natural disasters. A number of industry trade publications, such as Construction Dive [3] and Geo Week News [4], devote ample attention to the ever-growing number of computer-based tools, sensor systems solutions,

However, how changes in traits affect ecosystem processes remains poorly understood. Variation in trait values among species in a community may drive ecosystem processes. Alternatively, the mass ratio hypothesis proposes that trait values of the dominant species in a local community are related to ecosystem processes. Using data from 159 farms in six European countries, we quantified the impact of local and landscape‐level land‐use intensity on ground beetles as pest control agents. We then assessed the extent to which functional diversity and community‐weighted mean trait values relate to pest control and cereal yield. In addition, we assessed how the responses to land use and the effects of different species on pest control and yield varied with their traits to compare the relative impact of the traits studied. Functional diversity of ground beetles improved aphid removal, but did not translate into higher crop yields. Pest control of aphids was enhanced by a higher proportion of smaller, mobile ground beetles with a preference for the vegetation layer. Smaller, predatory ground beetles in communities improved crop yield. The magnitude of responses to land‐use intensification and the effects on pest control and yield were more strongly influenced by body size than other traits. Our study provides evidence that reduced management intensity can improve pest control by supporting small‐sized, macropterous ground beetles. In contrast to the claims of ecological intensification, our joint analysis of the direct effects of land use on yield and indirect effects via functional diversity of ground beetles and pest control suggests that ecosystem services by ground beetles cannot compensate for the yield gap due to a reduction in land‐use intensity.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664629","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"34","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eap.3035","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb6c","name":"Klaus","lastName":"Birkhofer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c50d2cb9-9c5f-42e1-b022-684aa953bd96"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb6b","name":"Werner","lastName":"Ulrich","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41bb9413-1365-4499-a7ca-f6864956a7df"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb6a","name":"Dara A.","lastName":"Stanley","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6909b978-55a9-4fcc-8049-527116b5dfbf"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb69","name":"Adrien","lastName":"Rusch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13acfd5f-c732-4aa6-a457-420d50d1617d"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb68","name":"Emmanuelle","lastName":"Kesse‐Guyot","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d33cc60-cb9e-4787-8273-c928eb89405d"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb67","name":"Róbert","lastName":"Gallé","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84902b58-29eb-4e24-ad36-d87831b02fed"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb66","name":"Tara","lastName":"Dirilgen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ccb193d-f536-46d2-8866-ccf8903470d4"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb65","name":"Enrique G.","lastName":"de la Riva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"445fd68f-4b1d-4a14-909e-496b6578ebe8"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb64","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Čerevková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"60c1972c-75ea-4be5-8dd2-b718df93070f"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb63","name":"Léa","lastName":"Beaumelle","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8a1f525-0f0a-4b62-abba-6b2f1d20cf92"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb62","name":"Julia","lastName":"Baudry","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b419de0d-e064-49b8-9b0f-bd5dba223654"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb61","name":"Péter","lastName":"Batáry","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"66629186-fcca-40b2-8a48-41dffd935108"},{"objectId":"68250864fdbe83139258fb60","name":"Roman","lastName":"Bucher","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b354b421-8be5-46e6-82cb-c8179d906409"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392296","name":"Maria","lastName":"Rembiałkowska","uuid":"2B5F2CCA53E2450E232705A4C04193E7829D4243C6A4326CE1E6945527C7C1B495FA287C2514F2C3C499D5031296D14863B1D2930506C4E058E1F12EA9C0E725","orcidId":"0000-0002-4109-5486","documentHash":"c5e14ba0-8d26-4de6-80bc-9a6b9d4b2b60"}],"doi":"10.1002/eap.3035"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["public safety","sustainable society","urban green spaces","placemaking","sustainable city"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"68250409fdbe83139258ec59","doi":"10.11118/978-80-7509-963-1","title":"Public recreation and landscape protection – with environment hand in hand?

Among the limitations to their use, the literature often mentions safety concerns - a security perception among users depending on the time of day, weather, lighting, and park maintenance, but also on the behavior of other park users. The case study of Central Park (NY, USA) based on the data collected by the New York Police Department shows that this huge park visited by hundreds of people each day is significantly safer than the surrounding precincts. In particular, it is interesting that in the park there are fewer cases of crime such as rape and felony assault, as well as grand larceny, which are the most common in green urban areas. The results prove that urban green areas can play an important role in increasing the safety related to recreational activities in the city, which should be taken into account in modern placemaking

In this study, we investigated the effect of the endophytic bacterium Pantoea vagans SRS89 strain on carrot germination and growth under saline conditions. The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions on agar gel and in pots with a soil mixture. First, we determined the NaCl doses that cause stress to carrot seeds. Among the tested NaCl concentrations (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mM), we selected 150 and 100 mM for further study. They were critical for germination and seedling growth, respectively. In the next step, carrot seeds were inoculated with the bacterium for 1 and 3 h and germinated under selected NaCl concentrations. In a soil mixture watered with a 150 mM NaCl inoculation, depending on the duration, increased germination by 30 % and 18 %, compared to the control. Under these conditions, the morphological parameters of the plants, as well as the content of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll b and carotenoids) and soluble sugars, were also significantly higher. The positive effect of the P. vagans SRS89 strain on carrot seed germination and seedling growth in laboratory conditions suggests the need for further studies to confirm this effect in field conditions, assuming the practical application of the tested strain."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664638","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6824ac1efdbe836c41bc13c8","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"180","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6bf3a621-7c8a-4092-a623-dfb48fbe3707"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"180","pagesFromTo":"415-427","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0254629925001577?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6824ac1efdbe836c41bc13ca","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Simlat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0d41e41b-fde0-4061-a3f8-ca63a3ca7805"},{"objectId":"6824ac1efdbe836c41bc13c9","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Matera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d5c7eae-4a0b-47af-bb67-cb83474c3524"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5c6c","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Warchoł","uuid":"96C50C213364C636F181AB8D51BAF7D54BC1844F8C0FE66B80B47E5B3D24280420727B45E1BF0E2DC6316BDF1E9053073F82A99FB17A766EFBCA0E94D412D94C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3606-4869","documentHash":"89ecd230-5148-4dc5-9fc4-5f70e200b5b4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.sajb.2025.03.033"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hygroscopic properties","blanching","color","betalain content","rehydration ratio","structure"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923b878c28a0473921dc","682507c3fdbe83139258f7a2","5e709487878c28a0473bf096","5e7092bc878c28a04739bb46","5e70923b878c28a04739221b","682507c3fdbe83139258f7a3","682507c3fdbe83139258f7a4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Chosen Biochemical and Physical Properties of Beetroot Treated with Ultrasound and Dried with Infrared–Hot Air Method","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682507c3fdbe83139258f7a1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a04739221b","5e709487878c28a0473bf096","682507c3fdbe83139258f7a2","682507c3fdbe83139258f7a3","682507c3fdbe83139258f7a4","5e7092bc878c28a04739bb46","5e70923b878c28a0473921dc"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Beetroots are sources of bioactive compounds and valued pigments such as betalains. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of ultrasound pretreatment on the beetroot infrared–hot air drying process and the functional properties of the obtained product. In this study, there were two used frequencies—21 and 35 kHz—and three different periods of time—10, 20, and 30 min. Since beetroots are usually subjected to thermal treatment, another aim was to examine the influence of blanching and soaking on the beetroot tissue properties in order to compare traditional and ultrasound-treated methods. As a result of this study, it was found that ultrasound pretreatment changed the dry matter content, water activity, thickness of the tissue, total color difference, and contents of betanin pigments in the beetroot. It was revealed that the drying process is shorter after ultrasound pretreatment using a 21 kHz frequency. Drying tissue exposed to ultrasounds showed a significant increase in the L* parameter; however, the decrease in the a* parameter was caused by a reduced content of betalain pigments. Taking into consideration parameters important from a technological point of view, it was found that the best condition for beetroot pretreatment is 20 min treatment, regardless of the frequency used.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664640","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/8/3507","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682507c3fdbe83139258f7a4","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Matys","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eef3e249-94cf-4ce9-98b0-ebe888ea1903"},{"objectId":"682507c3fdbe83139258f7a3","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Karwacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49b45e24-57c5-40f4-8678-ff0916a4a8a5"},{"objectId":"682507c3fdbe83139258f7a2","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Trusińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0fd08f8-5259-475e-ae3e-2ff583a16f1c"},{"objectId":"5e709487878c28a0473bf096","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Rybak","uuid":"23CE32C58512E32A4B96EAE0AE9ECB2BF23310D66D220B65BFBB79CD39E7F53ECA83523B7822465B1A3A51369BA847D9FDD6BA28CDC2F09E8BE6E1DD13CE7440","orcidId":"0000-0003-3595-0818","documentHash":"4fdd131f-d106-4642-a4be-de7994ac4305"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bb46","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pobiega","uuid":"3231AADA75EB512A5688122B41E2DFE88D86F3DE4A6B997988CE034ED561C7394C06732EE1FF7FF623D42A2EC59E35C7B4371CBEB5D9A49A154386AA2758F0B2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3532-8666","documentHash":"f2873c2c-ae2f-4119-9627-3aa99c51372d"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a04739221b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Nowacka","uuid":"E85B587CB83FA262B33EC648A56233E393FCEE2E993B8374949D817101C99BFE915F89BFEA3B24894CF241C78C82241C2FCAD33FFB0DBE868B6365630E5D17A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4689-6909","documentHash":"4ecb9480-c3af-4d13-9055-38f9ae2905e5"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921dc","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Witrowa-Rajchert","uuid":"280E3A48FBDCD443419B808E81929077FDA5A14E56339600FF4B4352EFA5E4CBF460A0F9C12FA7AA717F25A4A358396EA7447AE40172F5930D37B19E5F038F1F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0937-3204","documentHash":"bac7465f-4ca1-4462-8f00-071ab8790a41"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14083507"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67e54eb1fdbe831b59a692db","doi":null,"title":"Trust

Despite various objections to the validity of such a predictor, citations are considered in grant acquisition, recruitment or even journal review processes. However, not only merits may contribute to the performance of scientific research. This work presents factors, mostly those related to the authors and manuscript composition, that influence the number of citations gained by scientific articles. The created database collected almost 30 variables and around 50 of their functions or interactions that describe papers published in physicochemical journals related to colloid and interface science. The coarse examination was carried out by comparison of the parameters with respect to the journals. Subsequently, the data was investigated using multivariate analysis-classical linear regression model. The method, usually applied in econometrics, determined significant and insignificant factors. Eventually, a log-linear model is presented, allowing the optimisation of the writing process of a manuscript to increase the utility of a physicochemical article."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664650","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67fd008ffdbe831f2f169898","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e6ecb368-a7fe-4baf-a93b-21fda54a756e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11192-025-05311-4.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c32f759543c72336544028","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Zbonikowski","uuid":"E25732A6ACDE02743F9F906A933A6757F4B737A0260153E72970A6BCFDE691EA1C24C5547CC2F14AD23D2700E5102EEAB2D53C059CB3E79BEE06CD6DB7DDF399","orcidId":"0000-0003-4302-7142","documentHash":"5fd44a6e-8e9a-49c8-b194-772af721e253"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11192-025-05311-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["integrated modelling framework","macroinvertebrates","eco-hydraulics","habitat suitability"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a047393119","682503f5fdbe83139258eba3","682503f5fdbe83139258eba4","5e709259878c28a0473941e7","682503f5fdbe83139258eba1","5e7092bc878c28a04739bb1d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Development of an integrated modelling framework to evaluate impacts of pressures on habitat conditions and riverine biota","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779ef","mniswId":"5313","title":"Ecohydrology","doi":null,"issn":"1936-0584","eissn":"1936-0592","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3618a8e2-dbce-4767-ab0f-7b851f66ebb3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682503f5fdbe83139258eba0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682503f5fdbe83139258eba1","682503f5fdbe83139258eba2","682503f5fdbe83139258eba3","5e7092bc878c28a04739bb1d","5e709259878c28a0473941e7","682503f5fdbe83139258eba4","5e709249878c28a047393119"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It is becoming extremely challenging to protect the structural and functional integrity of freshwater ecosystems, as many ecological systems face pressures from climate change, population growth and other environmental impacts. However, existing approaches of assessing impacts of external stressors to habitat conditions often neglect the long-term hydrological changes. This study aimed to develop an integrated modelling framework to assess impacts of different stressors on reach-scale habitat conditions for benthic macroinvertebrates in a temperate lowland river in central Poland. We coupled hydrological (SWAT+), hydraulic (HEC-RAS 1D and SRH-2D) and habitat (CASiMiR) models to predict the response of habitat suitability for the functional group of filter feeders to changes in the catchment for a 135-m section of the Jeziorka river. Setting up and calibrating individual models required extensive field data collection (e.g., bathymetry field surveys, gauging water levels, discharge and flow velocity measurements and biological sampling). The performance of individual models in simulating discharge, water levels and depth/flow velocity was assessed as satisfactory according to literature. The modelling chain was then applied to compare the effects of three flow scenarios (average, low and high flows). The results showed an overall high value of hydraulic habitat suitability index for filter feeders, with moderately and severely lower values for low and high flow scenario, respectively. The implemented modelling framework performed well could be applied to examine the impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic stressors on reach-scale habitat conditions. Its practical implementation could be beneficial towards sustainable water resources and environmental flow regime development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664651","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/eco.2585","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682503f5fdbe83139258eba4","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Oglęcki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9dfe06a-24a9-4a09-b395-d8b8045cd57f"},{"objectId":"682503f5fdbe83139258eba3","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dytkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88c8bb05-39b6-48e7-b2de-5d6fcbb61bae"},{"objectId":"682503f5fdbe83139258eba2","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Szałkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03c8b689-07d4-4434-90c5-01ef7dd7bf40"},{"objectId":"682503f5fdbe83139258eba1","name":"Somsubhra","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df596794-2608-4f10-af5e-84c86b01a43d"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bb1d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Marcinkowski","uuid":"12AFB029D222A32E02F345C525BCEB27BCE0D28FE090E81F16DC635B135024732AFFC71F8AA40A59EF811108D2C85A11750EAE28DCEF7EDB8210E8F03C2A9202","orcidId":"0000-0002-6000-9758","documentHash":"0f48beb6-356a-477b-9eff-065ec8561482"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941e7","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Mirosław-Świątek","uuid":"F7A3277DAA495B9B81B3B29096927B58CA3C7044646D1579FE3B70BB6023A137703FD70E33C38EA7D27A68234F130673C2BE5348735ED6F46FD980D398A7EEA4","orcidId":"0000-0003-3920-8215","documentHash":"a3c92471-7f48-48a3-b9d5-3048ca9a55ef"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a047393119","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Piniewski","uuid":"1325AADC37DE251FBAE2A7A6FDB327242E2082495558045E06FA8A68F79864A04A8420377722641C20294BC3B66773043A19E73F2928EC90680CF045F7827808","orcidId":"0000-0001-7930-4549","documentHash":"d0279ebd-d0d2-4411-9e17-dd526ba79acc"}],"doi":"10.1002/eco.2585"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["physical properties","CCS","plywood composite","nonwoven fabric","recycling","upcycling","reinforcement","mechanical properties"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a0473923f5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Utilization of Fibrous Mat Residues from Upholstered Furniture as Sustainable Fillers in Plywood Production","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682505b6fdbe83139258f466","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682505b6fdbe83139258f467","5e70923d878c28a0473923f5"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nonwoven upholstery fabric is a waste product which is mainly generated during upholstered furniture production. The polyester composition makes it problematic to recycle and reuse this product. This study examined the manufacturing process of nonwoven fabric-reinforced plywood composites and their selected mechanical and physical properties. Nonwoven fabric was integrated between veneers bound with urea–formaldehyde resin to improve standard layered composites’ mechanical and physical properties. Several board variants were produced, differing in the position of the nonwoven layers in the composite structure. The composites were evaluated for modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), internal bond, and screw withdrawal resistance, among others. The results showed that the addition of nonwoven fabric significantly improved some properties, like internal bond and screw withdrawal resistance. Variants with strategically placed nonwoven layers showed the highest performance increases. The results underscore the potential of\nnonwoven fabric as an effective reinforcing material, offering a path to developing high-performance plywood composites suitable for demanding applications. Another environmental advantage is that the nonwoven fabric waste used in the tested plywood production has not been subjected to burning or landfilling but, through its incorporation into plywood structure, has positively contributed to the\nCarbon Capture and Storage (CCS) policy. The findings advocate for a circular economy approach, in which industrial waste is effectively repurposed, contributing to the development of green materials in the wood-based composite industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664653","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/16/4080","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682505b6fdbe83139258f467","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bartoszuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2eb9803-0282-4c2f-89bb-b4dab6bf5aaf"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923f5","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kowaluk","uuid":"68FBD120BB38A98CBB3EEA3BD6ED9F0498687633ADB279D51D69CAD676E465F0F6ED590B66AD118E477534CC7E2DEE92CB80B1E7A1B838ECEB1636F9AAA2E01E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1463-0540","documentHash":"99b518a0-3f6f-4b31-8930-dee3b8571abf"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17164080"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-967259-1-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a047392262","682507a5fdbe83139258f722"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Przewodnik metodyczny Junior-Edu-Żywienie.

Thus, focusing on the ZWC cluster in Shandong Province, China, this study calculates the pollution reduction and carbon reduction synergies for each city from 2013 to 2022. It also explores the structural characteristics and influencing factors of the spatial network of pollution reduction and carbon reduction synergies within the ZWC cluster. Results show the following: (1) During the research period, the synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction is strengthened due to improvements in pure technical efficiency, a reduction in disparities between cities, and the gradual optimization of spatial patterns. (2) Jinan, Qingdao, and Weihai occupy dominant core positions within the collaborative network. The relationship between the provincial capital and the Jiaodong Economic Circle is well-balanced, while the Lunan Economic Circle exhibits a strong outward orientation, although with limited reciprocal feedback. (3) Geographic proximity, public attention, and differences in information technology foster the formation of the spatial relationship network, while government support disparities demonstrate the opposite effect. Economic disparities have a relatively considerable impact on relational promotion, whereas the influence of industrial structure is comparatively negligible.

The integrity of the DNA molecule is crucial for the proper functioning and survival of cells, as DNA damage can lead to mutations, genomic instability, and various diseases, including cancer. The DDR safeguards the genome by coordinating a series of signaling events and repair mechanisms to maintain genomic stability and prevent the propagation of damaged DNA to daughter cells. The study of an ion channels in the context of DDR is a promising avenue in biomedical research. Lately, it has been reported that the movement of ions through channels plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including nerve signaling, muscle contraction, cell signaling, and maintaining cell membrane potential. Knowledge regarding the involvement of ion channels in the DDR could support refinement of our approach to several pathologies, mainly cancer, and perhaps lead to innovative therapies. In this review, we focused on the ion channel's possible role in the DDR. We present an analysis of the involvement of ion channels in DDR, their role in DNA repair mechanisms, and cellular outcomes. By addressing these areas, we aim to provide a comprehensive perspective on ion channels in the DDR and potentially guide future research in this field. It is worth noting that the interplay between ion channels and the cellular DDR is complex and multifaceted. More research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutic implications of these interactions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664668","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"793","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383574224000012?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250489fdbe83139258ede1","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Maliszewska-Olejniczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9272f042-bfed-4c52-a11f-5ae4019b091b"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923f7","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bednarczyk","uuid":"DEA63C7A36560E90D26A9AF2FEEA0575B15670257A3799125E863B24C76ECA4CABB6A839B4A5285F65CA489A6891EA46CB446FB5DB7781AE09D7FD2A9FC67265","orcidId":"0000-0002-7125-0715","documentHash":"73be6e88-c498-4fe6-bb28-9430e3ca97a3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.mrrev.2024.108488"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f2878c28a04739fc62"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zero Trust w administracji","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"68233471fdbe834501616104","mniswId":null,"title":"Radca Prawny w Administracji : praktyka, opinie i orzecznictwo","doi":null,"issn":"2719-616X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"https://rpwa.pl/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"c1dc94b7-d7b5-4340-8c86-9b44f326e96a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68245fa1fdbe836c41b5679b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f2878c28a04739fc62","68245fa1fdbe836c41b5679c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261664670","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68233484fdbe83450161613f","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"ba885373-07d1-44cc-ad47-236463a2cffa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"64-65","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://opus.us.edu.pl/info/article/USL10c3b0666bde4f0d8f4337895ebe9cf6/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68245fa1fdbe836c41b5679c","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Jakubik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eceabea6-a6a1-4208-b875-8fbe5d387f24"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fc62","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Prabucki","uuid":"8AC31B7CDD354C806A1F084753AA408551C2B3764457D4A460BD05A8CE206FB3604E151A834A0EC1E43FC6894F3CF9EC7D24BD3B25F229F8BE68E8FBA5A88E42","orcidId":"0000-0003-2397-1283","documentHash":"0419a995-474f-4567-8e8d-b281df07a61d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["wskaźniki efektywności","metale ziem rzadkich","pośrednie inwestycje w towary"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["indirect commodity investments","risk‑adjusted performance measure","rare earth metals"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709259878c28a047394190","5e70923b878c28a0473921a6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of Efficiency of Investment in Companies Belonging to the Rare Earth Metals Sector","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a23a","mniswId":"200416","title":"Optimum.

Metoda badawcza – W badaniu wykorzystano następujące miary efektywności inwestycji: zmodyfikowany wskaźnik Sharpe’a oraz wskaźniki Omega, Sortino, Calmara, Sterlinga i Burke’a. Badanie oparte było na dziennych notowaniach wybranych spółek, których działalność związana była z wydobyciem, przetwarzaniem i recyklingiem metali ziem rzadkich oraz na notowaniach, reprezentującego światowy rynek, indeksu MVIS® Global Rare Earth/Strategic Metals Index w okresie: od lipca 2018 r. do czerwca 2023 r. Wyniki – Biorąc pod uwagę cały analizowany okres, otrzymano gorsze wyniki z inwestycji w akcje spółek sektora metali ziem rzadkich niż z inwestycji w aktywa wolne od ryzyka. Tylko akcje AREC uzyskały lepsze wyniki w porównaniu z pozostałymi spółkami w przypadku 3 z 6 wskaźników. W celu zbadania stabilności wyników, cały analizowany okres podzielono na 5 podokresów i dla każdego z nich wyznaczono wszystkie wskaźniki efektywności. Duże zróżnicowanie wyników nie pozwoliło na zidentyfikowanie jednoznacznych stabilnych wzorców. Gdy jako punkt odniesienia przyjęto wyniki za cały okres badania, to tylko dla indeksu MVREMX otrzymano stabilne i atrakcyjne wartości zmodyfikowanego współczynnika Sharpe’a, które w 4 z 5 podokresów były lepsze niż wartość dla okresu pięcioletniego.\nOryginalność / wartość / implikacje / rekomendacje – Niniejsze badanie oferuje nowy wgląd w sektor pierwiastków ziem rzadkich w kontekście jego rosnącego znaczenia międzynarodowego i efektywności inwestycji w notowane na giełdzie spółki tego sektora. W badaniu wykorzystano dwuwymiarowe wskaźniki, których zaletą jest jednoczesne uwzględnienie kategorii zysku i ryzyka. Uzyskane wnioski wskazują, że aby przyciągnąć zainteresowanie inwestorów konieczna jest poprawa wyników spółek. "},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose – This paper aimed at assessing the efficiency of investment in companies belonging to the rare earth elements sector and examining the stability of the results. Research method – The following performance measures were used in the study: modified Sharpe and Omega, Sortino, Calmar, Sterling and Burke ratios. The investigation is based on daily quotations of selected companies whose business activities were related to extraction, processing and recycling of rare earth metals in the period: from July 2018 to June 2023 and MVIS® Global Rare Earth/Strategic Metals Index representing the global market. Results – The analysis for the entire period revealed a worse performance of investments in rare earth stocks than investment in risk‑free assets. Only AREC outperformed other securities offering the best results for 3 of 6 ratios. To examine the stability of the results, the total investigation period was divided into 5 subperiods and all performance ratios were determined for each of them. A strong variation of results did not allow to recognise stable patterns. When the results for the entire investigation period were used as a benchmark, only MVREMX offered stable and attractive results of modified Sharpe ratio outperforming the five‑year value in 4 out of 5 subperiods. Originality / value / implications / recommendations – This study provides a new insight into the rare earths sector regarding its growing international importance and the efficiency of investments into listed rare earth firms. The examination uses two‑dimensional measures offering the advantage of simultaneously combining return and risk into a single performance number. The findings imply the necessity of improving the stock price performance to attract investors’ interest."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664672","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"134-153","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://repozytorium.uwb.edu.pl/jspui/handle/11320/16391","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a047394190","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krawiec","uuid":"C693036F0E461CE47062995591593E977F3B04666255F2012B9B139DB0666F26A51504524872534D9D520010B3CB846BE906FC87FDFD57A1C924B61D242E50F2","orcidId":"0000-0002-4765-244X","documentHash":"c3780c52-4372-4dc9-8acc-fe5e32347143"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921a6","name":"Anna","lastName":"Górska","uuid":"0309951F8DEED890BCC878518288C438A4180F04BDEE2E591AAC6DE6D30BC4AA5F09D968B1F7C093BE0CA7E01CF6B3FD3B5E371CCA94D729EEAB911BB88FF794","orcidId":"0000-0003-0763-0550","documentHash":"192f9208-d6b8-42ab-a787-f0e38d46cf50"}],"doi":"10.15290/oes.2024.01.115.07"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A new avenue in the search for CP violation: Mössbauer spectroscopy of $$^{227}$$Ac","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ebffe12ad49b31ccece870b","mniswId":null,"title":"The European Physical Journal.

the genesis of the problem of the crisis of professional identity of a teacher in the context of the formation of a new information and communication educational paradigm in the second half of the twentieth century - early twenty-first century. The analysis of the scientific and pedagogical literature of the second half of the twentieth century - the beginning of the twenty-first century demonstrates that the transition to a new paradigm of education was marked by the emergence of a crisis of professional identity, which is also emphasised by the ambiguity of definitions of the concept of professional identity. In the modern scientific and pedagogical discourse, a teacher is seen as a person with numerous roles. The scientific, theoretical and philosophical foundations for considering research activities and publication activity as key indicators of the level of professional identity of a teacher are identified and substantiated. An empirical study of the opinions of practicing teachers in Poland, Slovakia, Ukraine and Sweden on research and publication activity is carried out. The results of the international empirical research state the presence and reveal specific manifestations of the professional identity

Various seed priming techniques are experimented to mitigate the adverse effect of drought stress on plant performance. It is a low-cost and sustainable technology that proved to be of immense potential to enhance drought tolerance and increase crop productivity. Drought episodes are followed by recovery through rain or irrigation and help the plants to recuperate from the damages caused by drought stress. The severity of drought-associated damages determines the recovery kinetics of plants. Under the recurrent cycle of drought events, recovery kinetics has immense importance in predicting the stress tolerance potential and survival status of a plant. Many processes like DNA damage repair, de-novo synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins, osmotic adjustment through the accumulation of osmolytes, the potential activity of antioxidant machinery occurring during seed priming play a significant role during recovery from drought stress. Alleviation of the severity of drought stress through the accumulation of osmolytes, the augmented activity of antioxidant machinery, improved photosynthetic performance, and the upregulated expression of stress-responsive genes attributed by seed priming will complement the recovery from drought stress. Although the beneficial effects of seed priming on drought tolerance are well explored, priming influenced recovery mechanism has not been well explored. There is a lacuna in the field of research related to the beneficial effects of seed priming for recovery from drought stress, and that is the focus of this paper."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664684","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"97","pagesFromTo":"235-253","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10725-021-00755-z","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504b8fdbe83139258ef99","name":"Jos T","lastName":"Puthur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55b2452d-e051-4c75-abef-39fcf0c80544"},{"objectId":"682504b8fdbe83139258ef98","name":"KP Raj","lastName":"Aswathi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a588e49-3135-4fa7-b3fb-217217d4b152"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10725-021-00755-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["vegetable drinks","physicochemical properties","nutritional value","rice"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["68250842fdbe83139258fa52","5e70923b878c28a047392231","68250842fdbe83139258fa54","68250842fdbe83139258fa56"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Physicochemical Properties and Nutritional Relevance of Rice Beverages Available on the Market","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68250842fdbe83139258fa51","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68250842fdbe83139258fa52","68250842fdbe83139258fa53","68250842fdbe83139258fa54","5e70923b878c28a047392231","68250842fdbe83139258fa55","68250842fdbe83139258fa56","68250842fdbe83139258fa57"]},"issue":"19","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Recently, more consumers have reached for plant-based milk substitutes, mainly for health, dietary, and flavour reasons. This study aimed to evaluate the physicochemical and bioactive properties and sensory profile of 10 selected rice drinks available on the EU market. Assessment of the physicochemical characteristics included measurement of soluble solids, pH, osmolality, foaming properties and colour parameters. Analysis of bioactive compounds involved the determination of polyphenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. Based on the manufacturer’s data, the composition and nutritional value of the above-mentioned beverages were also analysed in this study. The tested beverages were characterised by a low fat content of 0.6–1.3 g/100 mL, derived mainly from added sunflower oil, but are a good source of energy (energy value of 37–55 kcal/100 mL), derived mainly from naturally occurring carbohydrates whose content ranged from 8.0–11.0 g/100 mL. The protein content of all rice drinks was shallow, not exceeding 0.5 g/100 mL. Of the ten rice drinks analysed, in only two were vitamins B12 and D added (0.38 μg/100 mL and 0.75 μg/100 mL, respectively) and in only three was calcium (120 mg/100 mL) added. In evaluating the physicochemical characteristics, the drinks showed a pH close to neutral (mean 6.85 ± 0.01). The average soluble solids content was about 11%, which was determined by the carbohydrate content. The osmolality of the beverages averaged 324.73 ± 70.17 mOsm/kg H2O, with four beverages classifiable as hypertonic ones (osmolality &gt; 330 mOsm/kg H2O), three as isotonic ones (with osmolality between 270–330 mOsm/kg H2O), and three as hypotonic beverages (osmolality &lt; 270 mOsm/kg H2O). Only two rice drinks evaluated in this study showed foaming properties. The high whiteness index (81.79 ± 2.55) indicated high white colour saturation of the tested beverages. The rice drinks were characterised by a relatively diverse sensory quality regarding aroma and flavour notes. The overall sensory quality was rated highest for the beverages with the highest sugar content. The tested beverages were characterised by a low content of total polyphenols (average 1.40 ± 0.62 mg GAE/100 mL) and relatively high antioxidant activity (average 418.33 ± 59.65 µM TEAC/100 mL). Based on the research conducted and the analysis of the manufacturer’s data, it can be concluded that the rice drinks studied in this paper can be included in the daily diet, providing a rehydrating beverage that shows free radical-neutralizing properties and provides carbohydrates. At the same time, it should be highlighted that the studied drinks have a low nutritional value and cannot be recommended as milk substitutes due to low protein levels and lack of milk-specific vitamins and minerals.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664686","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/app14199150","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250842fdbe83139258fa57","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Buczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98caa206-fb2f-455e-8615-5e740b0d904f"},{"objectId":"68250842fdbe83139258fa56","name":"Franciszek","lastName":"Świderski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"644c7c13-0d8d-4e05-abc9-566b52815abd"},{"objectId":"68250842fdbe83139258fa55","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Wasiak-Zys","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d4ee3465-bc44-4ee6-85e1-f09ee30a7725"},{"objectId":"68250842fdbe83139258fa54","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sadowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"865dfc63-dbd9-4f27-83f3-1565764c6902"},{"objectId":"68250842fdbe83139258fa53","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Ponikowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"66a8ec12-3141-477c-be77-1dd6856d7130"},{"objectId":"68250842fdbe83139258fa52","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Najman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3241ff2d-d537-4c94-829a-6fe0837f18a8"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392231","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Hallmann","uuid":"F60056F177FB859A55C46C4CA731C8A63A3ECC469A1164EC09ECA3A756B3FC369E6D3BDA6FB975083AD371D36C16F9C4531BB67EA181FC5D8A2DD5DC8435A248","orcidId":"0000-0002-4855-7057","documentHash":"c139fe5f-6789-45c8-b993-5a7a12a42eb8"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14199150"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","information technology","customer relationship management"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923a878c28a047392171"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The impact of customer relationship management on the sustainable development of enterprise","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e7135ce46e0fb0001c49649","mniswId":null,"title":"Issues in Information Systems","doi":null,"issn":"1529-7314","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"23ff3c18-003a-425b-a315-f550df01f4a8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-02-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6825063afdbe83139258f542","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923a878c28a047392171"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the most important dimensions influencing the behavior of an organization towards its external\nenvironment is customer relationship management (CRM).

The article presents basic concepts such as stress and stress in the workplace, as well as characterizes various factors causing this phenomenon. It also presents ways of identifying the phenomenon of stress and possible ways of dealing with stress in the workplace. The article also refers to the impact of stress on the employee's motivation to work. The concept of \"motivation\" was introduced and its types were listed. The second part of the article presents the results of empirical research on the impact of stress on the level of employee motivation and involvement in performed tasks, as well as the role of the motivation system in minimizing the phenomenon of stress in the workplace. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study used the method of analyzing the literature on the subject, as well as analyzing source data. The research sample was selected by defining the population that allowed for obtaining results enabling reference to the research problem. The sample selection method used was non-random. The sample included people of different ages, different income levels, different job profiles and different places of employment. The study was conducted using an online questionnaire. Neutral people were selected for the study. The selection of experts in the researched field would negatively affect the credibility of the obtained results. Findings: Modern times are a period in which there has been a very rapid increase in the pace of life, as well as dynamic professional and personal development of many people. Unfortunately, the demands of modern life often exceed both the physical and mental capabilities of a given individual, and then the phenomenon of doubt in one's own potential appears. Through this approach, a person begins to wonder whether he or she is able to meet the ever-growing market demands. This type of negative thinking begins to cause stress, which negatively affects the quality of life, the level of social relationships, as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of work. Stress has become one of the most common problems in today's society and affects not only adults, but also adolescents and even children. Even though stress accompanies virtually every sphere of life, and a certain level of it is a natural and inherent element of the functioning of every individual, its excess can lead to many negative consequences for both mental and physical health. One of the important elements of minimizing both the causes and effects of stress in the workplace is a properly developed motivation system, which undoubtedly influences the employee's success and mental balance both in his private and professional life. Currently, the job market is very competitive. Not only because of competition between companies from a specific industry, but also because of competition among people applying for a given job position. Therefore, effective motivation plays a key role in achieving professional success, but also affects the level of commitment and efficiency of employees and the quality and effectiveness of their duties as well as the level of stress reduction in the workplace. Practical Implications: The article contains information and guidelines for workplace owners related to the common phenomenon of stress in the workplace. It shows the basic types and sources of stress and shows the possible long-term effects of this phenomenon. It also draws attention to the shortcomings of the motivation system existing in many workplaces, which contributes little to minimizing both stress and its effects. Originality/Value: The study contains important conclusions regarding variables influencing the minimization of stress as well as improvements in the employee motivation system at work."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664689","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"XVII","pagesFromTo":"652-676","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3458/download","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682502b1fdbe83139258e997","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pietrzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"adb08a6c-fd72-4530-b2a0-12192851314d"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a04739215c","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Grębowiec","uuid":"401C536132604F7FE04A8068569BEF6908531CD0F187B280E906495A1651867DFEBC144E3D3D8755B4264C9CE82ABF4D7F0E71B95E68781BEE471D096596DBBE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2631-3940","documentHash":"a1fa1072-e515-45a0-b47e-90d4b5995cab"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3458"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709259878c28a0473941bf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"GO nanoparticles mitigate the negative effects of salt and alkalinity stress by enhancing gas exchange and photosynthetic efficiency of strawberry plants","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682504a2fdbe83139258eede","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682504a2fdbe83139258eedf","682504a2fdbe83139258eee0","5e709259878c28a0473941bf"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Considering the potential use of nanomaterials, particularly carbon-based nanostructures, in agriculture, we conducted a study to investigate the effect of graphene oxide (GO) on strawberry plants under salinity and alkalinity stress conditions. We used GO concentrations of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 50 mg/L, and applied stress treatments at three levels: without stress, salinity (80 mM NaCl), and alkalinity (40 mM NaHCO3). Our results indicate that both salinity and alkalinity stress negatively impacted the gas exchange parameters of the strawberry plants. However, the application of GO significantly improved these parameters. Specifically, GO increased PI, Fv, Fm, and RE0/RC parameters, as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in the plants. Moreover, the use of GO significantly increased the early yield and dry weight of leaves and roots. Therefore, it can be concluded that the application of GO can enhance the photosynthetic performance of strawberry plants, and improve their resistance to stress

with a high content of biologically active compounds are essential in preventing many diseases. Therefore, the interest in searching for and testing new plant sources for bioactive constituents remains strong. Although many publications on individual species exist, their results are difficult to compare directly due to varying methods and conditions of analysis. Only a few studies have investigated many different species in a single analysis. Therefore, we examined and compared 21 different genotypes, using various measurement methods for total phenolic content (TPC) (Folin–Ciocalteu, FBBB), total antioxidant capacity (ABTS, FRAP, DPPH), and the HPLC technique for the total ascorbate concentration in freshly harvested fruits. One-way ANOVA, Principal Component Analysis, and Pearson Correlation were used to analyse and compare the results. The tested samples showed significant differences in TPC, ascorbate content, and antioxidant capacity. The correlation between the content of bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity depended on the analytical methods, with results obtained using the FRAP test being the most strongly correlated. Due to higher levels of polyphenols, ascorbate, and antioxidant potential, the most promising species for further evaluation appear to be Chaenomeles × californica, Actinidia kolomikta, Mespilus germanica, and ×Sorboaronia fallax."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664697","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/18/2926","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6825073bfdbe83139258f661","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gutfeld","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a8869ac-85ca-4185-9751-55179187e282"},{"objectId":"6825073bfdbe83139258f660","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Łaźny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9dba0539-d747-4f24-8bda-1a58cd67d89e"},{"objectId":"6825073bfdbe83139258f65f","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Łata","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"136b87bf-08f4-4bc5-a8be-df372808f173"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739236d","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Latocha","uuid":"3CE8525A491D602521587FFF2783E3178D1BAF30DA83D25003F8FE0E87CBABFCC1CA1A4E693145B87F6F514D091680D556D42A65B0CBCE7BDE5948F151402391","orcidId":"0000-0002-6282-7340","documentHash":"4019858e-c07b-49aa-8879-42634156380f"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods13182926"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Masurian Lakeland","pellets","owls","small mammals","north-eastern Poland"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a047392248"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mammals in the food of the tawny owl Strix aluco in Gorzekały in the Great Masurian Lakeland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac24ad204581b62ebbab","mniswId":"201409","title":"Fragmenta Faunistica","doi":null,"issn":"0015-9301","eissn":"2391-5846","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6fc9b21-b565-4a6d-aa24-58ec04d9f1bd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682504a7fdbe83139258ef15","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392248","682504a7fdbe83139258ef16"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study was carried out in Gorzekały, situated ca. 10 km east of Lake Śniardwy in the Masurian Lake District (NE Poland).

The objective of this study was to examine the impact of distinct drying techniques, including convective drying at 70 °C (70CD) and 90 °C (90CD) and freeze-drying (FD), on the drying kinetics, physical characteristics (water activity, color), chemical characteristics (chemical composition, amino acid profile, oil properties, total polyphenol content and antioxidant activity, mineral composition, FTIR), and presence of hazards (allergens, microorganisms) of blanched yellow mealworm larvae. The freeze-drying process results in greater lightness and reduced moisture content and water activity. The study demonstrated that the freeze-dried insects exhibited lower contents of protein and essential amino acids as compared to the convective-dried insects. The lowest content of total polyphenols was found in the freeze-dried yellow mealworm larvae; however, the highest antioxidant activity was determined for those insects. Although the oil isolated from the freeze-dried insects exhibited the lowest acid and peroxide values, it proved to have the lowest PUFA content and oxidative stability. All the samples met the microbiological criteria for dried insects. The results of the study demonstrate that a high temperature during the CD method does not result in the anticipated undesirable changes.

The influence of light intensity, quality, and photoperiod on photosynthetic pigments content and some biochemical and growth traits of cucumber seedlings grown under controlled conditions was investigated. An orthogonal design based on a combination of different light irradiances, ratio of LEDs and photoperiods was used. Treaments consisted of three light irradiance regimes (80, 100, and 150 µmol m−2 s−1) provided by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of different ratios of red and blue (R:B) (30:70, 50:50, and 70:30) and three different photoperiods (10/14, 12/12, and 14/10 h). The white light was used as a control/reference. Plant height, hypocotyl length, stem diameter, leaf area, and soluble sugar content were highest when exposed to LM9 (150 µmol m−2 s−1; R70:B30; 12/12 h) light mode, while the lowest values for the above parameters were obtained under LM1 (80 µmol m−2 s−1; R30:B70; 10/14 h). Higher pigments contents (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid) were obtained when light regime LM9 (150 µmol m−2 s−1; R70:B30; 12/12 h) was applied. In general, cucumber seedlings grown under the LM9 regime showed a significant increase in growth as well as photosynthetic capacity. It seems that the content of photosynthetic pigments is the key factor responsible for the performance of cucumber seedlings grown under different lighting modes, compared to other traits studied. We recommend monitoring the content of chlorophyll a, b, and their ratio value when studying the light requirement of cucumber plants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664716","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-04859-y","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250513fdbe83139258f2f9","name":"Ahmed

This research is intended to provide a better understanding of hemp product potential as a new material that can be used in the production of pellets and briquettes for biofuel purpose. Nevertheless, the anisotropic raw material interferes with the compaction process and may expose a poor durability of the pellets and briquettes. The research that was conducted evaluated the conditions of the biofuels by measuring the physical and chemical parameters. The ash content, compressive strength, and durability of the samples were examined.

Elemental sulphur (S0) is highly beneficial as a source of S in agriculture, but it must be oxidized to a plant-accessible form. Micro- or nano-formulated S0 may undergo accelerated transformation, as the oxidation rate of S0 indirectly depends on particle size. Graphene oxide (GO) is a 2D-carbon-based nanomaterial with benefits as soil amendment, which could modulate the processes of S0 oxidation. Micro-and nano-sized composites, comprised of S0 and GO, were tested as soil amendments in a pot experiment with unplanted soil to assess their effects on soil microbial biomass, activity, and transformation to sulphates. Fourteen different variants were tested, based on solely added GO, solely added micro- or nano-sized S0 (each in three different doses) and on a combination of all S0 doses with GO.\nResults\nCompared to unamended soil, nano-S0 and nano-S0+GO increased soil pH(CaCl2). Micro-S0 (at a dose 4 g kg−1) increased soil pH(CaCl2), whereas micro-S0+GO (at a dose 4 g kg−1) decreased soil pH(CaCl2). The total bacterial and ammonium oxidizer microbial abundance decreased due to micro-S0 and nano-S0 amendment, with an indirect dependence on the amended dose. This trend was alleviated by the co-application of GO. Urease activity showed a distinct response to micro-S0+GO (decreased value) and nano-S0+GO amendment (increased value). Arylsulfatase was enhanced by micro-S0+GO, while sulphur reducing bacteria (dsr) increased proliferation due to high micro-S0 and nano-S0, and co-amendment of both with GO. In comparison to nano-S0, the amendment of micro-S0+GO more increased soluble sulphur content more significantly.\nConclusions\nUnder the conditions of this soil experiment, graphene oxide exhibited a significant effect on the process of sulphur oxidation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664728","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024144702","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed2c","name":"Martin","lastName":"Brtnicky","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1612e58-eeac-4de8-a249-ebac59f2c575"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed2b","name":"Ondrej","lastName":"Malicek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a534698e-9e41-49bb-af2a-fd75cc18860f"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed2a","name":"Radmila","lastName":"Valova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7531502e-9d73-4035-9792-35942daa406d"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed29","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Jaskulska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fe9e7ae-95d8-41f2-b82e-8aa2892f0159"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed28","name":"Jiri","lastName":"Kucerik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"69e61b6d-f0d2-43b4-8773-c1aadddfeab9"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed27","name":"Jana","lastName":"Pekarkova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e730112b-6025-461a-a36d-99b9a0fd557c"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed26","name":"Antonin","lastName":"Kintl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c873fa23-00fb-4226-b747-30dbd6dcf0ea"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed25","name":"Lukas","lastName":"Richtera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af3bb358-1639-4ae7-ab0e-b6af5aa74a52"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed24","name":"Petr","lastName":"Skarpa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"09e3d899-ef73-4db4-aa59-88f73e686f91"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed23","name":"Zuzana","lastName":"Bytesnikova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4a0c61c-7b76-42b3-855f-4538b08f93ed"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed22","name":"Jiri","lastName":"Holatko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f6f9060b-d2f4-4271-b18f-5386b2925f29"},{"objectId":"68250421fdbe83139258ed21","name":"Tereza","lastName":"Hammerschmiedt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5f063ff-76df-41ac-b917-8ead41ecb71b"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a53fe","name":"Maja","lastName":"Radziemska","uuid":"F16909B2F0C594C5EA5AB2C145BE90CFEEA14A48CA90D9D4824051912FC2B3FC4FC9E7D2A3266C8A1BD64306A603FDBCAFD3EA7B0AD12A270B5018F1BD77B2DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3526-5944","documentHash":"c1e899af-a37d-4ddc-8151-8234dcce63ce"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e38439"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfabb","5e709352878c28a0473a7253","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Lung Cancer Detection and Type Determination From Plasma and Lung Tissues by Surface‐Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a1e","mniswId":"12483","title":"Journal of Raman Spectroscopy","doi":"","issn":"0377-0486","eissn":"1097-4555","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1097-4555","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"282630f5-685d-4caf-b781-51484fcfe7bc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68248621fdbe836c41b8e741","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709352878c28a0473a7253","68248621fdbe836c41b8e743","68248621fdbe836c41b8e744","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54","5e709491878c28a0473bfabb"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique combined with chemometry can be a potential tool for early discrimination of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from plasma and, as well as from the lung tissue samples. Based on the acquired spectra and the applied algorithm, it is possible to distinguish between the two types of SCLC and NSCLC associated with smoking and also to differentiate between subtypes of NSCLC in a very fast mode in comparison to standard histopathology. The applied chemometry in the form of the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) method allows, for the first time, to discriminate against tumor samples and determine between SCLC, NSCLC, and NSCLC types. The presented data clearly indicate that plasma samples are enough to discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC samples and NSCLC subtypes efficiently, which significantly facilitates the cancer diagnosis in terms of time and costs of analysis. Moreover, the fast and proper identification of LCC samples, especially in the case of a very aggressive SCLC-like type of cancer, has a substantial impact on the patient's treatments and thus may significantly impact the patient's life."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664730","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68248621fdbe836c41b8e742","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"619f4d1f-4da8-4c27-a07c-fe58b2dd7fbb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jrs.6816","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68248621fdbe836c41b8e744","name":"Juliusz","lastName":"Pankowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5ac4fc5-dded-478a-b634-598afa2e881b"},{"objectId":"68248621fdbe836c41b8e743","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Chmielewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c820bdc-f9b8-4ff5-b47b-0bcf4f435426"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfabb","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"A43E02DD56D97130FB557B1170B3ECC60D6B846F14E17ECAF295B91DD22E0E78EB30FDCEA47C95AA87D5C0B1F534A8439F0A639134D2305C36B7DDB342E7A131","orcidId":"0000-0002-1904-9459","documentHash":"42719eb5-a19e-4150-a61d-d9d457ec8b41"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Michota-Kamińska","uuid":"4EB7079300C2AFB8708927EEDB21FBD81AEF2FD51FC263E240C99C7038D1005DEC8459DA840507FBA6DE74655F99385CF34A6DC7B3F7B83FA17E470DC416A800","orcidId":"0000-0002-1713-4182","documentHash":"c1786c7a-c1fc-4ac2-aa4a-053360f9fd89"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a7253","name":"Marta","lastName":"Czaplicka","uuid":"D48FF5359202157732E88B5216C25CBCCCF560C1859E8234114A32ABBABF8060CF8C3C43057C906298BA6D24A2927C0D77AC6E9685D7F142074B16A3CB258A6C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3325-1896","documentHash":"5c94814a-f5e5-4144-8e73-839d2172683b"}],"doi":"10.1002/jrs.6816"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzI2MTY2NDczMA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
