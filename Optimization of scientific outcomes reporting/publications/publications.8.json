The purpose of the study was to investigate the role of several miRNAs as a markers of kidney damage. Assessment of 45 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients stage 1–4 and 17 healthy control. Sample of urine and blood was taken from each participant for molecular analysis using Real Time PCR method to identify such micro-RNAs as: hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-214-3p, hsa-miR-200a-5p, hsa-miR-29a-5p, hsa-miR-21-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, and hsa-miR-196a-5p. Basic biochemical test was done. Analysis was performed in CKD patients group and subgroup with chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) confirmed by kidney biopsy. Moreover, analysis was performed in subgroup with different estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (according to CKD–EPI equation: eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min, eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min) and different daily protein excretion (DPE): (DPE &lt; 3.5 g; DPE &gt; 3.5 g). Increased relative expression of hsa-miR-29-5p, hsa-miR-21-5p, and hsa-miR-196a-5p and decreased expression of hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-214-5p, hsa-miR-200a-5p, and hsa-miR-93-5p was demonstrated in urine of analyzed CKD patients. In subpopulation of chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN) patients, there was higher level of expression in urine of hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR 214-3p, hsa-miR-93-5p, and hsa-miR-196a-5p in CGN with DPE &lt; 3.5 g. CGN patients with eGFR &lt; 60 ml/min showed higher expression level of miRNAs such as hsa-miR-214-3p, hsa-miR-29-5p, hsa-miR-93-5p, and hsa-miR-196-5p in urine. There was increase in hsa-miR 155-5p, hsa-miR-214-3p, and hsa-miR-200a-5p serum expression level in CKD population and reduction of hsa-miR-29a-5p, hsa-miR-21-5p, and hsa-miR-93-5p expression. Increased level of expression of hsa-miR-155-5p; hsa-miR-214-3p, hsa-miR-200a-5p, and hsa-miR-29-5p was found in CGN patients with eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min. Increased relative expression of profibrogenic miRNAs in urine or serum of CKD patients with eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min and DPE &lt; 3.5 g may indicate higher degree of fibrosis at early CKD

aim of this chapter is to show the influence that the model of an organization has on its degree of innovation. It argues that the lack of hierarchy in the management model has a positive influence on the implementation of innovation and that the development of teal attributes by an organization is a prerequisite for achieving innovation capability. The case study presented in this chapter is that of a Silesian printing house – Drukarnia Skill Sp. z o.o. To expand on the problem, this chapter refers to the results of the research project “Teal Organizations in the Age of Economy 4.0” whose subject is the influence of the features characteristics of teal organizations on the degree of implementation of innovations in the field of digital technologies. Before the research problem was tackled, the available knowledge about it was marginal. In the literature on the subject (especially in the Polish publications), this issue has not been widely discussed thus far.

This enables solving the individual systems for each horizontal block on a separate computing node, followed by solving the composition system. The size of minimal clans, obtained as a result of matrix decomposition, varies considerably. For load balancing, early versions of ParAd software were using dynamic scheduling of jobs. The present paper studies a task of static balancing the clan size. Rather good results are obtained using a fast bin packing algorithm with the first fit on a sorted array which are considerably improved applying a multi-objective graph partitioning with software package METIS. Aggregation of clans allows us to obtain up to three times extra speed-up, including systems over fields of real numbers, on matrices from Model Checking Contest and Matrix Market."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057020773","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62270df62467f06c17645210","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"37","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"2c0354be-5e5a-41fc-9cfc-6f76b13ba2ae"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"198-219","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17445760.2021.2004412","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61a47c4e2467f00d7d88b305","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Luszczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0089-6965","documentHash":"a4d364fd-f48f-466a-a707-ac55bc21617f"},{"objectId":"61a47c4e2467f00d7d88b304","name":"Tatiana R.","lastName":"Shmeleva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4799-3842","documentHash":"36b1d859-4695-45e3-ad69-dc8d79491da3"},{"objectId":"6160fea975234017e050df36","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Zaitsev","uuid":"BA62D3A29E4943F9355A9AD76D6B2620B738556278860232559ECE04BF1195D3D73CEA66F6CF55054908F039C4B21B053198B29CC34F329D4539698D6D71EF24","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"567ff72b-a4f3-4bde-aab2-61d9c7aa3a05"}],"doi":"10.1080/17445760.2021.2004412"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["interpersonal relationships","close relationships","positive  emotions","capitalization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","parentUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","rootUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

These benefits often depend on whether a partner responds with enthusiasm; however,  it is unknown what prompts enthusiastic responses. In two experiments, we aimed to examine  whether partners reciprocate enthusiastic responses to capitalization attempts. In Study 1, parti \ncipants (N = 394) who recalled their partner’s past enthusiastic feedback to capitalization attempts  endorsed stronger intentions to respond enthusiastically to their partner’s capitalization attempts  (relative to a comparison group recalling their partner’s prior demeaning feedback). In Study 2  (N = 326), we found that enthusiastic responses to capitalization attempts were reciprocated  among romantic couples but reciprocation was not mediated by subjective emotion, emotional  expressiveness, nor physiological responses. In conclusion, our findings support reciprocity in  capitalization, i.e. romantic partners are more motivated and more likely to respond enthusiasti cally to capitalization attempts depending on their partner’s previous behavior."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057026552","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"561-572","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2021.1885054","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61a4a6fb2467f0352ac88199","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Guzik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e358fee-28cf-4820-a0ba-95758cc9b478"},{"objectId":"61a4a6fb2467f0352ac88198","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kosakowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e752fdc0-f934-45d7-847d-9dcdf6c2b3a4"},{"objectId":"61a4a6fb2467f0352ac88197","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Matuła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b9986b97-08f5-491e-82e4-001b4bffb717"},{"objectId":"61a4a6fb2467f0352ac88196","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Dziekan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"428e22d1-e914-42dc-a5ef-2ab97726568e"},{"objectId":"61a4a6fb2467f0352ac88195","name":"Todd

advanced use of a pH-responsive biomaterial-based injectable liquid implant for effective chemotherapeutic delivery in glioblastoma multiforme brain (GBM) tumour treatment is presented. As an implant, we proposed a water-in-oil-in-water multiple emulsion with encapsulated doxorubicin. The effectiveness of the proposed therapy was evaluated by comparing the cancer cell viability achieved in classical therapy (chemotherapeutic solution). The experimental study included doxorubicin release rates and consumption for two emulsions differing in drop sizes and structures in the presence of GBM-cells (LN229, U87\r\nMG), and a cell viability. The results showed that the multiple emulsion implant was significantly more effective than classical therapy when considering the reduction in cancer cell viability: 85% for the emulsion-implant, and only 43% for the classical therapy.

The yield of 4-nitrocatechol (4-NC) was higher at pH = 9; at the same time, a lower number of phenolic products was observed due to the hydrolysis and other irreversible reactions at pH > 7. Mineralization investigated with total organic carbon (TOC) technique showed that after 4-NP was completely consumed approx. 85 % of the organic carbon remained in the aqueous solution. Hence, up to 65 % of the organic carbon that remained in the aqueous solution accounted for the open-ring non-phenolic products. The light absorptivity of the reaction solution between 250 and 600 nm decreased as a result of OH reaction with 4-NP. At the same time, 4-NP solution showed some resistance to chemical bleaching due to the formation of the light-absorbing by-products. This phenomenon effectively prolongs the time-scale of chemical bleaching or 4-NP via reaction with OH by a factor of 3–1.5 at pH 2 and 9, respectively.

Lifestyle interventions have limited effect for most patients. Bariatric surgery is highly effective, but resource-demanding, invasive and associated with serious complications. Recently, a new intragastric balloon was introduced, not requiring endoscopy for placement or removal (Elipse™, Allurion Inc., Natick, MA). The balloon is swallowed in a capsule and filled with water once in the stomach. The balloon self-deflates after 4 months and is naturally excreted. The present trial investigated balloon feasibility, safety and efficacy in patients with obesity and type-2 diabetes.\nPatients and methods\nWe treated 19 patients, with type-2 diabetes and body mass index (BMI) of 30.0–39.9 kg/m2 at two Norwegian centers with the Elipse balloon. Patient follow-up during balloon treatment mimicked real-world clinical practice, including dietary plan and outpatient visits. The primary efficacy endpoints were total body weight loss (TBWL) and HbA1c at weeks 16 and 52.\nResults\nAll patients underwent balloon insertion uneventfully as out-patients. Mean TBWL and HbA1c reduction after 16 and 52 weeks of balloon insertion was 3.9% (95%CI 2.1–5.7) and 0.8% (95%CI 1.9–3.5); and 7 (95%CI 4–10), and 1 (95%CI −6 to 9) mmol/mol, respectively. Adverse events occurred in two patients (10.5%): one developed gastric outlet obstruction, managed by endoscopic balloon removal; the other excessive vomiting and dehydration, managed

tests that may improve clinical evaluation of pulmonary hypertension (PH) are needed. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of soluble ST2 (sST2) in patients with PH.\n\nMaterial and methods:\nA total of 57 patients with chronic thromboembolic PH and 43 patients with idiopathic arterial PH were enrolled in this study. All patients were evaluated for World Health Organization (WHO) functional class (FC), N-terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), troponin T (TnT), and hemodynamics. Plasma sST2 was assessed by an immu­nofluorescent in vitro diagnostic assay. All patients were followed up from the date of blood sampling. The endpoint was all-cause death.\n\nResults:\nThe median sST2 concentration was 32.8 ng/ml (IQR: 21.6–48.5 ng/ml) in the whole study population. Significant differences were found between median sST2 in successive WHO FCs (FC II vs. FC III, p = 0.002; FC III vs. FC IV, p = 0.12; FC II vs. FC IV, p = 0.008). Significant correlations were found between sST2 and hemodynamic parameters: mean right atrial pressure (r = 0.56; p < 0.05), mean pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.25; p < 0.05), cardiac index (r = –0.40; p < 0.05), pulmonary vascular resistance (r = 0.41; p < 0.05), and between sST2 and WHO FC (r = 0.36; p < 0.05), NT-proBNP (r = 0.55; p < 0.05), and TnT (r = 0.44; p < 0.05). sST2 concentration above the median was associated with worse clinical prognosis (p = 0.02, Kaplan-Meier).\n\nConclusions:\nsST2 seems to be a marker of poor clinical prognosis in patients with

and safety of anticoagulant treatment for venous thromboembolism (VTE) may vary in patients with different cancer sites. We evaluated the rates of VTE recurrence and major bleeding and the relative efficacy and safety of 6-month treatment with oral apixaban or subcutaneous dalteparin in patients with different cancer sites randomized in the Caravaggio study. Primary cancer was located at gastrointestinal sites in 375 patients (32.5%), lung in 200 (17.3%), breast in 155 (13.4%), genitourinary sites in 139 (12%), gynecological sites in 119 (10.3%), and was hematological in 85 patients (7.4%). Rates of VTE recurrence were 10.9% in patients with gynecological, 8.8% with gastrointestinal, 6.5% with genitourinary, and 5.5% with lung cancer with lower rates in the other sites of cancer. Rates of major bleeding were 7.2% in patients with genitourinary and 4.8% with gastrointestinal cancer, with lower rates in patients with other sites of cancer. The observed absolute risk difference in VTE recurrence in favor of apixaban was 11.9% in patients with gynecological, 5.5% with lung, 3.7% with genitourinary cancer, and 0.6% with gastrointestinal cancer. None of the risk differences was statistically significant. The rates of major bleeding in patients treated with apixaban or dalteparin was similar across patients with different cancer sites. In conclusion, recurrences appear to be more common in patients with gastrointestinal and gynecological cancer and major bleedings in patients with genitourinary and gastrointestinal cancer. Oral apixaban is a valid oral alternative to subcutaneous dalteparin for the treatment of a large spectrum of patients with cancer-associated

We have learned much about ABC proteins in model organisms, notably Arabidopsis thaliana; however, the importance of research dedicated to these transporters extends far beyond Arabidopsis biology. Recent progress in genomic and transcriptomic approaches for nonmodel and noncanonical model plants allows us to look at ABC transporters from a wider perspective and consider chemodiversity and functionally driven adaptation as distinctive mechanisms during their evolution. Here, by considering several representatives from agriculturally important families and recent progress in functional characterization of nonArabidopsis ABC proteins, we aim to bring attention to understanding the evolutionary background, distribution among lineages and possible mechanisms underlying the adaptation of this versatile transport system for plant needs. Increasing the knowledge of ABC proteins in nonmodel plants will facilitate breeding and development of new varieties based on, for example, genetic variations of endogenous genes and/or genome editing, representing an alternative to transgenic approaches."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057067507","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"233","pagesFromTo":"1597-1612","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/nph.17779","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709407878c28a0473b5190","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Banasiak","uuid":"C6F94A55A9F69487213DB87E57427945512B1044B192C67E0911367B1060110EBBE510D09A5D8B2030FDCD225851BF43826EF86129D166E73F1A97DD3CD69407","orcidId":"0000-0002-2834-7116","documentHash":"6f83b911-2c1c-475d-a50d-6e143146c359"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62b2","name":"Michał","lastName":"Jasiński","uuid":"A96FF698DCB906328A83E19D32709BE55D3F45D8C3B0C99145C19D1433C821D6E6E6D3EB65A4AE68B76C70FA6DD2D509417F1FF0A89E226AFA54E970DF115E13","orcidId":"0000-0003-0904-5873","documentHash":"17f10e64-79e4-4e55-8c18-5bcd14b27997"}],"doi":"10.1111/nph.17779"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Psychologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a798e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Best research practices for using the Implicit Association Test","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454772d9","mniswId":"2280","title":"Behavior Research Methods","doi":null,"issn":"1554-3528","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"752eb349-3659-4490-ae0b-0ef21a7a1145"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a66bab2467f0269e9621c8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61a66bab2467f0269e9621ca","61a66bab2467f0269e9621cb","61a66bab2467f0269e9621cc","61a66bab2467f0269e9621cd","61a66bab2467f0269e9621ce","61a66bab2467f0269e9621cf","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d0","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d1","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d2","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d3","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d4","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d5","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d6","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d7","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d8","61a66bab2467f0269e9621d9","5e709356878c28a0473a798e","61a66bab2467f0269e9621db","61a66bab2467f0269e9621dc","61a66bab2467f0269e9621dd","61a66bab2467f0269e9621de","61a66bab2467f0269e9621df"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057067637","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"1161-1180","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13428-021-01624-3.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61a66bab2467f0269e9621df","name":"Reinout W.","lastName":"Wiers","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d293fb5-2050-425a-85a4-26d836040d5b"},{"objectId":"61a66bab2467f0269e9621de","name":"Adriaan","lastName":"Spruyt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0120a205-5c38-46e2-8ea3-bef91bc6099c"},{"objectId":"61a66bab2467f0269e9621dd","name":"Kate A.","lastName":"Ratliff","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca866a81-b2c3-4eb5-be3f-c9df12cf4104"},{"objectId":"61a66bab2467f0269e9621dc","name":"James R.","lastName":"Rae","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2caf0c18-dbe4-421d-a72f-187f66757959"},{"objectId":"61a66bab2467f0269e9621db","name":"Brian D.","lastName":"Ostafin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b010cd67-dcd2-49cd-bea9-d1b03036e8af"},{"objectId":"61a66bab2467f0269e9621d9","name":"Kristen P.","lastName":"Lindgren","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"961023bb-d499-4b33-8899-e0804c866df5"},{"objectId":"61a66bab2467f0269e9621d8","name":"Jonas W.

Unfortunately, there is no curative treatment so far except surgery and available pharmacological treatments are restricted for short-term treatment options. Thus, there is a large unmet need in the UF space for noninvasive therapeutics.\n\nAreas covered:\nThe authors reviewed the literature available for the utility of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs in women with UFs. We also focused on clinical studies exploring the therapeutic benefits of novel oral non-peptide GnRH antagonists that were recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with estradiol/norethindrone acetate for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with UFs in premenopausal women.\n\nExpert opinion:\nThe results regarding the efficacy of new-generation oral GnRH-antagonists, such as elagolix, relugolix and linzagolix, are promising and offer potential prospect for the future therapy of UFs. However, these antagonists must be combined with hormonal add-back therapy to minimize the resultant hypoestrogenic side effects such as bone

To investigate the predictive value of the Diverticular Inflammation and Complication Assessment (DICA) classification and to develop and validate a combined endoscopic-clinical score predicting clinical outcomes of diverticulosis, named Combined Overview on Diverticular Assessment (CODA).\nDesign A: multicentre, prospective, international cohort study.\nSetting 43: gastroenterology and endoscopy centres located in Europe and South America.\nParticipants: 2215 patients (2198 completing the study) at the first diagnosis of diverticulosis/diverticular disease were enrolled. Patients were scored according to DICA classifications.\nInterventions: A 3-year follow-up was performed.\nMain outcome measures: To predict the acute diverticulitis and the surgery according to DICA classification. Survival methods for censored observation were used to develop and validate a novel combined endoscopic-clinical score for predicting diverticulitis and surgery (CODA score).\nResults: The 3-year cumulative probability of diverticulitis and surgery was of 3.3% (95% CI 2.5% to 4.5%) in DICA 1, 11.6% (95% CI 9.2% to 14.5%) in DICA 2 and 22.0% (95% CI 17.2% to 28.0%) in DICA 3 (p<0.001), and 0.15% (95% CI 0.04% to 0.59%) in DICA 1, 3.0% (95% CI 1.9% to 4.7%) in DICA 2 and 11.0% (95% CI 7.5% to 16.0%) in DICA 3 (p<0.001), respectively. The 3-year cumulative probability of diverticulitis and surgery was ≤4%, and ≤0.7% in CODA A; <10% and <2.5% in CODA B; >10% and >2.5% in CODA C, respectively. The CODA score showed optimal discrimination capacity in predicting the risk of surgery in the development (c-statistic: 0.829; 95% CI 0.811 to 0.846) and validation cohort (c-statistic: 0.943; 95% CI

How does this translate into changes in education? In this article, I analyse the case of Poland. The research is focused on finding an answer to the following question: How does the postulate present in the programme discourse of the ruling, conservative party, of strengthening the national identity, translate into the changes in the school core curricula (CCs)? The applied method of analysis is Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA). The approach by Ruth Wodak and Martin Reisigl was adopted. The application of discursive strategies in learning outcomes relating to national identity, social equality, and diversity in the old and in the new CCs, was investigated. The analyses demonstrated a significant discursive strengthening of the national identity on the one hand, and application of mitigation/exclusion strategies in relation to issues of social equality and diversity on the other. The analyses presented in this paper contribute to the discussion on the relationship between curriculum studies and educational politics by showing the influence of the dominant ideology of contemporary politics on the concept of citizenship in the national CCs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057102595","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"520-535","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220272.2021.1995051","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e639","name":"Violetta","lastName":"Kopińska","uuid":"A0EA3A60842AD37C39FFF292A388780FBE61D5572959AFA2A0C1BE12678D773D90707088035F1E222A1A433328E1CBEFC5F6D51CC88711D5A69964355791CDC4","orcidId":"0000-0002-5255-9995","documentHash":"a9b05608-d65b-406e-8d42-232fac3432e0"}],"doi":"10.1080/00220272.2021.1995051"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["data mining","fuzzy modeling","hydro-climatologic processes","monthly precipitation","sea surface temperature","Z-numbers"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709301878c28a0473a0d29"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of Z-numbers to teleconnection modeling between monthly precipitation and large scale sea surface temperature","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c308","mniswId":"7819","title":"Hydrology Research","doi":null,"issn":"0029-1277","eissn":"2224-7955","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2ec8626b-5776-401b-b8d7-c73a58bd118b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-11-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a8b5f32467f03813074204","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61a8b5f32467f03813074206","61a8b5f32467f0381307420a","61a8b5f32467f0381307420b","61a8b5f32467f0381307420c","5e709301878c28a0473a0d29"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The teleconnection modeling of hydro-climatic events is a complex problem with highly uncertain circumstances. In contrast to the classic fuzzy logic methods, by using the Z-number in addition to the constraint of information, and by evaluating the data reliability, it is possible to characterize the degree of ambiguity of data. In this regard, this study investigates the performance of the Z-number-based model (ZBM) in prediction of classified monthly precipitation (MP) events of two synoptic stations in Iran (up to five months in advance). To this end, the sea surface temperature (SST) of adjacent seas was used as a predictor. The suggested model, by using of Z-number directly and applying fuzzy Hausdorff distance to determine weights of if-then rules, predicted MP events of both the stations with over 70% confidence. Analysis of the results in the test step showed that the ZBM compared to the traditional fuzzy approach improved the results by 69% for Kermanshah and 112% for Tabriz. Overall, the Z-number concept by assessing events reliability, can be used in various sectors of water resources management such as decision-making and drought monitoring."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057102725","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"53","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61a8b5f32467f0381307420c","name":"Kiyoumars","lastName":"Roushangar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5df07bf4-6956-4f99-befc-5a2450365c4b"},{"objectId":"61a8b5f32467f0381307420b","name":"Elnaz","lastName":"Sharghi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8907-8194","documentHash":"3e694c7a-b225-4276-ba03-0cf150fde41e"},{"objectId":"61a8b5f32467f0381307420a","name":"Vahid","lastName":"Nourani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b7f4e81-f68c-4fc2-9f8d-d4d433da4691"},{"objectId":"61a8b5f32467f03813074206","name":"Hessam","lastName":"Najafi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5176-2051","documentHash":"d8897165-cca6-40d8-b7a8-122e47b39139"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0d29","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"C541214B36DCE56EA73226A72D8583F0522497CB294F8F2C6D735A3F374248543D1650790C6EF95FF2DC3AE69045C1FE4CF28531EA368CB9D47AA769349E15F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-6762-8885","documentHash":"48791db9-a431-43a1-ac1b-a52e6c68d55c"}],"doi":"10.2166/nh.2021.025"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b06a5","60deab069543c7233654464d","5e709268878c28a0473952a6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dependence on parameters for nonlinear equations-Abstract principles and applications","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478db5","mniswId":"14026","title":"Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"0170-4214","eissn":"1099-1476","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b850645b-cb0e-4805-adc4-09d40e113af4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a3f0bc2467f00d74701191","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b06a5","5e709268878c28a0473952a6","60deab069543c7233654464d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057105902","journalIssue":{"objectId":"640f127f409707703509b97f","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"45","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"ed6ad740-9058-4d2f-a4b8-ea67d2918ece"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"1668-1686","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1002/mma.7882","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60deab069543c7233654464d","name":"Michał","lastName":"Bełdziński","uuid":"7924A718EF6EA0655C78CAF19E5D59641C684BDB0D24615E8F00A216B1323FCD391DB8A31870B2776CD3679290C823F75E41D29F70B838A78E94412AFD252DDD","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d654c757-865a-4f11-9842-31e66a3fb093"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b06a5","name":"Igor","lastName":"Kossowski","uuid":"DBA793258630409F227B2D754BA720E0FF0AC0D25B471F6EEC5A31F80C471CCDDE3A7C68801BAF94E6B72FA24B8517D1249828DE65E5C6179F05C355DC7C0EA9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1314-5562","documentHash":"381b692f-4188-4d13-adf9-5c4abd22995d"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a0473952a6","name":"Marek","lastName":"Galewski","uuid":"15D18DBA1AF2C30C60D521055882026877BEEA8219E1FC4D7B53E2F1FABAE9430DFCEED71BFFA412F3EFC80669C8AFB7A74F0186F2F7B7D90C509900063602D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-3224-2456","documentHash":"68d37f7b-d719-496c-b749-d3a6d9f90919"}],"doi":"10.1002/mma.7882"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Komórki macierzyste hemopoetyczne -

Venous leg ulcers (VLU) represent the most common chronic leg wounds and become epidemiologically relevant in an ageing society. \r\n\r\n<b>Aim:</b> This study investigated the effects of a complex treatment, including a specialized oral nutritional supplementation, on the dynamics of the VLU healing.\r\n\r\n<b>Material and methods:</b> This 12-week prospective study included 35 individuals with VLU. The patients received professional wound care including specialized dressings. To ensure an optimal nutritional status for wound healing, the patients were asked to drink three times per day 200 ml of an energy-dense protein-rich formula containing arginine, zinc, and vitamins. The healing dynamics were assessed by planimetry.\r\n\r\n<b>Results:</b> Complete wound healing was achieved in 6 patients, and the median ulcer area decreased from 26.5 cm2 to 14.8 cm2 (<i>p</i> = 0.0001).

Herein, a proof-of-concept study was conducted to demonstrate the use of coated probe electrospray ionization (coated-PESI) and coated blade spray (CBS) as ambient mass spectrometry approaches for monitoring drug biotransformation. The ability of these methods was investigated for monitoring the dephosphorylation of a prodrug, i.e., combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P), into its active form, i.e., combretastatin A4 (CA4), in a cell culture medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum. The CBS spot analysis was modified to achieve the same extraction efficiency as liquid-liquid extraction and obtain results in 7 min. Low quantities of target analytes were extracted using coated-PESI, indicating that this technique can be used to perform extractions with only negligible target analyte depletion. Because coated-PESI does not consume any sample, it is the preferred technique in the case of a limited sample volume. Although coated-PESI only extracts small quantities of analytes, it uses the desorption solvent volume of 5–10 pL, resulting in high sensitivity, thus allowing the detection of compounds after only 1 min of extraction. The biotransformation of CA4P into CA4 via phosphatases occurs within the simple matrix, and the proposed sample preparation techniques are suitable for monitoring the biotransformation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057108919","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"186-191","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095177921000873","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6620bde740970762636d25b8","name":"J.","lastName":"Pawliszyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b85e945-538e-4837-952d-64d35108017f"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac533","name":"Karol","lastName":"Jaroch","uuid":"6EE72E2E293B5AD556C0583C00C8E6D3F16702C22E9F7C8E8C8D59C271EE91649F0F541319395E62B6EFA0384FD5154FCD34C6E6F177244B541B6677B22C3C3F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0189-2509","documentHash":"ab98fddb-4a47-45be-82c4-ba42bd22db6f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jpha.2021.08.001"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Małżowiny uszne","Guz"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Rare auriculae entity","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b73","mniswId":"6089","title":"European Annals of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Diseases","doi":null,"issn":"1879-7296","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"10932477-e9d2-4fcf-b149-cf17c17c3a4e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61acd8392467f032cc231daf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094b2878c28a0473c1ca3","5e7092c1878c28a04739c187","661fa280409707626368ed93"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057108938","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"139","pagesFromTo":"103-104","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S187972962100185X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fa280409707626368ed93","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Masna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d4531f7-70d0-4b79-bc2c-24ce55a78cd7"},{"objectId":"5e7094b2878c28a0473c1ca3","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Zwierz","uuid":"79FF6CA47818EEB1956D10762A1FAFF02E14912FE4C212CAD60CCB0118FA1A1F6CFE8E1DAB9DEBAA3078BDC299A8EE594B1093D865B2CBDA1938DD269CBAAC77","orcidId":"0000-0002-5824-8709","documentHash":"3307142d-8c49-49f1-8535-fcd1d99dce47"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c187","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Maciejewska","uuid":"C012F043AFDAB964D10B147AFE99D6D268EE866167B33BE4AF5424907F9D1C5851D25B25549CA73B399E11A8811B90DB676C74B540FC1C4F86C8E58322015B88","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"889e32eb-ddfd-48e3-883d-2e330432b418"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.anorl.2021.05.021"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Metaloproteinazy macierzowe","Cukrzyca typu 2 -

The aim of this study was to analyse the patient characteristics and early outcomes of the surgical management of post-infarction PMR from an international multicentre registry.\r\nMETHODS: Patients underwent surgery for post-infarction PMR between 2001 through 2019 were retrieved from database of the CAUTION study. The primary end point was in-hospital mortality.\r\nRESULTS: A total of 214 patients were included with a mean age of 66.9 (standard deviation: 10.5) years. The posteromedial papillary muscle was the most frequent rupture location (71.9%); the rupture was complete in 67.3% of patients. Mitral valve replacement was performed in 82.7% of cases. One hundred twenty-two patients (57%) had concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting. In-hospital mortality was 24.8%. Temporal trends revealed no apparent improvement in in-hospital mortality during the study period. Multivariable analysis showed that preoperative chronic kidney disfunction [odds ratio (OR): 2.62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07–6.45, P = 0.036], cardiac arrest (OR: 3.99, 95% CI: 1.02–15.61, P = 0.046) and cardiopulmonary bypass duration (OR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00–1.02, P = 0.04) were independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death, whereas concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting was identified as an independent predictor of early survival (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.16–0.92, P = 0.031).\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment for post-infarction PMR carries a high in-hospital mortality rate, which did not improve during the study period. Because concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting confers a survival benefit, this additional procedure should be performed, whenever possible, in an attempt to improve the outcome.\r\nClinical

studies on paternal postnatal depression (PPND) have been performed in Poland.\r\n\r\nAim:\r\nThe aim of the study was to estimate the symptoms of depression in women and men and identify the determinants of mental health of fathers after the birth of their child.\r\n\r\nMaterial and methods:\r\nParents (142) participated in the study during the period 1 to 12 months after the birth.\r\n\r\nResults and discussion:\r\nThe analyses reveal that 13% of fathers and 18% of mothers after the birth of their child had Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) scores of 10 or higher, which indicates possible depression. At score 12 and more, the proportion detected by EPDS decreased to 7% of fathers and 13% of mothers, which is an indicator of major depressive disorder. At EPDS score 12 and more, a probable depressive disorder was indicated in 10% of fathers in the period of 1–3 months, 7% of fathers at 4–7 months and 4% of fathers at 8–12 months. The symptoms of maternal depression at a score of 12 and more were detected in 16% of women at 1–3 months, 12% at 4–7 months 11% at 8–12 months. PPND was significantly associated with depression in mothers OR 5.7, lower education OR 4.3, low financial income OR 6.0, decreased relationship satisfaction OR 3.3, and previous history of depression OR 3.2.\r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\nPsychosocial factors were strong predictors of PPND up to a year after the birth of the child. The authors suggest the routine screening and assessment of both parents should occur during the woman’s pregnancy and in the postnatal period.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747057109096","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"6-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.paom.pl/Paternal-postpartum-depression-its-relationship-to-maternal-postpartum-depression,132314,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fcda34097076263694bf7","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Kudziełko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"617b4a67-8293-4cda-8f42-05ba1b840374"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2eea","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Dombrowska-Pali","uuid":"E62287B89A9F66E5CEBD704C125590F34A57F9B403BA11D11E20D01E26EBABA1AE7D927D65F17CF12F96C3185FA0CADFC063BEC7DD195BD0E93111518FBFBC1A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0785-8977","documentHash":"ab9bb4ce-5ecf-4878-b130-c480e36f16ee"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c402","name":"Estera","lastName":"Mieczkowska","uuid":"839D07FFA1FF77BA007F355EAFDCB39EC46F24512D2D2B879105B9CC2E04F84E2A3EC280635C6AC4956704A492DBDA9F28B7C1CAAA853FFEA7FF3267909DB8D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4837-4891","documentHash":"3a00c886-bb9a-4ab6-ad37-f6a7d20be130"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c299","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Kaźmierczak","uuid":"0FE7E91AEC35FA8010850B99B19AE2E1885A805DA9D096324038973E0499AE314A58E32E94D4F50944313C784986DDA08998C1809EBF4060960BC436A0E7C4A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3795-7581","documentHash":"5fe74fd4-34ff-48df-bfc9-9ac8291d0bec"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c296","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Gebuza","uuid":"2F6C6EDCF141169DF8AE25C0A43B3A3CE68344A29AA99500A81F2F7A75132BBF7A1491134B670863DA75B4D275D75F47F9E3018D8639C0572528F535F818935D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9743-4267","documentHash":"a78d8e54-0d03-460d-8426-ce222e55fa2f"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c019","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gierszewska","uuid":"37ECA6CD53BD45D9AAA4EDC9B9984D7CDAC2854A18A75926B6EAF36CA63F607853A6BA33FC22244549B904E29BEE8B650D322E3FC262E9C3F8478178E81D96C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-4443-8982","documentHash":"9624c133-5709-4026-9527-6c7739e8f776"}],"doi":"10.29089/2020.20.00168"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Karbazolu pochodne - chemia","Optyka","Toksykologia","Białka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Carbazole dyes","Optical functional materials","Photo-optical properties","Nonlinear optical properties","Toxicology","Bioimaging","Protein affinity","DFT"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis, electrochemical, optical and biological properties of new carbazole derivatives","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797fa","mniswId":"18836","title":"Spectrochimica Acta - Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy","doi":null,"issn":"1386-1425","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"110a434f-15a5-4f97-aae1-25d7c2dc6c6d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61acd9072467f032cc2428ea","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c0878c28a04739c11a","5e7092c1878c28a04739c229","66017c5640970762631ca7b9","66017c5640970762631ca7ba"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Carbazole skeleton is the key structural motif of many biologically active compounds including synthetic and natural products.

The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of the number of spermatozoa entering the spermatheca on the initiation of egg laying, in naturally mated queens (NMQs) and in instrumentally inseminated queens (IIQs). The sperm number in the spermatheca, and the onset of oviposition in NMQs, as well as queens inseminated with different doses of semen, were also compared. The results showed that the beginning of egg laying in both NMQs and IIQs did not depend on how much the spermatheca was filled. Queens with 3 million and less or 3.1–4, 4.1–5, and more than 5 million spermatozoa initiated egg laying at similar time. Queens inseminated with a dose of 2x2 µl, 2x4 µl, 2x6 µl, 10 µl and NMQs had in their spermathecas 3.57, 4.23, 5.01, 3.86, and 4.36 million (on average) spermatozoa, respectively, and started oviposition at the age of 16.7, 17.3, 17.3, 15.6. and 10.2 days, respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057109158","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"206-212","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epub/10.1080/00218839.2021.1994258?needAccess=true","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392432","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Gąbka","uuid":"D07585C7F1F13B4AC7ADF8571643F0900E6512CDA2B187BA1A170B3521264E32834F7770C9F134296C1C0F25114A97AAC612A5D63CC150E187F7B5C943B91E22","orcidId":"0000-0002-2335-5643","documentHash":"0d8a17cf-c26e-4858-a34a-a89619ecd547"}],"doi":"10.1080/00218839.2021.1994258"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Radioterapia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Dose delivery","Ionizing radiation","Physical principles of radiotherapy","Radiation interaction with matter","Techniques in radiotherapy","Treatment planning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Principles of radiation therapy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547cf1a","mniswId":"16097","title":"Physical Sciences Reviews","doi":null,"issn":"2365-6581","eissn":"2365-659X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f47d15ed-6bb2-4b5c-9a8c-1366dddcad1f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61acd4d02467f032cc2030e7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709404878c28a0473b4e81"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<b>Introduction</b> Radiotherapy is one of the basic methods of cancer treatment. Tens of millions of people around the world are exposed to ionizing radiation each year in the hope that it will help fight the disease or slow down its progress. Radiotherapy owes its success mainly to important discoveries in the field of physics, which allowed to understand the essence of the interaction of ionizing radiation with matter, in particular living matter.\r\n<b>Materials</b> The following study explains which types of radiation have the ability to ionize matter. The difference between the interaction of electrically charged particles and neutral particles was explained. The author briefly described methods of delivering radiation to diseased tissues and how adjacent tissues are protected. The most important physical quantities describing the quality and dose of the delivered radiation were introduced.\r\n<b>Conclusions</b> Safe use of radiotherapy as one of the methods of oncological treatment requires proficient knowledge of the basics of radiobiology and the physics of nuclear interactions. The study describes the most important steps in the preparation and implementation of radiotherapy, but it is not sufficient to fully understand this method. However, it provides an opportunity to be familiar with the issue in general."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057109177","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"1501-1528","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/psr-2019-0063/html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4e81","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Winiecki","uuid":"D3A96B806B5E74718A51E59EF0B470DC7201CF949EC9CF8108D11F146AFD2FD23EC236D7D0D20786382C97ED992FE718E991C951E473A999B9B8AFD9033367C7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9330-1547","documentHash":"e9009d4a-f015-4c39-8b48-9200fb2a0ca7"}],"doi":"10.1515/psr-2019-0063"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","social researchers","research with researchers","Polish researchers","research ethics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ad878c28a0473aeee9"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","uid":"brSLXPVso2IWE01FTmuoK5g","uuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","parentUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","rootUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","name":"Collegium Civitas w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e2878c28a0473c5ff9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Social Researchers’ Approaches to Research Ethics During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478665","mniswId":"10929","title":"Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics","doi":null,"issn":"1556-2646","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"d0fb7adc-a472-4c0e-b491-5cbd8ba3b049"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a90d5f2467f038131af5e2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ad878c28a0473aeee9","61a90d5f2467f038131af5e4","5e7094e2878c28a0473c5ff9"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The global COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine/distancing measures have forced researchers to cope with a new situation. This paper aimed to analyze how the pandemic and its associated constraints have affected social researchers’ approach to research ethics. Drawing on an online qualitative survey with 193 Polish social researchers conducted in April and May 2020, we distinguished three approaches: nothing has changed, opportunity-oriented, and precautionary. According to the first, the pandemic was not regarded as a situation that required additional reflection on ethical issues or changes in research approaches. By contrast, the other two were based on the assumption that the pandemic affected research project ethics. The difference was in the assessment of changes in the area of ethics. The pandemic presented an opportunity and a threat to the ethicality of research, respectively. We discuss the implications of all three approaches for research and

The present study examined relationships between well-being and individualism and collectivism among 1906 emerging adults in the US, aged 18–25. We measured individualism and collectivism distinguishing horizontal and vertical dimensions of these constructs, and we measured well-being in terms of depression, anxiety, self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and neuroticism. Regression analyses found that individualism was negatively related to well-being, and these relationships varied somewhat between horizontal and vertical individualism. Horizontal collectivism was positively related to all measures of well-being, and vertical collectivism was positively related to three measures. These findings increase our understanding of the roles individualism and collectivism play in the psychological well-being of emerging adults, including the importance of distinguishing horizontal and vertical dimensions of individualism and collectivism."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057117506","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"520-524","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/21676968211054596","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620f12b87523402df0858ccf","name":"John","lastName":"Nezlek","uuid":"6F15958A624471F95302389C7931F0E9675CC7DA40F213EFDB4E9E88D46E0EC034F383D5CEF8C3166608FB3C1E4B6B64860ACCC4EA436C0364E9DEFF68304919","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcee9c7b-40d0-4193-b63b-bffaa0abb50c"},{"objectId":"61a4a6fd2467f0352ac88230","name":"Ashley","lastName":"Humphrey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2550873c-6da9-413f-a868-ac099d0b8b2f"}],"doi":"10.1177/21676968211054596"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-3-030-86296-1","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Biomechanics in Medicine, Sport and Biology","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61acf76a2467f032cc3eb287","editors":[{"objectId":"6447c0674097076e1e8adc0e","name":"M.","lastName":"Błażkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9d645bc-9d43-4047-9a46-610350adf992"},{"objectId":"6447c0674097076e1e8adc0d","name":"M.","lastName":"Syczewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7462aec4-b03a-4575-8b94-099b56465587"},{"objectId":"6447c0674097076e1e8adc0c","name":"S.","lastName":"Piszczatowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ef2d3bc-c5eb-49a7-ad0d-fd166ee94902"},{"objectId":"6447c0674097076e1e8adc0b","name":"A.","lastName":"Hadamus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c58158ef-b8cb-4c2d-a62e-5cef2d7e4504"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6447c0674097076e1e8adc0b","6447c0674097076e1e8adc0c","6447c0674097076e1e8adc0d","6447c0674097076e1e8adc0e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057117946","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"328","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86297-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-86297-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Jaskra -

Moreover, the study also compares texture features obtained on the basis of these images for healthy bone tissue, bone directly after implantation and after a 12-month period of prosthetic loading. Materials and Methods: The subject of the analysis was radiovisiogram images obtained from the Medical University of Bialystok from the Department of Dental Surgery. They are radiovisiogram photographs of 146 people aged 18–74, treated implantally due to missing teeth. The whole group of patients received two types of implants (Active and Replace) of the same company, made of titanium, intraosseous, screw-in. Results: It has been shown that both in the upper jaw and the mandible, the values of texture parameters obtained for bone images made after one year of prosthetic loading are closer to healthy tissue than immediately after implantation. These values for the mandible were relatively closer to those obtained on the basis of healthy tissue than those for the upper jaw. The bone around the implant with a single threading achieved better results in the mandible than the one with a double threading. Conclusion: The type of bone tissue and the shape of the implant have an impact on the achieved osseointegration. With the passage of time and the process of bone remodelling, the damaged tissue returns to its normal structure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057125316","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"111-118","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11760-021-01971-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63d8e5614097071d3437414e","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Szarmach","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a3bcfc41-89b8-49dd-9d90-9990b4d95d84"},{"objectId":"63d8e5614097071d3437414d","name":"Brygida ","lastName":"Trochim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b864092f-5132-4b0a-b6d3-d39f218f9a95"},{"objectId":"5e70922d878c28a0473912d2","name":"Marta","lastName":"Borowska","uuid":"B6A36BF8AD80ED24635D6A97832CD6FB743C8583CE28C9F3C80248A601BEE4AE49A09BB491C7CEA0B74D23966E6DE2B9A9C379C4923320F4A808EEBC7161A7B0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0148-9912","documentHash":"8d7cfae3-7612-4025-9104-2168553a317b"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11760-021-01971-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709316878c28a0473a29ea"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Word knowledge and lexical access in monolingual and bilingual migrant children : impact of word properties","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c87","mniswId":"13453","title":"Language Acquisition","doi":null,"issn":"1048-9223","eissn":"1532-7817","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d4c35902-1d19-4c39-995d-2e53614ca195"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a9e2312467f0525e8c0252","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64cd2fa04097077ac1dd4995","5e709316878c28a0473a29ea","64cd2fa04097077ac1dd4996","64cd2fa04097077ac1dd4997","64cd2fa04097077ac1dd4998","64cd2fa04097077ac1dd4999"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Word knowledge and the speed of word processing in monolingual children and adults are influenced by word properties, such as the age of acquisition (AoA), imageability, and frequency. Understanding how different properties of words contribute to the ease of processing by bilingual children is a critical step for establishing models of childhood bilingualism. However, a joint impact of these properties has not been so far assessed in bilingual children. Here, we compared the impact of AoA, imageability, and frequency on accuracy and response times in picture naming and picture recognition tasks in monolingual and bilingual children. We used Cross-Linguistic Lexical Tasks to test 45 monolingual children (aged 4 to 7 years) and 45 migrant bilingual children in their L1 (Polish). Word AoA, imageability, and frequency independently affected the accuracy and response times in both picture naming and picture recognition tasks. Crucially, bilingual children were more sensitive to word characteristics than their monolingual peers: Bilingual children’s accuracy was particularly low for words of high AoA (in the picture recognition task) and for words of low frequency (in the picture naming task). Also, the increase in response times for low-imageable and low-frequent words was particularly salient in bilingual children.

Our analyzes comprised two profiles from different parts of lake basin, each approximately 11-m long. The deposits represent two cycles of lake accumulation (two limnic layers), each ended by peat deposition, separated by mineral fluvial deposits. The lower and upper limnic layers, despite several similar geochemical features, are records of two separate phases of the lake's functioning. The palynological data suggest that the mineral deposits separating them are not continuous succession, but contain a stratigraphic hiatus. We characterized six geochemical zones (GZ), which correspond well with lithological features of deposits and climatic changes, and reflect the changing environmental conditions (redox conditions, variability and intensity of denudation, biological productivity, and fertility of the environment). In the first phase of lake's development, some influence of the surface material supply is visible, indicated by the increased content of lithophilous elements, (e.g. potassium), as well as closely correlated with them copper and zinc. Slow accumulation of carbonates dominated the limnic layers due to their abundant supply from the catchment area. The greatest variations of isotopic values of carbonates occur in the bottom and at the top of the stratigraphic profile and are related to the changing environmental conditions in the lake's basin (water level and temperature variations). The differences in carbon and nitrogen isotope values suggest different sources of organic matter accumulated in the studied basin and varying trophy of the environment. The higher mercury content is related to the course of climate change and is the highest in cold periods. We identified five main phases of evolution of the palaeolake at Gorzów Wielkopolski site. The lake accumulation began during the final phase of the Wartanian (Late Saalian) Glaciation (MIS 6). Initially the palaeolake harmonically developed and reached its maximum depth (Early and Middle Eemian, MIS 5e). Next the palaeolake became shallower and transformed into the peatbog (Late Eemian, MIS 5e). In the Early Vistulian period (or Early Weichselian, MIS 5a–d), the lake re-existed, initially as a flow-through lake. Finally in middle Vistulian (or Middle Weichselian – Pleniglacial, MIS 3–4), the palaeolake declined and mire developed.</p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747057133544","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65083a4a40970739aadc1a79","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"632","number":"","doi":null,"documentHash":"c4d289f3-d697-4f86-964d-03aaceeadfb2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"51-64","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040618221005644","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a24e4097074fa1bcdb28","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Stefaniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef62b3df-cb7c-4bb8-98da-059d51cc295e"},{"objectId":"6661a24e4097074fa1bcdb27","name":"Renata","lastName":"Stachowicz-Rybka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad2d3bbd-2a2e-4229-998b-2e84e492e017"},{"objectId":"6661a24e4097074fa1bcdb26","name":"Artur","lastName":"Sobczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d0ad522-a1e6-436c-a6af-c258a076efd0"},{"objectId":"6661a24e4097074fa1bcdb25","name":"Anna","lastName":"Hrynowiecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"86122267-c8ca-41c0-891c-221d89ee1023"},{"objectId":"6661a24e4097074fa1bcdb24","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Radzikowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5607fed-0e9e-4473-8cb5-1f1ed4fc1425"},{"objectId":"6661a24e4097074fa1bcdb23","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Mirosław-Grabowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"adf43b82-a2b3-41f4-bf38-6d9a6c9b0b47"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b78f8","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Sławińska","uuid":"896C1017B95B742A0B78CD963EC994283726A1169C63EAC20044A9E019A4D72552A53CF88BD2F18B16B9993D25839F37CB8187113257365BB48A67C263306BC0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1708-2722","documentHash":"1c200b09-780c-4594-a411-693861a1afeb"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a5f4","name":"RYSZARD","lastName":"BORÓWKA","uuid":"8E634D007F4F8D5029F16F8476DB95D179EE403D8FB340A33FF2AE03F6A5FF7DD3BE3A6D7922000352E72F2EDA7167B4ACC16A511EAFCF550978CD657E0427D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7232-3453","documentHash":"bd4822e6-0091-4433-b3a7-5d27ac9fee39"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.quaint.2021.11.023"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Prezycyjne

evidence for the effects of Holocene history on modern biotic communities suggests that current explanations of community patterns and conservation strategies require\r\nrevisiting. Here we focused on Central European rich fens that are at high risk among mire habitats because of their relatively low environmental stability, and hence sensitivity to successional shifts. At each of 57 study sites, inventory of specialist species of bryophytes,\r\nvascular plants and land snails, measurements of local environmental conditions, area, and radiocarbon dating were conducted. We used Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation, multiple linear regression models, MDS, db-RDA, and null models to identify drivers of species richness and occurrence. We tested the importance of site age and historical metacommunity dynamics expressed by regional age of the habitat for the diversity of three taxonomic\r\ngroups of fen organisms differing in dispersal and life history strategies. The richness of specialist species was affected by local environmental conditions and area in all\r\nthree groups, but the effect of regional age was significant and positive for vascular plants and snails, once the effect of fen area was set as a covariable.

studies show that eveningness and depressive symptoms are positively related. However, little is known about potential factors that may weaken or amplify the negative emotional consequences of the eveningness. In the present study, using a conceptual framework of the Regulative Theory of Temperament, we explored the moderating role of temperamental traits in the association between chronotype and depressive symptoms. We hypothesized that higher endurance and briskness, as well as lower emotional reactivity, may significantly reduce depressive symptoms. The study was conducted on a group of 929 individuals aged 18–35 years. Significant interaction effects showed that the magnitude of the association between eveningness and depressive symptoms might decrease with high briskness and low emotional reactivity. The results provide further evidence for the regulative role of temperament in the area of affective functioning, showing that briskness and emotional reactivity can be viewed as protective or risk factors against the elevated depressive symptoms of evening chronotypes. It may, therefore, be important to consider both chronotype and temperament in the prevention and diagnosis of depression."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057144895","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"185","pagesFromTo":"Nr artykułu:

states in the continuum (BICs) are observed in optical cavities composed of a high refractive index periodic structure embedded in significantly lower refractive index surroundings, enabling vertical confinement of the grating modes. Here, we propose a vertically nonsymmetric configuration, implemented on a high refractive index bulk substrate with a one-dimensional grating positioned on a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR). In this configuration, the grating modes are leaky, which could prohibit the creation of a BIC if the grating was implemented on uniform substrate. However, the judiciously designed DBR on which the grating is implemented reflects nonzero diffraction orders induced by the grating. We found that the laterally antisymmetric optical modes located at the center of the Brillouin zone of this structure create BICs that are robust against changes in the grating parameters, as long as the DBR reflects the diffraction orders. The configuration enables a high degree of design freedom, facilitating the realization of very high quality factor cavities in conventional all-semiconductor technology."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057156186","journalIssue":{"objectId":"651e79d34097070ba4d8f54a","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"11","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"17f79948-73c1-4072-ae57-3ff12b5560dc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"45-52","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c332f59543c7233654405d","name":"Mikołaj ","lastName":"Janczak","uuid":"A51E743DD4896C94F7EB558B8DD55119CBEC9B21CA66AECC15CBC2653F7B11C9043012BDBD4565A06C140D174BC5E224EE3F722ACCBF939A9974105DD9BAA504","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"20f4543e-aa0e-4923-ba29-74df4f3e6b74"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b42d5","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Pruszyńska-Karbownik","uuid":"A279671A66BF0F0754A4112C6A7842E41E3C621FB9CE626AB4C724C401406D02B5118CA3FC163F1394D0D4E9BC20F13F8101987DA9974A64099615A3AED93F3A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5973-9825","documentHash":"3b691352-0868-4d80-819b-15c1b6458114"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a0473952c6","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Czyszanowski","uuid":"3EED08095BF75204FB0DCDCBF00FCF9D5195661CE14B7D13464C3CA7B58ADBD17A5E97F03593DEDED86CF6225EFCABF862B37F123D4409DCD6707363DAF73860","orcidId":"0000-0002-0283-5074","documentHash":"acc03cc4-a41d-4edc-9863-318295b3a2d4"}],"doi":"10.1515/nanoph-2021-0478"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b65ab","5e709217878c28a04738fbcf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Non-thermal plasma technique for preservation of raw or fresh foods: A review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d10","mniswId":"6693","title":"Food Control","doi":null,"issn":"0956-7135","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cbfa2009-2bf5-4a62-a8aa-cac1a769647a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ae64262467f00bc8d15661","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61ae64262467f00bc8d15663","61ae64262467f00bc8d15664","61ae64262467f00bc8d15665","5e709217878c28a04738fbcf","61ae64262467f00bc8d15667","61ae64262467f00bc8d15668","5e70941c878c28a0473b65ab"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fruits and vegetables, as fresh foods, are significant sources of nutrients. However, the spread of diseases related to fresh foods is widespread. Development and research of rotting-control technologies are necessary to maintain quality, reduce postharvest biological hazards, while processing and storage are essential to increase their shelf-life. Cold plasma as an advanced non-thermal disinfection method can be supplementary or sole alternative for reducing microbial loads on raw or fresh products and packaging materials. Plasma employs inert gases at room temperature to generate ionized and highly reactive, e.g., positive and negative ions, electrons, molecules in (non) excited states, free radicals, and photons. Different plasma species react with the biological cells, fostering permanent changes at the molecular levels and morphology, thus leading to their inactivation. There are three primary mechanisms attributed to cell death by plasma, including cell surface etching induced by reactive species, impact on intracellular components, and the destruction of genetic material. Aside from that, plasma-mediated treatments are beneficial enzymatic inactivation, resulting in a shelf-life extension. Food processors can employ this technology for surface decontamination and impediment for biofilm development. Cold plasma may induce bioactive compounds degradation by the combined effects of numerous plasma-reactive species and thermal-induced oxidative cleavage pathways. Therefore, issues related to this technology include adverse effects on food components, especially lipids and vitamins, still require more investigations to improve the practical applicability of this technique."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057156493","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f3aead2467f061bc0de367","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"78","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"f3de40e5-fb2e-4e39-b85f-8215b6e9b866"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"134","pagesFromTo":"ID number 108560","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0956713521006988?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61ae64262467f00bc8d15668","name":"Amin Mousavi","lastName":"Khaneghah","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5769-0004","documentHash":"da1b0719-6b5d-42db-b077-e3b2584e074a"},{"objectId":"61ae64262467f00bc8d15667","name":"Predrag","lastName":"Putnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5bc0d34-8f32-4b58-b860-16a9303abe21"},{"objectId":"61ae64262467f00bc8d15665","name":"Moshen","lastName":"Gavahian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0871a7a2-c2f7-45fc-8492-92a238510bd3"},{"objectId":"61ae64262467f00bc8d15664","name":"Vikky","lastName":"Rajulapati","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3cefa274-effb-4d3b-8514-4d8b4a99bd0b"},{"objectId":"61ae64262467f00bc8d15663","name":"Parisa Jafarian","lastName":"Asl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e1c94ae-416f-4c4d-a0f0-3764261bc174"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b65ab","name":"Krystian","lastName":"Marszałek","uuid":"88F93A3610E25C643A9BFFEA7A4C0BA623BD8193F4E5FC1CEBAD67725B197D3F7470EF018F43D327D124F9626D81C72DF19FFE99ADCE550CFFDBEA001372ABC3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2121-0704","documentHash":"059df68b-5aba-400a-890a-fe326344f4df"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fbcf","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Kapusta","uuid":"6DAB645BDC2EBEE02DD000181F5F143BD9D7E0423ACCC8A800CA763AD09A0FEA916CE715E99056C761B940E21E587089ED03A23C4A9765611BE7A70B5ED64E47","orcidId":"0000-0002-1197-2361","documentHash":"a4c18afe-c217-4921-96ed-6e1885929b72"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.108560"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9781119761969","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Terraforming Mars","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":582,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a642372467f0269e92d9be","editors":[{"objectId":"6246eba42467f0368b8b0329","name":"Richard","lastName":"Gordon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be48bb4a-1223-4095-9034-9fdf7bb89b4c"},{"objectId":"6246eb932467f0368b8b0319","name":"Joseph","lastName":"Seckbach","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17762825-1d17-4fc2-94a3-bdbc6838dc82"},{"objectId":"6246eb7f2467f0368b8b0302","name":"Martin","lastName":"Beech","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d178e8ed-80d7-4116-8f40-48a455168e44"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6246eb7f2467f0368b8b0302","6246eb932467f0368b8b0319","6246eba42467f0368b8b0329"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book provides a thorough scientific review of how Mars might eventually be colonized, industrialized, and transformed into a world better suited to human habitation.\nThe idea of terraforming Mars has, in recent times, become a topic of intense scientific interest and great public debate. Stimulated in part by the contemporary imperative to begin geoengineering Earth, as a means to combat global climate change, the terraforming of Mars will work to make its presently hostile environment more suitable to life—especially human life. Geoengineering and terraforming, at their core, have the same goal—that is to enhance (or revive) the ability of a specific environment to support human life, society, and industry. The chapters in this text, written by experts in their respective fields, are accordingly in resonance with the important, and ongoing discussions concerning the human stewardship of global climate systems. In this sense, the text is both timely and relevant and will cover issues relating to topics that will only grow in their relevance in future decades. The notion of terraforming Mars is not a new one, as such, and it has long played as the background narrative in many science fiction novels. This book, however, deals exclusively with what is physically possible, and what might conceivably be put into actual practice within the next several human generations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057156522","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb85e","mniswId":"38400","name":"John

The relations between the two cities are more complementary than competitive, commonly indicated by the concept of NY- LON as a trans- oceanic service conglomerate for facilitating economic globalisation. However, world city network analysis \r\nshows London growing its overall servicing connectivity more than New York. This change in the inter- city relation is investigated through focus on the service connectivity and agglomeration capacities of the two cities.

Early analyses of BEF used a modification of the evolutionary Price equation to partition effects of biodiversity into components of complementarity (species richness) and dominance (species composition). However, early experiments and data on BEF did not use information on species traits or relative abundances. Here we extend the Price partition of the total expression of a single trait (such as leaf area) between two communities into five additive components: 1) species richness; 2) average species trait expression; 3) relative abundance; 4) the combined effects of relative abundance and trait expression; 5) absolute abundance. When applied to presence–absence data with no trait variation, the method yields a result that is identical to the original Price partition into two components of complementarity and dominance. When applied to an analysis of relative abundance itself as a trait, our method quantifies the strength of species co-occurrences as a difference in Simpson diversity between the communities. We tested the new partition with artificial data sets and null model comparisons, and applied it to a long-term data set on plant succession. A key finding is that the effects of total abundance might be very important when comparing two communities, and possibly could account for results from previous studies in which complementarity emerged as an important contributor to BEF."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057159684","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/oik.08871","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66052f304097076263351a36","name":"Nicholas J.","lastName":"Gotelli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d9fdca91-319d-4729-8446-aacc516210d9"},{"objectId":"66052f304097076263351a35","name":"Markus Klemens","lastName":"Zaplata","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"455f4c19-4f79-42e9-a2ab-89cd8ddb1e87"},{"objectId":"5e7092bf878c28a04739beae","name":"Werner","lastName":"Ulrich","uuid":"E636AB9F91BD32C290307BD55A2799A7F5ED26EFA2C354F79772F646273634BCAC9980D58EE057CA241A77BBCA8F49822354F1811ED56CE67AD90514F3B82CEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-8715-6619","documentHash":"4c3ad6cf-ed4d-46b5-9a1b-96a3f4c98cb1"}],"doi":"10.1111/oik.08871"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["infection","system biology","coronavirus","pandemic","biological network","host-pathogen interactions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparative host–pathogen interaction analyses of SARS-CoV2 and <I>Aspergillus fumigatus</I>, and pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated aspergillosis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e69","mniswId":"14327","title":"Microbial Ecology","doi":null,"issn":"0095-3628","eissn":"1432-184X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2e580020-cb00-4323-a79b-120fcf083dac"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-11-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ac98eb2467f032cc01eb96","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c3878c28a04739c266","66052ebf409707626335148e","66052ebf409707626335148f","66052ebf4097076263351490","66052ebf4097076263351491"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"COVID-19 caused a global catastrophe with a large number of cases making it one of the major pandemics of the human history. The clinical presentations of the disease are continuously challenging healthcare workers with the variation of pandemic waves and viral variants. Recently, SARS-CoV2 patients have shown increased occurrence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis infection even in the absence of traditional risk factors. The mechanism of COVID-19-associated aspergillosis is not completely understood and therefore, we performed this system biological study in order to identify mechanistic implications of aspergillosis susceptibility in COVID-19 patients and the important targets associated with this disease. We performed host–pathogen interaction (HPI) analysis of SARS-CoV2, and most common COVID-19-associated aspergillosis pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus, using in silico approaches. The known host–pathogen interactions data of SARS-CoV2 was obtained from BIOGRID database. In addition, A. fumigatus host–pathogen interactions were predicted through homology modeling. The human targets interacting with both pathogens were separately analyzed for their involvement in aspergillosis. The aspergillosis human targets were screened from DisGeNet and GeneCards. The aspergillosis targets involved in both HPI were further analyzed for functional overrepresentation analysis using PANTHER. The results indicate that both pathogens interact with a number of aspergillosis targets and altogether they recruit more aspergillosis targets in host–pathogen interaction than alone. Common aspergillosis targets involved in HPI with both SARS-CoV2 and A. fumigatus can indicate strategies for the management of both conditions by modulating these common disease targets."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057159757","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"84","pagesFromTo":"1236-1244","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00248-021-01913-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66052ebf4097076263351491","name":"Mahendra","lastName":"Rai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba99767a-2bc4-4e5a-95c9-39ca5e06d768"},{"objectId":"66052ebf4097076263351490","name":"Sudhir K.","lastName":"Jain","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e56a1d7-e293-4166-af10-cb2a6f58007b"},{"objectId":"66052ebf409707626335148f","name":"Fozia","lastName":"Farooq","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc9c5141-7dbe-4f08-8f8a-30d1bb75931a"},{"objectId":"66052ebf409707626335148e","name":"Abdul Arif","lastName":"Khan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1555def1-e2fc-41b5-9095-d62bdb447849"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c266","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Golińska","uuid":"03E6C857FA6117D98639154539182187A9D1BD52562DF91BB225FD2353AB86606047AF2EEB04894DBF865BE998E6DECF1E7DCAC813EC318C3C4161945ECBF3B4","orcidId":"0000-0001-9154-8191","documentHash":"63e82db8-7da5-4885-b836-958042c544ab"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00248-021-01913-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-0-12-821232-5","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Nutrition and Functional Foods in Boosting Digestion, Metabolism and Immune Health","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":566,"publicationPlace":"Stany Zjednoczone","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61af2aa52467f044f4d2f3c5","editors":[{"objectId":"658426054097076c14c00f43","name":"Sunny E.","lastName":"Ohia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49ea887f-47f9-4e7e-b6f3-dfc580779353"},{"objectId":"658426054097076c14c00f42","name":"Debasis","lastName":"Bagchi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eba96b9a-8092-4a89-b976-af8e61e72d7f"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["658426054097076c14c00f42","658426054097076c14c00f43"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057162222","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":"1","volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7dc","mniswId":"22600","name":"Elsevier","documentHash":"159aa552-a0f4-4616-8a63-8488cd70979f"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://publicum.umed.lodz.pl/info/book/AML8f4a37985d5b4f27a61d6504cb32afc4/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Laser‐Assisted Fabrication of Injectable Nanofibrous Cell Carriers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547974a","mniswId":"18530","title":"Small","doi":null,"issn":"1613-6810","eissn":"1613-6829","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fdba9821-cacc-42ee-82fe-6f0486679750"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ace4e02467f032cc2c02df","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947f878c28a0473be662","5e70947e878c28a0473be5fd","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02ed","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02ee","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02ef","5e709347878c28a0473a6614","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02f0","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02f2","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02f4","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02f5","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02f6","5e70923d878c28a04739241a","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02f7","61ace4e02467f032cc2c02fa","5e70942c878c28a0473b7910","5e70921c878c28a04739016c","5e709213878c28a04738f859","5e70921c878c28a0473900f3"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The use of injectable biomaterials for cell delivery is a rapidly expanding field which may revolutionize the medical treatments by making them less invasive. However, creating desirable cell carriers poses significant challenges to the clinical implementation of cell-based therapeutics. At the same time, no method has been developed to produce injectable microscaffolds (MSs) from electrospun materials. Here the fabrication of injectable electrospun nanofibers is reported on, which retain their fibrous structure to mimic the extracellular matrix. The laser-assisted micro-scaffold fabrication has produced tens of thousands of MSs in a short time. An efficient attachment of cells to the surface and their proliferation is observed, creating cell-populated MSs. The cytocompatibility assays proved their biocompatibility, safety, and potential as cell carriers. Ex vivo results with the use of bone and cartilage tissues proved that NaOH hydrolyzed and chitosan functionalized MSs are compatible with living tissues and readily populated with cells. Injectability studies of MSs showed a high injectability rate, while at the same time, the force needed to eject the load is no higher than 25 N. In the future, the produced MSs may be studied more in-depth as cell carriers in minimally invasive cell therapies and 3D bioprinting

concentrations of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in arable lands exceed the maximum permissible levels due to the excessive use of phosphorus fertilizers and fungicides by farmers. The increasing issues related to the application of agrochemicals have lead to the demand for the implementation of sustainable agricultural approaches. Association of arbuscular mycorrhizae with crop plants is an appropriate strategy due to the potential of these microorganisms to augment the metals tolerance of plants through the immobilization of Cd and Zn in an eco-friendly manner. In the present study, 45 d old Zea mays (var. CoHM6) plants inoculated with AM fungi (Claroideoglomus claroideum) were exposed to 1.95 g Zn Kg−1 soil and 0.45 g Cd Kg−1 soil. The major objective of this study was to determine the metabolic alterations in the leaves and roots of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants exposed to CdCl2 and ZnSO4. Both non AM and AM plants exhibited alterations in the quantity of primary and secondary metabolites on exposure to Zn and Cd toxicity. Moreover, Zn and Cd-induced accumulation of γ-sitosterol reduced the quantity of neophytadiene (a well-known terpenoid) and aided the production of 3-β-acetoxystigmasta-4,6,22-triene in maize leaves. Mycorrhization and heavy metal toxicity induced significant metabolic changes in the roots by producing 4,22-stigmastadiene-3-one, eicosane, 9,19-cyclolanost-24-en-3-ol, pentacosane, oxalic acid, heptadecyl hexyl ester, l-norvaline, and n-(2-methoxyethoxycarbonyl). In addition, the metal-induced variations in leaf and root lignin composition were characterized with the aid of the FTIR technique. Mycorrhization improved the tolerance of maize plants to Cd and Zn toxicity by stabilizing these metal ions in the soil and/or limiting their uptake into the plants, thus ensuring normal metabolic functions of their roots and shoots."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057165155","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"92-113","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10646-021-02492-5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61ace3992467f032cc2b1f85","name":"J.","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"619a4cea-1702-4065-aa18-5461eaaf8a90"},{"objectId":"61ace3992467f032cc2b1f84","name":"J.T.","lastName":"Puthur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a31abd57-baf5-48b7-a45e-4976577f9acf"},{"objectId":"61ace3992467f032cc2b1f83","name":"E.","lastName":"Janeeshma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07f270a8-fe8f-41e1-8f22-d1ee90a4b847"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10646-021-02492-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Czynniki ryzyka","Choroby","Polska"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Risk factors · Production losses · Indirect cost · Poland · Global Burden of Disease"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Production losses due to mortality associated with modifiable health risk factors in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bb2","mniswId":"6180","title":"European Journal of Health Economics","doi":null,"issn":"1618-7598","eissn":"1439-6637","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9b8dc4e7-cc90-4693-8faf-299bc6eae7a6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-07-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61acdb8c2467f032cc2645ab","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c0878c28a04739c03d","661fa1e5409707626368e426"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec>\r\n              <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\r\n              <jats:p>Epidemiological burden of modifiable mortality risk factors is recognized in literature; however, less is known on the economic losses due to a range of such risks.</jats:p>\r\n            </jats:sec><jats:sec>\r\n              <jats:title>Aim</jats:title>\r\n              <jats:p>To estimate production losses (indirect cost) of mortality associated with risk factors as classified in Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study in Poland in years 2000, 2010, and 2017.</jats:p>\r\n            </jats:sec><jats:sec>\r\n              <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\r\n              <jats:p>We relied on the human capital method and societal perspective and used sex-, age-, region-, and risk-specific data on mortality due to modifiable risk factors and a set of socio-economic measures.</jats:p>\r\n            </jats:sec><jats:sec>\r\n              <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\r\n              <jats:p>The production losses due to mortality attributable to all investigated risk factors accounted for 19.6–21.0 billion PLN (Polish zloty; 2017 exchange rate: 1€ = 4.26 PLN) and 1.44–2.45% of gross domestic product, depending on year.

In a meta-analysis stratified by glycosylated hemoglobin levels, early mortality was numerically reduced in each threshold comparison and yielded the highest reductions when less than 5.5% versus greater than 5.5% glycosylated hemoglobin levels were compared (risk ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.84; P = .02). Comparing higher glycosylated hemoglobin threshold values yielded comparable results. Late mortality was reduced with lower levels of glycosylated hemoglobin. Low preoperative glycosylated hemoglobin was associated with the lowest risk of sternal wound infections (risk ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.80; P = .003 and risk ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-0.70; P < .0001) for comparisons of less than 7.5% versus greater than 7.5% and less than 7.0% versus greater than 7.0% glycosylated hemoglobin thresholds, respectively.

Material and Methods: A quantitative and cross-sectional survey was conducted to examine the phenomenon of interest. The study employed a questionnaire survey with an independently designed questionnaire as a research tool. A total of 446 registered nurses taking part in different professional training courses for nurses in January–June 2018 who agreed to participate were included in the study. Results: The findings of this study reveal generally poor self-care strategies and compliance with medical recommendations among Polish nurses. The most frequent health behaviors among the surveyed nurses were caring for personal hygiene and a healthy diet. About 31% of the nurses confirmed supplements use. The most common reasons for taking supplements concerned the prevention of vitamin and mineral deficiencies (77.5%), and boosting of the immune system (49.3%). The most popular supplements included packs of vitamins (57.2%), single vitamin D3 (33.3%) and magnesium (31.2%). The vast majority of participants (79.8%) took some kind of over-the-counter drugs (OTCs) in the last 6 months, most often painkillers and flu medications, relying most frequently on the information included on the drug leaflets. The analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between declared OTC use and age, marital status, years of professional experience and economic status. Overall, 26.9% of the study participants declared the use of both supplements and OTCs, while 16.4% of the participants used neither supplements nor OTCs. Conclusions: Self-care strategies undertaken by nurses should be seen as an essential factor in their positive therapeutic relationship with patients. The ageing nursing workforce should make all of us increasingly aware that their self-care needs will increase as well."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057176169","journalIssue":{"objectId":"624e9b252467f009a40d72ee","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"35","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"277b56cc-b0dd-426d-a55d-462039e097e8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"13-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://ijomeh.eu/Analysis-of-self-care-strategies-among-nurses-in-southern-Poland-a-cross-sectional,135992,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e4ca","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Sternal","uuid":"5AB9AAEDC7A6E71959625E6F75A09E2FE120B7F60A45C0F205AF97BC50BEEFBC04D27A033955BAB1EB94CC411946DC9768A33E97B4DD21FE3979CF156CF28E60","orcidId":"0000-0002-1578-9919","documentHash":"627312f1-67b9-4134-9cad-9d1abe3d195e"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dc76","name":"Beata","lastName":"Babiarczyk","uuid":"D3CFE85AEB47533B931921060F85F047638B00860D1CB8F8FD2BA63D2EE3E50886AFF955282128DBC6F6C7C8A4DD07834B5B8EDF1334015128D638B3FA95E68B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9878-1954","documentHash":"0dc1fd50-04ce-445e-9126-3b839d21b2a4"}],"doi":"10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01802"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

Evaluation of the right ventricle with standard 2D echocardiography is challenging due to its complex geometry and irregular muscle fibers arrangement. Software package TOMTEC 4D RV-Function is an analysis tool which allows assessment of right ventricular function based on volumetric measurements and myocardial deformation. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of this method in fetal echocardiography. The retrospective study was conducted in the high-flow Referral Center for Fetal Cardiology. We recorded 4D echocardiographic sequences of 46 fetuses with normal hearts. Following parameters were calculated: end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF), right ventricle longitudinal free-wall (RVLS free-wall) and septal strain (RVLS septum). Tei index was calculated as a standard measure or RV function for comparison. 4D assessment was feasible in 38 out of 46 fetuses (83%). RV volumetric parameters—EDV, ESV and SV—increased exponentially with gestational age. Functional parameters—RV Tei index, EF and strains—were independent of gestational age. Mean EF was 45.2% (± 6%), RV free-wall strain was − 21.2% and RV septal strain was − 21.5%. There was a statistically significant correlation between septal and free-wall strains (r = 0.51, p = 0.001) as well as between EF and RV free-wall strain (r = − 0.41, p = 0.011). 4D RV assessment is feasible in most fetuses. Its clinical application should be further investigated in larger prospective studies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057192356","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fdd62840970719735dcaf7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"38","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"4f92c970-9ec9-4613-bfda-279dded39af6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"319-329","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10554-021-02407-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61a7dc222467f0352a66a669","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Duliban","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51bd0988-60d4-45e6-b78d-f13a1b701215"},{"objectId":"61a7dc222467f0352a66a668","name":"Monika","lastName":"Pasieczna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73b6c598-2ba2-495b-b4aa-bd2cdeff0f31"},{"objectId":"5e709369878c28a0473a9031","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Grzyb","uuid":"EC6F1BB1A940BDD0C2F29702509A51F1D2E967BC37423F796C96423D35C4F6446B4393BD06F8881859EA9C1B3A62259787DED3D18780147220C5CBD41AE3A81C","orcidId":"0000-0003-4297-0059","documentHash":"2c3ad526-1be5-4e55-86f0-0285ef11c378"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a577d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szymkiewicz-Dangel","uuid":"9D80614A146C374D0DCC3F53B9B9B006F040CE30057CB8DA2182BB75CE248A0039D0658CB4690491739AF37374CC0EE884571F722499AD15D68E0A3DC2C03A0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9155-4572","documentHash":"bee22426-4bf0-4d17-afa3-fdae7e4fef32"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10554-021-02407-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["venous thromboembolism","cancer","apixaban","randomized"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093dd878c28a0473b222c","5e7093dd878c28a0473b2233"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Extended anticoagulant treatment with full- or reduced-dose apixaban in patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism: the API-CAT Study.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479941","mniswId":"19510","title":"Thrombosis and Haemostasis","doi":null,"issn":"0340-6245","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"58e29592-77ad-48e1-b2b2-6690c6f9a93a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-09-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a7dc002467f0352a6695fe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61a7dc1e2467f0352a66a20d","61a7dc1e2467f0352a66a20a","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a25a","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a25b","61a7dc1e2467f0352a66a215","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a25c","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a25d","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a25e","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a25f","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a260","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a261","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a262","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a263","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a264","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a265","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a266","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a267","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a268","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a269","5e7093dd878c28a0473b2233","5e7093dd878c28a0473b222c","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a26a","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a26b","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a26c","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a26d","61a7dc1f2467f0352a66a26e"]},"issue":"(04)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cancer-associated thrombosis (CT) is associated with a high risk of recurrent venous thromboembolic (VTE) events that require extended anticoagulation in patients with active cancer, putting them at risk of bleeding. The aim of the API-CAT study (NCT03692065) is to assess whether a reduced-dose regimen of apixaban (2.5 mg twice daily [bid]) is noninferior to a full-dose regimen of apixaban (5 mg bid) for the prevention of recurrent VTE in patients with active cancer who have completed ≥6 months of anticoagulant therapy for a documented index event of proximal deep-vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. API-CAT is an international, randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, noninferiority trial with blinded adjudication of outcome events. Consecutive patients are randomized to receive apixaban 2.5 or 5 mg bid for 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome is a composite of recurrent symptomatic or incidental VTE during the treatment period. The principal safety endpoint is clinically relevant bleeding, defined as a composite of major bleeding or nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding. Assuming a 12-month incidence of the primary outcome of 4% with apixaban and an upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio <2.0, 1,722 patients will be randomized, assuming an up to 10% loss in total patient-years (β = 80%; α one-sided = 0.025).

Among the cytokines produced by keratinocytes, the stem cell factor (SCF) plays a leading role in stimulating melanogenesis.\r\n\r\nAim: To compare the expression level of stem cell factor (mSCF, pSCF) and the c-Kit receptor in the centre of the vitiligo patch and in the area of healthy skin adjacent to the vitiligo patch.\r\n\r\nMaterial and methods: The research material consisted of skin samples from a vitiligo lesion and from non-lesional skin adjacent to the vitiligo patch. Real Time PCR analysis (Applied Biosystems 7900HT) was performed to determine the expression level of the studied genes.\r\n\r\nResults: The studies showed a statistically significant increase in the amount of mSCF within the vitiligo patch compared to both healthy skin of patients with vitiligo and controls. In patients with vitiligo, c-Kit receptor expression was significantly decreased in the area of the lesional skin compared to the healthy skin of the same patient and the skin of the control group.\r\n\r\nConclusions: The membrane-bound form of the SCF is overexpressed within the vitiligo skin, which may indicate the participation of mSCF in the stimulation of melanogenesis in response to melanocyte damage. Decreased expression of C-Kit receptor by melanocytes in the vitiligo patch disrupts the ligand-receptor interaction and may therefore be related to melanocytes dysfunction and/or loss."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057195213","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"762-767","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Assessment-of-stem-cell-factor-expression-and-its-c-KIT-receptor-in-patients-with-vitiligo,7,45496,1,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630c9c44097076263e7deb2","name":"Waldemar

The described features make it possibleto clearly distinguish food remains deposited by diurnal birds of prey from thoseaccumulated by humans or owls. To identify the most likely species of bird of preythat has accumulated a given assemblage, it is important not only to establish thetaxonomic composition of the assemblage but also to take into account the prey sizepreferred by the various raptors.

Public spaces are the essence of urban life; therefore, the aim of the study was to analyze civic budget records relating to public spaces. The study was conducted in the largest Polish cities. The research involved quantitative and comparative analytical methods. The analysis focused on community involvement and local community needs, represented by a wide array of public space-related project categories. The analyzed cities were ranked according to their civic engagement, and the resulting classification was compared with voter turnout during polls on the proposals adopted as part of the CB process. The results revealed considerable diversity in both civic engagement and local needs, and they could be used to develop guidelines for designing public spaces in the urban planning process. The present findings are also a valuable source of information for local governments in their efforts to improve the functioning, attractiveness and development of user-friendly spaces in citizen-oriented cities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057195597","journalIssue":{"objectId":"648866b74097072fd770698e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"162","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"1572012d-a037-49eb-b9fe-5a756e6228d3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"162","pagesFromTo":"231-252","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/participatory-budgeting-as-a-method-for-improving-public-spaces-/19817202","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e1878c28a0473b278e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pietrzyk","uuid":"7031EA6D4E08DF7C74E00EC4DA04A93D6D08CEB53C10647F4CA2404C313B8771FC69734195A5044B572639CCA5FF05D399B26375C196151BDB8CB746A2AEAE1A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90137529-3a7b-483f-86be-6360a5117505"},{"objectId":"5e709219878c28a04738ff04","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zagroba","uuid":"E9A12BDBFC34B8529DCB226F8B97E705AE1E02B9468A275D879406925E97BD300557F2777762D339A6226DAD8EC5D8528AF47A0320F5B1161B5B34DBC5429940","orcidId":"0000-0003-2096-7297","documentHash":"2e02b896-0ae2-45e3-af9b-c5666d62f616"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fd4b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Szczepańska","uuid":"00CB11876B859915E4A0CBE8C9819BBD9B56ED7C2F63FEED1118374668E8E28EA567CE29E99CD90DF7E51FD2A32DECD443EA9F97497420F4C378C8850111AEE3","orcidId":"0000-0001-5184-0710","documentHash":"062d4ead-fa07-4f6b-9175-fecd7504b42c"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11205-021-02831-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Forest damage","Windstorm","Disturbance","Wind climate","Machine learning","Poland"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709420878c28a0473b6a31"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Modelling and prediction of wind damage in forest ecosystems of the Sudety Mountains, SW Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-02-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a8b80a2467f03813084772","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709420878c28a0473b6a31","61a8b80a2467f03813084775"]},"issue":"art. no. 151972","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Windstorms are one of the most important disturbance factors in European forest ecosystems. An understanding of the major drivers causing observed changes in forests is essential to improve prediction models and as a basis for forest management. In the present study, we use machine learning techniques in combination with data sets on tree properties, bioclimatic and geomorphic conditions, to analyse the level of forest damage by windstorms in the Sudety Mountains over the period 2004–2010. We tested four scenarios under five classification model frameworks: logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, neural networks, and gradient boosted modelling. Gradient boosted modelling and random forest have the best predictive power. Tree volume and age are the most important predictors of windstorm damage; climate and geomorphic variables are less important. Forest damage maps based on forest data from 2020 show lower probabilities of damage compared to the end of 20th and the beginning of 21st century."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057198001","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62162ee82467f04ac0db67ea","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"815","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"87205678-16f4-4307-a462-7ca310e335b7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"815","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721070480","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61a8b80a2467f03813084775","name":"Sandy P.","lastName":"Harrison","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"baae8c5d-7a95-4a84-9171-17a32d122956"},{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6a31","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawlik","uuid":"131618153DCF857EFC305BDD0B059C035F7CE186DD89FA2C3AE74B64F2F739CF2EA4CE31647E277D29334A640230FED2952E396E31026ECF6058520B99AD07E8","orcidId":"0000-0001-9271-3507","documentHash":"e1928eb3-6591-4491-8ff2-6178ba29dc9f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151972"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Phosphate minerals","Apatite","‘Chocolate’ flint","Siliceous rocks","Polish archaeology","East-central Europe"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df17","uid":"bxvEdTB_rZDwTwDCxKD8MAA","uuid":"baafdd5c-15d8-49db-ac14-1067a5fabd1b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Geologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7c27"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","uid":"bJjSI9Xh5XWd377BL7x5oLA","uuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","parentUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","rootUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","name":"Instytut Archeologii i Etnologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4b49"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The use of phosphate minerals for determination of the provenance of flint used by prehistoric communities in East-Central Europe","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547949e","mniswId":"16945","title":"QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL","doi":null,"issn":"1040-6182","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"70efaeaa-f287-45bc-8726-0465c39697f8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61adfd182467f00bc8bf9cc8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709359878c28a0473a7c27","5e709400878c28a0473b4b49"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The area of the Vistula is rich in deposits of several kinds of flint that were widely used in prehistoric times: ‘chocolate’, grey white-spotted, Jurassic-Kraków, striped (banded), and on its eastern borders, Volhynian. The differentiation of these flint types and determination of their characteristic features can be achieved by applying mineralogical studies. Samples of flint from Poland and Ukraine were collected in flint outcrops and deposits used by prehistoric communities from the Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age and analysed to determine distinguishing characteristics. The mineralogical research focused on the accessory minerals present in the flint samples. The most interesting and useful minerals recognized are apatites, and phosphates of rare earth elements.

Thus his elegies, tentatively committed to poetry as a consoling force, place solace for the death of the mother in the familial bond between the poet and his children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057218825","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"77","pagesFromTo":"209-216","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/oli.12328","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473ade67","name":"Wit","lastName":"Pietrzak","uuid":"BA55D75D0AD9EB9F5BAA0C6C14013E400B5620243A3F326AFAC6CAB9158ADD6A58B2AE61F723C26BF3DEEB9AF843FA12634A6E7660E76C688C301E6298BCD972","orcidId":"0000-0003-2231-7036","documentHash":"f8811107-f7ba-4451-9bfb-3de839c449dc"}],"doi":"10.1111/oli.12328"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","uid":"bX41kHc85ivocrWE0ISfROw","uuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","parentUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","rootUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","name":"Politechnika Wrocławska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b78eb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"General hypernetwork framework for creating 3D point clouds","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478010","mniswId":"8006","title":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":null,"issn":"0162-8828","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"71ac5882-8621-4b73-9614-0c17a445e9e2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b212b42467f00d53f21ab8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["653785f7409707139649284b","5e70942c878c28a0473b78eb","653785f7409707139649284c","653785f7409707139649284d"]},"issue":"nr 12","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057221311","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"vol. 44","pagesFromTo":"9995-10008","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"653785f7409707139649284d","name":"Trzciński","lastName":"Tomasz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8dadfd4c-9160-4f57-804c-4b7bed6bfbb6"},{"objectId":"653785f7409707139649284c","name":"Tabor","lastName":"Jacek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49a46fa5-fee1-493e-b568-3b8eaafc495f"},{"objectId":"653785f7409707139649284b","name":"Spurek","lastName":"Przemysław","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5e1df4d-4ac7-4660-ac3a-171763bd8c13"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b78eb","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"ZIĘBA","uuid":"79F12C440498A749E18C5BBF5231CACEDE3FD6D46D0549E3BB2441458BE0F891836C0E66735248C85B10D82436B7B6471979F6968752D684E2B6CE3CAA73D6F6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4217-7712","documentHash":"056499b7-559c-4daf-a747-1feb20e3edb9"}],"doi":"10.1109/tpami.2021.3131131"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Tomato cultivars","Seed textures","Image processing","Discrimination performance"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

The highest results were observed for models built based on sets of textures selected individually from color channels R, L and X and sets of textures selected from all color channels. In all cases, the tomato seeds ‘Green Zebra’ and ‘Ożarowski’ were discriminated with the highest average accuracy equal to 97% for the Multilayer Perceptron classifier and 96.25% for Random Forest for color channel R, 95.25% (Multilayer Perceptron) and 95% (Random Forest) for color channel L, 93% (Multilayer Perceptron) and 95% (Random Forest) for color channel X, 99.75% (Multilayer Perceptron) and 99.5% (Random Forest) for a set of textures selected from all color channels (R, G, B, L, a, b, X, Y, X). The highest average accuracies for other pairs of cultivars reached 98.25% for ‘Ożarowski’ vs. Sacher F1, 95.75% for ‘Pineapple’ vs. Sandoline F1, 97.5% for ‘Green Zebra’ vs. Sandoline F1, 97.25% for Sacher F1 vs. Sandoline F1 for models built based on textures selected from all color channels. The obtained results may be used in practice for the identification of cultivar of tomato seeds. The developed models allow to distinguish the tomato seed cultivars in an objective and fast way using digital image processing. The results confirmed the usefulness of texture parameters of the outer surface of tomato seeds for classification purposes. The discriminative models allow to obtain a very high probability and may be applied to authenticate and detect seed

The technological progress currently gives many diagnostic possibilities, however, pulmonary function testing in children remains problematic.\nObjectives: Our study aimed to correlate the results of impulse oscillometry (IOS) with those of multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW) in our paediatric CF population. We also compared those parameters between the groups with and without spirometric features of obturation.\nMethods: We collected 150 pulmonary function test sets including spirometry, IOS and MBNW carried out in CF patients aged 12.08±3.85 [6-18]. The study group was divided into two subgroups: IA (without obturation) and IB (with obturation). We also compared Sacin, Scond and oscillometry parameters of 20 patients aged 14-18 years who reached the appropriate tidal volume (VT) during MBNW.\nResults: Statistical analysis showed a negative correlation between lung clearance index (LCI) and MEF25 z-score, MEF50 z-score (rSpearman=-0.61; rSpearman=-0.56;). Comparison of subgroups IA (n=102) and IB (n=48) indicated a statistically significant difference in LCI (p <0.001) and FEV1z-score (p <0.001), FEV1% pred (p <0.001), MEF25z-score (p <0.001) ), MEF50 z-score (p <0.001), MEF75 z-score (p <0.001), R5% pred (p <0.05) and R20% pred (p <0.01). LCI higher than 7.91 was found in 75.33% of the study group, in subgroup IB – 91.67% and IA – 67.6%, respectively.\nConclusions: LCI derived from MBNW may be a better tool than IOS for assessing pulmonary function in CF patients, particularly those who cannot perform spirometry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057224784","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e57ce22467f0034f10e582","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"9","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"1085ad31-7e0d-4027-9239-f565dcbd8b85"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2021.692949/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e0878c28a0473c5d44","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Walicka-Serzysko","uuid":"8A6A0F9854BF4D646A86459E1BF18FF3B323C26D48068FB83491DAA9FE82A430D97105535C9071D856963C3990554C34D470F77F415BDDD737A51B30E480D11B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6496-8737","documentHash":"743c47b7-31c1-4f03-94dc-79efc8e12cfd"},{"objectId":"5e7094e0878c28a0473c5d43","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Postek","uuid":"7CD1AF07CA7C011EB528FD4541F545736B5121B626F570B8947C6EB00C97CD731032BB2EECE70062A83A2A59B48B485BCA4BD45D1D239F5070633FEAA113A262","orcidId":"0000-0002-1678-3316","documentHash":"ad04800c-037c-4fd5-a3c8-a8c049650f4b"},{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c3692","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Milczewska","uuid":"5F8CD69061392ED5C02D22F012AE3C397F0502AB61E957696EB1027218CA0E8B17444BB256AB9628CACC7AF9AFD7988E8DDE7A031DD5D435B1D50B3558272F1C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3365-9963","documentHash":"afd29d65-f841-470e-81dc-6d7023786e9d"},{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b44b7","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Sands","uuid":"E08F64638DB6F24F619F3826D841E36928C0C2ABB1585955BEA63ED26C4BE7690AA42599E801A5C7BDD087C1741BED7CB3202D281297DB36E5A6004A0283D1C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4601-5158","documentHash":"3a2b11fe-b760-4511-ba2d-217e14f3a24c"}],"doi":"10.3389/fped.2021.692949"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1NzIyNDc4NA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
