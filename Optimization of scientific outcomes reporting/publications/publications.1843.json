However, DRM technology is still an industrially immature process due to the lack of stable and active catalyst. Therefore, the search for new catalytic materials is of great research interest. Recently, MAX and MXenes materials are increasingly being tested as potential materials for catalytic processes including dry reforming of hydrocarbons. However, transition metal carbides may be deactivated under DRM conditions due to phase transition caused by an oxidation process. The combining of the MAX/MXene materials with nickel phase may be beneficial for to improve catalytic activity and stability. In this view, we report preparation and characterization of nickel-modified V2CTx/V2AlC materials. The Ni-V2CTx/V2AlC catalysts were prepared using HF-etching followed by impregnation/precipitation method. The effect of preparation route on morphology and catalytic activity was investigated. The properties of fresh and spent catalysts were evaluated using XRD, XPS, MP-AES, SEM, BET surface area, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, TG/DTG and TEM techniques. Catalytic activity was investigated in the DRM process at 800 °C and 1 bar. It was found that the V2CTx/V2AlC- based materials undergo phase transition to vanadium oxide V2O3, vanadium carbide V8C7 and aluminium oxide. The presence of nickel was crucial for the catalyst activity of V2CTx/V2AlC- based catalysis. The catalytic activity was different and related to the preparation procedure resulting in dissimilar nickel-phase morphology and intercalation of sodium ions. It was found that the distribution of nickel phase and presence of alkali ions determined catalysts’ activity and stability. The highest activity and stability in DRM process was observed for Ni-V2CTx/V2AlC_IMP catalysts obtained using only impregnation method without precipitation agents. For the catalysts nickel phase was distributed uniformly forming needle-like structures. The CO2 and CH4 conversions during 20 h-test were in the range of 90-93% and 90-80%, respectively. The molar ration of H2 to CO in outlet stream fluctuated from 1.05 in the first hour of the process to 0.95 after 20 h of the DRM. The activity and stability of Ni-V2CTx/V2AlC_IMP catalyst was higher compared to unmodified V2CTx/V2AlC, unetched V2AlC and Ni-SiO2."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219095","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"48","pagesFromTo":"10922-10940","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d876fdbe831a38c31df8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Rogala","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da8af54a-ae2f-4c7c-a3c7-d4c535f61392"},{"objectId":"6777d876fdbe831a38c31df7","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Kościelska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2b2e9a6-8efa-4722-9841-ffd9acfeb8e6"},{"objectId":"6777d876fdbe831a38c31df6","name":"Michał","lastName":"Maciejewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"09385fde-daa1-4c8f-ace5-4f6f66531cd9"},{"objectId":"6777d876fdbe831a38c31df5","name":"Bartłomiej Michał","lastName":"Cieślik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f456f1a5-36f4-418c-82ed-8368da5f035b"},{"objectId":"6777d876fdbe831a38c31df4","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Łapiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cf2660e-3f43-4026-a0d7-14a63186e0b8"},{"objectId":"6777d876fdbe831a38c31df3","name":"Jakub ","lastName":"Karczewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c44c4039-edc2-4b01-b3cd-e2b0bcc89910"},{"objectId":"6777d876fdbe831a38c31df2","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Wysocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ffa11ad-ec13-4a6f-b557-bd162e0f9d52"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b9596","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gołąbiewska","uuid":"063483BDECF928846115219C1E9C87E9956446687727E981C3F03378E79975556576A71B538E976D2F520150151CF041CC0836E079D5F11C308DC14D83092450","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aec023e2-c52c-4270-a99a-a7ca9495aeac"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.12.109"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67641437fdbe837ab13d53c6","doi":null,"title":"Odporność państwa, społeczeństwa i gospodarki na zagrożenia","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-8263-513-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://ksiegarnia.akademia.mil.pl","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"1f1ab963-edee-4d5e-b27d-7aa8858677c9","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb78a","mniswId":"13100","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","documentHash":"c4f363fb-9d53-41e0-ab80-06f2f03c63d0"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6b","uid":"bNWXY3ewtn9TlYIbns6NsZQ","uuid":"9e04afdc-5fef-43e3-a5d0-6050e5afbe7f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6b","parentUuid":"9e04afdc-5fef-43e3-a5d0-6050e5afbe7f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6b","rootUuid":"9e04afdc-5fef-43e3-a5d0-6050e5afbe7f","name":"Państwowa Akademia Nauk Stosowanych im.

For composites prepared by calcination, the photocatalytic activity increased with decreasing NTU-9 content as a result of the formation of TiO2 from the MOFs. The best photocatalytic performance (65% of toluene was photodegraded after 60 min) was achieved by the NTU-9/C3N4 sample prepared via the solvothermal method and containing 15 wt% MOF, which can be attributed to the appropriate amount and stable combination of composite components, efficient charge separation, and enhanced visible-light absorption ability.

In this case, a 10-year-old patient was diagnosed with fibrous dysplasia of the ethmoid sinus at an early age.

A CT scan revealed an expansive proliferative lesion, likely from the frontal or ethmoid bone, protruding into the nasal cavity, ethmoid sinus, and right orbit. The tumor causes bone defects in the area of the nasal bone, leading to fluid retention in the peripheral parts of the right maxillary sinus. The patient’s parents decided not to undergo surgery to remove the diseased tissue and reconstruct the area, as it would be very extensive, risky, and disfiguring. The patient is being treated conservatively with an MRI, with a contrast performed approximately every six months and infusions of bisphosphonates. Despite the lesion’s size, the patient does not experience pain characteristic of dysplasia, and functions typically. Fibrous dysplasia of bone is a rare condition that presents with the most visually apparent manifestations, often mistaken for other bone conditions. Advanced diagnostic tools, like CT and MRI, are used to identify conditions affecting the ethmoid sinus more frequently. However, diagnostic errors often occur in imaging studies, leading to confusion. The most common period for clinical manifestations and diagnosis is around 10 years of age. The preferred approach in managing fibrous dysplasia involves symptomatic treatment, which can alleviate airway obstruction, restore normal globe position and visual function, and address physical deformities. Surgical intervention is recommended only for patients with severe functional impairment, progressive deformities, or malignant transformation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219111","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"art.45 [7 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/61/1/45","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6776b656fdbe831a38ba3bef","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Resler","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da0c7ef6-4872-4cd9-847c-75b6f3d70a8d"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8f19","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Resler","uuid":"D70BDA13D5A9EFFACE7E9973304382D480F354D57925461D48A422D731F3C397E992FAF32B217A82D3FEA1F6E60E45194A881FD642F19C233E8048DC42194EAA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1399-5524","documentHash":"9cae3075-40db-4c5a-837e-4ff1840a5aa7"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b83","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Zatoński","uuid":"B47DE6E5AEBE1572AA1C3A33B05C3E3148E2CB436346D9A2BAE0AA1E53BF4A20687EEB1E295F59D3FDB90D245855166290529EEB1970982500672E6C92D61A3F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3043-4806","documentHash":"deab761d-a906-4888-8c1d-21d123156631"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a14d7","name":"Monika","lastName":"Morawska-Kochman","uuid":"580B92B2FDEB7FD934689DA01F14103B4BDD4FCEF1B41EAD10EC7C01DBB2C4DDF39FBF2798B825A612760701CD27CAE80F4DBF3F2EE59D6B463EDCC1A0A377F4","orcidId":"0000-0001-6551-7535","documentHash":"89dd1dd9-6190-42e1-a248-adffdf34cffb"}],"doi":"10.3390/medicina61010045"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["contaminants of emerging concern","photocatalytic oxidation","photocatalytic ozonation","ecotoxicity","doping TiO2"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"PPCPs abatement using TiO2-based catalysts by photocatalytic oxidation and ozonation: the effect of nitrogen and cerium loads on the degradation performance and toxicity impact","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657c5d8d4097076c14ab0adf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b3f","6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b40","6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b41","6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b42","6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b43","6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b44"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) have been consumed in great extension and most of these are found in water bodies, owing to the inefficiency of conventional wastewater treatments. To face against these recalcitrant contaminants, advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis and ozonation have been studied. Moreover, the combination of these technologies can improve the degradation of PPCPs, reducing the ozone consumption and the effluent toxicity with the presence of photocatalysts. In particular, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of different N and Ce loads in co-doping TiO2 catalysts on the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation and photocatalytic ozonation for PPCPs abatement, as well as on the resultant toxicity to aquatic species. Different radiation sources (UVA and solar radiation) were considered for the photocatalytic oxidation. A mixture of 5 PPCPs: paracetamol, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, methylparaben and propylparaben was used as a model synthetic effluent. Photocatalysis showed a low efficiency on the PPCPs removal (<20 %), which was not affected by the radiation source. In general, the tested catalysts showed no or low added-value for reducing the toxicity of the synthetic effluent. Concerning photocatalytic ozonation, the lowest N amount (2.5 % w/w) promoted the best results for PPCPs removal, achieving values up to 100 % with significant reduction of ozone dose compared to photolytic ozonation. In general, photocatalytic ozonation showed better ecotoxicological performance than single photocatalysis. Compared to single photolytic ozonation, a benefitial effect was observed for two aquatic species, using a specific catalyst. This catalyst, prepared by doping TiO2 with 2.5 % w/w N and 1.2 % w/w Ce, showed to be the most promisong one, with potential to be used in photocatalytic ozonation. Hence, this work highlights the potential role of N and Ce co-doped TiO2-based catalysts in photocatalytic ozonation for wastewater treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219124","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"887","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b44","name":"João","lastName":"Gomes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbe87d3e-63a9-43fb-92ca-5b4c10131718"},{"objectId":"6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b43","name":"Joana L.","lastName":"Pereira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56d2bb16-8f1e-4155-b16b-ae59577ff94e"},{"objectId":"6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b42","name":"Carla","lastName":"Cotas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd272f43-0dd7-4d0c-94ef-f60a0228dd5a"},{"objectId":"6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b41","name":"Mariana","lastName":"Alvim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0144b029-3d78-4cd0-b335-fcf0544fab92"},{"objectId":"6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b40","name":"Fátima","lastName":"Jesus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b65a1e93-590c-46b4-b243-548824e34a06"},{"objectId":"6777d7e2fdbe831a38c30b3f","name":"Eva","lastName":"Domingues","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"110574e7-79b9-4479-9677-02f7fb93677d"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Mazierski","uuid":"A09D3289B3EBAAB858589FE7FCAEC79094A621B893156BB9EC699995BBDDCB7EBB90B01E7344D3F3FF8FF125A2D612AC988F25F8F5EA94186B8051B00684CAA6","orcidId":"0000-0002-8674-0151","documentHash":"b42e86b1-4768-416f-a0cf-bee63e7faaa6"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164000"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["catalytic ozonation membrane","density functional theory","FT-ICR-MS","membrane fouling","N-doped grapheme"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924b878c28a047393204","5e7092b2878c28a04739aed8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Molecular levels unveil the membrane fouling mitigation mechanism of a superpotent N-rGO catalytic ozonation membrane: Interfacial catalytic reaction pathway and induced EfOM transformation reactions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477116","mniswId":"1445","title":"Applied Catalysis B: Environmental","doi":null,"issn":"0926-3373","eissn":"1873-3883","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8989031a-d489-4876-af3c-bcc700196dce"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6572d2184097071b8e6dd456","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924b878c28a047393204","5e7092b2878c28a04739aed8","6777d91efdbe831a38c334f7","6777d91efdbe831a38c334f8","6777d91efdbe831a38c334f9","6777d91efdbe831a38c334fa","6777d91efdbe831a38c334fb","6777d91efdbe831a38c334fc","6777d91efdbe831a38c334fd","6777d91efdbe831a38c334fe","6777d91efdbe831a38c334ff","6777d91efdbe831a38c33500","6777d91efdbe831a38c33501","6777d91efdbe831a38c33502","6777d91efdbe831a38c33503"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigated the membrane fouling self-cleaning of N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO)-tailored ceramic membrane with ozone (N-rGO-CM-O/F) at the molecular level.

This made humic acid-like substances blocking membrane pores to be sufficiently and preferentially removed in N-rGO-CM-O/F by 18-types reactions of catalytic ozonation. Conversely, CM-O/F preferentially removed protein-like substances that formed the cake layer.

If left untreated, it can cause serious complications and significantly shortens the life time. DM is one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease (uremia) worldwide. Early diagnosis is a prerequisite for successful treatment, preferably before the first symptoms appear. In this paper, we describe the optimization and synthesis of the internally quenched fluorescent substrate disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10). Using combinatorial chemistry methods with iterative deconvolution, the substrate specificity of the enzyme in non-primed and primed positions was determined. We used the ABZ-Lys-Ile-Ile-Asn-Leu-Lys-Arg-Tyr(3-NO2)–NH2 peptide to study ADAM10 activity in urine samples collected from patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, compared to urine samples from healthy volunteers.

In this field,  membrane distillation (MD), which is a thermally driven  membrane process, has been proposed as an alternative for the  separation and concentration of liquid food items. In  principle, MD can separate water and volatile compounds from  aqueous feed solutions through a permeate that passes across  microporous hydrophobic membranes. The separation via MD is  thanks to the vapor pressure difference on both membrane  sides. In this review, we analyzed the ongoing experimental  efforts aimed to recover and purify food bioactive compounds  from the concentration of fruit juices and extracts using MD.  Also, the processing of dairy products, concentration of food  by-products, and ethanol production and its removal from  beverages using MD have been reviewed.

Migration and capture of active electrons are central to catalytic ozonation reactions, which was not studied or reviewed more clearly. Based on this perspective, the catalytic ozonation potential of 2D-LCMs synthesized by numerous methods is firstly contrasted to guide the design of subsequent carbon based-catalysts, and not limited to 2D-LCMs. Matching ROS to active sites is a key step in understanding the catalytic mechanism. The structure-activity relationships between reported numerous active sites and ROS evolution is then constructed. Result showed that radical dotOH could be produced by -OH, -C=O, -COOH groups, defective sites, immobilized metal atoms, doped heteroatoms and photo-induced electrons; and radical dotO2− could be produced by -OH groups and sp2-bonded carbon. The normalized model further be used to visually compare the contribution degree of various regulatory methods to performance improvement. More importantly, this review calls for 2D-LCMs-based catalytic ozonation to be studied without circumventing the issue of structural stability, which would lead to many proposals of catalysts and its involved catalytic reaction mechanism being meaningless."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219156","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"832","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d91ffdbe831a38c33533","name":"Amir","lastName":"Ikhlaq","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a90ca65-9060-4be9-9bf0-8b71532a1982"},{"objectId":"6777d91ffdbe831a38c33532","name":"Fei","lastName":"Qi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2bf164f5-ae7e-476a-9a26-83214acc9791"},{"objectId":"6777d91ffdbe831a38c33531","name":"Bingbing","lastName":"Xu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f4de69d-5a11-4b96-9ccc-e744f4456504"},{"objectId":"6777d91ffdbe831a38c33530","name":"Zhonglin","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eea19278-c0a9-42d2-8465-b4686315a803"},{"objectId":"6777d91ffdbe831a38c3352f","name":"Didier","lastName":"Robert","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0fd5b9e1-e711-490b-ae97-5c86c526847c"},{"objectId":"6777d91ffdbe831a38c3352e","name":"Wei","lastName":"Chu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6eaffe2f-793a-4964-b43d-485c96c0d560"},{"objectId":"6777d91ffdbe831a38c3352d","name":"Fernando

In order to choose the representative conformations, we combined MD simulations with a clustering procedure to identify low energy geometries for which ADEs and VDEs were computed at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) level. Our results demonstrate that the assumed approach leads to sound geometries and energetics of the studied microsolvates since the calculated ADEs and VDEs are in pretty good agreement with the experimental characteristics.

Thus, long-term marine environmental monitoring needs a precise analytical method for determining isotopes in sediment and soil samples. Because 241Am is the first decay product of 241Pu, its activity in the environment will grow during the next 50 years. This study aims to compare and evaluate different sequential radiochemical methods for 241Am analysis, focusing on their precision and accuracy, to establish a more rapid, refined and reliable approach for environmental monitoring. Four radiochemical methods for 241Am determination in soil and marine sediment samples were compared using alpha-particle spectrometry. This sensitive technique plays a key role in quantifying low-level radioactive contaminants in sediment and soil samples. The procedure was optimised using reference materials prepared by IAEA: sediment (IAEA-300, IAEA-384 and IAEA-385) and soil (IAEA-327 and IAEA-375), and digestion, radiochemical separation, and purification on anion exchange resin (AG 1X8) and chromatographic resins (UTEVA, TRU) were used. The effectiveness of the Ca-oxalate precipitation method for iron removal was also evaluated. We used microcoprecipitation on neodymium fluoride (NdF3) to prepare measurement sources. As a significant outcome, we suggested the potential exclusion of co-precipitation (method D) in the determination of the 241Am isotope in sediment and soil samples. This recommendation aligns with our goal of developing a precise sequential radiochemical method for alpha-particle spectrometry. Our approach offers a valuable and optimised tool for monitoring the environmental impact of nuclear activities and accidents, particularly in marine ecosystems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219169","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"192","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d7cbfdbe831a38c307cb","name":"Ljudmila","lastName":"Benedik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3015a535-a4bf-4605-bc0a-f7331cb93100"},{"objectId":"6777d7cbfdbe831a38c307ca","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Block-Łaszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0221bf2d-8768-464b-821a-74cdfc7589e3"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739320b","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Strumińska-Parulska","uuid":"18582184A7A278191B136E32EF58032B118A0B14CD3A84637338E57C2BF576E650B14392F038D58EA78C7DA14DA279A9CD380E7AD4D5F2B5128FF449B83A323E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7900-6517","documentHash":"349a0389-bb07-489c-98e8-6d0c9f0eb256"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106243"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ocean gyres","Kazdan and Warner criteria","elliptic PDE on the sphere","exponential non-linearity","scalar curvature","existence of solutions of PDEs"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b9878c28a04739b786"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Geophysics and Stuart vortices on a sphere meet differential geometry","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477748","mniswId":"4103","title":"Communications on Pure and Applied Analysis","doi":null,"issn":"1534-0392","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"702c7434-9aef-47ab-b79f-f4916ee1f41d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657327fa4097071b8e700528","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b9878c28a04739b786"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We prove new existence criteria relevant for the non-linear elliptic PDE of the form ∆S2u = C−heu, considered on a two dimensional sphere S2, in the parameter regime 2≤C<4.

This study aims to investigate the interrelationships between frailty, cognitive impairment, and depression in older adults with HF, specifically focusing on how the physical and neuropsychiatric dimensions of frailty contribute to cognitive decline. Methods: This study included 250 patients aged 60 years or older, diagnosed with HF and hospitalized for acute decompensated HF. The patients were assessed using standardized protocols for frailty, cognitive function, and depression. The frailty was evaluated using Fried’s phenotype criteria, cognitive function with MMSE and MoCA, and depression and anxiety with HADS and PHQ-9. Statistical analyses included univariable and multivariable linear regression to identify the predictors of frailty. Results: Of the 250 patients, 151 (60.4%) were identified as frail. The frail patients were older (mean age 73.58 ± 6.80 years) compared to the non-frail patients (mean age 70.39 ± 6.16 years, p = 0.0002). Significant differences were observed in the NYHA class, length of the hospital stay, and prevalence of diabetes mellitus. The frail patients had worse cognitive (MMSE: 27.39 ± 2.12 vs. 28.13 ± 1.72, p = 0.004; MoCA: 24.68 ± 3.65 vs. 25.64 ± 3.98, p = 0.050) and psychological outcomes (higher prevalence of marked depression based on HADS categories: 8.61% vs. 1.01%, p = 0.021; and PHQ-9 categories: severe depression: 2.65% vs. 1.01%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Age, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and anxiety were identified as independent predictors of frailty in the patients with heart failure. Depression, cognitive dysfunction, and the length of the hospital stay showed significant differences between the frail and non-frail patients in the group comparisons but were not independent predictors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219173","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art.7345 [13 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/23/7345","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6776b68bfdbe831a38ba3e98","name":"Quin E.","lastName":"Denfeld","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84beb251-5841-4d79-8505-f8109c817287"},{"objectId":"6776b68bfdbe831a38ba3e97","name":"Christopher S.","lastName":"Lee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc340a3e-dd13-4958-99a9-55c6ede9dc3f"},{"objectId":"6776b68bfdbe831a38ba3e96","name":"Bernadetta","lastName":"Żółkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d56ca055-b438-4f88-a370-0ae703d200d2"},{"objectId":"6178b9a97523400564d430d8","name":"Maria","lastName":"Jędrzejczyk","uuid":"30088485EBFDAABD3A1B54C0F8DBD5D4FAE6E5ECB567F38173F50E235E14D5D9F8ECA10EAE6B6044F750E8C7E0F0EC0F72423115EE4F25121B95DAB86F182E9D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7208-3509","documentHash":"403013c6-a236-49e2-9cce-6549dfce1a02"},{"objectId":"5e7094c7878c28a0473c383d","name":"Michał","lastName":"Czapla","uuid":"F241A3A93C9297B0CC7621A3FB52E7F10530B0515BFD46FE96AD938D40C1748DCED47E8AE10D5CF004F6434A5B908E4A45CFB50223EFFE0F306589A45A1A64F8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4245-5420","documentHash":"73c1748c-d090-491c-9f8a-2c21149fb49e"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af624","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Diakowska","uuid":"10DE7A483B23961D5950E05784B47EF1615BFB4FB85E2485AC31985466CD77C4EAE0666BA40EE8AF5355FA457BD2E87B96F9FE2303CF87F885A95800D3D2CFA0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1377-5601","documentHash":"4e378276-b99e-4254-bd6f-435108368bee"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa12d","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Lisiak","uuid":"FFEB8127A42A3C783E54A632B5443A26C751519F4B87A79ACB349D88B11AC7B37BF60B8C1FED9D729F047DEB7B1CCE8DD3BFE6C040A7F3C40D1CC29F8D86EBE6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4038-7492","documentHash":"3a38b4b6-2865-4ef3-92c7-5262ce895640"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1ae1","name":"Izabella","lastName":"Uchmanowicz","uuid":"211CD83378E70AE49C511D80E5EB3C2443B5DDAA743ABA27E86AC1A53C36C36762757E03D23046BCE0EE016488EF4D52333CE89C10996CA090DEF7E0DF9E7BB4","orcidId":"0000-0001-5452-0210","documentHash":"23bc999d-ab0f-486b-9c1d-7bab9caa1f5a"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a11ff","name":"Marta","lastName":"Wleklik","uuid":"58C26A6807BDAC5CFE95789889D316D2B87800829FAB2267FA1097C23C9061F4934F54B160DDD23A975AE295B2BB754132358520BA741943BCBA7E3EB9F9C7B9","orcidId":"0000-0001-9574-4448","documentHash":"64814271-d94d-4277-9faa-3afad5df1474"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm13237345"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["East/West","Europe","communicating","border traffic","infrastructures and media"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-3-11-073817-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Cold War Europe: a space of communication","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":265,"publicationPlace":"Berlin ;

Considered events need to be biologically plausible, regulatory relevant, and crucial for the examination of occurrence of adverse outcomes. The promising advantages of using high-throughout-based omics data are highlighted. Furthermore, the application of 3D in vitro models and nano genome atlases to study nanoparticle toxicity is briefly summarized. Additionally, the challenges related to the extrapolation of in vitro doses into in vivo-relevant responses are presented.

Biofouling phenomenon signatures on artificial solid surfaces, deployed in the shallow Baltic Sea waters (Gulf of Gdańsk, Poland) for a specific period of time, were determined over a three-year period using improved photoacoustic spectroscopy apparatus based on closed cell geometry. Selected chemical parameters (oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations) and biological productivity (primary production and Chlorophyll a; hereinafter abbreviated as Chl a) of the water body were obtained from the SatBałtyk System platform (http://satbaltyk.iopan.gda.pl) and used as comprehensive data. As a result, close cross-correlations between photosynthetic energy storage and PAS amplitude spectra and the seawater chemical parameters were demonstrated. As found, ES was negatively correlated with concentrations of biogenic elements (correlation coefficient R given in brackets): O (–0.67), P (–0.81), N (–0.76), and positively correlated with concentrations of Chl a (0.82) and primary production (0.39). As periphyton is believed to respond dynamically to water quality and environmental stresses, its photosynthetic system features can be used as novel, modern and robust indicators in marine bioassessment, in addition to traditional trophic state indices based on chemical analysis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219190","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"65","pagesFromTo":"194-201","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777c3c9fdbe831a38c25ccb","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Grzegorczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fdbd51d-e21a-4b5b-85c8-aaf9e1e042f4"},{"objectId":"6777c3c9fdbe831a38c25cca","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Boniewicz-Szmyt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1fcf865f-f0c7-4b6a-ba4d-6c02014c9783"},{"objectId":"5e709418878c28a0473b6166","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Rochowski","uuid":"677B5487217BFADB8CF26F1BDA31168D2100719AA5FAAC9F4CEA506FE38365E2FD58F1DA45F1862AE2C3211B5CC40A5FD676586CE8FB29CD9B981F627A038E2B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9433-2166","documentHash":"af64889a-7ed9-46e2-ae11-4d677e473232"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931d0","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Pogorzelski","uuid":"481A27EAE1B176513AF234F9A6B8DDFAE7B0859E9AF73F6257533CEA4C9C9D7A5EE8D8F177CB354A1B47CAD260E3DF4C4E9638EA56FBC76A0F8EFF3A8AC783A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5618-7941","documentHash":"16a38224-d5c3-4a3f-b788-37d50734bb13"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2022.04.004"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["abatacept","primary immune regulatory disorder","CTLA-4","belatacept","Allogeneic HSCT"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Primary end points were overall survival (OS) and disease- and chronic graft-versus-host disease-free survival (DFS). Secondary end point was immunologic outcome assessed by immune dysregulation disease activity (IDDA) score.\n\nResults: Forty patients were included over a 25-year period. Before HSCT, 60% received CTLA-4-Ig, and median (range) IDDA score was 23.3 (3.9-84.0). Median (range) age at HSCT was 14.2 (1.3-56.0) years. Patients received peripheral blood stem cell (58%) or marrow (43%) from a matched unrelated donor (75%), mismatched unrelated donor (12.5%), or matched family donor (12.5%). Median (range) follow-up was 3 (0.6-15) years, and 3-year OS was 76.7% (58-87%) and DFS was 74.4% (54.9-86.0%). At latest follow-up, disease of 28 of 30 surviving patients was in disease-free remission with median IDDA reduction of 16. Probability of OS and DFS was greater in patients with lower disease activity before HSCT (IDDA < 23, P = .002 and P = .006, respectively). CTLA-4-Ig receipt did not influence OS or DFS. Cause of death was transplant related in 7 of 8 patients.\n\nConclusion: HSCT is an effective therapy to prevent ongoing disease progression and morbidity, with improving survival rates over time and in patients with lower pre-HSCT disease activity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219195","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"154","pagesFromTo":"1534-1544","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674924009035","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6776b673fdbe831a38ba3da1","name":"Mary

Recent advances in analytical techniques provide the opportunity to detect a wide range of contaminants in water that would not be detected by traditional targeted analysis (TA) methods. These advanced techniques include the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) or tandem HRMS in suspect screening analysis (SSA) or non-target analysis (NTA). This review presents the advances of the last five years for SSA and NTA of polar emerging contaminants (ECs) in various matrices, including drinking water, surface water, wastewater, and soil/sediment. We discuss all steps in the analytical procedure, including novel sampling and extraction approaches, GC or LC-HRMS analysis, (pre)data processing, evaluation, and reporting. We also identify challenges and future trends in SSA and NTA monitoring of polar ECs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219215","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"154","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2022.116671","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bcc","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Godlewska","uuid":"1088C3BAEE2172B90195B47947E94E23920DF6BD8F2BE5D639DFA990EC712ACE5404706CBC91AC11C78433417C8F55BACB16AC85F6442DBF42D0062F6EF792B8","orcidId":"0000-0003-1318-2248","documentHash":"2b08a9b9-0a34-40d3-8e01-538012ebefe8"},{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b1443","name":"Magda","lastName":"Caban","uuid":"3A4AA2A083920B5A2B0B1ADA5F526E06D289257CFBF3DB65EB5F3402846AA1FB23F52D1FCB67013DA7696139A79349244CAAA9984E81DD447145F3B9D20E53BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8040-5862","documentHash":"4b533442-142a-47f7-ba96-547e1c3f7fff"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Białk-Bielińska","uuid":"9E8640A84BE9C2C8F6ECE5DC189616D83275B51761F908B5D8E28A506342BC6B9E0E419EA45044698C596073F9588A5A8E6FB50837AD4C2D797ED8C5DA9DE62C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8304991e-5722-4b70-8065-b3f551596db8"},{"objectId":"5e709299878c28a047398c53","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Lis","uuid":"DE44D6AC191C09FDB9C996C2291B9CC45BBED2D92F437F321E12EE15DDE9E3C571E5AD25F88E6702AFD74E1721C779B950A9DCAB57E7F62C0FBC293F5C543729","orcidId":"0000-0001-9580-6098","documentHash":"31724210-a0f2-47eb-8a7f-0176d9e53f30"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739320a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Stepnowski","uuid":"6E1315A45E3C8D09C3EE267052AAD1C60A569A460874126B8373B3B6D2F586BD5705BEA16397F24679657E1320E2E894A863F6233606B6B575C78426A27C7BB0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ecfa3c4-0c71-4746-9745-712eaf025413"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a047393208","name":"Monika","lastName":"Paszkiewicz","uuid":"BFF2B801AF2DD72591E9BEA07EF7155547FA7F610516734400FB73FF4ED8B1ED76CBA0C4A98FEE9955E3125972CF541138C6FED3486487FF5E4866FDEEB6C430","orcidId":"0000-0002-3163-145X","documentHash":"fa251294-9f05-4042-a63f-d43049af9e1b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.trac.2022.116671"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bimetallic photocatalyst","photocatalytic ozonation","qPCR analyses","antibiotic resistance genes","rutile"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bda"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Enhancement of photocatalytic-based processes by mono- and bimetallic (CuPd) rutile loaded nanoparticles for antibiotic resistance genes and facultative pathogenic bacteria removal","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775cb","mniswId":"3472","title":"Chemical Engineering Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1385-8947","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"89a565d0-e4d6-4fd9-8a85-2913c3124bf4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-03-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"641972c44097077035a92a70","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bda","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","6777d7f4fdbe831a38c30d75","6777d7f4fdbe831a38c30d76","6777d7f4fdbe831a38c30d77","6777d7f4fdbe831a38c30d78","6777d7f4fdbe831a38c30d79","6777d7f4fdbe831a38c30d7a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study was the strong reduction of facultative pathogenic bacteria (FPB), and clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from secondary effluent. To evaluate the ARGs removal efficiency comparative study of individual unit processes and combined AOPs has been performed. The present work investigated: i) removal of selected ARGs, namely blaTEM, ermB, qnrS, tetM, five FPB as well as 16S rDNA and the integrase gene intl1 involved in horizontal gene transfer; ii) bacterial regrowth potential after treatment; (iii) the removal of the total genomic DNA content, by mono- and bimetallic TiO2-CuPd rutile photocatalysts under visible light radiation in real secondary effluent. The nanoparticles were characterized by UV–vis, XRD, HRTEM, Raman and XPS. TiO2-CuPd/VIS inactivation gives the highest (more than 2 log units removal) efficiency for almost all targets (blaTEM, ermB, tetM, intl 1, and 16S rRNA) compared to monometallic catalysts. The highest efficiency toward blaTEM was achieved after ozonation and TiO2-CuPd/O3/VIS (3.22 and 3.23 LRV, respectively). It was found that despite similar FPB inactivation, lower DNA destruction was found after O3 compared to TiO2-CuPd/O3/VIS treatment. The blaTEM and enterococci were completely removed during TiO2-CuPd/O3/Vis and TiO2-Cu/O3/Vis. While, catalytic ozonation leads to only slightly blaTEM removal (0.64 and 0.44 LRV for TiO2-CuPd/O3 and TiO2-Cu/O3, respectively). Photocatalytic ozonation with the application of TiO2-CuPd leads to significant removal of FPB and ARGs due to synergistic effect between Pd and Cu, which leads to acceleration of ozone – catalysts reaction.

Untargeted metabolomics was applied to investigate changes in metabolic pathways in response to Cr(VI) exposure. We obtained our data from a study population of 220 male workers with exposure to Cr(VI) and 102 male controls from Belgium, Finland, Poland, Portugal and the Netherlands within the HBM4EU Chromates Study. Urinary metabolite profiles were determined using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and differences between post-shift exposed workers and controls were analyzed using principal component analysis. Based on the first two principal components, we observed clustering by industrial chromate application, such as welding, chrome plating, and surface treatment, distinct from controls and not explained by smoking status or alcohol use. The changes in the abundancy of excreted metabolites observed in workers reflect fatty acid and monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism, oxidative modifications of amino acid residues, the excessive formation of abnormal amino acid metabolites and changes in steroid and thyrotropin-releasing hormones. The observed responses could also have resulted from work-related factors other than Cr(VI). Further targeted metabolomics studies are needed to better understand the observed modifications and further explore the suitability of urinary metabolites as early indicators of adverse effects associated with exposure to Cr(VI)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219231","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo12040362","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8d7fdbe831a38c32c38","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Wąsowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"169c9862-0533-43aa-86a4-47fae472761f"},{"objectId":"6777d8d7fdbe831a38c32c37","name":"Jelle","lastName":"Verdonck","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b5f477a-c8b5-4682-ab18-dbf068a74c2d"},{"objectId":"6777d8d7fdbe831a38c32c36","name":"Susana","lastName":"Viegas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba9228af-9b9b-4257-a5e4-856d854f1e0f"},{"objectId":"6777d8d7fdbe831a38c32c35","name":"Maria João","lastName":"Silva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a77f359b-6a7b-49bd-96bc-c3f31cd9cdb9"},{"objectId":"6777d8d7fdbe831a38c32c34","name":"Monika","lastName":"Sijko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06d83c84-32bc-4c75-a347-e170da86917e"},{"objectId":"6777d8d7fdbe831a38c32c33","name":"Paul T.

The compound was obtained by direct alkylation of 3,4-pyrrolodicarboximide 1 with (1-chloroacetyl-4-(o-fluorophenyl)piperazine) 2 in DMF. Its physico-chemical features were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR, MS spectra, and elemental analysis. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was also recorded. A colorimetric inhibitor screening assay was used to determine its inhibitory potency towards COX-1 and COX-2. It was found that the compound exhibits anti-inflammatory activity higher than the reference structure – Meloxicam (MXM). According to the experimental results, the tested compound inhibited the activity of COX-1 and COX-2 respectively. In the next step, molecular docking was performed to estimate the binding affinity of compound 3 and commercially available reference compounds for COX-1/COX-2 enzymes. It was found that the binding affinity of 3 is higher than for the reference compounds. Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) and Reduced Density Gradient (RDG) methods were used to reveal non-covalent interactions present in the COX-1/COX-2 binding pocket. Finally, Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) based on semiempirical forces was carried out to gain insight into the dynamic features of the studied complexes and confirmed the fact that the weak hydrogen bonds play the most important role in stabilizing the ligand conformation for the studied COX-2 complexes with compound 3 and Rofecoxib."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219237","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1322","pagesFromTo":"art.140027 [17 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286024025365","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6776b7f9fdbe831a38ba3ee2","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Jezierska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb68b693-9c86-4817-8dd9-62a277998b43"},{"objectId":"6776b7f9fdbe831a38ba3ee1","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kochel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd6a3028-89b9-46d6-8150-97d2bb8b485c"},{"objectId":"6776b7f9fdbe831a38ba3ee0","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Wojtkowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14fd4c07-ce6e-4871-a82c-78ade26c0340"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473acfae","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Jęśkowiak-Kossakowska","uuid":"46AB97FE304B6ACD16832CFDD8129557708F8B0DCE4D9BE8E90830C809907ED2B70EBE56FE33D491F8337730E28B791981B0ADF9F033BDEFE2D3A45366D8740A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8829-4482","documentHash":"5944ba74-d4eb-4010-830d-3eaaf7a2eb4e"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a134d","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Redzicka","uuid":"8F2A3C8C2FF1BFD61C1A1B26B60A69509CA77685CAB1DA24D208AFABEFEB91F8F84493CEA8E36B4A696D60F191BDBDC91E4122BE9A95CEB73649042F206DE08C","orcidId":"0000-0003-1508-8327","documentHash":"71fd9cfc-5433-4424-8ac9-671063ad902e"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398df3","name":"Benita","lastName":"Wiatrak","uuid":"15B10EC052D1999E98426EE856EC5E778993B5E37DE32980441D40DABD0E5B80EDF18CEB00D591C7A791684F74B9E0D4213F23D2AD58A5F03B9DA80052D1EFDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1404-2274","documentHash":"1e070791-706d-4bdd-8d0f-a10a4a576fdd"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.140027"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SPPS","vasopressin","arginine building blocks","increased lipophilicity","prodrugs"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709299878c28a047398c84","6777d7f2fdbe831a38c30d56","6777d7f2fdbe831a38c30d55","6777d7f2fdbe831a38c30d54","5e7092b3878c28a04739aeed","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef3","5e70929a878c28a047398ca4","5e7092b3878c28a04739aefa","5e70924b878c28a0473931f5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis of novel arginine building blocks with increased lipophilicity compatible with solid-phase peptide synthesis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65760c124097071b8ef37062","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929a878c28a047398ca4","5e709299878c28a047398c84","5e7092b3878c28a04739aefa","5e7092b3878c28a04739aeed","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef3","5e70924b878c28a0473931f5","6777d7f2fdbe831a38c30d54","6777d7f2fdbe831a38c30d55","6777d7f2fdbe831a38c30d56","6777d7f2fdbe831a38c30d57"]},"issue":"23","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Arginine, due to the guanidine moiety, increases peptides’ hydrophilicity and enables\ninteractions with charged molecules, but at the same time, its presence in a peptide chain might\nreduce its permeability through biological membranes.

In particular, we consider two non-equivalent models of local hidden variables, namely the Svetlichny and the no-signaling bilocal models. While our knowledge concerning these models is well established for Bell-type scenarios involving two measurement settings per party, the general case based on an arbitrary number of settings is a considerably more challenging task and very little work has been done in this field. In this paper, we applied such general tests to detect and characterize genuine n-way nonlocal correlations for various states of three qubits and qutrits. Apart from the fundamental problem of characterizing genuine multipartite nonlocal correlations, the extension of the number of measurements beyond two is also of practical importance. As a measure of nonlocality, we use the probability of violation of local realism under randomly sampled observables, and the strength of nonlocality, described by the resistance to white noise admixture. In particular, we analyze to what extent the Bell-type scenario involving two measurement settings can be used to certify genuine n-way nonlocal correlations generated for more general models. In addition, we propose a simple procedure to detect such nonlocal correlations for randomly chosen settings with an efficiency of up to 100%. Due to its near-perfect efficiency, our method may open new possibilities in device-independent quantum cryptography applications where strong nonlocality between all partners is required."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219258","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777c455fdbe831a38c28e81","name":"Tamás","lastName":"Vértesi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3109abd7-a309-4087-9b9f-7bff686e8c53"},{"objectId":"6777c455fdbe831a38c28e80","name":"István","lastName":"Márton","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf904faf-1f16-4417-9d77-41e7e35c4e91"},{"objectId":"6777c455fdbe831a38c28e7f","name":"Artur","lastName":"Barasiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"769c6ad3-1b6e-45e9-8f50-eeca83254e81"},{"objectId":"6777c455fdbe831a38c28e7e","name":"Mahasweta","lastName":"Pandit","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59ed39f2-4208-4b21-8e7f-f1e2aabc381f"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b422","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Laskowski","uuid":"D718172EDF297443B889961C1939751DE230B0599A62624E0161707E1C29BFC1A21B5AB700EF3E7F67EC7C5F508A58B3F5A628D18502ADF941621ABC4C949449","orcidId":"0000-0001-5166-0373","documentHash":"a81b889d-319b-42b5-a6ee-1dc407bdf929"}],"doi":"10.1088/1367-2630/aca8c8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["extraction","SPE","LC-MS/MS","biota","MAE"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924b878c28a04739320a","5e709434878c28a0473b80f1","6777d831fdbe831a38c31506","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analysis of imidazolium ionic liquids in biological matrices: a novel procedure for the determination of trace amounts in marine mussels","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798cb","mniswId":"19245","title":"Talanta","doi":null,"issn":"0039-9140","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"79ff427e-af83-4ed6-8e2a-2bf3c6818c63"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6572d1e44097071b8e6dd0e3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924b878c28a04739320a","5e709434878c28a0473b80f1","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","6777d831fdbe831a38c31506"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Imidazolium ionic liquids (ILs) are chemical compounds beginning to be used on a mass scale.

Thus, there is no doubt that monitoring the presence of these compounds in organisms from potentially contaminated waters will be needed. Therefore, the aim of our study was to develop and fully validate a novel and reliable analytical procedure for the determination of the mixture of imidazolium ILs in Mytilus trossulus mussels. For this purpose, different extraction techniques were tested such as: microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), accelerated-solvent extraction (ASE) and bullet-blender homogenization (HOMO). Finally, the proposed procedure is based on the application of MAE technique for the extraction of imidazolium cations and SPE technique using Oasis HLB cartridges for the purification of the obtained extracts and LC-MS/MS technique with QqQ analyzer for their final determination. Absolute recoveries of the proposed analytical procedure reached 71–90%. The developed procedure is characterized with low limits of quantification, at 50–100 ng g−1 dry tissue and allows for reliable determination of trace amounts of the tested compounds in complex biological matrix. Matrix effects obtained for the optimized procedure ranged from 7.8 to 37.5%. As a result, this is the first study presenting the analytical procedure for the analysis of imidazolium ILs in aquatic animal tissues."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219269","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"252","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.123790","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d831fdbe831a38c31506","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Maculewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c93a33d-6eef-44fe-ba51-7479b01b3c65"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b80f1","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Dołżonek","uuid":"55474A74C6FD6C5698541C4A2E8D2DF071955D9642A49DFECF0DF1EE21D6159AB8BAA17381BAF5C1D478682FACEF2F74D7A17D0E8BE574FC29D0A31952D74F80","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94d1d69c-9fde-48e3-893b-7430013bc516"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Białk-Bielińska","uuid":"9E8640A84BE9C2C8F6ECE5DC189616D83275B51761F908B5D8E28A506342BC6B9E0E419EA45044698C596073F9588A5A8E6FB50837AD4C2D797ED8C5DA9DE62C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8304991e-5722-4b70-8065-b3f551596db8"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739320a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Stepnowski","uuid":"6E1315A45E3C8D09C3EE267052AAD1C60A569A460874126B8373B3B6D2F586BD5705BEA16397F24679657E1320E2E894A863F6233606B6B575C78426A27C7BB0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ecfa3c4-0c71-4746-9745-712eaf025413"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.talanta.2022.123790"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quantum mechanics","luminescence","transition metals","Infrared light","phonons"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6777c3fefdbe831a38c27252","5e709389878c28a0473ac36f","5e709423878c28a0473b6faa","5e7092b7878c28a04739b424"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Pentavalent manganese luminescence: designing narrow-band near-infrared light-emitting diodes as next-generation compact light sources","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b7fe","mniswId":"133","title":"ACS Energy Letters","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2380-8195","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ab76b991-f645-4c9d-89fc-e18250932889"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63c9b7d04097074220d66ea3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709423878c28a0473b6faa","5e709389878c28a0473ac36f","5e7092b7878c28a04739b424","6777c3fefdbe831a38c2724f","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27250","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27251","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27252","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27253","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27254","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27255","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27256","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27257","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27258","6777c3fefdbe831a38c27259"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Manganese in the pentavalent state (Mn5+) is\nboth rare and central in materials exhibiting narrow-band nearinfrared (NIR) emission and is highly sought after for phosphorconverted light-emitting diodes as promising candidates for\nfuture miniature solid-state NIR light source.

This is a fundamental challenge for annotation of measurement data, relevant, e.g., for designing data-driven autonomous systems. The contribution consists in formulation of an offline robust methodology based on the classical approach for structural break detection. The problem of data segmentation for the changing scale is solved as a process variable sensitive to the occurrence of a critical event in a reorganizing physical system. The advantage is that this approach does not require the existence of a variance of the data distribution. Efficiency has been evaluated for simulated data from two distributions and for real-world data sets measured in financial, mechanical, and medical systems. Simulation studies show that in the most challenging case, the error mean absolute in estimating the regime change is 20 times lower for the robust approach compared to the classical approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219290","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"239","pagesFromTo":"art.115472 [21 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224124013575","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6776b7fcfdbe831a38ba3efe","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Jabłoński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f662a67-be93-4d09-b929-9b7ad6725ad9"},{"objectId":"6776b7fcfdbe831a38ba3efd","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wyłomańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce9c3bcc-5797-44dc-90cb-61ffa1f9290c"},{"objectId":"6776b7fcfdbe831a38ba3efc","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Kremzer-Osiadacz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a689b5f1-bd15-468e-bfb9-8d9f9cd6abd5"},{"objectId":"6776b7fcfdbe831a38ba3efb","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Witulska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d4c8a5c-1848-4ef6-bf3a-200dc6bd62a3"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4dcf","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zaleska","uuid":"8771145E0A7D2E57E4AD326667E123ADE586F7503DFE8328A031A3247084CAE2468953194A8B7FCA209871920BE7E14925D34C9A354FC8E4956105D88710172C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7513-8042","documentHash":"ef84d32b-cd4c-426e-b4d5-b270d0ae9905"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2024.115472"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Plantago lanceolata L","folium","lead","toxicological risk assessment","traditional herbal medicinal products"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709315878c28a0473a289a"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3a41"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Lead impurities in traditional herbal medicinal products with Plantago lanceolata L., folium (Ribwort Plantain leaves) available in Polish pharmacies - toxicological risk assessment for adults","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f73","mniswId":"14796","title":"Natural Product Research","doi":null,"issn":"1478-6419","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8257ced2-a5d9-43e6-915d-6de741cb8c50"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6515ec494097070ba4d5f80e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709315878c28a0473a289a","5e709325878c28a0473a3a41"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Traditional herbal medicinal products (THMP) with Plantago lanceolata L., folium (Ribwort Plantain Leaves) are well-known and very popular among the European population. The aim of our study was the toxicological risk assessment for adults of Pb impurities in THMP with Plantago lanceolata L. obtained from pharmacies in Poland. The estimations of Pb impurities in the single dose (22.1 - 50.7 ng/single dose) and in the daily dose (ng/day) were based on the worst-case scenario (WCS), i.e. based on the posology recommended by manufacturers. The estimated daily exposure (ng/day) meets the standards of the ICH Q3D (R1) guideline on elemental impurities (5.0 µg/day) according to the Pb levels (all results were below 250 ng/day).

Badanie przeprowadzono w 2024 roku wśród przedstawicieli gospodarstw rolnych z województwa lubelskiego. Warunkiem uczestnictwa w badaniu było korzystanie przez gospodarstwo z programów pomocowych UE. Z analiz wynika, że rolnicy korzystali przede wszystkim z programów, takich jak: „Młody rolnik”, „Wymiana eternitu” i „Rozwój małych gospodarstw”. Środki finansowe rolnicy przeznaczali przede wszystkim na modernizację gospodarstw, w tym głównie na zakup maszyn i ciągników rolniczych. Inwestycje te przyczyniły się do unowocześnienia, a także poprawy wydajności i konkurencyjności gospodarstw rolnych. Większość właścicieli gospodarstw rolnych nie zrealizowałoby planowanych inwestycji bez środków pochodzących z funduszy UE, dlatego tak ważne jest upowszechnianie przez instytucje do tego uprawnione, informacji o projektach skierowanych do rolników, a także wsparcie rolników w przygotowaniu wniosków o dofinansowanie z należytą starannością."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study is to determine directions the use of European Union (EU) funds on selected farms in the Lubelskie Voivodeship in the period 2019-2022.

The survey used the method of a diagnostic survey carried out with an online survey technique using a survey questionnaire tool. The survey was conducted in 2024 among representatives of agricultural holdings from the Lubelskie Voivodeship. The selection of objects for the study was purposive, with the condition of participation in the study being the use of EU aid programmes. The survey showed that farmers mainly used the Young Farmer, Eternit Replacement and Small Farm Development programmes. The farmers used the funds mainly to modernise their farms, including mainly the purchase of agricultural machinery and tractors. These investments arguably contributed to the modernisation, as well as to improving the efficiency and competitiveness of farms. The majority of farm owners would probably not realise the planned investments without the funds from the European Union funds, therefore it is important for the institutions authorised to do so to disseminate information about the projects addressed to farmers, as well as to support farmers in preparing the applications for financing with due diligence."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219303","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6761473ffdbe8365715fbaa9","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XXVI","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"d5a85198-6656-4961-8978-9d8025f96704"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"221-232","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Directions of the use of financial resources from the European Union funds in farms in Lubelskie voivodeship in 2019-2022"}],"publicUri":"https://rnseria.com/article/548801/pl","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67654d95fdbe832d0ce4657b","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Gruszczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d3cdbc8-3530-4c5f-a2b1-a175e2e6ea04"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395b20","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Żurakowska-Sawa","uuid":"4098367EB326DF6172D62A80EB2C4E6316EC10F6315793D6A18FF7F16B57E912ED8D9A608CA5EE3E24DAC8E26CBB0D94D9462CA782B85EDAE9213FF4ADFBE02F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3811-4586","documentHash":"e414b905-bca9-4cf4-ae01-a38b7483904d"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0054.8801"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["arithmetic progressions","ideals of nowhere dense sets","ideals on countable sets","Kirch's topology","Golomb's topology"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092de878c28a04739e6a4","5e709368878c28a0473a8f8c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"On some generalizations of the Kirch's ideal","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479965","mniswId":"19577","title":"Topology and its Applications","doi":null,"issn":"0166-8641","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"dd86d5e5-d035-4b10-bdfa-b679e17e8201"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6576c9934097071b8ef77d1c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709368878c28a0473a8f8c","5e7092de878c28a04739e6a4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Consider the following topological spaces \n introduced by Szyszkowska (2022) [24]: for any \n, the base \n for the topology \n consists of the arithmetic progressions with the common difference being \n-free (i.e., not divisible by any \n-th power of a prime number) and coprime with the initial term of the sequence. The nowhere dense sets in these topological spaces form ideals \n that are a generalization of the Kirch's ideal on \n. In this paper we modify the definition of \n in order to obtain a further generalization of the mentioned topologies, and explore the relations between the corresponding ideals of nowhere dense sets. We also compare them with the Golomb's ideal and present some additional conclusions – in particular, we show that there are \n many pairwise ⊆-incomparable ideals of this kind."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219305","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"325","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.topol.2022.108386","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8f8c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kwela","uuid":"5BC4D3D73695F9C393B3FEE7A74B50BB9F42C7122E7EF72FC576C7BFFE38A7D334ACCF8FBFE5CA4C2B20F7AED96D58BF8AD27A10A34ECFF8C07B125EAA82B9A4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2866-4661","documentHash":"4eb3c689-997f-4046-8c5f-9ce6ed1f68df"},{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e6a4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Tryba","uuid":"DD63B35FD7D74F96FEE9DF9A4FB411A86533F779EE23EEBB42535885757D88E07939360B28277F23E1F7224AB84F8B109FE93FDF793116FF569FA2F7F9705F0C","orcidId":"0000-0003-4799-8894","documentHash":"8c9f16b3-179e-4f86-b5aa-aedd7a31b0de"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.topol.2022.108386"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["COVID-19","ACE2","SARS-CoV-2","UNRES","modelowanie molekularne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","ACE2","SARS-CoV-2","molecular modeling","UNRES"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b3878c28a04739aeef","6777d88efdbe831a38c32267","5e70924b878c28a0473931eb","5e70941f878c28a0473b6957","5e70924b878c28a0473931e3","5e70924b878c28a0473931ed"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Theoretical investigation of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection mechanism and selectivity","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65760ba64097071b8ef369d4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70941f878c28a0473b6957","5e70924b878c28a0473931e3","5e70924b878c28a0473931ed","5e70924b878c28a0473931eb","5e7092b3878c28a04739aeef","6777d88efdbe831a38c32267"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus, commonly known as COVID-19, first occurred in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Since then, it has become a tremendous threat to human health. With a pandemic threat, it is in the significant interest of the scientific world to establish its method of infection. In this manuscript, we combine knowledge of the infection mechanism with theoretical methods to answer the question of the virus’s selectivity. We proposed a two-stage infection mechanism. In the first step, the virus interacts with the ACE2 receptor, with the “proper strength”. When the interaction is too strong, the virus will remain in an “improper position”; if the interaction is too weak, the virus will “run away” from the cell. We also indicated three residues (positions 30, 31, and 353) located on the ACE2 protein-binding interface, which seems to be crucial for successful infection. Our results indicate that these residues are necessary for the initiation of the infection process."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219311","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27072080","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d88efdbe831a38c32267","name":"Iga","lastName":"Biskupek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ab04157c-ae19-44e9-9efd-1e08794bb776"},{"objectId":"5e70941f878c28a0473b6957","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sieradzan","uuid":"91AE28AA8E9D17E2D793BC99725763459D566DB75574D3AE619E73A99E2633E593F2BD8AEE441156BE0C8681790D7299421EA26448014A5C63D192ADECA7449B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2426-3644","documentHash":"42fb16aa-04a9-4e93-9f4e-02fe5a1a7d7e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aeef","name":"Artur","lastName":"Giełdoń","uuid":"8ADD1176A9C28C63B3030651D48EB581AB921C4D4D4DCA3FF2B7D706B6BF6AA012E8308D307F1277AA3CA1A4382A07733449F871452619E8AC340FC2982B1953","orcidId":"0000-0003-0415-9214","documentHash":"9155f5ba-7f55-48a7-bcb8-d2b28a9ceb02"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931ed","name":"Józef","lastName":"Liwo","uuid":"3B5D8B8662D4EACFC86FEF607377CFE9786BD92C4A5706A9E9F988196F33388BF9CD1799C90A4F4F4914448BA5CDE495B8C57ECD015581CB0EA2EA651E7F69DD","orcidId":"0000-0001-6942-2226","documentHash":"41611fe5-3cdf-4921-b6dd-7985a64b4e04"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931eb","name":"Adam","lastName":"Lesner","uuid":"25627CB569B67025087227C929922CA08F2658613ADE65A1901D050DB944D1796E3F3D82DF61C5D29B4CDC14B7E4B74F5560721C58AD30C3074E8867A2FA5DF6","orcidId":"0000-0001-8335-3431","documentHash":"ad8c97f3-c1da-450b-8df7-2de86f9fb154"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931e3","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Czaplewski","uuid":"CCB86ADD3D404981FF354CC57AB2A185BF2B17B718FABC1DF8085749586CBF51E0D074ED075AE0371AE69D9080A6D8F7FB19A0DBD224B8CDDCC3363818A223F3","orcidId":"0000-0002-0294-3403","documentHash":"19f0c025-59cf-469f-a1f5-e91820f4cc1f"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27072080"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alternative medicine products","mushrooms","food toxicology","foods","210Po and 210Pb","nutrition supplements","radioactivity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924b878c28a04739320b","5e70941c878c28a0473b6704"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"On the occurrence, origin, and intake of the nuclides, 210Po and 210Pb, in sclerotia of Wolfiporia cocos collected in China","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research","doi":null,"issn":"0944-1344","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"80fb5f49-d17d-4c94-ae09-f813bb7059c2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-03","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f89bc4409707099272b0c5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924b878c28a04739320b","5e70924b878c28a047393200","5e70941c878c28a0473b6704"]},"issue":"18","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The dried sclerotium of the fungus Wolfiporia cocos is edible and has medicinal value.

Sclerotia were collected in the wild and from cultivars in China's Anhui and Yunnan provinces. The mean values of 210Po activity concentration levels were 0.36 Bq kg-1 dry weight in the core and 12.0 Bq kg-1 dw in the shell; 210Pb activities were 0.43 and 9.84 Bq kg-1 dw, respectively. The potential effective radiation doses from core layers (as a major raw material of the sclerotium) ranged from 0.13 to 3.43 µSv kg-1 dw from 210Po decay and from 0.11 to 1.52 µSv kg-1 dw from 210Pb decay. Corresponding values for shell ranged from 0.80 to 42.4 for 210Po and from 0.53 to 13.6 µSv kg-1 dw for 210Pb. In general, the intake of W. cocos sclerotia varies between consumers, but this would not significantly change the effective radiation doses from 210Po and 210Pb isotopes.

The production of microcapsules is based on the use of their physical properties such as amphiphilicity, partition coefficient and melting point, while their formation of microcapsules is mainly carried out using physical methods such as coacervation, spray drying, cooling and coating, agglomeration, suspension crosslinking, solvent evaporation, and extrusion, as well as chemical methods: interfacial polymerization and in situ polymerization.

Synthesis, structural and optical properties of core-shell nanostructures with a large number of two kinds of fluorophores bound to the shell are presented. As fluorophores, strongly fluorescent rhodamine 101 and rhodamine 110 chloride were selected. The dyes exhibit significant spectral overlap between acceptor absorption and donor emission spectra, which enables effective FRET. Core-shell nanoparticles strongly differing in the ratio of donors to acceptor numbers were prepared. This leads to two different interesting cases: typical single-step FRET or multistep energy migration preceding FRET. The single-step FRET model that was designed and presented by some of us recently for core-shell nanoparticles is herein experimentally verified. Very good agreement between the analytical expression for donor fluorescence intensity decay and experimental data was obtained, which confirmed the correctness of the model. Multistep energy migration between donors preceding the final transfer to the acceptor can also be successfully described. In this case, however, experimental data are compared with the results of Monte Carlo simulations, as there is no respective analytical expression. Excellent agreement in this more general case evidences the usefulness of this numerical method in the design and prediction of the properties of the synthesized core-shell nanoparticles labelled with multiple and chemically different fluorophores."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219335","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23063182","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d927fdbe831a38c336a3","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Kułak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7758757b-ec45-4962-9943-874a88688052"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bd4","name":"Elżbieta ","lastName":"Adamska","uuid":"A50DE293A6FD2A2BD433D5CBFD0B8EEA8B3491C34FB793AAA0A7169350F6B779F0C3AE9988D2033F31AF0A26A0FB362CA1BF77229D4B4D9AC01D9CE4A2BDE240","orcidId":"0000-0003-1115-1894","documentHash":"7d73c829-cb4f-46e4-a1ce-6dd7c2674b66"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aeeb","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Niedziałkowski","uuid":"97C1F9B31B3C222BF0E4BD570D528DDF933931937CD882B0D4B2AB91E26BBEF54361BFF31355F21C2E21A0A4D1F0EB0FDE8A108FBC43DFFFDDCCA171E16B075A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8197-6333","documentHash":"7e7420df-a4f6-4715-8e7a-f68d765968d1"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394bdb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Synak","uuid":"7AB7D061DFE8D4DDF0108D2EB95441A18F442E31EC010EE98938C11AFC84A9E78D3654EACEB89900779C77DF6E1E429AFD5B64023B9AF2AF4E2C5B696FCE12C4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8264-7833","documentHash":"0fed4fa1-eae9-4d53-acc7-a8e8822b40bb"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394bcf","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bojarski","uuid":"291B3383CF6F007935A6537EB7E4CF15E2A0EA481F647A84C0FBC79727DC29CA6044273D1141085753137CE89CD9FD0BC6108FBA59C9D70F8A34779B6FF42F8E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3863-1521","documentHash":"87573490-d5e1-42dd-bebe-45cd5b8fba07"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931e5","name":"Beata","lastName":"Grobelna","uuid":"03DAC8D059717451C83E84290A2D915B449FD5FEFA6938470987A98C126AA26CD5A4EDEE7146FE2D9367E067C595400345B81F4DE54CBF0F5B531E4744B9135C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2122-2238","documentHash":"d4bcf608-8bd0-4f87-b19b-97faa35dedbb"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23063182"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-1032-19922-1","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Chemical and Functional Properties of Food Components","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":548,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"647d993e4097071acaa88276","editors":[{"objectId":"66b5ed44fdbe83188066fae3","name":"Zdzisław E.","lastName":"Sikorski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba4bdd46-32c8-4c5b-b265-6daceaf2d08c"},{"objectId":"66b5ed44fdbe83188066fae2","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Staroszczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cfb2408b-fd03-4f1e-9b5a-1f56b21bd6a3"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["66b5ed44fdbe83188066fae2","66b5ed44fdbe83188066fae3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060219340","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb764","mniswId":"2600","name":"Taylor & Francis Group","documentHash":"186b7a58-eacb-453a-bc81-dbcca285e881"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1201/9781003265955"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mycobacterial disease","statistical bias","autoimmune thyroiditis","myopathy","nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)","cachexia","precision medicine","thyroid cancer","calcium homeostasis","BRAFV600E mutation","paraneoplastic syndrome"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Critical and progressive cachexia may be observed in numerous medical disciplines, but in patients with various diseases, several pathways overlap (endocrine, inflammatory and kidney diseases, heart failure, cancer). Methods. Unlike numerous cohort studies that examine thyroid cancer and risk factors, a different method was used to avoid bias and analyze the sequence of events, i.e., the pathway. A case-control analysis is presented on patients with initial immune-mediated thyroiditis complicated by cachexia, presenting pulmonary pathology coexisting with opportunistic infection, and ultimately diagnosed with cancer (TC—thyroid cancer, misdiagnosed as lung cancer). Results. Contrary to other patients with lung cancer, the presented patients were not active smokers and exclusively women who developed cachexia with existing autoimmune processes in the first phase. Furthermore, the coexistence of short overall survival without cancer progression in the most seriously ill patients, as well as correlation with sex (contrary to history of smoking) and predisposition to mycobacterial disease, are very suggestive. Although we describe three different autoimmune conditions (de Quervain’s, Graves’, and atrophic thyroiditis), disturbances in calcium and metabolic homeostasis, under the influence of hormonal and inflammatory changes, are crucial factors of cachexia and prognosis. Conclusions. The unique sequence sheds light on immune-mediated thyroid disease as a subclinical paraneoplastic process modified by various therapeutic regimens. However, it is also associated with cachexia, systemic consequences, and atypical sequelae, which require a holistic approach. The differential diagnosis of severe cachexia, adenocarcinoma with pulmonary localization, and tuberculosis reactivation requires an analysis of immunological and genetic backgrounds. Contrary to highly specialized teams (e.g., lung cancer units), immunotherapy and general medicine in aging populations require a multidisciplinary, holistic, and inquiring approach. The lack of differentiation, confusing biases, and discrepancies in the literature are the main obstacles to statistical research, limiting findings to correlations of common factors only. Time-lapse case studies such as this one may be among the first to build evidence of a pathway and an association between inflammatory and endocrine imbalances in cancer cachexia."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219342","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.2722 [17 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/12/12/2722","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6776b685fdbe831a38ba3e5e","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Zdziarski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"064829fb-e0b4-4d96-90da-bad9b7cae926"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1a76","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"A6B6DA1C953DB4F41F7E2FAA3334A651CF4EBF8499A09C6C8F4CE2D0B66B2514F36F8F6056D74EB74C567A788D1871628772A54C3C8F87D24518D895FC20ED4C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6618-017X","documentHash":"2f470a30-4807-45b0-b69c-997e15c897b8"}],"doi":"10.3390/biomedicines12122722"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924b878c28a047393205","5e70924b878c28a0473931e1","5e70924b878c28a0473931fb","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bca","5e709249878c28a0473931da"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Metal-ion interactions with dodecapeptide fragments of human cationic antimicrobial protein LL-37 [hCAP(134–170)]","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a1","mniswId":"12285","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","doi":null,"issn":"1520-6106","eissn":"1520-5207","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3ef059cd-df5a-4b8d-a9e3-d604d4e486e5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65760b624097071b8ef36616","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bca","5e70924b878c28a0473931fb","5e70924b878c28a0473931e1","5e70924b878c28a047393205","5e709249878c28a0473931da","6777d894fdbe831a38c32319"]},"issue":"36","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism (CD) techniques, and in silico analysis were used to determine potential metal binding sites in human cationic antimicrobial protein (hCAP) corresponding to overlapping the dodecapeptide sequences of hCAP(134–170) referred to as LL-37. The correct antibacterial action of LL-37 is closely related to its established unique structure. Disturbances in the LL-37 structure (e.g., unwanted presence of metal ions) lead to a radical change in its biological functions. Five fragments of the LL-37 [hCAP(134–170)], namely, hCAP(134–145) (A1), hCAP(140–151) (A2), hCAP(146–157) (A3), hCAP(152–163) (A4), and hCAP(159–170) (A5), were taken into account and their affinity to Mn(II) and Zn(II) ions was rigorously assessed. We prove that only three of the investigated peptides (A1, A2, and A5) are capable of forming thermodynamically stable complexes with metal ions. Additionally, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose the most likely coordination modes of metal(II) to peptides as well as discuss the chemical nature of the interactions. Finally, we present the structural features of the strongest binding peptide, hCAP(159–170), responsible for the metal binding.

However, the unique nanoscale properties that make ENMs attractive may result in as yet poorly known risks to human health and the environment. Thus, new ENMs should be designed in line with the idea of safe-and-sustainable-by-design (SSbD). The biological activity of ENMs is closely related to their physicochemical characteristics, changes in these characteristics may therefore cause changes in the ENMs activity. In this sense, a set of physicochemical characteristics (for example, chemical composition, crystal structure, size, shape, surface structure) creates a unique ‘representation’ of a given ENM. The usability of these characteristics or nanomaterial descriptors (nanodescriptors) in nanoinformatics methods such as quantitative structure–activity/property relationship (QSAR/QSPR) models, provides exciting opportunities to optimize ENMs at the design stage by improving their functionality and minimizing unforeseen health/environmental hazards. A computational screening of possible versions of novel ENMs would return optimal nanostructures and manage ('design out') hazardous features at the earliest possible manufacturing step. Safe adoption of ENMs on a vast scale will depend on the successful integration of the entire bulk of nanodescriptors extracted experimentally with data from theoretical and computational models. This Review discusses directions for developing appropriate nanomaterial representations and related nanodescriptors to enhance the reliability of computational modelling utilized in designing safer

the formation of organic salts can improve the solubility, bioavailability, and stability of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the aim of this work was to prepare an organic salt of chlordiazepoxide with saccharin. To achieve this goal, the saccharin salt of chlordiazepoxide was obtained from a physical mixture of both components by grinding them with a small volume of solvent and by crystallizing them with complete evaporation of the solvent. The resulting salt was examined by methods such as Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD), Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction (SCXRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR), and Raman spectroscopy. The results of the studies proved that saccharin salt of chlordiazepoxide crystallizes in the orthorhombic Pbca space group with one chlordiazepoxide cation and one saccharin anion in the asymmetric unit. In the crystal of the title compound, the chlordiazepoxide cation and the saccharin anion interact through strong N–H···O hydrogen bonds and weak C–H···O hydrogen bonds. The disappearance of the N–H band in the FT-IR spectrum of saccharin may indicate a shift of this proton towards chlordiazepoxide, while the disappearance of the aromatic bond band in the chlordiazepoxide ring in the Raman spectrum may suggest the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between chlordiazepoxide molecules. The melting point of the salts differs from that of the starting compounds. Thermal decomposition of the salt begins above 200 °C and shows at least two overlapping stages of mass loss. In summary, the results of the research showed that the crystalline salt of the saccharin and chlordiazepoxide can be obtained by various methods: grinding with the addition of acetonitrile and crystallization from acetonitrile or a mixture of methanol with methylene chloride."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219354","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8ddfdbe831a38c32cda","name":"Marek","lastName":"Wesołowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9bbb5125-afa4-41ac-8b52-88d22f290b12"},{"objectId":"6777d8ddfdbe831a38c32cd9","name":"Maria","lastName":"Gazda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ade6a61-0e50-4d3b-a35a-67a7be4a81dd"},{"objectId":"6777d8ddfdbe831a38c32cd8","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Garbacz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31c3bcf6-876a-49b9-85c6-8a6b13e9ff3d"},{"objectId":"6777d8ddfdbe831a38c32cd7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lech","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6c4cc6f-fe31-44e8-bcb0-c997ea045f1c"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f7","name":"Artur","lastName":"Sikorski","uuid":"5D7943CFAAEADF3F6049F8F00F3BBB6B04062010DC929098A77E98EAC2E01C7806BF88D0FAB186F56DA69E8B3919F4E57D752B83B888511D18B22CEACBC7BA00","orcidId":"0000-0002-4559-7870","documentHash":"36851ee1-e7b5-4be7-9b56-002725f5a834"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms231912050"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["nowotwór","enzymy","trzustka","cukrzyca","testy diagnostyczne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["diagnostic tests","pancreas","enzymes","cancer","diabetes"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398ca5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wykorzystanie enzymów w diagnostyce medycznej","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac20ad204581b62ebb9a","mniswId":"201380","title":"Wiadomości Chemiczne","doi":null,"issn":"0043-5104","eissn":"2300-0295","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"c2d76b01-aea2-4086-b682-5da0b4f0e8cd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-02-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65797ccc4097076c149b72b5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929a878c28a047398ca5"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Each tissue has its own specific enzyme profile.

Here, we advanced by applying the technique to monitor the inversion of the induced circular dichroism (ICD) spectrum when ligands move between human and bovine serum albumin proteins (HSA and BSA). ICD experiments were performed using dimers of methyl vanillate (DVT) and vanillin (DVN). The sign and spectra shape were dependent on the albumin type. DVN presented a positive maximum in 312 nm when complexed with HSA and a negative one in BSA. It was possible to induce and follow the time-dependent displacement of the ligand from BSA (2.2 × 106 M−1) to HSA (6.6 × 105 M−1) via ICD inversion. The Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area approach was used to calculate the binding free energy of the conformers, and a dissociation pathway for each system was proposed using Umbrella Sampling calculations. Four energy minima dihedral angle conformers were identified, and the corresponding CD spectra were calculated using the quantum chemistry approach. Then, weighted spectra for the conformationally accessible conformers were obtained based on each conformer's Boltzmann probability distribution. In conclusion, the methodology described in the manuscript might be helpful in monitoring the movement of ligands between proteins that they bind."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219373","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"278","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8a5fdbe831a38c3256c","name":"Valdecir F.","lastName":"Ximenes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08b7346e-5a9d-4eec-b5c0-f3f752d9622d"},{"objectId":"6777d8a5fdbe831a38c3256b","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Maszota-Zieleniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ea56630-8320-42be-9c30-cb70d953c249"},{"objectId":"6777d8a5fdbe831a38c3256a","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kogut","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8124b2f2-d31b-4791-8420-234612514e7c"},{"objectId":"6777d8a5fdbe831a38c32569","name":"Luiza","lastName":"de Carvalho Bertozo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b5d15b03-6b68-4674-b8ac-d89b37ffa059"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Samsonov","uuid":"0A696C8802E71A3A89F3AF367E2CEA8CC0EA07478D60E9F4C08683C9707E2904AFE17930A29C903F2FFC8DA1032E57DEF00B2199857435DB613F28F5CF334581","orcidId":"0000-0002-5166-4849","documentHash":"736332c7-8850-4b23-9312-3e4bab0971fa"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.saa.2022.121374"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["radioactive contamination","food products","radiation protection","diet","Coffee","extraction"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7a67","5e70924b878c28a04739320b","5e70941c878c28a0473b6704"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"On the radiotoxic 210Po in coffee beans worldwide and the impact of roasting and brewing on its extraction into beverages: from the experiments to 210Po content prediction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research","doi":null,"issn":"0944-1344","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"80fb5f49-d17d-4c94-ae09-f813bb7059c2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f89bf3409707099272b734","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7a67","5e70941c878c28a0473b6704","5e70924b878c28a04739320b","6777d843fdbe831a38c3174a"]},"issue":"17","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We determined radiotoxic 210Po in roasted cofee beans from diferent regions worldwide, the beverages, and tried to create\nthe prediction model of 210Po content based on its growth location.

In recent years, many studies have focused on investigating novel photocatalysts driven by visible light. In this study, K2V6O16·nH2O nanobelts and KV3O8 microplatelets were synthesized and investigated as photocatalysts. Samples were obtained via the facile method based on liquid-phase exfoliation with ion exchange. By changing the synthesis temperature (20–80 °C), different compositions, morphologies, and V4+/V5+ ratios were obtained and investigated as photocatalysts for organic dye degradation. Potassium vanadates’ structural, morphological, and optical properties were characterized using X-ray diffraction(XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with mass spectrometry (MS), N2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence (PL), and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Synthesized K2V6O16·nH2O and KV3O8 showed an efficient absorption in the visible wavelength region with a narrow band gap energy of 1.80 and 1.91 eV, respectively. Their photocatalytic activity was evaluated by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under simulated solar light illumination. The KV3O8 microplatelets exhibited the greatest photocatalytic activity, resulting in more than 90% degradation of the dye within the first 30 min. It is suggested that the observed excellent photocatalytic performance is attributed to the high content of V4+ species.

Their majority were determined in a probabilistic way, while some of them, such asthe fire monitoring notification system and selected elements of the final stage, were assessed ina deterministic way. The paper discusses methods of their estimation, particularly in terms ofthe used data. The developed model consists of two main action phases, each subdivided intosmaller stages, the sum of which gives the time taken to undertake extinguishing actions. Thistime is presented as a probability distribution. The first phase, i.e. the notification of the incident,is variable and depends on the equipment of the building with detection devices. As a result of thevariability of the first phase of action, three different but invariable paths have been identified. Theresults in the form of extinguishing action times, along with the probabilities for each variant, arepresented in three result tables at the end of the article.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219388","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"107-131","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://zeszytynaukowe-sgsp.pl/gicid/01.3001.0054.7330","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c0","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Gałaj","uuid":"F26548C6C90BDE149ED4D17BFC349DDE7790FC97D88561FEA87CEB2F54B87EFBE0CF7900A35AD4AB9B0284B064FED259E13E57AA366F8C90CEB22E736635E643","orcidId":"0000-0002-1509-6733","documentHash":"6ccf065a-3f6e-40bb-bad4-0a14016212fd"},{"objectId":"5e7092a9878c28a04739a24a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kuziora","uuid":"90E9E3306F4290F0DB03FD40F214B867FE60952864AF387680EA949F3E44350FEBE804FE574030DF59DD8C1733B668783689DED088A9ED5AE9EEA8DAA4DEEFD0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56b1c8bb-febe-4733-974a-2a20d0995f76"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0054.7330"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anthraquinone","crown ether","cryptand","chromoionophore","electrophore","proton transfer"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b3878c28a04739aef5","5e70929a878c28a047398c9a","5e7092b3878c28a04739aeeb","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bca"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Macrocyclic chemosensors with anthraquinone signaling unit built into ionophore.

First ligand, labeled in the paper as AQ-Ncrown is characterized by a cyclic structure of a crown ether, while second one AQ-Ncrypt includes an additional ethoxy bridge, which ensures the bicyclic character of a cryptand. The studied macrocycles possess both oxygen and nitrogen heteroatoms in the ionophore cavity. Dualistic (chromophore and electrophore) signaling nature of described compounds, makes them potentially attractive molecular recognition systems. The aim of our research was to synthesize and analyze the spectroscopic, acid-base and redox properties of aforesaid macrocycles. Furthermore, we have combined experimental approach together with theoretical investigations. The equilibrium structures of AQ-Ncrown and AQ-Ncrypt were determined with the use of DFT calculations. The sensitivity of studied macrocycles towards interactions with protons was scrutinized. The complete pH-spectrophotometric characteristic of studied ligands together with their protolytic forms and corresponding pKa values were determined. The influence of medium (aprotic and protic solvent) on spectral effects was described. Furthermore, the molecular electrostatic potential maps for ligands and differential electron densities for their mono and dianions were calculated. The redox reactions was investigated at different pHs by cyclic voltammetry. Electrochemical results have presented intriguing phenomenon: the specific stabilization of the reduced form of the protonated molecules. The calculations have revealed that this is a consequence of barrierless intramolecular proton transfer (from the macrocycle cavity onto the anthraquinone moiety) that might occur during the reduction process in acidic medium."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219401","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"292","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bca","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Brzeski","uuid":"FAED33494D37CE004F641B051750CA215890B2295C5164001673B9AAD4A6E26146BF7EB4F5C7959FC9C345105B0FDB221F79E473D4D62ECDB4A1F936C31CE7D5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4865-0152","documentHash":"7894c70f-7210-4114-8f18-cc96882ca6dd"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aef5","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Zarzeczańska","uuid":"6AE708423F9D781FFF24A95A796757EA2A37BE6E79E39D7557C481626C82E4B42D12E979A70BEC379B8D833DAB077C54B16956545EA66D30478C3060A2309D6F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3800-8687","documentHash":"a74381fa-b5c7-44aa-9e1e-ce7e41cfcc8e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aeeb","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Niedziałkowski","uuid":"97C1F9B31B3C222BF0E4BD570D528DDF933931937CD882B0D4B2AB91E26BBEF54361BFF31355F21C2E21A0A4D1F0EB0FDE8A108FBC43DFFFDDCCA171E16B075A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8197-6333","documentHash":"7e7420df-a4f6-4715-8e7a-f68d765968d1"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398c9a","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Brzeska","uuid":"DA32C4363658846B6922E82710AFD7D6F500ED6D512D5D12DED7C407EA7CEF98C88E63BBDE7B7C52EFC4001EFCF40F6540BF53C9ADBD31C7D52955172B5A24D7","orcidId":"0000-0003-1212-0395","documentHash":"de16a4ad-f1f0-4ea8-af55-b784516c1162"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.saa.2023.122405"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CdS quantum dots","photoelectrocatalysis","TiO2 nanotubes","anticancer drugs"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b65ff","5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","5e7092b2878c28a04739aed8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Role of operating parameters in photoelectrocatalytic degradation of anticancer drugs: ifosfamide, 5-fluorouracil and imatinib using CdS/TiO2","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547caf6","mniswId":"13187","title":"Journal of Water Process Engineering","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2214-7144","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"87fbff2e-7ab1-434e-8c3d-4455e1b0050c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6572d1654097071b8e6dc844","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","5e7092b2878c28a04739aed8","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","5e70941c878c28a0473b65ff"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The ineffective removal of drugs in conventional wastewater treatment plants causes the search for new, effective and environmentally friendly methods. The promising alternatives consist photoelectrocatalysis. However, there is still lack of information about applied it for anticancer drugs removal and the influence of process conditions on its effectiveness. In the presented research CdS/TiO2 nanocomposite was applied in photoelectrocatalytic degradation of tree anticancer drugs: ifosfamide, 5-fluorouracil and imatinib. The effect of the process parameters such as applied potential, irradiation power, pH and conductivity of solution, drug concentration and presence of inorganic ions was investigated. It was shown that efficiency of drug degradation strongly increased with increasing irradiation power and with decreasing pH. The minor effect on the degradation efficiency of drug\nwas observed with changing the potential and conductivity of the solution. In turn, presence of Cl− , NO3− , HCO3− ,HPO42− in the treated solution acted as scavengers of hydroxyl radicals and decrease the decomposition rate. Studies on photoelectrocatalytic mechanism, shown that imatinib degradation occurs mainly as a result of holes\nactivity, with slightly lower contribution of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals. On the other hand, 5-fluorouracil was degraded mainly by the holes and hydroxyl radicals, the superoxide radicals had a marginal participation. Based on a identified by-products, degradation pathways for 5-fluorouracil and imatinib have been proposed. Finally, research confirmed decreasing eco-toxicity towards duckweed (Lemna minor) of drugs solutions treated by photoelectrocatalysis.

We utilized a dorsal skin wound model to further evaluate this epigenetic inhibitor in wound healing. Full-thickness excisional wounds were made on the dorsum of 2 and 10-month-old healthy BALB/c and 3 and 8-month-old diabetic (db/db) mice, followed by topical or intraperitoneal zebularine delivery. Depending on the strain, age, dose, and delivery, the zebularine treatments either had no effect or accelerated or delayed wound closure. In principle, zebularine applied topically moderately promoted wound closure in the healthy but markedly delayed in the diabetic mice, which was in line with decreased viability of cultured keratinocytes from diabetic patients exposed to zebularine. The histological analysis revealed an improvement in the architecture of restored skin in zebularine-treated mice, manifested as a distinct layered pattern resembling panniculus carnosus. The finding corresponds with the zebularine-mediated activation of the Wnt5a gene, an essential regulator of Wnt signaling, the pathway involved in hair follicle development, the process which in turn is connected with regenerative skin healing. Although zebularine did not remarkably accelerate wound healing, zebularine and other epigenetic inhibitors deserve further testing as potential drugs to improve the quality of restored skin."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219418","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1238-1248","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1002/term.3365","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d914fdbe831a38c33397","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Sachadyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c364b2a-3d0e-432a-a1df-f967c3c88b87"},{"objectId":"6777d914fdbe831a38c33396","name":"Michał","lastName":"Pikuła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bcaae81a-3ef1-423a-af10-26cb31244411"},{"objectId":"6777d914fdbe831a38c33395","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"767aaac0-2d4a-4ca5-8cf0-4c52c49093a7"},{"objectId":"6777d914fdbe831a38c33394","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Skoniecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3210c6ba-a43b-433c-9098-ca8691fbaaae"},{"objectId":"6777d914fdbe831a38c33393","name":"Milena","lastName":"Deptuła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"301e3f14-afb5-46b0-882c-d2f25a860e60"},{"objectId":"6777d914fdbe831a38c33392","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Kamińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd086cd3-f6b8-46b8-94e4-76f574e91f77"},{"objectId":"6777d914fdbe831a38c33391","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Sosnowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0e77277-7854-4734-b68b-9aa2bb628752"},{"objectId":"6777d914fdbe831a38c33390","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sass","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"775f6084-7955-400e-b233-14d1226f1bbc"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f4","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Rodziewicz-Motowidło","uuid":"DC1BA0FAC2CC1F07647DBDB64AFFC519F282E6ED5F74ED61933F2E6778A3E1B8AB4202511635282C89E36B6BD60DCC69643787FC203C73C6D7105C93FA51968A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4471-5951","documentHash":"78ad2a69-6641-4a64-9507-2d01299f8e34"}],"doi":"10.1002/term.3365"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["roboty mobilne","robotyka","zadania logistyczne","systemy intralogistyczne","sterowanie głosowe","ogniwa odwracalne","robotyka mobilna","akumulatorowe magazyny energii","roboty przemysłowe","sterowanie","przekładnie magnetyczne","zużycie energii"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["magnetic gears","intralogistics systems","voice control","industrial robots","robotics","reversible cells","logistic tasks","control","mobile robotics","mobile robots","energy consumption","battery energy storage"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-7880-897-8","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394aec"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Analiza, synteza i optymalizacja układów elektrycznych.

The focus of the study is the relationship between experiencing transformative learning in a pandemic and the sense of loneliness, received social support, sense of life satisfaction and age. Methods: The study was conducted among 258 educationally active women – part-time students, as well as students of the Universities of the Third Age. Age of the surveyed women: from 19 to 87 years. Data were collected using the online test method. A statistical significance of differences was tested with the U Mann-Whitney test and the two proportion z-test. Results: Most of the surveyed women manifested elements of transformative learning in their experience of the pandemic. Those scoring high on the Transformative Learning in a Pandemic Situation scale have had their life satisfaction decrease to a greater extent than those scoring low. The group scoring high on the Transformative Learning in a Pandemic Situation scale is characterised by a higher sense of loneliness. No relationship was found between perceived manifestations of transformative learning and age, social support, place of residence and education. Discussion: The transformative potential of learning can be seen in a pandemic situation. The obtained data provide arguments supporting the supposition that the feeling of loneliness, influencing the lowering of satisfaction from life, is a factor triggering learning and leading to the change of habits of thinking and acting of educationally active women."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219428","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d38e254097070bb2f8123d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"70","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"74978ec8-742c-41b8-a7fb-e2f81ade57ec"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"70","pagesFromTo":"57-67","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.15804/tner.2022.70.4.05","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473925a5","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kozerska","uuid":"68EBB9E06F1914DBACE59A592576B5EE6B5EBE0A0CDF3C596EB0813ECA036843CDCFF72A75E0CCC75E8DD738120B186587BF9ECE21393684EAB8894285B13582","orcidId":"0000-0001-6375-6495","documentHash":"763d602b-62b9-4728-8529-b1b5b2de729f"},{"objectId":"5e709220878c28a0473903f4","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Ciechanowska","uuid":"2793187EE64AE8020EF7672D6103EEF1E41E02A310C20541FBCF310D96DAF05FBC98A44BCA95EF9223F41D9585B440CBB28BB401871BE0ADDA740471A94BCDF3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a07122e-252b-4b70-8e3f-3d4e81b9a167"}],"doi":"10.15804/tner.2022.70.4.05"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ff54125085dcb38e917c8ac"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparative analysis of signal-to-noise ratio in correlation plenoptic imaging architectures","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c16","mniswId":"6314","title":"European Physical Journal Plus","doi":null,"issn":"2190-5444","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"f27572c7-72e1-439a-980c-2bbf494cd3c2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64079ab54097073534a5e4c6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ff54125085dcb38e917c8ac","6777c44efdbe831a38c28c75","6777c44efdbe831a38c28c76","6777c44efdbe831a38c28c77"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Correlation plenoptic imaging (CPI) is a scanning-free diffraction-limited 3D optical imaging technique exploiting the peculiar properties of correlated light sources.

Recent developments in computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and 3D printing have enabled the fabrication of digital indirect bonding (IDB) transfer trays. These modern products require thorough investigation.\n\nObjectives. The aim of the study was to determine the accuracy of one-piece and three-piece IDB transfer trays in vitro.\n\nMaterial and methods. An initial dental scan (IDS) of a randomly selected patient with digitally positioned brackets served as the master scan (MS) for designing 16 IDB transfer trays of each type. They were 3D printed and used for bonding 448 brackets to the models. Subsequently, the models were scanned with a TRIOS® 3 Intraoral Scanner (3Shape A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark), producing actual scans (ASs). The accuracy of bracket positioning was measured digitally on both MSs and ASs. The measurements were compared to the Objective Grading System for dental casts provided by the American Board of Orthodontics (ABO).\n\nResults. The 2 types of IDB transfer trays showed comparable accuracy. All linear errors were within the clinically acceptable range, whereas the angular measurements demonstrated significant variability, resulting in clinically unacceptable transfer errors that ranged from 3.3% to 90.3%.\n\nConclusions.

The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of SDS was determined by conductivity and fluorescence intensity measurements. The steady-state fluorescence quenching experiments with pyrene as a fluorescent probe were performed to obtain micellar aggregation numbers (Nagg) of the surfactant. The thermodynamic parameters of micellization (DG0\nmic for all studied systems; DH0mic and DS0mic for sodium 1-dodecanesufonate) have been determined and compared. The influence of alkyl chain length and concentration of the selected sodium\n1-alkylsulfonates on the values of CMC, Nagg, DG0mic, DH0mic, and DS0mic of SDS has been discussed. As it was found, all selected for the experiments electrolytes decrease significantly the CMC of the surfactant, while an opposite effect is observed for Nagg values. The obtained experimental results have been supported by theoretical calculations. Interestingly, it has been proven that solely the molecules of sodium 1-dodecanesufonate (of the same carbon chain length) may act as the SDS mimetics – they are not recognized by SDS as the ones with a different structure and consequently are allowed to participate in the\nformation of the surfactant’s micelles."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219444","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"377","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2023.121568","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d7f7fdbe831a38c30dc9","name":"Michal","lastName":"Olewniczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1c08ad7a-5d01-41f1-828f-540235317070"},{"objectId":"6030e36f9543c7410626f9d0","name":"Ola","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"3BCDC00482735B79CC6D6DDA0B7DC68AB8B8558A133E321E2B2C45593E6001635BF70E3B4EB969672A341D0C3423EB71D253F592A368D3BB64FF223EDA2721D6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6793-5415","documentHash":"55527068-6184-47cc-ab31-3b3a48073dc9"},{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b3011","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Żamojć","uuid":"6975FBFE8F7A22A7B7E1A5B035045C8722AEF50D5E57D8B09F2B53A1304957AD74827E1F3D2277B4CAF10EF48E97D6091375DA6BD1DA4831666516B326202BF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-4756-1927","documentHash":"e8b6d49e-cceb-4b64-9844-39bb141089af"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931fb","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wyrzykowski","uuid":"3B956F9C0B7686ED59275CFF3B8648BA8F9C3CB89F93EE35AB167E88A6838A0B159273F225F93E005C235A3E473106580C59CB88CEC569E4F34A6BC83DBE7B2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-3286","documentHash":"f1e4ddf0-1ffe-4622-a596-7c9ab1503df1"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931d9","name":"Lech","lastName":"Chmurzyński","uuid":"5DE37747545FFA3E7D4D9DA7CE005002C9325988FBF5001EC223FCCE05C50D288222ED2B9B92D1F67FAA3F8A4534DC57F4B433DD2A622E9FADC9A64213BEB246","orcidId":"0000-0003-2707-0255","documentHash":"2568cc1d-6dc7-4c01-9a64-35e360685da8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2023.121568"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CSS codes","asymmetric quantum codes","quantum error correction"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c836d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"New quantum codes from CSS codes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547948f","mniswId":"16926","title":"Quantum Information Processing","doi":null,"issn":"1570-0755","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"08e2fa9a-fe30-4bf8-b883-996bc3595b32"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657c2f244097076c14aa1051","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c836d"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a new propagation rule for CSS codes.

The new code enables us to run molecular dynamics simulations of protein systems with size exceeding 100,000 amino-acid residues, reaching over 1 ns/day (1 μs/day in all-atom timescale) with 24 cores for proteins of this size. Parallel performance of the code and comparison of its performance with that of AMBER, GROMACS and MARTINI 3 is presented."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219452","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"44","pagesFromTo":"602-625","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.27026","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d861fdbe831a38c31b51","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e36f12cf-8289-477b-8e10-b86903a8813c"},{"objectId":"6777d861fdbe831a38c31b50","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Czarnul","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2fafbec-c7dd-4511-af5c-563da7e0aa91"},{"objectId":"6777d861fdbe831a38c31b4f","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Proficz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e6e715af-3387-48c1-ac65-0abfdba09620"},{"objectId":"6777d861fdbe831a38c31b4e","name":"Krzysztof M.","lastName":"Ocetkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0587b64-eebc-41bc-8257-4a15fcb34495"},{"objectId":"6777d861fdbe831a38c31b4d","name":"Jordi","lastName":"Sans‐Duñó","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4fa4ea0-e23f-4767-bfdd-e25f69c6f430"},{"objectId":"5e70941f878c28a0473b6957","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sieradzan","uuid":"91AE28AA8E9D17E2D793BC99725763459D566DB75574D3AE619E73A99E2633E593F2BD8AEE441156BE0C8681790D7299421EA26448014A5C63D192ADECA7449B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2426-3644","documentHash":"42fb16aa-04a9-4e93-9f4e-02fe5a1a7d7e"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac255","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Lipska","uuid":"3A50E45C2D8335B786D27E5147BCD0922C2757074FFFBE588BF8553E7808CA179F1D01BA5B7059E13204CCA9D8DCD887D1F336AB42C6CADE3DBE7B81470CE1DF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75f3f468-2fcc-4c9d-890e-1774b88144ee"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac0f0","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Lubecka","uuid":"3B6D7FA32264608121ECC2A1EE740913759D6E51627E452F599D5ADDE6949D293EF7854B10A56977E5278404F09B86471733E83DD0AE7991BE5E050AC1C36265","orcidId":"0000-0003-2590-7269","documentHash":"393e02b4-daab-4233-aeaa-99f8042e5f1a"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393857","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Leszczyński","uuid":"8CFD7AC9FE728F630FEE9736CD4DC050648418B883FB35E74B3080D30AF13E8630E71088F5F614462C3D559E9F68940801B8F9C71639BE53B77DFCCC339B4738","orcidId":"0000-0003-1239-1910","documentHash":"b0abf059-5a72-44dd-9086-dd20d25a4205"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931ed","name":"Józef","lastName":"Liwo","uuid":"3B5D8B8662D4EACFC86FEF607377CFE9786BD92C4A5706A9E9F988196F33388BF9CD1799C90A4F4F4914448BA5CDE495B8C57ECD015581CB0EA2EA651E7F69DD","orcidId":"0000-0001-6942-2226","documentHash":"41611fe5-3cdf-4921-b6dd-7985a64b4e04"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931e3","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Czaplewski","uuid":"CCB86ADD3D404981FF354CC57AB2A185BF2B17B718FABC1DF8085749586CBF51E0D074ED075AE0371AE69D9080A6D8F7FB19A0DBD224B8CDDCC3363818A223F3","orcidId":"0000-0002-0294-3403","documentHash":"19f0c025-59cf-469f-a1f5-e91820f4cc1f"}],"doi":"10.1002/jcc.27026"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DFT and TD DFT calculations","design of chemiluminogen","acridinium derivatives","chemiluminescence reaction"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6777d84dfdbe831a38c318ae","5e7093f0878c28a0473b3bab"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"What other than acridinium esters?

Among these, non-lamellar lipid nanoparticles, notably cubosomes and hexosomes, showcase remarkable biocompatibility and stability, rendering them as optimal choices for theranostic applications. Particularly, incorporating edge activators like sodium taurocholate enhances the potential of these nanoparticles for dermal and transdermal drug delivery, overcoming the stratum corneum, a first line of defense in our skin. This study reports on the formulation of monoolein-based cubosomes and hexosomes incorporating taurocholate and stabilized by Span 80 and co-encapsulating Chlorin e6 and coenzyme QH for photodynamic therapy in skin metastatic melanoma. The formulations were optimized using small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryo-transmission electron microscopy confirmed the presence of cubosomes or hexosomes, depending on the ratio between taurocholate and Span 80. Furthermore, the co-loaded nanoparticles exhibited high encapsulation efficiencies for both Ce6 and the coenzyme QH. In vitro studies on human melanoma cells (Me45) demonstrated the biocompatibility and photodynamic activity of the loaded formulations. These findings show the possibility of formulating more biocompatible cubosomes and hexosomes for photodynamic therapy in skin cancer treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219471","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"677","pagesFromTo":"842-852","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002197972401909X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6776b7f3fdbe831a38ba3ea8","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Bazylińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"387be0d5-ffc4-4e0c-95be-e6e0c8ac5ec2"},{"objectId":"6776b7f3fdbe831a38ba3ea7","name":"Sergio","lastName":"Murgia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"74eead1d-4532-48f9-80ee-6f4c9f1e7507"},{"objectId":"6776b7f3fdbe831a38ba3ea6","name":"Peter","lastName":"Jönsson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f0b22e9f-5739-4615-81b0-c8266dfcb441"},{"objectId":"6776b7f3fdbe831a38ba3ea5","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Krautforst","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"886a3e04-8d87-4fb1-bccb-3adfabeae8b8"},{"objectId":"6776b7f3fdbe831a38ba3ea4","name":"Marco","lastName":"Fornasier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b9ebf425-2336-4ed6-ba2e-90895a89af3f"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1eb2","name":"Julita","lastName":"Kulbacka","uuid":"89F5F3BEF56B4A64B9BC60A721EA54D63EC87BA8F04E9C7A00FDEACD5FB5BC2D2B9205307431052D0508373A186A177F5472803C6473FD2F53F30FE93DD5970F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8272-5440","documentHash":"b50ad7c8-2652-43fc-aed0-9e38646ceea2"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jcis.2024.08.126"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["silanization","electrode modification","electrochemical measurements","conductive materials","FTO electrodes"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6777d7e1fdbe831a38c30b23","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef5","5e709419878c28a0473b6313","5e70924b878c28a0473931f1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Controlled silanization of transparent conductive oxides as a precursor of molecular recognition systems","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65760beb4097071b8ef36db1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b3878c28a04739aef5","5e70924b878c28a0473931f1","5e709419878c28a0473b6313","6777d7e1fdbe831a38c30b23"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The search for new molecular recognition systems has become the goal of modern electrochemistry. Creating a matrix in which properties can be controlled to obtain a desired analytical signal is an essential part of creating such tools. The aim of this work was to modify the surface of electrodes based on transparent conductive oxides with the use of selected alkoxysilanes (3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, trimethoxy(propyl)silane, and trimethoxy(octyl)silane). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry techniques, as well as contact angle measurements, were used to determine the properties of the obtained layers. Here, we prove that not only was the structure of alkoxysilanes taken into account but also the conditions of the modification process—reaction conditions (time and temperature), double alkoxysilane modification, and mono- and binary component modification. Our results enabled the identification of the parameters that are important to ensure the effectiveness of the modification process. Moreover, we confirmed that the selection of the correct alkoxysilane allows the surface properties of the electrode material to be controlled and, consequently, the charge transfer process at the electrode/solution interface, hence enabling the creation of selective molecular recognition

By analyzing the establishment of new rural settlements, the article seeksto identify patterns that shaped this process. The reconstruction of economic system required innovative approaches to land use, unfamiliar to traditional rural communities.

Prediction of adverse effects caused by substances without having to perform time- and cost-consuming experiments makes QSAR models promising tools for supporting risk assessment. However, very often, newly developed nano-QSAR models are not used in practice due to the complexity of their algorithms, the necessity to have experience in chemoinformatics, and their poor accessibility. In this perspective, the aim of this paper is to encourage developers of the QSAR models to take the effort to prepare user-friendly applications based on predictive models. This would make the developed models accessible to a wider community, and, in effect, promote their further application by regulators and decision-makers. Here, we describe a web-based application that enables to predict the transcriptomic pathway-level response perturbated in the lungs of mice exposed to multiwalled carbon nanotubes. The developed application is freely available at http://aop173-event1.nanoqsar-aop.com/apps/aop_app. It requires only two types of input information related to analyzed nanotubes (their length and diameter) to assess the doses that initiate the inflammation process that may lead to lung fibrosis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219509","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"183-194","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17435390.2022.2064250","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8b9fdbe831a38c328b8","name":"Ulla","lastName":"Vogel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2ba347f-75e2-4749-8dab-b16272db408e"},{"objectId":"6777d8b9fdbe831a38c328b7","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Halappanavar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ad24d49-2db2-460b-a94d-43fe9d27f83b"},{"objectId":"6777d8b9fdbe831a38c328b6","name":"Andrew","lastName":"Williams","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02c9bf3f-5062-4e66-a20d-c7711caf37eb"},{"objectId":"6777d8b9fdbe831a38c328b5","name":"Anna","lastName":"Rybińska-Fryca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9eefd5b9-1ba1-4c59-acce-c3690241c955"},{"objectId":"6777d8b9fdbe831a38c328b4","name":"Filip","lastName":"Stoliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ef4ce9c-4c20-478f-a266-f7d12e9f38ca"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af98f","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Jagiełło","uuid":"5734FC6644741754C8BA0C4917F46C6A95EFE99F2A4B8843FBEB5483C46C69B1277B06A2BA089CEC55D18EF309C6E8C0A345DE56C2F9B8D1E27508FAEB78A277","orcidId":"0000-0002-2730-6873","documentHash":"2eab8832-907e-4bbd-b7c1-a3b1c0a22b79"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aee7","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Puzyn","uuid":"7B0E9F3E23C8A780082379FC8C41BA69BDB353F92E111064F36B5BF9B429CD99886F4F472481ED89159392EE0190007729C932A710EDEAD43F560C9311852C06","orcidId":"0000-0003-0449-8339","documentHash":"427a0a47-79ff-4fc1-baf5-1042649e8c40"},{"objectId":"5e709299878c28a047398c63","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Gromelski","uuid":"8113FE9A6F644B11270EF190ECEAFAF93BDC390C37A41F0D4907D72C7CB406BB828E29D9100793A9AB1642BD7DD92A764C986D9CC025D7A469F2FB7B8D594765","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98e6818e-03c8-4528-a853-bd95287b949b"}],"doi":"10.1080/17435390.2022.2064250"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["heterogeneous photocatalysis","metal-organic frameworks","hydrothermal hydrolysis","photocatalytic reaction","NH2-MIL-125 (Ti)"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b65ff","6777d7c6fdbe831a38c306c0","5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","5e70925e878c28a04739474c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"MOF/TiO2 erythrocyte-like heterostructures decorated by noble metals for use in hydrogen photogeneration and pollutant photodegradation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477565","mniswId":"3329","title":"Catalysis Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"2044-4753","eissn":"2044-4761","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cabc062a-8772-49a6-a0c9-9904a2a851a0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"655cb0424097071dcb5bbd55","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","5e70941c878c28a0473b65ff","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","6777d7c6fdbe831a38c306c0","6777d7c6fdbe831a38c306c1","6777d7c6fdbe831a38c306c2","6777d7c6fdbe831a38c306c3"]},"issue":"17","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Various metal–organic framework (MOF)/TiO2 heterostructures can be obtained by the partial hydrolysis or calcination of Ti-based MOFs. By adjusting the hydrolysis and calcination steps of NH2-MIL-125 (Ti), a novel photoactive material composed of a MOF (NH2-MIL-125 (Ti)) and TiO2, with a unique “erythrocyte” shape, was developed. Furthermore, modification of the composition prepared by the partial hydrolysis of NH2-MIL-125 (Ti) (h-MOF) using Au, Ag, Pt, or Pd metal nanoparticles resulted in a significant increase in the efficiency of hydrogen photogeneration. Higher photocatalytic properties are associated with the excitation of MOFs and TiO2, electron transfer, and electron accumulation on nanoparticles. Using the optimal h-MOF/Au photocatalyst, 117 μmol g−1 h−1 of hydrogen was produced. On the other hand, composites (ch-MOFs) obtained by calcination of h-MOFs after modification with Au showed high efficiency in the photodegradation of phenol under the threshold of visible radiation (over 42 μmol dm−3 h−1).

There are countless structural features of guest molecules responsible for the efficiency of guest–CD interactions. Among these factors, the hydrophobic moieties of a guest and their size are commonly considered to govern its binding affinity to CD molecules. Experimentally, it is often challenging to extract structural and dynamic information at the atomic scale about CD inclusion complexes, especially in the aqueous phase. Therefore, this study consisted of experimental (isothermal titration calorimetry and conductometric titration) and in silico analysis to rigorously characterize the interactions of β -CD with three alkyl sulfates of different hydrophobic chain lengths: sodium dodecyl sulfate (S12S), sodium decyl sulfate (S10S) and sodium octyl sulfate (S8S) in aqueous solutions. We find that the hydrophobic interactions are not always a key factor leading to the formation of stable inclusion complexes. Our results demonstrate that van der Waals interactions contribute more to complexation efficiency for sulfates with a longer hydrophobic tail, whereas electrostatic interactions are more pronounced for sulfates with shorter ones. Furthermore, we propose and discuss for the first time the putative mechanisms of the guest entering the host cavity conditioned by the lengths of hydrocarbon chains of alkyl sulfates. Finally, we prove that different types of inclusion complexes can exist in a conformational equilibrium depending on the size of a guest tail."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219519","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"364","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2022.119978","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8cdfdbe831a38c32b0b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kogut","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e55fe609-dbd2-4780-a23d-df7a4180a28e"},{"objectId":"6030e36f9543c7410626f9d0","name":"Ola","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"3BCDC00482735B79CC6D6DDA0B7DC68AB8B8558A133E321E2B2C45593E6001635BF70E3B4EB969672A341D0C3423EB71D253F592A368D3BB64FF223EDA2721D6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6793-5415","documentHash":"55527068-6184-47cc-ab31-3b3a48073dc9"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Samsonov","uuid":"0A696C8802E71A3A89F3AF367E2CEA8CC0EA07478D60E9F4C08683C9707E2904AFE17930A29C903F2FFC8DA1032E57DEF00B2199857435DB613F28F5CF334581","orcidId":"0000-0002-5166-4849","documentHash":"736332c7-8850-4b23-9312-3e4bab0971fa"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931fb","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wyrzykowski","uuid":"3B956F9C0B7686ED59275CFF3B8648BA8F9C3CB89F93EE35AB167E88A6838A0B159273F225F93E005C235A3E473106580C59CB88CEC569E4F34A6BC83DBE7B2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-3286","documentHash":"f1e4ddf0-1ffe-4622-a596-7c9ab1503df1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2022.119978"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-3-031-65706-1","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Public policy in democratic backsliding: how illiberal populists engage with the policy process","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":388,"publicationPlace":"Cham","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67694251fdbe8317b9a13fcb","editors":[{"objectId":"67694d72fdbe831a381c2178","name":"Alexandre","lastName":"de Ávila Gomide","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98582f23-6621-4890-94f1-289a6e89ebf9"},{"objectId":"67694d72fdbe831a381c2177","name":"Michelle","lastName":"Morais de Sá e Silva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ef512e5-cb68-434b-b5e5-70aa5a3947fb"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["67694d72fdbe831a381c2177","67694d72fdbe831a381c2178"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060219521","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":"2524-7301","series":"International Series on Public Policy","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb885","mniswId":"46100","name":"Palgrave Macmillan","documentHash":"bbef3f09-e653-452e-b7e6-8ca04f79b40e"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-65707-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-65707-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e3c","6777c3fdfdbe831a38c2722c","614e8e559543c7051ff01d77","5e7094f9878c28a0473c81e5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Contextuality with vanishing coherence and maximal robustness to dephasing","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479263","mniswId":"16085","title":"Physical Review A","doi":null,"issn":"2469-9926","eissn":"2469-9934","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"54b87290-dbb9-4444-b60a-e639b708ae87"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657327e94097071b8e700475","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["614e8e559543c7051ff01d77","5e7094f9878c28a0473c81e5","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e3c","6777c3fdfdbe831a38c2722c"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Generalized contextuality is a resource for a wide range of communication and information processing protocols.

In this work, for the first time, Pb-free Bi-based perovskites of the Cs3Bi2X9 type (X = Cl, Br, I, Cl/Br, Cl/I, Br/I) were synthesized and subjected to comprehensive morphological, structural, and surface analyses, and photocatalytic properties in the phenol degradation reaction were examined. Furthermore, the most promising Pb-free Bi-based Cs3Bi2X9 perovskites (i.e., structures that present an optimal combination of structural features and efficiency) were selected using a machine learning based virtual screening methodology and enriched with the C3N4 composite. The selected and designed Cs3Bi2 (Cl/Br)9 structures were in line with the “safe and sustainable by design” approach and applied for the first time in the aforementioned reaction, which allowed for approximately 84% efficiency under visible light. The main merit of this achievement was the optimum deposition of perovskite Cs3Bi2(Cl/Br)9 (5 wt%) on the C3N4 matrix, which resulted in approximately a two-fold increase in the apparent quantum efficiency of the composite compared with that of bare C3N4 (at an excitation wavelength of 430 nm)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219532","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"588","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.152921","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8f5fdbe831a38c32fc7","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Trykowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9ff4377-7fdb-43e8-a1b8-b763b016e68e"},{"objectId":"6777d8f5fdbe831a38c32fc6","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Lisowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cb1e9d6-8be5-455f-bfe4-505721be3ce3"},{"objectId":"6777d8f5fdbe831a38c32fc5","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Klimczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ef13e0c-f1ec-41c7-aa29-5d3bc4be3533"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bda","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Miodyńska","uuid":"EA844FA4EE04FEE606AD0F0DD6A30974146CE0BCD98967FCB1FCF7BD0C44FB3003CFD2C14DB4590DDF74E4EB3D55F3639A9AA934E9026CB2883ABB99FE2E3714","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18b3a057-330e-431e-b6b7-3be8be4ec391"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Mazierski","uuid":"A09D3289B3EBAAB858589FE7FCAEC79094A621B893156BB9EC699995BBDDCB7EBB90B01E7344D3F3FF8FF125A2D612AC988F25F8F5EA94186B8051B00684CAA6","orcidId":"0000-0002-8674-0151","documentHash":"b42e86b1-4768-416f-a0cf-bee63e7faaa6"},{"objectId":"5e7092cb878c28a04739cd61","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"46EEB7B7CCFA45A00B605E85781827E195D2A2608EDBFB606688EF443C8F8E307EC478D676761696256B21876EF5228CB3239FAA4E1E9D606F8E716850986E8B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0019-8323","documentHash":"cc089db8-1760-4096-a98e-897dd56733c9"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a04739474c","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Zaleska-Medynska","uuid":"FCC1A188E4F2AF56B568174FA189B741DCD83D0C831507B0115F615AEA31FC25C15AC5D683567B55D8E2D6F3A8CB9FDCE763EDABC58888F77D798CBE56855EAD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3817-296X","documentHash":"6dbe2d0a-b017-47cf-9762-4a9dd31b42d8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.152921"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["domination","2-domination","spanning tree"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b416","5e7092de878c28a04739e693"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Spanning trees with disjoint 2 dominating and 2-dominating sets","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477980","mniswId":"5131","title":"Discussiones Mathematicae -

It is known that the chemical groups attached to GAGs and GAG conformations comprise “glycocodes” that are not yet fully deciphered. The molecular context also matters for GAG structures and functions, and the influence of the structure and functions of the proteoglycan core proteins on sulfated GAGs and vice versa warrants further investigation. The lack of dedicated bioinformatic tools for mining GAG data sets contributes to a partial characterization of the structural and functional landscape and interactions of GAGs. These pending issues will benefit from the development of new approaches reviewed here, namely (i) the synthesis of GAG oligosaccharides to build large and diverse GAG libraries, (ii) GAG analysis and sequencing by mass spectrometry (e.g., ion mobility-mass spectrometry), gas-phase infrared spectroscopy, recognition tunnelling nanopores, and molecular modeling to identify bioactive GAG sequences, biophysical methods to investigate binding interfaces, and to expand our knowledge and understanding of glycocodes governing GAG molecular recognition, and (iii) artificial intelligence for in-depth investigation of GAGomic data sets and their integration with proteomics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219548","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"628-656","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.2c00569","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d84afdbe831a38c3185c","name":"Sylvie

manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is beginning to play an unprecedented role in developing many applications for industrial or personalized products. The conductive composite structures require additional treatment to achieve an electroactive surface useful for electrochemical devices. In this paper, the surfaces of carbon black/poly(lactic acid) CB-PLA printouts were activated by electrolysis or enzymatic digestion with proteinase K, or a simultaneous combination of both. The proposed modification protocols allow the tailoring of electrochemically active surfaces and electron transfer kinetics determined by electrochemical techniques (CV, EIS) by [Fe(CN)6]4-/3- redox probe. X-ray photon spectroscopy and SEM imaging were applied to determine the delivered surface chemistry. CB-PLA hydrolysis under alkaline conditions and anodic polarization greatly impacted the charge transfer kinetics. The enzymatic hydrolysis of PLA with proteinase K led to highly efficient results, yet requires an unsatisfactory prolonged activation duration of 72 h, which can be efficiently reduced by electrolysis carried out in the presence of the enzyme. Our studies hint that the activation protocol originates from surface electropolymerization rather than a synergistic interaction between the electrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis. The detailed mechanism of CB-PLA hydrolysis supported by electrolysis is a promising new route to achieve time-efficient and environmentally-friendly activation procedure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219556","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"574","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151587","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8d3fdbe831a38c32bb5","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Ryl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"10303388-f871-4c9d-9d0f-61e95d570a2f"},{"objectId":"6777d8d3fdbe831a38c32bb4","name":"Robert","lastName":"Bogdanowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f73d2bee-3066-40b9-a281-93ba6e9f3377"},{"objectId":"6777d8d3fdbe831a38c32bb3","name":"Robert","lastName":"Tylingo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4f06a81-db4a-4f27-9873-00ba4fe1b5ad"},{"objectId":"6777d8d3fdbe831a38c32bb2","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Mania","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fff28121-be5a-4c87-88c4-d395ce188e23"},{"objectId":"6777d8d3fdbe831a38c32bb1","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Kaczmarzyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b5a1ad5-7104-4bd0-acfb-9d9e09b656cc"},{"objectId":"60139bdf9543c74f83155154","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Koterwa","uuid":"400780C52B06D65C32FB13EC359748F71806009449E8806DDF6239D5CEEB514A415687281DEC68C59FAB8914F5FCEB33C874D331256AEB82646F293BCAB0FA3B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7058-277X","documentHash":"6e9cd20b-b55c-44ef-9b20-342de0bec827"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac0d3","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Cieślik","uuid":"1162EE0BA2C2331386FF98171D0ABF7A583815E86E752D5ED7FC9CEBCB0A858E004AE95AEFBEE8C00F2F3D6829A9D263F0B22423A183E0AF4D9D2121C38657E3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0e93e4b-7c0d-4c6b-8aad-06f69380deb7"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aeeb","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Niedziałkowski","uuid":"97C1F9B31B3C222BF0E4BD570D528DDF933931937CD882B0D4B2AB91E26BBEF54361BFF31355F21C2E21A0A4D1F0EB0FDE8A108FBC43DFFFDDCCA171E16B075A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8197-6333","documentHash":"7e7420df-a4f6-4715-8e7a-f68d765968d1"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f1","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Ossowski","uuid":"28AE09C821467501D038B63061B4F4EAB00F089F1EA6EBC4904099BEDB60C0485FFD5462992EBB95F6AF6F16B564731C5953E2B0E31E55FA329E9114FA09672A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0468-0133","documentHash":"6b0911ce-1d2b-401d-82f9-2153682000fb"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151587"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","uid":"bkIJHJpQNKsrvtM8Wh9DD9w","uuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","parentUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","rootUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","name":"Akademia Pożarnicza","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709360878c28a0473a85f0","6776fb83fdbe831a38ba748c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"ANALIZA WPŁYWU WYBRANYCH ZAGROŻEŃ NA KSZTAŁT EDUKACJI DLA BEZPIECZEŃSTWA W WOJEWÓDZTWIE MAZOWIECKIM","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eba59","mniswId":"201372","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Pro Publico Bono","doi":null,"issn":"2719-3403","eissn":"2720-2216","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"7afb1cd8-ef03-4f99-8834-671300f6c230"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6776fb83fdbe831a38ba748b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6776fb83fdbe831a38ba748c","5e709360878c28a0473a85f0"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"<jats:p>Artykuł swoim zakresem obejmuje tematykę wpływu współczesnych zagrożeń na kształtowanieedukacji dla bezpieczeństwa.

Fundamentally, this tension should result in breaking one of the fundamental principles of quantum theory or general relativity, but it is usually hard to assess which one without resorting to a specific model. Here, we answer this question in a theory-independent way using General Probabilistic Theories (GPTs). We consider the interactions of the gravitational field with a single matter system, and derive a no-go theorem showing that when gravity is classical at least one of the following assumptions needs to be violated: (i) Matter degrees of freedom are described by fully non-classical degrees of freedom; (ii) Interactions between matter degrees of freedom and the gravitational field are reversible; (iii) Matter degrees of freedom back-react on the gravitational field. We argue that this implies that theories of classical gravity and quantum matter must be fundamentally irreversible, as is the case in the recent model of Oppenheim et al.

Although the reaction mechanism and the\nconstruction of simple reactors have been known to mankind for over 100 years, it is\nin recent years that the greatest increase in interest in this field can be noted. New\nand better reactor construction projects are constantly being developed.\nModifications are not only the types and forms of materialsfrom which the electrodes\nare made, but also the separation methods, the form of the electrolyte or the method\nof current flow. Such a wide range of innovations allowed for the development of\nnew, more and more interesting applications for these processes. The presence of\nelectrochemical methods can be seen in industry in the processes of obtaining\nchemical reagents, metals and more complex compounds, such as drugs, and also\nrefining metals by galvanization. In addition, electrochemistry is used in many\nanalytical instruments as a sensor, for example in pH measurements. The aspect of\nusing electrochemical reactors for energy purposes as a source of electricity\ngeneration that does not emit harmful pollutants and does not require further use of\nfossil fuels is also becoming more and more important. In addition, thanks to\nelectrolysis, there is also the possibility of generating hydrogen, which, apart from\nmany other applications, is also starting to play an increasingly important role as a\nnew, harmless fuel. One should also not forget about developing the possibility of\nwastewater treatment with greater efficiency than the existing treatment methods,\nespecially of small amounts of compounds.

In this work, we show that 6IdU is unstable in an aqueous solution. Indeed, a complete disappearance of the 6IdU signal was observed during its isolation by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). As indicated by the thermodynamic characteristics for the SN1-type hydrolysis of 6IdU obtained at the CAM-B3LYP/DGDZVP++ level and the polarizable continuum model (PCM) of water, 6-iodouracil (6IU) was already released quantitatively at ambient temperatures. The simulation of the hydrolysis kinetics demonstrated that a thermodynamic equilibrium was reached within seconds for the title compound. To assess the reliability of the calculations carried out, we synthesized 6-iodouridine (6IUrd), which was, unlike 6IdU, sufficiently stable in an aqueous solution at room temperature. The activation barrier for the N-glycosidic bond dissociation in 6IUrd was estimated experimentally using an Arrhenius plot.

However, bacteria quickly learn how to minimize the effects of antibiotics and strengthen their resistance. Thus, the fight against them becomes more and more difficult and there is a constant search for new bactericidal compounds. It is important in this type of search to determine the basic properties of compounds such as pKa, hydrogen bond formation, or hydrophobicity. Here, we present the results of our in silico study of five sulfonamide derivatives differing in alkylamine substituent length. Based on our results, we propose a model of three possible pKa values for each of the studied compounds. Interestingly, the use of Muckerman’s approach for pKa determination exhibits that theoretical and experimental results are in very good agreement. Intramolecular hydrogen bond formation affects pKa. The strength of the H-bond interaction increases from ethyl to butylamine and then decreases with the elongation of the alkylamine chain. The obtained partition coefficients (expressed here in the value of log P) increase with the number of carbon atoms in the alkylamine chain following Lipinski’s rule of five. The presented results provide important structural, physicochemical, and thermodynamic information that allows for the understanding of the influence of some sulfonamides and their possible activity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219586","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"127","pagesFromTo":"6620-6627","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"603090b69543c7410626f7e0","name":"Aleksandra ","lastName":"Ciesielska","uuid":"AF4C90BDD66359DABDDD823AAAB20A82A524F659ACE445ED16D4362566F818F89D3717DB3722FCA10CBE771A0251CDAD6E0DC5FA53AEC7EDC7218AFC8C7BE9EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0268-4210","documentHash":"61f47998-6a8e-4a1d-9430-b3da2384b9f0"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bca","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Brzeski","uuid":"FAED33494D37CE004F641B051750CA215890B2295C5164001673B9AAD4A6E26146BF7EB4F5C7959FC9C345105B0FDB221F79E473D4D62ECDB4A1F936C31CE7D5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4865-0152","documentHash":"7894c70f-7210-4114-8f18-cc96882ca6dd"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a047393205","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Makowski","uuid":"E572F07D910A19F7E4E44837E152E5ECF8463F14EFBFFC1E36F7386CBEDF3574CD21C3C1F83C890527B8A6DCF2C38FF71445B623C6A9742AE62F60572D7EB3A2","orcidId":"0000-0002-7342-722X","documentHash":"05e3ddb0-c8cc-4193-89b7-00cbaa44215e"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c01965"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Glycosaminoglycans","coarse-grained modeling","Procathepsin S maturation","electrostatic driven interactions"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"In silico insights into procathepsin S maturation mediated by glycosaminoglycans","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788ab","mniswId":"11909","title":"Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling","doi":null,"issn":"1093-3263","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b4b2febb-513c-4955-8196-66917160d45f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6572d2aa4097071b8e6dde4e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bd2","5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Procathepsins, inactive precursors of cathepsins are present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and in lysosomes.\nTheir active forms are involved in a number of biologically relevant processes, including bone resorption,\nintracellular proteolysis and regulation of programmed cell death.

Demonstrated limitations of this model for the passive sampling of pharmaceuticals from water were presented. Most notably, the contribution of the protective membrane in the resistance to mass transfer of lipophilic analytes and the well documented effect of external parameters on sampling rates contributed to the greatest uncertainty in PS application. The diffusion gradient in thin layer (DGT) technique seems to reduce the effect of external parameters (e.g., flow rate) to some degree. The laboratory-determined integrative uptake periods over defined sampler deployments was compared, and the discrepancy found suggests that the most popular Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) could in some cases utilized as an equilibrium sampler. This assertion is supported by own calculations for three pharmaceuticals with extremely different lipophilic characters. Finally, the reasons performance reference compounds (PRCs) are not recommended for the reduction in uncertainty of the TWAC found by adsorptive samplers were presented. It was concluded that techniques of passive sampling of pharmaceuticals need a new uptake model to fit the current situation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219594","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"52","pagesFromTo":"1386-1407","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10408347.2021.1881755","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b1443","name":"Magda","lastName":"Caban","uuid":"3A4AA2A083920B5A2B0B1ADA5F526E06D289257CFBF3DB65EB5F3402846AA1FB23F52D1FCB67013DA7696139A79349244CAAA9984E81DD447145F3B9D20E53BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8040-5862","documentHash":"4b533442-142a-47f7-ba96-547e1c3f7fff"},{"objectId":"5e709299878c28a047398c53","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Lis","uuid":"DE44D6AC191C09FDB9C996C2291B9CC45BBED2D92F437F321E12EE15DDE9E3C571E5AD25F88E6702AFD74E1721C779B950A9DCAB57E7F62C0FBC293F5C543729","orcidId":"0000-0001-9580-6098","documentHash":"31724210-a0f2-47eb-8a7f-0176d9e53f30"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739320a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Stepnowski","uuid":"6E1315A45E3C8D09C3EE267052AAD1C60A569A460874126B8373B3B6D2F586BD5705BEA16397F24679657E1320E2E894A863F6233606B6B575C78426A27C7BB0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ecfa3c4-0c71-4746-9745-712eaf025413"}],"doi":"10.1080/10408347.2021.1881755"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["generalised probabilistic theories","quasiprobabilities","duotensors","non-signalling channels"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e3c","6777c428fdbe831a38c27e6c","5e7094f9878c28a0473c81e5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Decomposing all multipartite non-signalling channels via quasiprobabilistic mixtures of local channels in generalised probabilistic theories","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a7","mniswId":"12292","title":"Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical","doi":null,"issn":"1751-8113","eissn":"1751-8121","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"52332bcb-2c2e-4c18-9a05-4c851efbe063"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6576cb3e4097071b8ef78b32","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c81e5","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e3c","6777c428fdbe831a38c27e6c","6777c428fdbe831a38c27e6d"]},"issue":"40","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Non-signalling quantum channels-relevant in, e.g., the study of Bell and Einstein-Podolsky–Rosen scenarios-may be decomposed as an affine combinations of local operations in bipartite scenarios. Moreover, when these channels correspond to stochastic maps between classical variables, such a decomposition is possible even in multipartite scenarios. These two results have proven useful when studying the properties of these channels, such as their communication and information processing power, and even when defining measures of the non-classicality of physical phenomena (such as Bell non-classicality and steering). In this paper we show that such useful quasi-stochastic characterizations of channels may be unified and applied to the broader class of multipartite non-signalling channels. Moreover, we show that this holds for non-signalling channels in quantum theory, as well as in a larger family of generalised probabilistic theories. More precisely, we prove that channels are non-signalling if and only if they can be decomposed as an affine combinations of corresponding local operations, provided that the underlying physical theory is locally tomographic-a property that quantum theory satisfies. Our results then can be viewed as a generalisation of references (Phys. Rev. Lett. 111 170403) and (2013 Phys. Rev.

Due to the complexity of the pathogenesis of these diseases, there are still many open questions regarding their etiology. Therefore, scientists unceasingly search for new data hoping to detect dependable biomarkers and design safe and effective treatment. The research on immune checkpoints is in line with these scientific and clinical demands. Immune checkpoints may be the key to understanding the pathogenesis of many immunological disorders. BTLA-HVEM complex, the inhibitory immune checkpoint, has recently caught scientific attention as an important regulator in different immune contexts, including autoreactivity. So far, the BTLA-HVEM complex has been mainly studied in the context of cancer, but as numerous data show, it may also be a target in the treating of autoimmune diseases. In this review, we intend to focus on the mechanisms of BTLA-HVEM interactions in immune cells and summarize the available data in the context of autoimmunity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219618","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"376","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cellimm.2022.104532","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d93afdbe831a38c33ae5","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wardowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb1d818e-cf47-4b0c-ad3d-4d4449915fe2"},{"objectId":"6777d93afdbe831a38c33ae4","name":"Katarzyna A.","lastName":"Lisowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46dd7a7b-449f-4cf1-b999-38a5ed97f7df"},{"objectId":"6777d93afdbe831a38c33ae3","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Wojciechowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d5c5e7b-c56c-4b5a-a930-db32db8311db"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa727","name":"Marta","lastName":"Spodzieja","uuid":"99BDBB3CD454F7CDE8D28762645F589F400BD0782059226ECC70CF76BC56AB2ACA220D860041F48B078AF0BEDA63E3A4AB639F1D295ED2B1F48DB4ABAB625A88","orcidId":"0000-0003-2712-0048","documentHash":"5a88587f-4126-4960-8202-c2861b5c4872"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cellimm.2022.104532"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["drugs","degradation products","metabolites","emerging contaminants","toxicity","stability","bioconcentration"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b80f1","5e70924b878c28a04739320a","6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e58","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e59","6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e5b","6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e5a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Transformation products of pharmaceuticals in the environment: their fate, (eco)toxicity and bioaccumulation potential","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6572d13f4097071b8e6dc611","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924b878c28a04739320a","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","5e709434878c28a0473b80f1","6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e58","6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e59","6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e5a","6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e5b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nowadays, a huge scientific attention is being paid to the chemicals of emerging concern, which may pose a significant risk to the human and whole ecosystems. Among them, residues of pharmaceuticals are a widely investigated group of chemicals. In recent years it has been repeatedly demonstrated that pharmaceuticals are present in the environment and that some of them can be toxic to organisms as well as accumulate in their tissues. However, even though the knowledge of the presence, fate and possible threats posed by the parent forms of pharmaceuticals is quite extensive, their transformation products (TPs) have been disregarded for long time. Since last few years, this aspect has gained more scientific attention and recently published papers proved their common presence in the environment. Also the interest in terms of their toxicity, bioconcentration and stability in the environment has increased. Therefore, the aim of our paper was to revise and assess the current state of knowledge on the fate and effects resulting from the presence of the pharmaceuticals' transformation drugs in the environment. This review discusses the metabolites of compounds belonging to six major pharmaceutical groups: SSRIs, anticancer drugs, antibiotics, antihistamines, NSAIDs and opioids, additionally discussing other individual compounds for which literature data exist. The data presented in this paper prove that some TPs may be as harmful as their native forms, however for many groups of drugs this data is still insufficient to assess the risk posed by their presence in the environment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219620","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"802","pagesFromTo":"1-31","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e5b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Toński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ffece79-2c39-41a5-a959-90460abcab8d"},{"objectId":"6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e5a","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Świacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1857a7d8-204d-4610-b83a-8a8943a8b647"},{"objectId":"6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e59","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ce7c4bd-b5ef-48d9-8a51-bf85cbb2ef27"},{"objectId":"6777d8e9fdbe831a38c32e58","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Maculewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58ab9065-098f-4abe-9e1a-128e4a789da7"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b80f1","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Dołżonek","uuid":"55474A74C6FD6C5698541C4A2E8D2DF071955D9642A49DFECF0DF1EE21D6159AB8BAA17381BAF5C1D478682FACEF2F74D7A17D0E8BE574FC29D0A31952D74F80","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94d1d69c-9fde-48e3-893b-7430013bc516"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Białk-Bielińska","uuid":"9E8640A84BE9C2C8F6ECE5DC189616D83275B51761F908B5D8E28A506342BC6B9E0E419EA45044698C596073F9588A5A8E6FB50837AD4C2D797ED8C5DA9DE62C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8304991e-5722-4b70-8065-b3f551596db8"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739320a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Stepnowski","uuid":"6E1315A45E3C8D09C3EE267052AAD1C60A569A460874126B8373B3B6D2F586BD5705BEA16397F24679657E1320E2E894A863F6233606B6B575C78426A27C7BB0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ecfa3c4-0c71-4746-9745-712eaf025413"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149916"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA2MDIxOTYyMA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
