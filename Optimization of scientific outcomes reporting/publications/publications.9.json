It was shown that theSNP g.-671C>G (NC_037336.1: g.72224078C>G) in theSLC2A12gene could be an effectivemarker of cattle production traits and that genotypes CC and CG are associated with thebest productivity. The polymorphisms found in theSLC5A1gene promoter also influencedmilk production traits in HF cows, albeit to a lesser extent, and we propose that these poly-morphisms could be useful as genetic markers for milk production traits in marker-assistedselection (MAS); however, this must be confirmed on larger populations of cattle.

This can present in the skin as a late symptom of the disease or as a manifestation of an undetected, asymptomatic RCC. AIM: To review the literature and present a case study of cutaneous metastasis in primary genitourinary malignancy, especially RCC in order to broaden the related knowledge. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The first stage of our work was focused on presenting the results of the literature review about cutaneous metastasis in the patients with renal cell carcinoma. Next, taking into account that this type of metastasis associated with RCC is relatively rare, we have decided to present a patient aged 68 with incidentally detected skin metastases of RCC located on the scalp. RESULTS: It was diagnosed as a primary manifestation of advanced disease. Computed tomography scans showed a solid mass in the left kidney. Following surgical excision of the skin lesion, a left-side nephrectomy was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous metastases of RCC present an unfavourable prognosis, however, remission is possible subsequent to early diagnosis and appropriate surgical excision."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057241364","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6353ab2a4097070bd14bfe32","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"39","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"c1563db8-f43c-4dbe-9854-70fa75c0ce6f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"553-558","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Cutaneous-metastasis-as-the-first-sign-of-renal-cell-r-ncarcinoma-crossroad-between-literature-analysis-r-nand-own-observations,7,44889,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b5c1712467f02b702ff63e","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Przybyła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"556503fd-7acc-44c0-8067-32f899ad305b"},{"objectId":"5e709464878c28a0473bc16a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Balawender","uuid":"59F4F8F5BB9ABB299C2B3A72960ED8F27F417DB174FCBD244297205E694BEE13FD773AFAA5BAA5C98EDEA20FB5F24194FD94590903B67C0E4A5766F9C33F2AC8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8706-1927","documentHash":"e69c914f-0733-473f-86bf-fd3b877540bd"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae511","name":"Beniamin","lastName":"Grabarek","uuid":"E99AB7B3936AC2F1AAD1A2CAEF107FABEAF839206BEDF3B8E8E67F769C188A4D6E163E27199206DBE75163A287425634BE588464568AD3DB7CD7449C050E45DB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1633-7145","documentHash":"c6387056-1829-451c-b531-42bb1b624d33"},{"objectId":"5e709303878c28a0473a1143","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Boroń","uuid":"C59C50D3F2A0CF82AFC81F315BE7133790483653068AEE400467DB9FDD073A05D9AEE0CDFD91F6EED5287CE9AD510299448F490D6405AC1AA426260F57261DD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2691-5829","documentHash":"dce4030d-d1e5-48ed-a3d5-31c0e7ac68d6"},{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e72b","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Orkisz","uuid":"C8AC3395827864A7504F46CE6EC8D83A86C1EA5BDD84B80781A7DBCC4523D724BE3472A8B1AB3ABCF07C64B7B3DFD6D3882F19EEB83036FA5983C5913A9C78A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-8526-2311","documentHash":"73ac7318-1953-4465-9d68-b4de333a1132"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390b73","name":"Agata","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"809BB4AC9DEA59DB182DF616D217B855607530D8CFB3C951EEA3E4426C197EEDDC4CC8031ED69A1D7963A7F271E5B8BEF0A57701F1CA05C2B249A3FBCECFA30F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8568-1770","documentHash":"324aa010-64e5-4fd9-925b-89e5b71c55a7"}],"doi":"10.5114/ada.2021.108275"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["international tourism","domestic tourism","geography","big data","dasymetric mapping","Airbnb"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Combining conventional statistics and big data to map global tourism destinations before COVID-19","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478baf","mniswId":"13096","title":"Journal of Travel Research","doi":null,"issn":"0047-2875","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"3e30ac30-a362-4b17-bcbc-c11e34716260"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2021-10-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ac98a22467f032cc01d9ed","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709439878c28a0473b8673","5e7092c1878c28a04739c170"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) is the major source of internationally comparable data on tourism. However, UNWTO data has two drawbacks: it focuses on international trips and ignores differences between regions within individual countries. Alternative sources of big data are increasingly used to enhance tourism statistics. In this paper, we combine traditional information sources with gridded population dataset and Airbnb data to address the limitations of UNWTO statistics. We produce a map of world tourism destinations measured by the number of tourism visits and tourism expenditure in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. We then identify hot spots of tourism and compare the level of spatial concentration of tourism to that of global population and economy. The results illustrate how supply and demand shape the global distribution of tourism, highlight the dominance of domestic travels in global tourism mobility and may help planning tourism policy in the face of current global challenges."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057243648","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"1848-1871","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00472875211051418","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b8673","name":"Czesław","lastName":"Adamiak","uuid":"A0DB51B1148D6A3C95A24CF966DFB140BCAFADE290820D37C89A3C0DF2EC770F41CA03B64211E978A1581BF20D5A986B8939088527937CB4E53608A80C9C83E7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3307-5079","documentHash":"fb746a3c-4b91-4af2-b385-9b0ba35f643c"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c170","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Szyda","uuid":"AD6753F357B4387695D5F78C25D31AE28BBDCA78A3197280D24D2E2875AC3334806AF67B2E141D28A4C3F3D77D09E5432C648D31392192162D139B268A08411E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9221-6284","documentHash":"556db212-41bd-4110-a0b2-7cda1e6e68ae"}],"doi":"10.1177/00472875211051418"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["antybiotyki","elektroforeza kapilarna","spektrometria mas","metabolity","próbki moczu"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antibiotic drugs","capillary electrophoresis","mass spectrometry","metabolites","urine samples"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"CE‐DAD‐MS/MS in the simultaneous determination and identification of selected antibiotic drugs and their metabolites in human urine samples","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a7c","mniswId":"5584","title":"Electrophoresis","doi":null,"issn":"0173-0835","eissn":"1522-2683","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8d239cb9-72a4-4b47-af3f-57b82b05b7b1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ac98212467f032cc01bfa4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde90","5e7092bf878c28a04739bf3c","5e709349878c28a0473a6742","5e7092bd878c28a04739bdb6","5e709425878c28a0473b7287","5e709344878c28a0473a6174"]},"issue":"9-10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, a new analytical method was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of antibiotic drugs (amoxicillin, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, linezolid, metronidazole) and their metabolites (amoxycilloic acid, amoxicillin diketopiperazine, 3-desacetyl cefotaxime lactone, clindamycin sulfoxide, ciprofloxacin piperazinyl-N4-sulfate, linezolid N-oxide, metronidazole-OH) in human urine.

The relationship between probability and causality requires an acceptable philosophical account.

This paper explores causal understandings of probabilistic knowledge using concepts of the theologian, Thomas Aquinas.

Aquinas’ anthropological concepts related to modern ‘risk science’ and his concepts of rationality, harm and prudence are applied to contemporary social welfare."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057243872","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"3302-3316","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10943-021-01452-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65f853b24097076263617937","name":"Brian J.","lastName":"Taylor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d5844c6-3cee-43d8-a7bc-34e224aa9f22"},{"objectId":"65f853b24097076263617936","name":"Saša","lastName":"Horvat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"806f4907-8738-4903-b2b3-b22277d5ff8f"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c391","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Roszak","uuid":"4B0E2F2756DEA548AAD3A5219A7AE1DBECC67BD5DB41FB0A59547416B9FCD63A054FD0266017FB8A3AC624325E352EE6A9AF0F77E182FB0157A7D540D15E664E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2723-2667","documentHash":"d9f2a628-1bb3-41e9-b636-05cd86074a24"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10943-021-01452-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","parentUuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","rootUuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The lower boundary of the Coniacian Stage is placed at the base of Bed 46 of the Salzgitter-Salder section in northern Germany. The boundary is defined by the first appearance of the inoceramid bivalve species Cremnoceramus deformis erectus (Meek) and complemented by the Navigation carbon isotope event.

withers height is frequently estimated based on skeletal remains during archeozoological analyses. The routinely used methods (Vitt and Kiesewalter) do not allow withers height estimation without complete long bone and skull osteometry. The modified Wyrost and Kucharczyk formula is based on the internal dimensions of the cranial cavity. This method can be used even when the neurocranium is the only surviving portion of the skull. Earlier investigation demonstrated that it can be used as a substitute for the Kiesewalter method. The statistical analyses of the results achieved using metapodial bones are strongly correlated with the results achieved using the Wyrost and Kucharczyk method. A unique horse skull assemblage, dating back to medieval times, was unearthed from several archeological sites in Poland (Silesia, Kuyavia, Grater Poland, Western Pomerania, and Eastern Pomerania). This study aimed to estimate the withers height of this assemblage using the modified Wyrost and Kucharczyk method. Subsequently, these estimations were compared with accessible literature data from both medieval Poland and surrounding territories. The literature indicates that the horses from Western Pomerania, Silesia, and Kuyavia were larger than the animals from Eastern Pomerania. Our results show that horses from Western Pomerania were larger than those from Silesia, Kuyavia, and Eastern Pomerania. In both cases, the Western Pomeranian horses are the largest. In general, according to our results and the accessible literature, it seems true that Polish medieval horse populations can be described as medium- and small-sized, according to Vitt's classification. The modified Wyrost and Kucharczyk formula can be used as an additional or alternative method of calculating withers height in routine archeozoological studies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057246628","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"378-395","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/oa.3073","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3d0e40970762633a51c8","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Sienkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9d14d67d-c44d-4982-a3a1-2a3f35756beb"},{"objectId":"662a3d0e40970762633a51c7","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acefb450-b234-4289-809c-0cfbeece0943"},{"objectId":"662a3d0e40970762633a51c6","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Spychalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"110e8d7f-0fc9-4157-8245-c5da35baa58b"},{"objectId":"662a3d0e40970762633a51c5","name":"Beata","lastName":"Sudoł","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b20e5b82-6422-40ac-9735-c37d50d979e5"},{"objectId":"662a3d0e40970762633a51c4","name":"Vedat","lastName":"Onar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a515818-af29-47ad-9ced-1b3eb27c431e"},{"objectId":"662a3d0e40970762633a51c3","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Janeczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"86b95f8f-460c-4ee6-ad0c-b9dea646a22e"},{"objectId":"662a3d0e40970762633a51c1","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Baranowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e178d9c-38dc-41ec-921a-4d242c412d4f"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8ed3","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Poradowski","uuid":"904190827EBE9D336A3A4113B4A76012C627C6C9F353F4EBD23AE303B3F3BC2CADBE9D2DDAE1017492FD2D1C93E223B284A95297D95BBB0619345891E2A2E1B7","orcidId":"0000-0003-4296-3174","documentHash":"ae7b83fb-1f99-4c19-b365-ab06120d8edc"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4b2f","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"65B57FE30A083F4DEB087812A66AE04E626D82FF35FA6371892B006E4CFD6A0BD602F2CF22C226DAA2AE96DAA473A3FCA9180E8374901C4DB97621CF6F405B3F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3272-3444","documentHash":"4f913deb-4ead-48fd-a7c1-f62cb8069740"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f5a3","name":"Albert","lastName":"Czerski","uuid":"42363474F22C4C29F3A37EAE0975357314D0956E616819A1D30D1D5A7D3706D6DAFAD46E92C5E6F9E03299BBE0F509A876F5B0E4CC5E432C307D2D6DBFBDBAAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4235-6940","documentHash":"51d8e201-c57e-40c9-be87-acfac6b8c90d"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2c4","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Chrószcz","uuid":"F78518BFD405FCB87A59B45217274E0931F308EEAEF5134D2F762827136E7D1014715E9F69821C3B048295069FFF1FFFB4E9CE28D2032E9D8E5615037FBA65B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9079-549X","documentHash":"f6d3d4a1-957b-4e9e-b65e-42b59292b1b6"}],"doi":"10.1002/oa.3073"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nowotwory odbytnicy -

In this study, we present what constitutes the term “forest management” as well as what activities are included in forest management. We propose that forest management should be seen as an inseparable part of the concept of sustainable forest management, i.e. the pursuit of maintaining and strengthening economic, social and environmental values of all types of forests. Forest management is also linked to the Sustainable Development Goals, which also aim to ensure the protection and restoration of terrestrial and inland ecosystems, including forests. Using Quantitative research with comparative method, descriptive research approach and also the abductive research approach, the elements of forest management in which the Forest Data Bank can be used taking Poland as an example was analysed. The integration of cadastral data would facilitate the use of this database. And finally – what is most important – Forest Data Bank, due to its database structure can be used with other land administration databases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057249311","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6317118f409707488e9fd349","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"37","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"57fdead0-7c8a-48b6-ba2c-52244b00e491"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"83-91","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02827581.2021.2005134?journalCode=sfor20","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3eda","name":"Michał","lastName":"Pietkiewicz","uuid":"F19CB62DB3D537232410D29850BB065611AA77E1FA2DD98D72330929D7ECE11529D3885F1A3E3D289020E6BC4A3492063200B82BAF36DD747FDDDC1E9A17B9F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-1119-3771","documentHash":"ddfb99a8-77bc-4cb5-b7a5-9ca188042eda"},{"objectId":"5e7093bf878c28a0473b01f8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Klimach","uuid":"08186B3379A93A025C06350EF802FDBD48F09622B889D3318C2755238E9FC609010CE6743D32E5305ADC45726D8AA2C4DE82AF2A343FFDA4F7C409260837321D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7930-3888","documentHash":"468c8493-c41b-4f38-9339-363fe2a129d7"}],"doi":"10.1080/02827581.2021.2005134"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nowotwory","Zakażenia

This study aimed to explore the complication rates of radical cystectomy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer and identify potential risk factors. Methods: A total of 553 patients were included: 131 were operated on via an open approach (ORC), 242 patients via a laparoscopic method (LRC), and 180 by a robot-assisted procedure (RARC). Patient age, gender, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, urinary diversion type, preoperative albumin level, body mass index (BMI), pathological (TNM) stage, and surgical times were collected. The severity of complications was classified according to the Clavien-Dindo scale (Grades 1–5). Results: The surgical technique was significantly related to the number of complications (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#x3c; 0.00005). Grade 1 complications were observed most frequently following LRC (52.5%) and RARC (51.1%), whereas mostly Grade 2 complications were detected after ORC (78.6%). Those with less severe complications had significantly higher albumin levels than those with more severe complications (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#x3c; 0.05). Patients with an elevated BMI had fewer complications if a minimally invasive approach was used rather than ORC. The patient’s general condition (ASA score) did not impact the number of complications, and urinary diversion type did not affect the severity of the complications. Mean surgical time differed according to the urinary diversion type in patients with a similar TNM stage (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;#x3c; 0.005); however, no difference was found in those with more locally advanced disease. Longer operation time and lower protein concentration were associated with higher probability of complication rate, that is, Clavien-Dindo score 3–5. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions: The risk of complications after RC is not related to the type of urinary diversion, and can be reduced by using a minimally invasive surgical technique, especially in patients with high BMI."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057249555","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"106","pagesFromTo":"163-170","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/517787","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f969a4097076263686795","name":"Witold","lastName":"Mikołajczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd91830a-dfaf-4ee9-bfd4-8453091a188f"},{"objectId":"661f969a4097076263686794","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Kadlubowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b61f8bc8-d83a-4802-adf9-c386fc51b590"},{"objectId":"661f969a4097076263686793","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Pobłocki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"584e68f3-db27-478d-a225-6ec999af8223"},{"objectId":"661f969a4097076263686792","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Adamczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd1c4e8c-344f-4651-af16-a421adcf92c5"},{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c4309","name":"Adam","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":"E142D17AD7749997CE85BA422D0B9A0C1C8867F248B8337662F2CD05331E1059E02C549EB3D0DBEC7D2D771C692614FE55A8C82FECDF8B40D24B263E91D383B6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c1d6b9f-6747-489f-a526-d0176794bb45"},{"objectId":"5e709324878c28a0473a3822","name":"Kajetan","lastName":"Juszczak","uuid":"69181E3871A51B28509A0A28D8ABE58B1E26E253960EB57FE4EFE77AD7A68844BACDBE98228C160D2E50FC9D71C66183D5B7AE1C914550CFBED6A599C9761F67","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcac98c5-ee16-4c8f-b3e5-77460e75efee"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bffe","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Drewa","uuid":"B694F29E137BDAD2001C2D2584A69D3C412FF9D2CE5A90CF67B3D0A0332C46D7491D0C0CB864518DB747EDD42E633AE7B3408D42DCDEF75592233B030C32DEF6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d21e8f5a-1d48-4b0e-9603-c853444e8c2a"}],"doi":"10.1159/000517787"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nowotwory

1932 C. S. Lewis famously argued how Chaucer medievalized Boccaccio’s story of Troilus and Criseyde as told in Il Filostrato. More than eighty years later, the opposite process is at work in Lavinia Greenlaw’s A Double Sorrow. The aim of my article is to examine what Greenlaw really did to Chaucer’s poem, to paraphrase the title of Lewis’s essay, in her attempt to make the Trojan story ‘more itself rather than less so’. I hope to show how the modern poet distances herself both from ancient authorities and the authorial stance adopted by Chaucer in Troilus and Criseyde, namely that of the storytelling historian who relies on memorised ‘matter’, and – taking images rather than the plot as the starting point – formulates a different model of memory. In this model information is creatively processed rather than merely fixed and stored and thus memory, especially autobiographical memory, emerges suddenly and automatically rather than being effortfully retrieved, as in the ancient model, evoked by Chaucer. Traces of the same model are also to be found in Greenlaw’s novel In the City of Love’s Sleep and Hilary Mantel’s Giving Up the Ghost, both of which will be referred to for comparison."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057252328","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"95","pagesFromTo":"47-62","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00393274.2021.1924855?journalCode=snec20","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709244878c28a047392bbd","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Ruszkiewicz","uuid":"E7AF7CC6E1BE274DE9D085E06499AA440562C36488ED8B527F371EA0078B7D3E86D03BC9384C8A4F56F4FC6B8DB81DBC7CB1A44AF8DFECA103DF05E181A07D01","orcidId":"0000-0001-7809-587X","documentHash":"480fed2c-a9d2-41e3-9b71-3fad692bd368"}],"doi":"10.1080/00393274.2021.1924855"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Niedokrwienie kończyn dolnych - leczenie","Plastyka naczyniowa","Jakość życia","Stan zdrowia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Peripheral artery disease","endovascular procedure","functional assessment","physical status","psychological status"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Physical and psychological functioning of patients with chronic limb ischemia during a 1-year period after endovascular revascularization","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bc6","mniswId":"13137","title":"Journal of Vascular Surgery","doi":null,"issn":"0741-5214","eissn":"1097-6809","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5bd4db9e-deb8-441d-87c8-61c9dd090993"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-10-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61acd96b2467f032cc247ff4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709378878c28a0473aa7e2","5e7092c3878c28a04739c35b","6093a6c39543c73526c48d40"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective\r\nSymptoms of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and patients’ physical and psychological status are related in a vicious circle. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between improvement in parameters of PAD after endovascular procedures and changes in patients’ physical and psychological status.\r\nMethods\r\nWe studied 140 consecutive PAD patients: 50 patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), 50 patients with intermittent claudication (IC) undergoing an endovascular procedure, and 40 IC patients who were not qualified for leg revascularization. All participating patients were assessed at the beginning of the study and at 3 and 12 months of follow-up; scores taken included: ankle-brachial index, 6-minute walking test distance, Barthel index, activities of daily living (ADL) index, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) index, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).\r\nResults\r\nAfter 12 months of follow-up, an improvement in PAD-related symptoms following leg revascularization had been maintained in 56% of the patients with CLTI and in 68% of those with IC. Twelve months after endovascular leg revascularization, the scores in respect of ADL, IADL, and MMSE had increased, and scores for HADS had decreased in both CLTI and IC patients. A higher baseline score in the IADL index was associated with a reduction in the 1-year cardiovascular event risk (OR; 95% CI: 0.70; 0.54-0.91; <i>P</i> < .01).\r\nConclusions\r\nIn PAD patients, endovascular procedures not only improved PAD-related symptoms, but also ameliorated patients’ physical state, improved cognitive function, and reduced depression.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747057254710","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"75","pagesFromTo":"1679-1686","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0741521421023387","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6093a6c39543c73526c48d40","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Banaś","uuid":"95D4585CFD5B2844AD678C87C44E7C10B26531197300A657792C5F444B85212EE673AB5B3DF87B5C0589D34DF16C6BC5204C46D70F07539E96CAFD39B3314C9A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dfd3565f-f589-4c79-9e3d-3f15f4bd0ac8"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa7e2","name":"Beata","lastName":"Czerniak","uuid":"0FD80F2A3982A443ABCA1CEB999FE50CCF14828C5282C265ACD06064D5637E3FBEFFB59D9863329D7275CC0ADD68AED268AA1E30881AF251EEA992E412FB3DC4","orcidId":"0000-0002-6291-2713","documentHash":"1e1e7ad3-bb5b-46da-b65e-5fa069f72269"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c35b","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Budzyński","uuid":"77641D331628CC6FA49AD1807B8781CFC647860428EB6C29C520E09D629D93E662F00C53E6BF9A873F25DEAAF4145C77F5E4D7319206E246E2AE69C6DAF6B46E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3556-5821","documentHash":"5cf6cf23-8357-4660-bb39-1adf2924c5e4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jvs.2021.10.021"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

malignant syndrome caused by atypical antipsychotic drugs may present in an atypical manner without symptoms such as hyperthermia and/or muscle rigidity. A detailed description of atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by atypical antipsychotic drugs, practical information to distinguish neuroleptic malignant syndrome from other related conditions, and the diagnostic criteria that may be used to settle the diagnosis of atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome are highlighted in this paper. This study was conducted searching PubMed and Science Direct, resulting in 525 articles. 26 case reports that met inclusion criteria were identified. Atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome was found to develop mainly in male patients suffering from schizophrenia (14 cases) and bipolar disorder (2), and was induced by clozapine (6 cases), olanzapine (5 cases), aripiprazole and quetiapine (4 cases). Muscle rigidity did not develop in patients treated with clozapine and quetiapine, whereas a lack of hyperthermia was common with aripiprazole and clozapine treatment. Atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a difficult matter, especially when symptoms of hyperthermia or muscle rigidity is lacking, but using Levenson’s or Adityanjee and Aderibigbe’s criteria may increase it detectability, can permit earlier intervention and prevent development of life-threatening typical neuroleptic malignant syndrome."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057254982","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"284-293","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02791072.2021.1957188","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"618353b97523400564d82060","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Radajewska","uuid":"49E63AF92FCACF87609DCD47EBC00A65DD711806AE6CFFBBBE4A7D38F7297E391403A8CC76FBF34CE5E2E8C92BA0827D0CCAD18CA75E5F7224F1B66A0FCCD547","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de3443ff-d5f9-4388-86a0-27ae48e068f0"},{"objectId":"5e7093ba878c28a0473afdd6","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szota","uuid":"7A05E62893E0CAADF85F8ED11E275711B501D452298FFE5BD7FC17370D32DB479CD59AD1D4E7871630684034A4EF773F580447A6BD2413240E9C1FCBA70536F3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9184-342X","documentHash":"6e54718f-ad5b-4011-bd41-a05a0d22a78c"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c33b","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Araszkiewicz","uuid":"5517924AA1D931DF31D9C1F1BC093D7A23D6D928D08B6504C90CBD8C01CB51CA9FE0A31DD11D434F31881C398589774517877E09395D2ECDA732DE7615D03306","orcidId":"0000-0003-4324-4112","documentHash":"8f03cb65-083d-4c52-bd18-329d44909640"}],"doi":"10.1080/02791072.2021.1957188"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["geny oporności na antybiotyki","bakterie oporne na antybiotyki","oczyszczalnia ścieków"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antibiotic resistance genes","antibiotic resistant bacteria","urban resistome","wastewater treatment plant"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Antibiotic resistance in wastewater, does the context matter? : Poland and Portugal as a case study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547782c","mniswId":"4517","title":"Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"1064-3389","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a27cb62c-2062-466f-9829-14620b1ad77c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b77e872467f01ef0edcdda","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b21ae3409707197792f253","65b21ae3409707197792f254","65b21ae3409707197792f255","65b21ae3409707197792f256","65b21ae3409707197792f257","65b21ae3409707197792f258","65b21ae3409707197792f259","5e709233878c28a0473919b0"]},"issue":"23","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057255037","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"52","pagesFromTo":"4194-4216","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10643389.2021.2000828?scroll=top&needAccess=true","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65b21ae3409707197792f259","name":"C.

The association of biomarkers with the risk of HT has been variably reported. We conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis and sought to compare blood biomarkers associated with HT and its subtypes by evaluating its predictability and correlation with outcome in AIS. Methods: The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020201334) and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Among 2,230 articles identified from Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, 30 quality-appraised articles were found eligible. Meta-analysis was conducted for matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), cellular fibronectin (c-Fn), ferritin, S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). We also reviewed biomarkers for correlation with the functional outcome at 90 days from stroke onset (poor outcome modified Rankin scale &amp;#x3e;2). Results: The pooled diagnostic odds ratio (DOR&lt;sub&gt;pooled&lt;/sub&gt;) was the highest for baseline c-Fn levels (299.253 [95% CI, 20.508–4,366.709]), followed by MMP-9 (DOR&lt;sub&gt;pooled&lt;/sub&gt;, 29.571 [95% CI 17.750–49.267]) and ferritin (DOR&lt;sub&gt;pooled&lt;/sub&gt;, 24.032 [95% CI 2.557–225.871]). However, wide confidence intervals for ferritin and c-Fn suggested lesser reliability of the markers. Patients with MMP-9 levels ≥140 ng/mL were 29.5 times at higher risk of developing symptomatic HT after AIS (area under the curve = 0.881). S100B (DOR&lt;sub&gt;pooled&lt;/sub&gt;, 6.286 [95% CI, 1.861–21.230]) and NLR (DOR&lt;sub&gt;pooled&lt;/sub&gt;, 5.036 [95% CI, 2.898–8.749]) had lower diagnostic accuracies. Among the markers not included for meta-analysis, caveolin-1, thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and soluble ST2 were highly sensitive. Elevated levels of MMP-9, ferritin, and NLR were found to be associated with poor functional outcomes and mortality. Conclusion: Of the 5 biomarkers, there was enough evidence that MMP-9 has higher diagnostic accuracy for predicting the risk of HT before thrombolysis. MMP-9, ferritin, and NLR also predicted poor short-term outcomes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057255434","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"51","pagesFromTo":"235-247","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/518570","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fa1c0409707626368e24d","name":"P.N.","lastName":"Sylaja","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71896463-143c-4fb4-a5ce-6be76965d372"},{"objectId":"661fa1c0409707626368e24c","name":"Laura","lastName":"Mechtouff","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7bca570-b0fc-4ce3-a153-4c566f0af406"},{"objectId":"661fa1c0409707626368e24b","name":"Konark","lastName":"Malhotra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55029f38-f016-4679-b324-fd76277c4412"},{"objectId":"661fa1c0409707626368e24a","name":"Régis","lastName":"Bordet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57ff12a9-3e75-499d-8ebb-5dc20d4ee606"},{"objectId":"661fa1c0409707626368e249","name":"Ilaria","lastName":"Maestrini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4bcde0d4-a722-4406-9f4e-f5273c229ae4"},{"objectId":"661fa1c0409707626368e248","name":"Mónica","lastName":"Millán","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d22980ff-6b9c-43f6-baed-d18e2a9b04cb"},{"objectId":"661fa1c0409707626368e247","name":"W.

Poland is a significant producer of poultry and swine in Europe; Ukraine is located in the immediate vicinity of Poland and the EU. Thus, the review focuses on the presence of potentially pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant zoonotic bacteria and antimicrobial genes in the environment of farms and food of animal origin in Poland and Ukraine. Existing data confirms presence of these bacteria in the food animal origin chain environment in both countries. However, it is difficult to compare the scale of multidrug-resistant bacteria (e.g. MRSA, ESBL) dissemination in Poland and Ukraine with other EU countries due to lack of more extensive studies and large-scale monitoring in these two countries. A series of studies concerning resistance of pathogenic bacteria isolated from livestock environment have been published in Poland but usually on single farms with a very limited number of samples, and without a genotypic drug resistance marking.

Compared with conventional streamer acquisitions, the separation of sources and receivers makes it possible to increase the maximum offset and azimuth coverage for improving the illumination at depth. Furthermore, the three-component geophones naturally capture elastic wave propagation effects. While this information is mostly overlooked up to now, reconstructing jointly P- and S-wave velocities would significantly improve the subsurface characterization. To achieve a 3D high-resolution multi-parameter reconstruction, we design an efficient 3D fluid-solid coupled full waveform modelling and inversion engine. In this engine, fluid and solid domains are divided explicitly and handled with the acoustic and elastic wave equations, respectively. The numerical implementation is based on a time-domain spectral-element method (SEM) with a flexible 3D Cartesian-based hexahedral mesh, which contributes to an accurate coupling of the acoustic and elastic wave equations and high computational efficiency through domain-decomposition based parallelization. We select the best acoustic-elastic coupled formulations among 4 possibilities with criteria based on numerical accuracy and implementation efficiency. Moreover, we propose a specific hybrid approach for the misfit gradient building so as to use a similar modelling solver for both forward and adjoint simulations. Synthetic case studies on a 3D extended Marmousi-II model and a 3D deep-water crustal-scale model illustrate how our modelling and inversion engine can efficiently extract information from ocean-bottom data to simultaneously reconstruct both P- and S-wave velocities within a full waveform inversion framework."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057265494","journalIssue":{"objectId":"627a0e844097077f84ec2fab","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"229","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"fe79a990-8a85-482c-b5a3-a3ab376fad51"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"229","pagesFromTo":"671–703,","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gji/ggab484/41363793/ggab484.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a97","name":"Jean","lastName":"Virieux","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fca75f7a-9d24-482f-bf89-984567cb5688"},{"objectId":"61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a95","name":"Ludovic","lastName":"Métivier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db832798-6e23-44c0-96c6-aeb61bcce44b"},{"objectId":"61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a90","name":"Romain","lastName":"Brossier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75bc0e2f-a36c-46ec-9d29-82e04bc0335a"},{"objectId":"61b1b6fd2467f0304b807a81","name":"Jian","lastName":"Cao","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3133-8608","documentHash":"819699f7-67c7-4565-a398-abaaeca45e9b"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a0473989c9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Górszczyk","uuid":"0A6AE9F1EC9A1C443C1601B910B3422E361203C041A5225F1AAF35894B9C2763A7BC803BACC3400B7D1931FDD885C2A176CCC58E5930BA848AE9C0703A7D0641","orcidId":"0000-0002-9767-2772","documentHash":"c13106bc-e029-46e2-a892-271c4a59eaa7"}],"doi":"10.1093/gji/ggab484"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Changes in urban fabric – a cause or a result of an innovation district?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e3e4","mniswId":"24527","title":"Journal of Urbanism","doi":null,"issn":"1754-9175","eissn":"1754-9183","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"39f968b8-6b99-42e0-9fb2-0de98f207a6e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b1b3a52467f0304b7f891b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66e82ca0fdbe8327373f3030","66e82ca0fdbe8327373f3031","5e70920b878c28a04738f05f","5e7093e7878c28a0473b3035"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057265546","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17549175.2021.2005118","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66e82ca0fdbe8327373f3031","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Anielska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7f9ab04a-38ef-4e10-9a86-c0c0c2c75817"},{"objectId":"66e82ca0fdbe8327373f3030","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Morawska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b3463241-81ad-4014-ada7-1bea77527a1b"},{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b3035","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Afeltowicz","uuid":"2A30CAA4188F5ED808800C7CA34BFDA269156F51A0981487AE91D8DBB5EF50C49F5BB7DBD550DBD38B18A67A73291DAEFE0E2FACF2DBCDA2475780B5ED4D39E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2316-6332","documentHash":"a32f8cee-4ace-41c4-9cb8-247889bb8f2c"},{"objectId":"5e70920b878c28a04738f05f","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Gądecki","uuid":"F202E963F66039D8F620364BE156E8C8FEFC4D9905D88DFED0487EA2494FE20DF1F745F2CE95AAC540C6A708551D7CE0B73306AA0BAC223FC06FEECE291AD8F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1954-9605","documentHash":"be582b6e-f605-4293-b555-d76e82e20a2b"}],"doi":"10.1080/17549175.2021.2005118"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY","MASS SPECTROMETRY","NANOMACHINES","NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE","PHI-VALUE"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"9781071617151","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Protein Folding.

Research carried out around the world aims at reducing the emission of particles and harmful chemical compounds during the operation of diesel engines, an example of which is the use of fuel nanomodifiers. In the study presented, the effect of two fuel additives available in Poland, containing cerium dioxide and ferrocene nanoparticles was investigated. Additives were added to standard European diesel fuel to evaluate their influence on the emission of particulate matter and selected chemical compounds in exhaust gases from a vehicle equipped with a compression-ignition engine. Measurements were carried out using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), on a chassis dynamometer, simulating real road traffic conditions. The results showed a reduction of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulate matter (both in terms of mass and number of particles) in the exhaust gases, but also a 2-4% increase in nitrogen oxide emissions. The use of such nanomodifiers in diesel fuel seems to be a promising solution, especially for older passenger cars commonly used on the roads, which are not regulated by the latest emission standards."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057265968","journalIssue":{"objectId":"614058842467f0723cada5b2","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"14466af5-121b-4d0b-8d25-feec5c321569"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"25–33","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/138209","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b85c382467f00dcba7e40b","name":"Joseph","lastName":"Woodburn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d88f114-d096-48ba-a9c4-95c60d7f9943"},{"objectId":"61b85c382467f00dcba7e40a","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Szczotka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71e4ac71-4ec5-406e-b336-87b684b2d689"},{"objectId":"61b85c382467f00dcba7e409","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Puchałka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f66f9e9a-8123-417e-bb1a-5703993af45f"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b7ffb","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Dobrzyńska","uuid":"5662CB5DBD44F278185DF53EC34AF4C07037CDA7945B78A89615CD16B807BACE0CEA5DBC3F55F45C381C99836F12F2ED83DA7E9D36F78BF5F30861DE50806351","orcidId":"0000-0003-1595-9663","documentHash":"d5611848-bd2b-4fba-a676-e984d852f391"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a60","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Szewczyńska","uuid":"9570D3E978CC99E45F80D3818C5F2D7B4F8ED291AD70595D44255A7BD84D91EC2C86C9DDDEF847B607829FBCC6039B3677FC10407F3F4DAFD8A1A0B9DB7CC9A6","orcidId":"0000-0003-3319-3024","documentHash":"c8e7f5df-0a70-4520-b1c9-8a004b1899d2"}],"doi":"10.15244/pjoes/138209"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["agents","entrepreneurship","social entrepreneur","structuration theory"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092db878c28a04739e2fb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Are They Really a New Species?

We show that the development of the contemporary significance of social entrepreneurialism lies in a combination of complex context-specific structural forces and the activities of agents who initiate, demand, and impose change. Social entrepreneurs intentionally tackle social challenges, but their actions bring unintentional results, such as the transfer of state responsibilities onto communities. Direct outputs of their activities introduce indirect outcomes, bringing wider changes in culture and policy. The evolving nature of entrepreneurship and a number of factors that interplay in time and space, and enable and constrain social entrepreneurs, confirm the applicability of Giddens’s theory in the field of social entrepreneurship. The originality of this article derives from revealing mechanisms that enable social entrepreneurs to emerge and reasons for structural change. We also build a “co-creation model of structure and agency” that can be used to “engineer” the process of social entrepreneurship."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057270923","journalIssue":{"objectId":"631b3f074097076e64985f4b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"61","number":"7","doi":"","documentHash":"a1722109-e23e-4202-b277-04251a568a84"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"1919-1961","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00076503211053014","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b208802467f0304b9f03cc","name":"Jane","lastName":"Farmer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"243e7a1b-a1bd-4c08-936f-64f8901fb49e"},{"objectId":"61b208802467f0304b9f03ca","name":"Sarah","lastName":"Jack","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f14f8956-5f41-46e3-8858-1d5c05d0f977"},{"objectId":"61b208802467f0304b9f03c3","name":"Artur","lastName":"Steiner","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7422-8396","documentHash":"6cf8e0cc-767d-449c-a173-9fc96ca0b258"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e2fb","name":"Izabella","lastName":"Steinerowska-Streb","uuid":"584398E5A094E95EF740557F0BF6E51877D89ED9A3E5D41B4C3497A35AF67C85E91D72DD1916E8EDF131703E0EC3128B24704129F75CEC1278ABAE96B3C7CA9D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5379-5730","documentHash":"e5a59369-6b26-4d00-9728-dca5aa9caa4b"}],"doi":"10.1177/00076503211053014"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["forced migration","refugees","motherhood","cultural transmission","socialization","enculturation","social mirrors","self-perception","psychological anthropology"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","uid":"bJjSI9Xh5XWd377BL7x5oLA","uuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","parentUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","rootUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","name":"Instytut Archeologii i Etnologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4b3e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Single Motherhood of Refugees in Poland and the Challenges of Socialization in the Face of Cultural Alienation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a28","mniswId":"12495","title":"Journal of Refugee Studies","doi":null,"issn":"0951-6328","eissn":"1471-6925","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"9a275250-2265-4937-aaad-8acad216aa12"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b878cb2467f00dcbb21185","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709400878c28a0473b4b3e"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Maternity is an extremely important aspect of self-determination regardless of the culture of origin. In the case of refugee women (functioning without the support of close relatives, the family and their own society with its cultural norms), it additionally plays a crucial role in the construction of self-image. Women are often taken care of their children, which largely determines their adaptation strategies focused primarily on providing offspring with safety, development conditions and stability. No less important it is also for their self-perception and self-determination, which are to a large extent conditioned by the gender roles in their culture of origin. In the article, I discuss the most common dilemmas of mothers-refugees among whom I conduct research since 2014 (coming from former Soviet Republics: Chechnya, Dagestan, Tajikistan) and I analyze their impact on the upbringing of offspring. At the beginning of the article, I present the basic terminological issues related to socialization and enculturation. These processes are considered to be one of the most important and difficult challenges faced by refugee women living in Poland. In the following part, I analyze the relationship between the self-assessment of the parental and educational activities effectiveness made refugee mothers and their adaptation attitudes and acculturation strategies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057271135","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61b878cb2467f00dcbb2118a","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"70c20373-bb49-41a5-9aae-9730ed7ca8da"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"396-415","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://academic.oup.com/jrs/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jrs/feab036/36681104/feab036.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4b3e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kość-Ryżko","uuid":"D66CC35BBF31ED3465BE9068F104779C15821C8B8CA73D1052CC7AF0973D71CB417AC021ED0EF17E8CD2751D3D910AB5C3C081EB0F8DD3B2D932D69BCFB35232","orcidId":"0000-0002-6103-2474","documentHash":"dd5f5a35-7b43-42e2-8f0a-b2d5091069e0"}],"doi":"10.1093/jrs/feab036"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","parentUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","rootUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Coconut by-products, such as residues fromcoconut milk (RCM) and coconut oil (RCO) extraction, are a valuable source of dietaryfiber. In the study, coconutflours obtainedfrom RCM and RCO were used (FCM and FCO, respectively) for supplementation of rolls; white wheatflour was replaced withFCM or FCO at levels of 6, 12, and 18 g per 100 g.RESULTS: The effect of the addition of the coconut by-products on the nutritional value, sensory evaluation, physical proper-ties, and texture of rolls was determined after 24 and 72 h of storage. The research showed a positive effect of FCM and FCOon the roll yield, crumb moisture, and baking loss. The sensory evaluation revealed that the 12% addition of coconut residuesyielded products with high overall acceptability (8 points on a 9-point scale). Compared with the control, a 12% addition of FCOor FCM contributed to an increase in proteins of 7.9% and 3.9% respectively and an increase in dietaryfiber of 76% and 57%respectively. Despite the increase in the fat and protein contents, the energy value of the coconut rolls was significantly lower(244.6 kcal and 245.3 kcal for FCO and FCM respectively) than in the control wheat rolls (266.0 kcal).CONCLUSION: White rolls with coconutflours obtained after grinding residues from oil or coconut milk extraction significantlyincreased the nutritional value of the rolls.© 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057271334","journalIssue":{"objectId":"610901952467f02e4a379766","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ef86f07b-39af-4f8e-b617-2a954633b80d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"102","pagesFromTo":"3370-3378","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jsfa.11684","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b679e","name":"Agata","lastName":"Blicharz-Kania","uuid":"484DC146A1C21DAC9BB4F2D0F094A0FE09FABCE06CEECE4D7835B6C3257433A7E19FEF683F200442E309017B1486901B8F4257D5DED6E4854C64AF6113E0A9AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-7663-5016","documentHash":"e3c9a2b7-22dc-4bd9-846a-08f42dfd4883"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b423f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nawrocka","uuid":"92DD55CD956407DB231A8A617BD918DC31C19DFBF230DD28086D1BF19FEA7FF67E3B9D172D57A87FECFF6B2286364E0DE182AD08B716B889AC664FC619220F31","orcidId":"0000-0001-8618-2092","documentHash":"37e88670-0b34-47dc-98dc-8d64d41f9881"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a0473948a6","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wirkijowska","uuid":"5A969FAEFBA7556D146831777FF61273B6A791D6BF2B1AD02218939FC500784574D845A5197397AFD09FAE9EC45DFF18EDB5BE866D6AD4D245028BA54DF13B35","orcidId":"0000-0002-1647-2921","documentHash":"33ee90d0-6c96-4298-a009-0c2fff8e5c6d"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a52","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zarzycki","uuid":"8C5F8EE6690C1473A91F81DD690F29D9CA30E4C340B8D38F67E739BE4A939CC1E49102CD9424F1ED3D3E1ADAAFE5F8DFAD5DB9463591C82E9D2BFF23390F524C","orcidId":"0000-0003-1462-6146","documentHash":"92b719b6-4952-46a1-afa1-759e3bf1177f"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909f0","name":"Aldona","lastName":"Sobota","uuid":"3F7127ED5154844F0A62E989B5FB1EC4225276990E363D739FD0F98F369F623A3BB508AA8EC9AE9AC0170828C031F7030A9FE146FD3D277DA8239C15CBB48895","orcidId":"0000-0001-6526-6764","documentHash":"ea0ae230-baba-4e91-9a94-f495500925b2"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a0473908b6","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Andrejko","uuid":"B6488967C9A584E2E55F760C58042979609CC850352416260E6835DD2EC2DD293226CC4DFDA7E95E310E971544CB134E1903AB8DD47702812500AD3130A7278E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9345-7795","documentHash":"a493ffbc-b038-45b2-bd42-5d3629438146"}],"doi":"10.1002/jsfa.11684"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b4878c28a047385b32","uid":"bS6M08TFKPbY503_RCN7QVg","uuid":"09856ec8-9220-4fe5-b068-d49e53a4db41","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Instytut Robotów i Konstrukcji Maszyn","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70946a878c28a0473bc97a","5e70929a878c28a047398ed5"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","uid":"bPoyZM9sTF7DfGYlClitONQ","uuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","parentUuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","rootUuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","name":"Instytut Techniki Budowlanej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e7878c28a0473b30a7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Potential of Al2O3–ZrO2-Based Composites, Formed via CSC Method, in Linear Infrastructure Applications Based on Their Mechanical, Thermal and Environmental performance","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e46","mniswId":"14267","title":"Metallurgical and Materials Transactions.

The method has so far been mainly utilized in making ceramic-metal composites. Al2O3–ZrO2 composites have been obtained with different shares of ZrO2, i.e., 15, 50 and 75 vol pct, respectively. Prior to sintering the composite samples, the rheological properties of the casting slips were investigated and thermogravimetric tests were performed. Upon sintering, all three series of the ceramic composites showed a density close to 100 pct and no microcracks or delamination. Phase, microstructural and mechanical investigations were carried out to determine what effect the share of ceramics has on the composites produced. An increase in the\nshare of ZrO2 in the Al2O3–ZrO2 composite leads to a reduction in the growth of Al2O3 grains and a decrease in the average hardness. Cross-sectional hardness testing of the composites showed no evident gradient in any of the samples. Life cycle analysis (LCA) results indicate that the further optimization of the composite formation process, including up-scaling, allows to obtain Al2O3–ZrO2-based pipes possessing more favorable environmental characteristics compared with materials conventionally used for linear infrastructure, which is important in light of the global transformation toward sustainable construction and the

to the increase in the consumption of highly processed food in developed countries, as well as, a growing number of foodborne diseases, exploration of new food additives is an issue focusing on scientific attention and industrial interest. Functional compounds with lipophilic properties are remarkably desirable due to the high susceptibility to the deterioration of lipid-rich food products. This paper in a comprehensive manner provides the current knowledge about the enzymatic synthesis of lipophilic components that could act as multifunctional food additives. The main goal of enzymatic lipophilization of compounds intentionally added to food is to make these substances soluble in lipids and/or to obtain environmentally friendly surfactants. Moreover, lipase-catalyzed syntheses could result in changes in the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of phenolic compounds, carbohydrates, amino acids (oligopeptides), and carboxylic acids. The review describes also the implementation of a new trend in green chemistry, where apart from simple and uncomplicated chemical compounds, the modifications of multi-compound mixtures, such as phenolic extracts or essential oils have been carried out.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747057276799","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b22a5a2467f0304baf113d","name":"Agata","lastName":"Fabiszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b481e681-429c-4026-9777-45db9f9edd4f"},{"objectId":"61b22a5a2467f0304baf113c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wierzchowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fdb09773-9f3d-4eab-9f9f-a8b16780e798"},{"objectId":"61b22a5a2467f0304baf113b","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Białecka-Florjańczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f9e3b1a-32ff-4d5b-8ee5-2d4d43b18b21"},{"objectId":"61b22a5a2467f0304baf113a","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Zieniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc09171f-0d61-43de-aa4e-ecdd7725d251"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b19c8","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Zieniuk","uuid":"D782057207C8C02BBF6CE3E4F0A79D5C1A2774FF2D1EE8B2DC7DBE10CCEBF91BE451DA097CA654A41C34B2C21CAB90CF65EF29313B98F9EC266F38C7AA67262D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6344-8695","documentHash":"8c9330b0-306c-4920-9068-4516860c4627"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11274-021-03200-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dedifferentiation approach","religious tourism","geography of religion","spatial changes","pilgrimage centers"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d17","5e709313878c28a0473a27aa"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The changing roman catholic pilgrimage centres in Europe in the context of contemporary socio-cultural changes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479753","mniswId":"18550","title":"Social and Cultural Geography","doi":null,"issn":"1464-9365","eissn":"1470-1197","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a684e52b-b32e-4133-bcc2-f43d99379dfd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b376f42467f0024e7d6106","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d17","5e709313878c28a0473a27aa"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057279431","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"380-403","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/284342","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3d17","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Liro","uuid":"5ACD1295B2CD3DE5928CDF912EEB228EFD93E9C2C2342A6AE7A7EBCC2FB1FBCA8787FACB27083D89292826EA2839B4C1F4BCACA10A2E4DF27EFC9FF159BD8C9C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8603686a-68d7-479e-bf5d-976ce18f5004"},{"objectId":"5e709313878c28a0473a27aa","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Sołjan","uuid":"7471248181796CFDD3993056EABE4D01E99D5EACFBFA1B349AD817BEF1F7117FFB79C573E09BF35751A6673EF737176EBDB922D093BC3EA086BE0E92A4CEEFE8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d387cc7a-e93b-4e58-bfd7-81c4cdbeaed5"}],"doi":"10.1080/14649365.2020.1739322"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","uid":"bFdp5gORDGmB2AOTB2xubqg","uuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","parentUuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","rootUuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","name":"Instytut Metalurgii i Inżynierii Materiałowej im.

disease, which highly affected global life in 2020, led to a rapid scientific response. Versatile optimization methods found their application in scientific studies related to COVID-19 pandemic. Differential Evolution (DE) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are two metaheuristics that for over two decades have been widely researched and used in various fields of science. In this paper a survey of DE and PSO applications for problems related with COVID-19 pandemic that were rapidly published in 2020 is presented from two different points of view: 1. practitioners seeking the appropriate method to solve particular problem, 2. experts in metaheuristics that are interested in methodological details, inter comparisons between different methods, and the ways for improvement. The effectiveness and popularity of DE and PSO is analyzed in the context of other metaheuristics used against COVID-19. It is found that in COVID-19 related studies: 1. DE and PSO are most frequently used for calibration of epidemiological models and image-based classification of patients or symptoms, but applications are versatile, even interconnecting the pandemic and humanities;

Evening circadian preference has also been linked to affective disorders. The aim of our study was to confirm the relationship between the severity of depressive symptoms, bipolar features, chronotype, and sleep quality among patients with major depressive disorder.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nA group of 55 individuals who were recruited from a mental health outpatient clinic completed the following psychometric tools: a Chronotype Questionnaire comprising morningness-eveningness (ME) and subjective amplitude of the rhythm (AM) scales, the Hypomania Checklist 32 (HCL-32), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nFactor analysis identified two latent components, accounting cumulatively for 58% of variables: depressive symptoms (BDI and PSQI) and bipolarity (ME, AM, and HCL-32). After rotation, ME loading in the first factor increased the result to a significant level. The correlation between the two components was very low.\r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\nEvening chronotype appears to be a bipolarity-related marker, with this relationship being independent of its link to depressive symptoms and sleep quality. Eveningness and high circadian rhythm amplitude may offer promise as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic predictors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057292491","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"44","pagesFromTo":"35-40","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.scielo.br/j/rbp/a/bQkCJLvgstc6kjT5nc9md8F/?lang=en","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6582e18e4097076c14bbc7f1","name":"Tadeusz Bogdan","lastName":"Pietras","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dbd980cc-1578-4513-a34c-78ccf74406b0"},{"objectId":"6582e18e4097076c14bbc7f0","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Witusik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bb62e75-9dc3-459c-9902-718199a0468e"},{"objectId":"6582e18e4097076c14bbc7ef","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Nowakowska-Domagała","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cec14c2-b985-4acb-a9b1-7f25c555bf11"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e4de","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Mokros","uuid":"01EF05D8CE644938D2BFCD1C0C6663132D008F42D4E9678418F84D38A96C5B112ED3BEB2C68B049F5D9C747EB7597270C1BF3E705172D48CC80BDB24E1A5899D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1331-8408","documentHash":"4a0ad3be-29f7-461a-beb7-b9e7c905042f"}],"doi":"10.1590/1516-4446-2021-1747"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["canine","paroxysmal movement disorders","postural tremor","shaky legs syndrome","tremorsyndromes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Primary orthostatic tremor and orthostatic tremor‐plus in dogs: 60 cases (2003‐2020)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd3","mniswId":"13151","title":"Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine","doi":null,"issn":"0891-6640","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5897c03f-ba28-4b17-9b92-c35eccfd9795"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b8d2a82467f01ef017f605","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61b8d2a82467f01ef017f60c","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f60d","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f60e","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f60f","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f610","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f611","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f612","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f613","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f614","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f615","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f616","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f617","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f618","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f619","61b8d2a82467f01ef017f61a","5e7093e7878c28a0473b2ff8"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Orthostatic tremor (OT) is a rare movement disorder characterized by high-frequency (>12 Hz) involuntary, rhythmic, sinusoidal movements affecting predominantly the limbs while standing.\r\nObjective:To describe the signalment, presenting complaints, phenotype, diagnostic findings, treatment, and outcome of a large sample of dogs with OT.\r\nAnimals: Sixty dogs diagnosed with OT based on conscious electromyography.\r\nMethods: Multicenter retrospective case series study. Dogs were included if they had a conscious electromyography consistent with muscle discharge frequency >12 Hz while standing.\r\nResults: Fifty-three cases were diagnosed with primary OT (POT). Giant breed dogs represented most cases (83%; 44/53). Most dogs (79%; 42/53) were younger than 2 years of age at onset of signs, except for Retrievers which were all older than 3.5 years of age. The most common presenting complaints were pelvic limb tremors while standing (85%; 45/53) and difficulty when rising or sitting down (45%; 24/53). Improvement of clinical signs occurred in most dogs (85%; 45/53) treated medically with phenobarbital, primidone, gabapentin, pregabalin or clonazepam, but it was mostly partial rather than complete. Orthostatic tremor-plus was seen in 7 dogs that had concurrent neurological diseases.\r\nConclusions and Clinical Importance: Primary OT is a progressive disease of young, purebred, giant/large-breed dogs, which appears to begin later in life in Retrievers.

This study was aimed to analyze and synthesize the evidence on the efficacy of cognitive TR interventions in patients with neurological diseases, compared with conventional face-to-face rehabilitation. From a total of 4485 records, 9 studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis. At the end of the process, 7 studies remained for quantitative analysis. By comparing TR with face-to-face treatments for cognitive impairments, we assessed improvements in global cognitive domain (Mini Mental State Exam) (MD = −0.86; 95% CI −2.43, 0.72, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), in learning and memory domains (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI −0.22, 0.74, I<sup>2</sup> = 24%), in verbal fluency (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI −0.47, 0.62, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), and in executive functions (i.e., problem-solving, central processing speed and working memory) (SMD = 0.38, 95% CI 0.06, 0.71, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). In all the included studies, improvement in the performance of the TR groups was comparable to that achieved through face-to-face intervention. Significant differences between those two modalities of providing treatments were observed for working memory and total executive function comparison, in favor of TR.

We measure the risk by the sovereign bond spreads.

The causality approach demonstrates various asymmetric causality patterns between stringency index and bond spreads. Most often, the rise in stringency indices contributed to the increase of the spreads or their volatility."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057298618","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"2292-2312","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1544612321005328?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393ae5","name":"Agata","lastName":"Kliber","uuid":"B6B991D6DF43AAB55887F0160D1D0883E36579C73C0B53DD7A0D6D17CCEB4347E27E54DD6ECC1847C6FFD4F81CBAC9985228AF4FA5D5753864790F03B08587AE","orcidId":"0000-0003-1996-5550","documentHash":"6d40bfa2-4e79-4661-b2e4-e10d9c19d60d"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393ad7","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Będowska-Sójka","uuid":"D1ACC8E566125C75F2FC359EE0208A04A3D2D827831FB21CC7897551118B1DEA7A74C218CC458ABB2C5B52BE85FC4902D3FB920043AFE340AD16D31ABE571D44","orcidId":"0000-0001-5193-8304","documentHash":"d30a9ca4-c73a-4ba0-90bd-ab81aef79d36"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.frl.2021.102582"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61b998ec2467f0239144714c","doi":null,"title":"Swoboda działalności gospodarczej.

Selectivity screening revealed that they were devoid of activity at mGlu1, mGlu2 and mGlu5 receptors, but modulated mGlu7 and mGlu8 receptors, thus were classified as group III-preferring mGlu receptor agents. None of the compounds was active towards hERG channels or in the mini-AMES test. The most potent in vitro mGlu4 PAM derivative 52 (N-(3-chloro-4-(5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)phenyl)picolinamide) was readily absorbed after i.p. administration (male Albino Swiss mice) and reached a maximum brain concentration of 949.76 ng/mL. Five modulators (34, 37, 52, 60 and 62) demonstrated significant anxiolytic- and antipsychotic-like properties in the SIH and DOI-induced head twitch test, respectively. Promising data were obtained, especially for N-(4-(5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-3-methylphenyl)picolinamide (62), whose effects in the DOI-induced head twitch test were comparable to those of clozapine and better than those reported for the selective mGlu4 PAM

worldwide decline of pollinators is of growing concern and has been related to the use of insecticides.\nSolitary bees are potentially exposed to many insecticides through contaminated pollen and/or nectar. The kinetics of these compounds in solitary bees is, however, unknown, limiting the use of these important pollinators in pesticide regulations. Here, the toxicokinetics (TK) of chlorpyrifos (as Dursban 480 EC), cypermethrin (Sherpa 100 EC), and acetamiprid (Mospilan 20 SP) was studied for the first time in Osmia bicornis females at sublethal concentrations (near $LC_{20s}$). The TK of the insecticides was analysed in bees continuously exposed to insecticide contaminated food in the uptake phase followed by feeding with clean food in the decontamination phase. The TK models differed substantially between the insecticides. Acetamiprid followed the classic one-compartment model with gradual accumulation during the uptake phase followed by depuration during the decontamination phase. Cypermethrin accumulated rapidly in the first two days and then its concentration decreased slowly. Chlorpyrifos accumulated similarly rapidly but no substantial depuration was found until the end of the experiment. Our study demonstrates that some insecticides can harm solitary bees when exposed continuously even at trace concentrations in food because of their constant accumulation leading to time-reinforced toxicity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057307422","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"293","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/307461","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6554c14a40970749a8f5b39e","name":"Jayasravanthi","lastName":"Mokkapati","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70653a3d-7714-4573-bea9-62eb4a304def"},{"objectId":"61b7456d2467f06307cc995f","name":"Jaya

The role of telemedicine in this context remains equivocal. We investigated whether an outpatient telecare based on nurse-led non-invasive assessments supporting remote therapeutic decisions (AMULET telecare) could improve clinical outcomes in patients after an episode of acute HF during 12-month follow-up.\r\n\r\nMethods and results: In this prospective randomised controlled trial, patients with HF and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤49%, after an episode of acute HF within the last 6 months, were randomly assigned to receive either an outpatient telecare based on nurse-led non-invasive assessments (n = 300) (AMULET model) or standard care (n = 305). The primary composite outcome of unplanned HF hospitalisation or cardiovascular death occurred in 51 (17.1%) patients in the telecare group and 73 (23.9%) patients in the standard care group up to 12 months after randomization [hazard ratio (HR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-0.99; P = 0.044]. The implementation of AMULET telecare, as compared to standard care, reduced the risk of first unplanned HF hospitalisation (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42-0.91; P = 0.015) as well as the risk of total unplanned HF hospitalisations (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.41-0.99; P = 0.044).There was no difference in cardiovascular mortality between the study groups (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.54-1.67; P = 0.930).\r\n\r\nConclusions: AMULET telecare as compared to standard care significantly reduced the risk of HF hospitalisation or cardiovascular death during 12-month follow-up among patients with HF and LVEF ≤49% after an episode of acute HF."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057317311","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a9f568fdbe8339bd9946a3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"02db3c4b-1b54-436b-9535-6f04be961ae0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"565-577","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ejhf.2358","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716e2","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Gielerak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c54324db-b98f-485e-8f04-c1e9f2b09964"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716e1","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Banasiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e31190f3-89aa-42ae-83fb-02101a0447eb"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716e0","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Szalewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"defc1e2d-b016-4901-9ab9-50a56e143e99"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716de","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Murawski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8efd61ef-9104-4513-9a94-57e0a15f38aa"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716dd","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chrom","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02a549f5-4b1f-4f80-a7d6-1b27f6730c7a"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716dc","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Gutknecht","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1ca494c-4e5a-47e5-b6e3-484b808c3024"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716db","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Siwołowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24e7cc1f-e374-4629-b7fd-85c8135034a4"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716da","name":"Adam","lastName":"Stańczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b010aafb-de6c-4810-bee4-c4821dc34ade"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716d9","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Piotrowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41b13fae-86f2-4010-a274-7bf66ae51fc1"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716d8","name":"Agata","lastName":"Galas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"36a81d80-2e88-42bc-ae2e-2001fc837724"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716d7","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Siebert","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68227376-53dc-45b4-8e27-d44ae9a536bc"},{"objectId":"6630bac44097076263e716d6","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krzesiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85053d69-6ae0-46e2-9121-1dd9db690434"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1ae0","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Jankowska","uuid":"5B729C5C5DD6175DDDEECAA1F60AC95B6115E855F3D21EED7BEFC3B6B92A731803D005EE4A622D43FDA03EA0D6A8BF8BCEFE5496C131B0C0A9052310D18AF52D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9202-432X","documentHash":"b4d2345c-586c-4a1a-9673-ac5ff47acaef"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1458","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ponikowski","uuid":"4BA43AD81191E72DA939FC5D83BEA90B9477144E13175E0C90F36EE4CB3FEE9042BB27EBF84E4EC7BA5B8F74BCDAD927438A7A29631A6A4168BC1347284129FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3391-7064","documentHash":"85c7bbe3-e979-4c59-ab11-59e57cb9e09e"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a04739806d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Walczak","uuid":"DD23CF450DDE24B08B5557DB230D7667EFA1ABCE6759C7B2FC45FC0D5BF7E546BEC9F07561C76BD858DB316998CAEA4D923AFCA47E5D2ECAC5958459D00B9CB9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5038-7149","documentHash":"21d64bdc-a092-4932-8c12-e1953e235a9a"}],"doi":"10.1002/ejhf.2358"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","uid":"bmfkTgrYux51kKuOA70Q27Q","uuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","parentUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","rootUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","name":"Instytut Hodowli i Aklimatyzacji Roślin -

Autoxidation of α-linolenic acid is the principal process contributing to the development of off-flavors, loss of color, and alteration in the nutritional value of linseed oil. However, there is huge a demand on the market for oils having different compositions of fatty acids, including the linseed oil characterized by improved stability. For this purpose, a complete diallel cross was performed in this study using six flax genotypes varying in the fatty acid content to estimate the genetic parameters. The analysis of variances carried out for the studied traits (content of oleic, linoleic and α-linolenic acid) indicated large differences among the genotypes. Variances due to GCA were much higher in magnitude than those related to SCA for the content of linoleic and α-linolenic acid, which indicated the superiority of additive gene effects in determining the inheritance of these traits. The nonadditive gene action played an important role for oleic acid content, since the magnitude of SCA effect was almost two times higher than GCA effect. The parental lines of linola (Linola KLA and Linola KLB) exhibited the highest concentration of favorable alleles for the two traits (high content of linoleic acid and low content of α-linolenic acid) and were thus found suitable for a continuous improvement program. On the basis of the SCA effect, five cross combinations, were found to be promising F1 hybrids for use as a source population for further selection, in order to achieve fatty acid changes in linseed. These combinations allow selecting varieties with 1:1 and 2:1 ratio of omega–6:omega–3 fatty acids for producing oil with an extended shelf life for food products."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057317365","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61bb2fc32467f079a079bdaa","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"218","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"5916ce9e-b673-4092-8c97-5ac144f85511"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"218","pagesFromTo":"2","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10681-021-02941-6.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709483878c28a0473bec9b","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Krótka","uuid":"525745D62922646723EF96C065529D00C7C30BA8EB91D0186E132C33B7ABF2C4D2D758DDF6D76401E227C406A04BFEFD07DB72482442CDD9EADA646290EB402E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b48cc4d2-93a6-4a1b-8322-df207f33fdf4"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bead9","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Walkowiak","uuid":"33F8D67D5FDCBCD5F54EF922660AB54D5DB0231A8ACF55F4B059001C5793083655FAF4AC48D7011D6A61AE0840353ED4F2103A383FB458C9AEEBEEDDDF9CD2AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1168-8870","documentHash":"a3686cff-7249-4f51-a7b4-54d59b0650c6"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4972","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Spasibionek","uuid":"A353F873D267A4CF0655B0D4E10D5BD9FC894538A8AC0FF11D8D6FA682D611510703370633760ABF676789A01B1C6F8BE70BD8486F1000068948F193E11D213C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92d7872d-8bb5-4a87-a17d-4dc21f6776f7"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10681-021-02941-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["microstructure","phase transformation","ultrasonics","acustic emision","continuous cooling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of acoustic emission to the analysis of phase transformations in 27MnCrB5-2 steel tests during continuous cooling","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454774b8","mniswId":"2980","title":"Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences: Technical Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"0239-7528","eissn":"2300-1917","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a1a9dcf0-8393-4a15-8ffe-557c354d4f4b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61bb295d2467f00d34564766","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396b5c"]},"issue":"","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The goal of the research was to analyze the acoustic emission signal recorded during the heat treatment.

courtship feedings (10%) and a low level of extra pair copulation (EPC; 0.6%). In this study, we used a set of microsatellite loci to analyse parentage in 56 Whiskered Tern families from southern Poland. Depending on the method, we detected that 1.4%–3.6% of chicks were sired by an \nextra-pair male, and extra-pair chicks were present in 3.6%–8.9% of broods. IBP was observed in 8.9%–14.3% of broods, corresponding to 3.6%–6.4% of the chicks. The low rate of EPP is in agreement with the hypothesis that in species with high male parental investment, females should avoid EPC. The low level of IBP indicates that intraspecifc egg dumping is not a common female strategy in Whiskered Tern, similar to many other colonial waterbird species."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057329147","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"163","pagesFromTo":"437–444","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10336-021-01954-1.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61bc42fd2467f07eeb61b607","name":"Patricia","lastName":"Szczys","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c11fa968-07f2-45cf-a618-014ccc285298"},{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b4457","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Ledwoń","uuid":"B96598ACC3B3B98DD2E20DF618AA06EED4E9B9E592A84B8A62F1B8B128580EA399B2CC24A3E1E663015B2E6E852DD04A3DE9ABC65DC9D250C74FBAD178BF0682","orcidId":"0000-0003-3017-6376","documentHash":"3ebeacc3-f25d-4e8c-a9d1-2980cc4fd4ec"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10336-021-01954-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c8878c28a04739c9a8","5e7092c8878c28a04739c7d3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Content of tryptophan and kynurenines in serum and milk of dairy cows with mastitis caused by Streptococcus spp.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479507","mniswId":"17196","title":"Reproduction in Domestic Animals","doi":null,"issn":"0936-6768","eissn":"1439-0531","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5aade5d0-4eab-4c21-97c4-12892398bcfc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2021-11-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b08a842467f00d532e3ef2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c8878c28a04739c7d3","5e7092c8878c28a04739c9a8","65731c334097071b8e6fdfcd","65731c334097071b8e6fdfce","65731c334097071b8e6fdfcf","65731c334097071b8e6fdfd0","65731c334097071b8e6fdfd1","65731c334097071b8e6fdfd2"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057329266","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"57","pagesFromTo":"277-283","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rda.14050","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65731c334097071b8e6fdfd2","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Krakowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aea1dfcb-89d5-4525-b5a9-d6f40f0d0b52"},{"objectId":"65731c334097071b8e6fdfd1","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Brodzki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3ee7091-e18f-4584-befa-8125ab6a5550"},{"objectId":"65731c334097071b8e6fdfd0","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szczubiał","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b3e98339-8add-4ad7-8566-54129c78767d"},{"objectId":"65731c334097071b8e6fdfcf","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Błaszczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"16df03d3-0cb7-48be-b348-2609b9c46f8f"},{"objectId":"65731c334097071b8e6fdfce","name":"Roman","lastName":"Dąbrowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca40da98-7eec-4fdf-b4fc-82e2405f8f66"},{"objectId":"65731c334097071b8e6fdfcd","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Bochniarz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41d181a7-0d42-4f73-84a7-a6f745067a38"},{"objectId":"5e7092c8878c28a04739c9a8","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Turski","uuid":"322EE114A5CB570E6F55E1954C2D9B1E03BCDC5EE2B977C100754207746104E1CFB7666E64D279E16FC666D543B98A9229E4BC3F57C3B31ED3B2AB1BA77A03D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-5805-5106","documentHash":"1d3f4445-4863-403d-ab26-42453a81f376"},{"objectId":"5e7092c8878c28a04739c7d3","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kocki","uuid":"38B9AC603D00260381864801ECB4BDEAF51545B261778D5B0D09D6D2582993AE8287C079DA38FE0D14120F58195984F404BD20A0818A899A4492EEAC5E22963E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7587-2626","documentHash":"5391c3bf-188d-4a3e-915c-3b572e4ba2a0"}],"doi":"10.1111/rda.14050"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evaluating the effects of botulinum toxin injection and physiotherapy on post-stroke patients during one year observation -

Spasticity is one of the consequences of stroke and affects about 30% of people. Increased muscle tone affects postural control disorders. Due to the specificity of spasticity, therapy in post-stroke patients is a challenge for neurological physiotherapy. Therefore, it requires the development of appropriate management standards .\n\nStudy aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 combination therapy cycles based on botulinum toxin injection and physiotherapy for muscle tone, muscle strength and postural stability in post-stroke patients qualified for the spasticity treatment programme of the lower and upper limbs.\n\nMaterial and methods: The pilot study involved 12 patients (6 from the lower limb and 6 from the upper limb programme). The 1-year combination therapy programmes included 3 botulinum toxin injections and 3 weeks of physiotherapy after each injection. Clinical evaluation was conducted before and after the 1-year observation cycle. The results were evaluated using: MAS (Modified Ashworth Scale), MRC (Medical Research Council Scale) and posture stability test on a balance platform (BiodexSD).\n\nResults: A decrease was observed in muscle tone of the lower and upper limbs, as well as an increase in muscular strength of the upper limb. However, there were no noted statistical significance of the studied parameters.\n\nConclusions: Physiotherapy in combination with the botulinum toxin is an important element of improvement in post-stroke patients. However, further research is needed to explicitly confirm its effectiveness."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057331733","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"27-34","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Ocena wpływu iniekcji toksyny botulinowej oraz fizjoterapii na pacjentów po udarze mózgu w obserwacji rocznej - badanie pilotażowe"}],"publicUri":"https://rehmed.pl/resources/html/article/details?id=225120","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b8cd5b2467f00dcbc7dd3f","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Olszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"afed65a3-aec4-48cb-b167-2ceaa6bcc9f3"},{"objectId":"6049960b9543c711bc6eaa7e","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Opoka-Kubica","uuid":"ADAF0370FA80392B8A386E0A15628154FEF5352155A31317626BCE637C62DD2B012D8A43A84506868EC3923B86AB18868AEE4EC1C5513F957F583203A38FD3E2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff6741c3-5b30-4fa3-8c80-c35525a1096b"},{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb13a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Filip","uuid":"2FC53BDD689653136D793F0BF43A8A718CB002FACDF095D877FF921052EBD6C3EF57975E21BAED589E002D4B55E30B9DE889865DE8038DA0DCCB30974210910A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6131-7410","documentHash":"93b2e3ff-3b68-4d75-8b81-95d1712a6a2e"},{"objectId":"5e70932c878c28a0473a4436","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Pasiut","uuid":"0BA72E98A72376095F057319432E49B65529CF7BB8B1D646153D5D2B4536755095B719C8201A028766D365D7703DB6195D1EFFED586BAE7CCB61225C6D1350F7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e05c0035-d8f3-435d-b082-ba45759215b0"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738ea19","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Mirek","uuid":"68EC38E9248CB2F96CD91C9B2692CF921F29CBBB978F154ABCC5F682A84F7135CA01E7F95EF17FC49249A561FBAD40D75198E9487753ECF8C2208CF797AF1F0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6139-0466","documentHash":"25724277-3a4f-4c89-96fd-034e5cb37538"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.5409"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["occupational safety and health","waste sorting plant","cytotoxity","mycotoxins","harmful biological agents","metagenome analysis","bioaerosol"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdee9","5e709466878c28a0473bc270","5e709269878c28a0473953d5","5e709334878c28a0473a4db8"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec9","uid":"b61xtrk_7aMtYlgdTtxB1KQ","uuid":"c866ff49-25fe-4636-b4ec-5c14998e9eef","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec9","parentUuid":"c866ff49-25fe-4636-b4ec-5c14998e9eef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec9","rootUuid":"c866ff49-25fe-4636-b4ec-5c14998e9eef","name":"Centralny Instytut Ochrony Pracy - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b5936","5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Microbiological and toxicological hazard assessment in a waste sorting plant and proper respiratory protection","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547868b","mniswId":"10995","title":"Journal of Environmental Management","doi":null,"issn":"0301-4797","eissn":"1095-8630","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a8a85e51-c558-4043-b45b-021782e22b46"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b8b77b2467f00dcbc4d515","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709466878c28a0473bc270","5e709334878c28a0473a4db8","5e709479878c28a0473bdee9","5e709269878c28a0473953d5","67370e37fdbe832d85aed1ed","67370e37fdbe832d85aed1ee","67370e37fdbe832d85aed1ef","5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b1","5e70940f878c28a0473b5936"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Even though biological hazards in the work environments related to waste management were the subject of many scientific works, the knowledge of the topic is not extensive. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive assessment of microbiological and toxicological hazards at the workstations in a waste sorting plant and develop guidelines for selecting filtering respiratory protective devices that would consider specific workplace conditions. The research included the assessment of quantity (culture method), diversity (high-throughput sequencing), and metabolites (endotoxin - gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; secondary metabolites - liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry) of microorganisms occurring in the air and settled dust. Moreover, cytotoxicity of settled dust against a human epithelial lung cell line was determined with an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The research was performed in a waste sorting plant (Poland; 240,000 tons waste/year) at six workstations: two feeders, two pre-sorting cabins, secondary raw material press and organic fraction waste feeder for composting.\n\nThe total dust concentration at tested workstations varied from 0.128 mg m-3 to 5.443 mg m-3. The number of microorganisms was between 9.23 × 104 CFU m-3 and 1.38 × 105 CFU m-3 for bacteria and between 1.43 × 105 CFU m-3 and 1.65 × 105 CFU m-3 for fungi, which suggests high microbial contamination of the sorting facility. The numbers of microorganisms in the air correlated very strongly (R2 from 0.70 to 0.94) with those observed in settled dust. Microorganisms representing Group 2 biological agents (acc. to Directive, 2000/54/EC), including Corynebacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and others potentially hazardous to human health, were identified. The endotoxins concentration in settled dust ranged from 0.013 nmol LPS mg-1 to 0.048 nmol LPS mg-1.

Combating this problem starts with improving global surveillance of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and applying standardized protocols, both in a clinical and environmental context, in agreement with the One Health approach. Exceptional efforts should be directed to controlling ARGs conferring resistance to Critically Important Antimicrobials (CIA). In this study, a systematic literature review to synthesize data on the identification of mcr genes using a PCR technique was performed. Additionally, a novel set of PCR primers for mcr-1 – mcr-9 genes detection was proposed. The developed primers were in silico and experimentally validated by comparison with mcr-specific PCR primers reported in the literature. This validation, besides being a proof-of-concept for primers’ usefulness, provided insight into the distribution of mcr genes in municipal wastewater, clay and river sediments, glacier moraine, manure, seagulls and auks feces and daphnids from four countries. This analysis proved that commonly used primers may deliver false results, and some mcr genes may be overlooked in tested samples. Newly-developed PCR primers turned out to be relevant for the screening of mcr genes in various environments."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057337318","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"425","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421029058","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b9f6562467f07b6bbc492a","name":"Jan","lastName":"Bartacek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d28461d9-f67a-4008-b234-02fc05f0b833"},{"objectId":"61b9f6562467f07b6bbc4929","name":"Celia

Growing interactions of humans with non-human intelligent systems are both a source of threats and a source of hopes. In this paper, some ethical challenges in the development and application of weak and strong AI systems are analyzed. Then, legal challenges that appear when legislators attempt to regulate uncertain and unpredictable phenomena such as AI are discussed. Here we show that despite these challenges, an appropriate law is the most optimal response to threats and hopes related to AI. We also point out that the development of AI will be a major political challenge. Politicians will have to find a difficult compromise between, on the one hand, consenting to the inevitable and essentially beneficial technological development for humanity and, on the other hand, certain risks and dangers, probably also inherent in the specificity of AI functioning."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057340374","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66cef271fdbe831381456856","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"79","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"fc0b11e7-bc5f-4de0-8d70-e096f6f36069"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"79","pagesFromTo":"557-573","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02604027.2021.2012876","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d3d","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Szocik","uuid":"52B07C4E29E4CA94009732F074330C22D995448B41C81680DE1A34B823D4DADB685FB9300D3CA9E58629BE6FC363559ADE5BB44C64802B26E1579C9DAF205C73","orcidId":"0000-0002-7262-3915","documentHash":"5b76818c-f758-4c2d-bddb-b5681ae634da"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a04739800b","name":"Agata","lastName":"Jurkowska-Gomułka","uuid":"2229F4DF5CF4133E40AC55CD7A2554B219048408A3BDD998330D95395DBD14FC47D81F2BBF036F58BC6A21DB35B0225CE703D78FA73AB38A7B4BA54ECE4F57FB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7074-6850","documentHash":"56ca0875-1290-41da-8cf0-6b04381886e2"}],"doi":"10.1080/02604027.2021.2012876"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Energy efficiency","Data envelop analysis","Ordinary least squire","Data envelop analysis Ordinary least squire"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a054b87523402fabdf7cb2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Does green finance improve energy efficiency?

The findings reveal a lower degree of EE in advanced and emerging economies (0.44), discovering only seven nations, saving energy with DEA and the West Asia and North Africa groups as the top energy savers. Moreover, the mean EE ratio of the advanced and emerging countries plummeted, dating back to 2013, whereas financial investment positively impacts EE. Similarly, the study perceives how open structures in the nations' economic systems can advance ecological conditions by reducing pollution levels and graft enable EE and reduce pollution levels. Simultaneously, natural resources and technological advancements can accelerate the course of EE and ecological dimensions. Therefore, analysis of causality reinforce the response hypotheses between EE, Environmental carbon emissions levels, financial advancements, graft control, proceeds from mineral resources, technological creativity, commerce, and localization of industries, respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057351781","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d2705140970773d53ed919","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"55","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"c353e6fe-a829-41dd-a301-4b99ab50aeed"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"55","pagesFromTo":"485-509","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10644-021-09355-3.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b20e502467f0304ba0af91","name":"Nadeem","lastName":"Iqbal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1ad6db5-2082-4c11-895e-f8a182f3b952"},{"objectId":"61b20e502467f0304ba0af8e","name":"Mui Yee","lastName":"Cheok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98a37dfb-7189-43ef-8c66-486c065808a3"},{"objectId":"61b20e502467f0304ba0af8d","name":"Qiang","lastName":"Zhou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bcb4b18d-2da8-4b0f-8ad8-e657f74fc58e"},{"objectId":"61b20e502467f0304ba0af8a","name":"Mingzhe","lastName":"Yu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18318de8-6649-49c0-a5a2-01565b2078f9"},{"objectId":"61a054b87523402fabdf7cb2","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kubiczek","uuid":"9EB21E38825C1C7BB67D91679344F041D8C48C2A93D44AF3251ACD72D95BE5CE1213554D3F84E3C0958BA95A4992F0F5251CE33254C28E1E09A847DC9B824383","orcidId":"0000-0003-4599-4814","documentHash":"03b198d5-df2d-4e19-9666-6f1db8e287f9"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10644-021-09355-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Slavic language","stask-oriented dialogue systems","non-task-oriented dialogue systems","chatbots","machine learning","artificial intelligence"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Survey on Dialogue Systems including Slavic Languages","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fd0","mniswId":"14934","title":"Neurocomputing","doi":null,"issn":"0925-2312","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f5c9a279-d890-4afe-8538-0482246527d7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b1f5b42467f0304b974005","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393781","63cfc3a84097076d267a778a","63cfc3a84097076d267a778b","63cfc3a84097076d267a778c","63cfc3a84097076d267a778d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Slavic languages pose a challenge to the researchers in the domain of dialogue technology.

It focuses in particular on - firstly - a consequent new impetus to bolster human rights in international politics, as Western democracies - especially the US - integrated human rights concerns into its foreign policy relations with Soviet Bloc countries and - secondly – how this Western embrace of human rights seemed to create new incentives for increased dissident activity in Central and Eastern Europe and from 1976 onward. Finally, the book reminds us of the significant role of the Helsinki Accords in developing democratic practices in Eastern European societies under Soviet domination in 1975-1989 and in creating the conditions for the peaceful transition to democratic government in the years that followed.

As an image super-resolution method, deep learning can extract more stable and higher level features. However, image super-resolution processing is an ill posed problem. Due to the lack of self-attentional negative feedback mechanism, the existing methods can not better constrain the mapping space from low-resolution image to high-resolution image, so generated high-resolution (HR) image does not conform to human visual perception. Therefore, this paper proposes a self-attention negative feedback network (SRAFBN) for realizing the real-time image SR. The network model constrains the image mapping space and selects the key information of the image through the self-attention negative feedback model, so that higher quality images can be generated to meet human visual perception. Specifically, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is firstly utilized to construct multiple negative feedback modules, and each module generates a HR image. Then, the key information of the generated image is extracted by the self-attention mechanism. Finally, the extracted information is fused to generate the final HR image.

However, the accuracy of environmental assessment based on species patterns may often be affected by insufficient survey details. The comprehensive evaluation of plant taxa richness in rivers requires an extensive sampling effort. The use of Hill numbers and Chao estimators improves species diversity assessment based on a feasible number of samples. The aim of this work was to identify macrophyte groups, associated with various species traits, which are rich in species, as well as those whose detection is particularly difficult as it requires an exceptional sampling effort (sources of dark diversity). Analyses were performed with the use of Hill numbers and Chao estimators. It was shown that the field identification of all estimated macrophytes is particularly difficult for low trophy indicators and generally submerged plants, as well as for small-leaved species. A field survey encompassing the full (expected) macrophyte diversity encountered within a river is easiest to perform in the case of free-floating plants and large-leaved macrophytes, as well as for species with high trophic tolerance. The study proved that ecological assessment of rivers based on a small number of sampling units may lead to incorrect diversity estimates. Conversely, the estimation of diversity patterns at the level of the Shannon and Simpson indices does not require extensive sampling, and the extrapolation approach is not needed. The effectiveness of diversity assessment in fluvial ecosystems can be increased by extrapolation of gray diversity which can be considered in planning of monitoring programs. Moreover even estimated dark diversity bight be already efficient to identify ecological pattern and when comparing biodiversity across regions and ecosystems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057368954","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6221c75d2467f016970d33d9","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"42529411-d945-4a52-abc7-987acf7ffd7e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"816","pagesFromTo":"151496","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721065748","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b48c472467f07fb4c0cd63","name":"Karol","lastName":"Pietruczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2506196d-388d-4707-8029-896db05d8160"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6467","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szoszkiewicz","uuid":"70A0389D83AA59B6EA4BE26DFA1F7723A310A0A8D648E35701BF5255382551399121B0B3D163C92C43CE026ED9360C981A0C1419CF74FB72CB34AB0DBF170EF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-8196-333X","documentHash":"76fd9dcd-6586-44ee-acdd-13ad636cbfaa"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a639c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Łacka","uuid":"8EE236F662B39D18C55445A77938FD8221CFBDBE0352EA1F33508172322BB89DCAE23B69F38734ECB83657626B74F2C13E459DE5B8526C65A77F42035A50BE11","orcidId":"0000-0002-8514-5449","documentHash":"0dc4e006-338d-4862-86ba-788600ad7f52"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a61e5","name":"Anna","lastName":"Budka","uuid":"3EDE4F2FA293EC98C7D42A42D5C9ED780D8D7170C0B2F42954420013FEB939FE3DF33C66CCD4D4B7070A61A1FB978547EAD25DF57DDD68303B23E110F8F8F004","orcidId":"0000-0002-0929-5285","documentHash":"26dbb0f3-581e-4226-bb7b-c96683e7637a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151496"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Historia","Mennonici","Twierdza Modlin","Mazowsze","Osadnictwo"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["History","Mennonites","Modlin Fortress","Mazovia","Settlement"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61b46b752467f07fb4bdc003","doi":null,"title":"Z głębokości.

Also the deceleration of migration and the shape of the contaminant plume in individual geological formations of the reactor surroundings, resulting from different values ​​of sorption affinity, were compared. The simulations were carried out for four selected metals (Co, Cd, Cu, Pb), which in relation to the raw coal and post-process char showed different sorption properties. The sorption parameters of the tested systems were determined experimentally on the basis of the Freundlich isotherm equation. The retardation coefficients were calculated and the degree of sorption intensity in hydrogeological media was classified from II (in the cobalt-char and metals-coal systems) to the IV class of sorption intensity (in the copper-char system).\nThe modeling was carried out using the finite element method (FEM) in the COMSOL Multiphysics computing environment in a two-dimensional plane. The simulation of pollutant migration was carried out for the transient state, with the assumed time horizon up to 20 years after the termination of the UCG experiment. The bottom of the cavity formed due to the coal gasification in situ (10 m  ×  20 m ellipse) was assumed as the source of contamination and the spread of metals in a horizontal plane 200 m long and 200 m wide was analyzed.\nTo compare the extent to which sorption phenomena affect the spread of pollutants, an additional model was constructed, taking into account only the advection–dispersion movement of the contaminant plume. The consequence of sorption interactions for the tested systems was the delay of the contaminant plume migration depending on time since the termination of the gasification process and depending on the distance from the source of pollution. Due to high sorption affinities, the post-process char acts as an effective buffer for inorganic pollutants and slows down the migration of analyzed metals even 20 years after UCG experiment. The greatest slowdown in migration in relation to the velocity of groundwater flow as a result of sorption occurred for copper transport in the char layer."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057377239","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"317","pagesFromTo":"Artykuł nr 122831","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0016236121026946?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afee0","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Strugała-Wilczek","uuid":"E1AB577D55E4BCD2C3F3D512DD7A2219F8013EED6A09B513D9567937B5C7BC04BAF394BA5643B694AC4795470CBCB63878271893166115E11C50FD6FA64E333E","orcidId":"0000-0001-5414-5676","documentHash":"af52fc94-0f78-4bf2-b54f-df751ffbd4f4"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a04739433a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kapusta","uuid":"7806AFC32353111DB00FBC716E74A0D436AB6C209E201739FA9E116EEEFCF903AC622B9FB8CCA00C8AF6672268B39C777CF9280D73DB3AF4CD8F69913B71B4B7","orcidId":"0000-0001-6343-9027","documentHash":"9e5edbb7-419d-4d66-a1e9-0fd9cb5205e2"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.fuel.2021.122831"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Level of Kinesiophobia and Its Relationship with Physical Activity in People with \na History of Ankle Sprain","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a3db","mniswId":"25906","title":"Rehabilitacja Medyczna","doi":null,"issn":"1427-9622","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"97fde98a-c08e-4577-9d2e-a3d766da9256"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b6f9752467f06307b0f715","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61b6f9752467f06307b0f716","5e709232878c28a0473918d1","61b6f9752467f06307b0f718","5e709232878c28a0473918d4","61b6f9752467f06307b0f71a","5e709392878c28a0473ad3c3"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Kinesiophobia is one of the leading clinical factors in recovery from injury. The stressful situation of an ankle joint injury can cause severe withdrawal and fear of the patient to undertake physical activity, resulting in hypokinesia.\n\nObjectives: The aim of the study was to demonstrate the relationship between the level of daily physical activity reported by the respondent after an ankle sprain and severity of the kinesiophobia phenomenon.\n\nMaterial and methods: The study comprised 78 people (mean age 23.1 years ±3.3) with a history of ankle sprain injury. This population was divided into 2 groups, taking the given level of physical activityinto account. GR1 consisted of 34 patients with an activity level of 0-3 hours a week of sports activity, GR2 was made up of 44 individualsreporting a level of physical activity> 3 hours a week. In order to obtain the necessary results, the respondents filled in their own personal data sheet; and 3standardised questionnaires translated into Polish: Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM); Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ); Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK-17).\n\nResults: A high level of physical activity helps to avoid limitations in ankle and foot functioning. A relationship was found between functional limitations and the intensity of fear regarding movement according to the FABQ questionnaire. The limitations of the foot function translate into higher results for the FABQ questionnaire. No other statistically significant relationships were found.\n\nConclusions: Kinesiophobia is a protective factor in the acute disease/injury phase. Physiologically, its level should decrease as functional abilities are regained. If the functional limitations remain high, the fear of movement also increases. Regular, high-level physical activity significantly improves the functioning of the ankle and foot, and reduces the level of kinesiophobia."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057377661","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"10-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Poziom kinezjofobii i jej związek z aktywnością fizyczną u osób po przebytym skręceniu stawu skokowo-goleniowego"}],"publicUri":"https://rehmed.pl/resources/html/article/details?id=225768","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b6f9752467f06307b0f71a","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Golec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5733bb48-48b9-41b6-9d97-add9bf958375"},{"objectId":"61b6f9752467f06307b0f718","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Serafin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"804bf715-b5da-42f3-b607-cf5e17aa1c8f"},{"objectId":"61b6f9752467f06307b0f716","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Balicka-Bom","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6950e7fe-ed77-411a-a5a1-588a24b31069"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad3c3","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Sihinkiewicz","uuid":"4476A2991C714C476D32B7476A0DEDF581C809CFAEAD326A6427D9E4DCDDB84B841D94519CF98189B3FA2FB1F86F9D6CAF442BB24F4527A5F0AB6912D9EC99D4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5601e490-453b-4506-95a2-19f6f0fa303f"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473918d4","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Szczygieł","uuid":"8D0D3CBBE99B35AFEEA39C7FCA3E2245C297B2CD002BB39692278BC08A76601EAF495D5827A48885883C9D6736C47F0DA2EA3B19C6AF3076CADF80A086AB6B21","orcidId":"0000-0002-6736-4322","documentHash":"7d5c5f6e-e138-486d-8439-0f6e04cab772"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473918d1","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Golec","uuid":"102CBEA2B3110620CCBA7218143D9D74B8E74347D56CFC3E79CF2187EDC4B59FF6B0AD8757BA118AA476502FD4E1667BBB3B9FD9A68549741934AD3008560470","orcidId":"0000-0001-8687-2536","documentHash":"04f90cc1-784a-4730-a418-129475c702b4"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.5903"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS)","Diagnostic measurements","Crack detection","Intensity","Laser spot size"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b0878c28a04739abb4","60c315a09543c72336543c90","5e70928b878c28a04739796d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Crack detection in building walls based on geometric and radiometric point cloud information","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454772af","mniswId":"2196","title":"Automation in Construction","doi":null,"issn":"0926-5805","eissn":"1872-7891","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/automation-in-construction/editorial-board/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"3958edda-20c5-40fd-98d9-14b3ccb59cff"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61b735ae2467f06307c6bec4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c315a09543c72336543c90","5e70928b878c28a04739796d","5e7092b0878c28a04739abb4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Symptoms such as cracks and other discontinuities of the scanned surface are indicators of poor technical conditions of buildings. The efficient detection of such changes using non-destructive remote measuring techniques is an important research topic because it may minimise the risk of building disasters. Terrestrial laser scanners register radiometric information of laser beams reflected from scanned surfaces (i.e., the intensity parameter), in addition to 3D spatial coordinates. Therefore, this study was focused on integrating geometric information with radiometric information of a point cloud in crack detection. The obtained results enabled the authors to develop a measurement methodology for detecting building wall cracks using a terrestrial laser scanner considering the technical parameters of the scanner and the ‘geometric’ conditions of the measurement. In addition, the influence of technical parameters of the scanner (such as laser spot size and laser beam divergence) on effective crack detection was discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057382587","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61b84f2c2467f00dcba44c0a","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"134","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"a9b9a344-9f70-4ccf-b086-fc29a6cf4bf5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"134","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580521005161","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c315a09543c72336543c90","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Stałowska","uuid":"BF9F838BFC65B75693EE676DEBEC2C98DEB506354A1BF58ED4C97136203B7C1EF3C4DAE5C1F120941A9E0DA2349725512B43C1966F2A4F18888133F6D7CE5031","orcidId":"0000-0001-8386-416X","documentHash":"97f5f67a-1022-4fbf-94bd-ced4de191cc7"},{"objectId":"5e7092b0878c28a04739abb4","name":"Miłosława","lastName":"Rutkowska","uuid":"49E6A7469BB6BD87DC8DF8D5923DD34C0FBFE02BCB664E1D28C23A1BCB544781AAD947CBC33770C467C93E13DBE2A908ADC6931B08588A264FDAA12FB0160471","orcidId":"0000-0002-7345-9889","documentHash":"8685c5f6-ec3b-4894-a9c1-5fb494273e11"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a04739796d","name":"Czesław","lastName":"Suchocki","uuid":"57691265BF15745DC5E12C5A529DF4776E015FD7583414108AB93849E4B2B2400C2CC2751928B340F681B973D3894D187AD710566E41B44A29E4EE1B0905EE38","orcidId":"0000-0002-0121-5711","documentHash":"4b6d79f3-c3ec-4a1f-a7f0-16cbc7c87082"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.autcon.2021.104065"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Rotational
