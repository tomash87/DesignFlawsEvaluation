The analysis was carried out using multibody simulation technique (MBS). Measurements of tram wheel rims and sample models of flat spots were used as input data. It has been observed that the presence of wheel OOR deviations caused a significant increase in vertical impact loads at the interface between the wheel and the rail, which favours rolling contact fatigue formation. Deviations created at the stage of manufacturing the wheel rim (usually while the profile of the rim itself is turned on a lathe) were amplified by increasing amplitudes and were also visible during the measurement of worn rims, thus creating inequalities with dominant amplitudes. Flat spots present on the rolling surfaces of the wheels cause cyclic jumps of vertical force at the contact point of the wheel and the rail, with maximum values depending on the depth and radius of the rounded edges of the flat spot, and thus subject to change in subsequent stages of the flat spot development. Taking into account the observations made, preventive measures have been proposed against the development of OOR deviations in tram wheels, the origin of which is primarily in the machining process."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056356360","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c53aba4097074de2232fda","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"236","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"ea863678-6a07-49ef-8cdb-2abb220b2579"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"236","pagesFromTo":"122 - 133","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954409721994036","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aeabe","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Firlik","uuid":"4EF7A9CC16E86ED7BC0B5C438D55412C3D2BDF82B6BD4ECBD6474B75B4E7886F7CD4ECB993EF6C1121D0069BB50B93809A80B329916F1C72A244E08CB8F69EF6","orcidId":"0000-0003-3355-5451","documentHash":"2602f6bc-a3ca-4149-bd64-ddc95bec071a"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aea2b","name":"Julian","lastName":"Kominowski","uuid":"B33D42EE0C2F829DCF038426FB36DE6AED21546DEC285DBC934818B71E67F7C643A0970C300D38E81DBF70821D72A58275F3D1CE1B02FE64B9D666A4789683A8","orcidId":"0000-0002-3528-2226","documentHash":"718129c1-634a-4504-b851-4f6482168c61"},{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a6e74","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Staśkiewicz","uuid":"B3FD336BD58EBA2A79028775C358E1D7EC99BC45407FA74CF69BE83CAA1D671FFC1F9333B364A76B9D12F34AD27FFF91E0BFD0E06DDCF4097C17BE4AD7438A9C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2427-7525","documentHash":"ae3621d4-568f-43e7-b5c1-cd95e817d3bc"}],"doi":"10.1177/0954409721994036"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Maternal diet in pregnancy and child's respiratory outcomes: an individual participant data meta-analysis of 18 000 children","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c21","mniswId":"6327","title":"European Respiratory Journal","doi":null,"issn":"0903-1936","eissn":"1399-3003","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"49a2cbef-2ef1-495d-94ca-3cf74ae3aeec"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"615ab8d42467f07ea9629201","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e2878c28a04739eae1","658e797d4097076c145c5b89","658e797d4097076c145c5b8a","658e797d4097076c145c5b8b","658e797d4097076c145c5b8c","658e797d4097076c145c5b8d","658e797d4097076c145c5b8e","658e797d4097076c145c5b8f","658e797d4097076c145c5b90","658e797d4097076c145c5b91","5e7092e2878c28a04739eb68","658e797d4097076c145c5b93","658e797d4097076c145c5b94","658e797d4097076c145c5b95","658e797d4097076c145c5b96","658e797d4097076c145c5b97","658e797d4097076c145c5b98","658e797d4097076c145c5b99","5e70940c878c28a0473b573d","658e797d4097076c145c5b9b","658e797d4097076c145c5b9c","658e797d4097076c145c5b9d","658e797d4097076c145c5b9e","658e797d4097076c145c5b9f"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Rationale: Severe fetal malnutrition has been related to an increased risk of respiratory diseases later in life, but evidence for the association of a suboptimal diet during pregnancy with respiratory outcomes in childhood is conflicting. We aimed to examine whether a pro-inflammatory or low-quality maternal diet during pregnancy was associated with child's respiratory health.\r\n\r\nMethods: We performed an individual participant meta-analysis among 18 326 mother-child pairs from seven European birth cohorts. Maternal pro-inflammatory and low-quality diet were estimated by energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DIITM) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) scores. Preschool wheezing and school-age asthma were measured by questionnaires and lung function by spirometry.\r\n\r\nResults: After adjustment for lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, we observed that a higher maternal E-DII score (a more pro-inflammatory diet) during pregnancy was associated only with a lower FVC in children (Z-score difference (95% confidence interval (CI)): -0.05 (-0.08, -0.02), per IQR increase). No linear associations of the maternal E-DII or DASH score with child's wheezing or asthma were observed. When exploratively examining the extremes, a very low DASH score (<10th percentile) (a very low dietary quality) was associated with an increased risk of preschool wheezing and a low FEV1/FVC (z-score <-1.64) (OR (95% CI) 1.20 (1.06, 1.36), 1.40 (1.06, 1.85), compared to ≥10th percentile), with corresponding population attributable risk fractions of 1.7% and 3.3%.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Main results from this individual participant data meta-analysis do not support the hypothesis that maternal pro-inflammatory or low-quality diet in pregnancy are related to respiratory diseases in childhood."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056356698","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"59","pagesFromTo":"1-1","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2021/08/26/13993003.01315-2021","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658e797d4097076c145c5b9f","name":"Liesbeth","lastName":"Duijts","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c61d974-e580-491a-9d7d-5f80bfaf75c0"},{"objectId":"658e797d4097076c145c5b9e","name":"Vincent W.

The latter approach is widely performed due to the similarity in color to the nasal mucosa. However, we lack a histologic description of the curved vomerine mucosa in cleft lip and palate malformations.\nMethods: We histologically examined an excess of curved vomerine mucosa in 8 patients using hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, Elastin van Gieson, and Alcian blue stains. Tissue samples were obtained during surgery at 8 months of age.\nResults: Our histological analysis of the mucoperiosteum overlying the curved vomer revealed characteristics consistent with those of an oral mucosa or a squamous metaplasia of the nasal mucosa, as exhibited by a stratified squamous epithelium containing numerous seromucous glands. Some areas showed a palisaded arrangement of the basal cells compatible with metaplasia of respiratory epithelium, but no goblet cells or respiratory cilia were identified. Abundant fibrosis and rich vascularity were present.\nConclusion: The vomer mucosa showed no specific signs of nasal mucosa. These findings should be considered in presurgical cleft orthopedics and palatal surgery for further refinement. Shifting the vomer mucosa according to a fixed physiologic belief should not overrule other important aspects of cleft repair such as primary healing and establishing optimal form and function of palatal roof and nasal floor."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056362997","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6598714a40970755be69001b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"59","number":"8","doi":"","documentHash":"c5901905-8583-420f-b50e-51afe67eabdc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"59","pagesFromTo":"1048-1055","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/10556656211031419","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"615c37432467f05fd3a6e04b","name":"Andreas

The Devonian CSO display highly depleted, harzburgite mantle sections containing gabbroic dykes and local occurrences of mostly isotropic, large gabbroic bodies as well as volcanic rocks. The ultramafic rocks locally show melt percolation-derived clinopyroxene-olivine aggregates and chromitites. The low REE composition and depletion in LREE relative to HREE of the clinopyroxene as well as the chromite Cr# and Mg# values are typical for phases formed from refractory melts occurring in the supra-subduction zone environment. The gabbroic bodies consist of differently evolved, mostly cumulate rocks, while the volcanic rocks form a relatively monotonous basalt sequence. The trace element compositions of both the plutonic and volcanic rocks display depleted N-MORB affinities, their derivation from a refractory mantle source is further reflected by previously published depleted mantle-like Sr-Nd isotopic compositions. The ultramafic and mafic members of the CSO show greenschist- to lower amphibolite-facies metamorphic overprints.</p>\r\n<p>The occurrence of depleted harzburgites and isotropic gabbros forming the mantle and the crustal sections of the CSO, respectively, indicate intermediate- to slow-spreading conditions and a heterogeneous structure of the oceanic lithosphere, untypical for layered ophiolites. The geochemical characteristics of the melt-percolation phases of the ultramafic rocks, the bulk-rock compositions of the mafic rocks and the homogeneous volcanic sequences suggest a formation of the CSO in a mature back-arc basin setting, lacking subduction-derived contamination. Spreading rate conditions and geochemical affinities of the CSO are similar to those of other Devonian ophiolites localized along the Variscan Belt, for instance the Upper Ophiolitic Units in the NW

The Rodnan skin score (RSS) is one of the established methods to examine skin thickness among patients with Sc. Due to RSS limitations, for instance, lack of detection of subclinical changes, a new tool is needed for the evaluation of Sc. In recent studies, shear wave elastography (SWE) has been examined as a potential tool to assess skin involvement through the evaluation of skin strain.\nAim: To verify whether elastography is a reliable method to examine Sc progression and possibly provide one useful site to perform the examination – as an easy, cheap, and reliable examination tool.\n\nMaterial and methods\nForty Sc patients were examined, and 28 healthy individuals were recruited for the control group. Among the patients and control group, skin thickness was assessed using the RSS and skin strain measurements using elastography in 20 body locations.\n\nResults\nSWE in the right-hand finger can be treated as an important diagnostic indicator of the severity of Sc.\n\nConclusions\nSWE is a reliable method for evaluating skin involvement among patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Right finger measurements correlate positively with Rodnan’s results and can be a predictor of the severity of SSc. This study found SWE to be a reliable method for examining SSc progression and possibly one useful site for the examination."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056370103","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6334201b4097070fbdd5f27a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"39","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"0cab0335-1942-4607-88e7-8f1cbbddb70e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"775-781","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Elastography-as-a-possible-useful-method-of-assessment-r-nof-skin-involvement-in-systemic-sclerosis,7,45298,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657308e04097071b8e6fb34d","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Zakrzewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"42cda2c2-6a69-43f0-b464-dbae5a860bf5"},{"objectId":"657308e04097071b8e6fb34c","name":"Monika","lastName":"Dźwigała","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8c8d692-3a16-45f1-a61b-e4a3e0e2c0ae"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6c65","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"628FADD5A587E062EED56A8424BC84B32AADB8BBE996FBD67EA1864ACDF226E8096CB5669F3C08D66F7FEB62CC353A2549849E45024FF60FB44F94CA327F481C","orcidId":"0000-0003-1287-8016","documentHash":"c941a4b0-0562-4e88-bac7-c0fcc79aeed6"},{"objectId":"5e7094ab878c28a0473c1553","name":"Irena","lastName":"Walecka - Herniczek","uuid":"A84A5C8FE6355BDCBCD3F9D94A97125F6FB7351E2570AA58DE6F2D691BA9A10DED17562E708CAE2FFFC468BD22F597FEB921C555AFB02411BD94F2552F119CE5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3502-3339","documentHash":"5d73e80a-452d-47a8-8c75-43ab2551053a"},{"objectId":"5e709369878c28a0473a9047","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Paluch","uuid":"051A663B2F0806BC0E15464B7BB7451BCF8BD8E40382E4397ABBB3832891362A2FA652399518432E66E822345C8016FEA9D9507BAF1FC83662C6C6B9DED8BA4B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8bd565db-0ba2-49c3-add8-8da3d5d70935"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5bee","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sobolewski","uuid":"33DEE02173092CF6F83B49A03D92F7797B1789397A4C2188E5D379EC76D33224C488AB12387065E3E7ABB5A4B27F2C05E4037B0C3185BAA99DD9415EDED98278","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"67cfad1f-f1d9-4641-acfb-b6c4747f3d3e"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0037","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Bogucki","uuid":"2DC075FF8BA295F1134420F4B011227778B958F27D6EA8AE45196237ADA2E9E15CF5919CD3EF0A0D86D87AAD43A9F84E00AFB936106DEE4307B8B5E1FCCB0972","orcidId":"0000-0002-8683-545X","documentHash":"b8ffd586-8250-498c-8639-4f892a65ee14"}],"doi":"10.5114/ada.2021.109503"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The late modernist community in the late socialistic block of flats: the issue of urban neighbourhood vitality in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478778","mniswId":"11353","title":"Journal of Housing and the Built Environment","doi":null,"issn":"1566-4910","eissn":"1573-7772","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b5d15378-4756-458e-a3ff-b426e6137370"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"615d72042467f053c3d0f493","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f2878c28a04739fc3c","659098104097076c147bc2c0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The question of the big-city neighbourhood seems important due to the discussion on the condition of modern cities. The issue is centred on the problems of sustainable development and designing social relations. The problem of the neighbourhood in relation to various forms of residence triggers a discussion rooted in the classic issues of sociology as a discipline. In the proposed article, the researchers address the problem of the late socialistic block of flats, attempting to diagnose the condition of the modern urban community in the developmental context of Central Europe, based on the neoclassic concept of ‘spatially determined social circle’. The text introduces the issues of ‘socialist modernism’ using the available Central European literature. In the research part, the data obtained from an online survey on the subject conducted in 2019 in three Polish cities and from a nationwide online survey on the same subject are statistically analysed. The linear regression analysis suggested the relative vitality of the block form of residence, whose sources are both economic and social. The problem of traditional forms of accommodation and urban neighbourhoods has become a hotly debated political issue that triggers a scientific reflection on the phenomena of integration and disintegration in cities. In this context, the issue of the vitality of the forms of housing seems important not only for diagnosis purposes but also for predictions for the forthcoming decades. The case to be analysed herein is that of the late socialistic block of flats (LSBF) in Central and Eastern European countries, which for some is an anachronistic form of residence whereas for others is a partial solution to the insufficient market dynamics intended to meet people’s housing needs. In this context, we ask four questions based on a hypothesis regarding LSBF urban neighbourhood vitality in Poland. The first question is a partly theoretical question based on the conceptualisation of social circles: To what extent does living in an LSBF modify one’s sense of belonging to a social circle? The second question concerns the empirical findings regarding the LSBF neighbourhood: What is the neighbourhood assessment related to declared residence in an LSBF? The third question concerns more specific subjects related to the LSBF neighbourhood: To what extent does living in an LSBF affect the declared depth of neighbourly relations? The fourth and last question relates to the notion of vitality of the LSBF neighbourhood: Does the length of residence in an LSBF impact the interactions between the neighbours therein? The questions concerning the present-day LSBF cannot be answered without historical references to the concept of the city of socialist modernism. It is only from the genetic perspective dating back to several decades that we can understand the dynamics of the process, which has been marked by a few fundamental tribulations.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747056373359","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"101-123","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659098104097076c147bc2c0","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Siatkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"460d3f13-d797-49ec-98eb-bf1ccdc07790"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fc3c","name":"Marek","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"E76EC1EFA60826793414F647E6DC5978AF72504CF31F11085D3BAF4690039E7EB56FFD37C5FAA6F532C39B4199AE2AC6D8CAEFA6A6A9965A5B97AE8F45EB2827","orcidId":"0000-0003-1749-7669","documentHash":"a0dffaa0-3f3f-483d-ae3c-ffa7720ef531"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10901-021-09844-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["molecular dynamics of butanol isomers","hydroxyl group","intermolecular interactions","alkyl","phenyl"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1c3","uid":"bq_xQN8TIwb_G48D9ae-rfg","uuid":"44cbe16c-3cde-4b4b-9c64-ad6da30ce36d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Instytut Fizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f157","5e7092e6878c28a04739ee74","5e709301878c28a0473a0d62","602b75b99543c7410626dd79","602b9e439543c7410626deea","5e7092ea878c28a04739f17e","5e70938d878c28a0473ac987"]},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e222","uid":"bqUMsPRTnkdr3xb8gKTDKbg","uuid":"61f7b6ee-2f6b-4841-b62c-d6ff496bd8bf","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Instytut Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602b8c5d9543c7410626de4c","5e7093ce878c28a0473b1209"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Systematic studies on the dynamics, intermolecular interactions and local structure in the alkyl and phenyl substituted butanol isomers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788ad","mniswId":"11911","title":"JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS","doi":null,"issn":"0167-7322","eissn":"1873-3166","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d8ba94a3-fab2-4bfd-9a05-8b5de56fd80f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-07-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"615d938c2467f053c3d6a4c0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602b75b99543c7410626dd79","5e70938d878c28a0473ac987","602b9e439543c7410626deea","5e709301878c28a0473a0d62","5e7092ea878c28a04739f157","5e7092e6878c28a04739ee74","5e7092ea878c28a04739f17e","602b8c5d9543c7410626de4c","5e7093ce878c28a0473b1209"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we have studied local structure, interactions scheme and molecular dynamics of series of aliphatic butanol (AB) isomers: n-butanol, iso-butanol, sec-butanol, and their phenyl counterparts (PhB): 4-phenyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-3-phenyl-1-propanol, and 4-phenyl-2-butanol by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) methods. XRD demonstrated that aside from the main peak related to the nearest-neighbour intermolecular correlations, there is a strong pre-peak at low scattering vector range for ABs, while for PhBs, this diffraction feature was weakly visible or not detected at all. At first sight, it suggests that molecules in aliphatic alcohols tend to associate and form medium-range order, while PhBs can be considered as disordered, simple liquids. However, further thorough FTIR and BDS spectroscopy investigations have shown that the phenyl moiety affects only slightly the degree of association and does not influence the strength of H-bonds in aromatic alcohols. What is more, PhBs are characterized by a similar Kirkwood factor (gk 1) to the ABs. 4-phenyl-2-butanol is characterized by the greatest gk ~ 3.7 among all studied herein alcohols, indicating a strong correlation between dipole moments and the formation of nanoassociates of chain-like topology in its structure. Combining results obtained from different experimental techniques, we pointed out that there are clear differences in dynamic and static properties between primary and secondary alcohols, including medium- and short-range order, variation in the strength of H-bonds and distribution of these types of interactions, the enthalpy of dissociation process, the glass transition temperature, and Kirkwood factor, irrespective of the presence of steric hindrance posed by the phenyl moiety. Results discussed in this paper clearly demonstrated that a superficial analysis of standard diffraction patterns, which are often the first step to probe the structure of materials, may lead to wrong conclusions. That is why complementary techniques must be applied together to understand the structure and behavior of assembling liquids."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056373532","journalIssue":{"objectId":"614ce93a2467f03ebf955ab4","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"208e3de0-740b-492d-813f-c72cb8d5e664"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"346","pagesFromTo":"117098-1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167732221018225","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602b9e439543c7410626deea","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"NOWOK","uuid":"2CA973CFED96082AE010F61FA01924869E89D800A22B30595C33478EEC4D59E13703E4DAD32F65A1C524D4A0631EB878BD4E00CE1A3E08DA13F79DAF7CCEDF3C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d225062-2e31-4dbb-9111-2bf0e3365c38"},{"objectId":"602b8c5d9543c7410626de4c","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Soszka","uuid":"9F05B754C73D6AA35A667AC65A8CD585119BA3DE6B163EE683D6B0D1252EF55BFD9BFD4293BE661FED9698E0A354EBC45B689562F0FB8661ADAA634E93D7DE03","orcidId":"0000-0001-7774-7450","documentHash":"e1d6c0aa-9626-4320-83d9-d9c8c6d8bcc6"},{"objectId":"602b75b99543c7410626dd79","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Grelska","uuid":"586E751973B732BCEF6F490FDA0C4D2F45C8A9E594473C67C806DB531B3DCF8ABA201F7DC7F29552C45944D7FAEA260B2CAE76A9F22084EFE40E05CBD705BE75","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b31e3dd4-5c3b-4888-9a32-46d23a621d2b"},{"objectId":"5e7093ce878c28a0473b1209","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Hachuła","uuid":"4481FD2313E05A5508746213EF38F39D6EB6DC05B2E3216D0CDF09058FE88DE944D31698F2A1370A198A1E9222E1D5E8D76911E13699C491D30358AAD1E4E092","orcidId":"0000-0001-9886-1076","documentHash":"1e2afa66-b420-4941-8fb4-92c059e909ec"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac987","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Jurkiewicz","uuid":"36ED6327612C551BEB4D47A83E72D045771D9DADA97456ED7C9F801C82619A8812A7801EE863CACE3A5D8A5C76FC3285C00E1EE2390F30D25892828EF2F7F54F","orcidId":"0000-0002-4289-7827","documentHash":"a03ba1b7-75e8-4f31-8df2-7f19da7ac57e"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0d62","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szeremeta","uuid":"AE0467A2457784FCF410F9827A5C09F8AD3EFC540FB3F8DE07602C04A6944B89A0C697ACD740EE1444A2D8D83699CFCD4255BE26CE7E1588E65854661E9F33E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6105-4075","documentHash":"66ddf69c-bc80-419f-9d8a-931706623cab"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f17e","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kamiński","uuid":"B21A63F393696E298A8E1D2B8DA2824BFE0701F775D6C0F5D3C536AA368CC2AD82D09B7849F3C8DE7150FFA4232C3126BC493FA150BB1615420272B3D1426D7F","orcidId":"0000-0002-5871-0203","documentHash":"51485256-28a1-4e0d-8fc9-f9ee01c26d18"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f157","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Pawlus","uuid":"92AC7357E054B99B6D310229F1C806C59CD914288AD5C6E189825BFA75C7C461F3FC97C7EAC2C58D3F1D791623DEEC9E9D5328368C097426F0623A99704B4BE0","orcidId":"0000-0001-9209-4056","documentHash":"b1ed1b04-b837-475b-a9a1-daf951df6d46"},{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739ee74","name":"Marian","lastName":"Paluch","uuid":"19580B9385E748744EA3F1E457A85562D93ED34D457921146A553492871FBD597B4E5AC7E6574678167B12D0ED974D65FE4CA1FF4464F1CA2EF22A9ABC60BC0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7280-8557","documentHash":"d6cf3f05-c9e8-49c2-8096-455a8dfc36de"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2021.117098"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coronavirus","pandemic","Covid-19","nanotechnology","management"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nanotechnology-based

It possesses unique hollow spines of various lengths on the tube underside, a position previously undocumented for these fossils. Like some cyclostome bryozoans possessing basal tubular extensions, the basal spines of Aculeiconchus n. gen. were presumably also used for fixation to flexible substrata, e.g., algal thalli, which is a previously undocumented adaptive strategy in microconchids. Together with other skeletal features, such basal spines could suggest that ‘lophophorate’ microconchids, unlike the other tentaculitoids, might be phylogenetically not as distant from bryozoans as previously thought. The Maywood Formation, which contains a few-millimeters thick, monospecific shell accumulation of the microconchids described herein, records deposition in an estuarine brackish setting within narrow channels that were cut into underlying strata. The microconchids were opportunistic taxa that repeatedly colonized these salinity-stressed estuarine channels, leading to a series of adaptive innovations, including colonization of plant stems during the Early Devonian (Beartooth Butte Formation) and possibly flexible, soft-algal substrata during the Middle Devonian (Maywood Formation, this study). Tectonic quiescence during the Early and Middle Devonian indicates that erosion and subsequent deposition of the Maywood and the underlying Beartooth Butte Formation channels were responses to major eustatic events. Over a span of nearly 30 Myr, channels were cut successively during lowstand conditions and a distinctive faunal assemblage with microconchids tracked marine transgressions into the channels."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056376818","journalIssue":{"objectId":"625e72b02467f03847f22298","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"96","doi":"","documentHash":"8bda927e-a139-4604-b62b-f3133e37f25d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"96","pagesFromTo":"112-126","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"615ee5762467f04f2b291de4","name":"Paul

While\r\na decrease in meltwater flow energy takes place, a proglacial bedform continuum is formed due to erosional and\r\ndepositional processes; these have been studied in relatively little detail as compared to the sediment transport modes and deposition processes of glacial lake-outburst floods. Therefore, we consider upper-flow-regime bedforms that originate from glacial lake-outburst floods under subaerial conditions in the ice-proximal portion of\r\nfloodwater spillways as the main interest of this study, and we particularly focus on a suite of features of\r\nscabland-like topography in NE Poland. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is used to detect the relevant landforms\r\nand to provide their morphometric parameters, and is further combined with sediment lithofacies analysis. These\r\nmethods allow us to recognise a train of transverse furrows that consists of seven main and two associated depressions\r\nthat altogether constitute a longitudinal cluster interpreted as cyclic steps.

By applying this, it is attempted to answer the key research question of whether quartz grains that come from a glacial-related sedimentary environment are indeed of glacial origin. The study also attempts to provide a linkage between microtextures produced on coarser and finer grains and to verify whether mineral grains from adjacent cryconite holes are similar or different. The preliminary assumption was that the more intense glacial grain record was based on several glacial activities from more and less recent glacial events in Iceland, and this assumption is true to some extent, because a set of sustained-shear-stress microtextures is found on coarser grains, especially in supraglacial and terminal moraine sediment samples. This latter reveals as much as 9% of glacial-type microtextures and this value seems much lower than in previous studies, which clearly argues for only limited grain glacial transformation. Glacial grains diminish with distance from a glacier, where fluvial grains dominate. Fine-grained cryoconite mineral grains reveal a proportion of glacially-induced microtextures that, nonetheless, may be a result of grain-crushing in the finer fraction. Long-distance-transported grains are practically absent in the finer fraction, likely because they are still too large to be entrained into the atmosphere. Finally, the adjacent neighbouring cryoconite holes reveal a different set of grain types, meaning that every cryoconite hole is independent and its grain type might be very random."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056380238","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"617","pagesFromTo":"101-111","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"660be5034097076263dc6ee9","name":"Jurijs","lastName":"Ješkins","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90bb3bb6-0f72-47b4-b051-d83326896b56"},{"objectId":"660be5034097076263dc6ee8","name":"Agnis","lastName":"Rečs","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf89a712-7f86-49d1-8807-5116681d97d3"},{"objectId":"660be5034097076263dc6ee7","name":"Māris","lastName":"Krievāns","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5875238c-cc69-4463-abb1-0383c7206bcd"},{"objectId":"660be5034097076263dc6ee6","name":"Jānis","lastName":"Karušs","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73e87a12-973f-44ef-ad99-ea7e86fd28a0"},{"objectId":"660be5034097076263dc6ee5","name":"Kristaps","lastName":"Lamsters","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd35e840-e9b3-4daa-9438-b97a5c0e00dc"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7e3d","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Kalińska","uuid":"CEDDB9DACBED6A6565EA05665DD4680286FE22F6174449DAD92A5E1FCF66E0AF1BA6FB72EED9B87CCFEA5B12F464254347114DA9C617EDCA56E1ED6B56A4F31B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0987-1091","documentHash":"745f5dae-ca3b-4828-8b6e-ab811cfa101f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.quaint.2021.03.029"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Kompleksowa procedura oceny dla argumentacji naturalnej (CAPNA)","Ocena argumentów","Argumentacja naturalna","Układ okresowy Argumenty (PTA)"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Comprehensive Assessment Procedure for Natural Argumentation (CAPNA)","argument evaluation","Natural argumentation","Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA)","reasoning","Rozumowanie"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evaluating Reasoning in Natural Arguments: A Procedural Approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771c9","mniswId":"1737","title":"Argumentation","doi":null,"issn":"0920-427X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"0e82f1cb-1099-46fa-8e32-c81916278f42"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"615f59d12467f04f2b303e29","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709407878c28a0473b50e3","6567156a40970749a843812e"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we formulate a procedure for assessing reasoning as it is expressed in natural arguments.

Methods: Participants were 182 undergraduates at a large university in the South of Poland, aged between 20–28 years old (M = 22.17, SD = 1.39), including 102 women (56%). The cross-sectional study used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Work Addiction Risk Test (WART). Results: This study shows that depression and workaholism levels are significantly lower in Physical Education students than other faculties' students. Gender moderates the relationship between workaholism and depression. Women demonstrate a stronger association between depression and workaholism than men. Conclusions: Both physical activity and gender appear to play an essential role in mental health prevention. The result of this study should be considered in therapy and prevention programs at university

report describes a general method to correlate the features determining the performance of an electrocatalyst (EC), including the accessibility of O2 to the active sites and the kinetic activation

The method has been implemented for oxygen reduction reaction ECs by cyclic voltammetry with the thin-film rotating ring-disk electrode (CV-TF-RRDE) setup. The method: (i) does not rely on the simplifications associated with the Butler-Volmer kinetic description of electrochemical processes and (ii) does not make assumptions on the specific features of the EC, allowing to compare accurately the kinetic performance of oxygen reduction reaction ECs with completely different chemistry. Finally, with respect to other widespread figures of merit (e.g., the half-wave potential E1/2), the figure of merit here proposed, E(jPt(5%)), allows for much more accurate comparisons of the kinetic performance of ECs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056386500","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"art.no.

report detailed functional analyses and genotype-phenotype correlations in 392 individuals carrying disease-causing variants in SCN8A, encoding the voltage-gated Na+ channel NaV1.6, with the aim of describing clinical phenotypes related to functional effects. Six different clinical subgroups could be identified: 1) Benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE) (n = 15, normal cognition, treatable seizures), 2) intermediate epilepsy (n = 33, mild ID, partially pharmaco-responsive), 3) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE, n = 177, severe ID, majority pharmaco-resistant), 4) generalized epilepsy (n = 20, mild to moderate ID, frequently with absence seizures), 5) unclassifiable epilepsy (n = 127), and 6) neurodevelopmental disorder without epilepsy (n = 20, mild to moderate ID). Groups 1-3 presented with focal or multifocal seizures (median age of onset: four months) and focal epileptiform discharges, whereas the onset of seizures in group 4 was later (median: 42 months) with generalized epileptiform discharges. We performed functional studies expressing missense variants in ND7/23 neuroblastoma cells and primary neuronal cultures using recombinant tetrodotoxin-insensitive human NaV1.6 channels and whole-cell patch-clamping. Two variants causing DEE showed a strong gain-of-function (GOF, hyperpolarising shift of steady-state activation, strongly increased neuronal firing rate), and one variant causing BFIE or intermediate epilepsy showed a mild GOF (defective fast inactivation, less increased firing). In contrast, all three variants causing generalized epilepsy induced a loss-of-function (LOF, reduced current amplitudes, depolarising shift of steady-state activation, reduced neuronal firing). Including previous studies, functional effects were known for 170 individuals. All 136 individuals carrying a functionally tested GOF variant had either focal (97, groups 1-3), or unclassifiable epilepsy (39), whereas 34 with a LOF variant had either generalized (14), no (11) or unclassifiable (6) epilepsy; only three had DEE. Computational modeling in the GOF group revealed a significant correlation between the severity of the electrophysiological and clinical phenotypes. GOF variant carriers responded significantly better to sodium channel blockers (SCBs) than to other anti-seizure medications, and the same applied for all individuals of groups 1-3. In conclusion, our data reveal clear genotype-phenotype correlations between age at seizure onset, type of epilepsy and gain- or loss-of-function effects of SCN8A variants. Generalized epilepsy with absence seizures is the main epilepsy phenotype of LOF variant carriers and the extent of the electrophysiological dysfunction of the GOF variants is a main determinant of the severity of the clinical phenotype in focal epilepsies.

Additionally, the volume of the liquid digestate used to prepare the culture medium constituted from 10 to 50% of the medium volume. The study demonstrated that the highest C. vulgaris and A. platensis biomass productions of 2490 mg TS/L and 2990 mg/L, respectively, were obtained by adding 50% of distilled digestate to a growth medium. Regarding centrifuged liquid digestate, only 10% dilution was required to obtain the maximum final biomass concentration. A. platensis removed 81.1% and 66.4% of the total nitrogen from medium prepared on distilled and centrifuged digestate, respectively, while C. vulgaris ensured 64.1% and 47.1% of removal, respectively. The phosphorus removal from both culture media was higher than 94.2% with A. platensis, while it was 70.4% from distilled and 87.4% from centrifuged media with C. vulgaris.

Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in bifurcations are still challenging and are associated with higher risks of periprocedural complications as well as restenosis and stent thrombosis. The aim of this paper was to summarize 12 months of clinical results of the prospective, first-inman registry assessing the BiOSS LIM C stent (Balton, Poland). \nMaterial and methods: In the  prospective two-center registry we enrolled patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) and stable coronary artery disease. Provisional T-stenting was the default treatment strategy. The primary endpoint was defined as the rate of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI) and clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) in 12-month follow-up.\nResults: The study population consisted of 95 patients (mean age 66.8 ±9.8 years, 17.9% were females). A BiOSS LIM C stent was implanted in the left main (LM) in 53 (55.8%) cases. There were 25.2% of patients with NSTE-ACS, 33.7% with diabetes, 90.5% with hypertension, and 53.7% had previous MI. The device success rate was 100%. An additional regular drug-eluting stent was deployed in the side branch in 18.9% of cases. Proximal optimization technique and final kissing balloon (FKB) technique were used in 53.7% and 30.5% of cases, respectively. MI type 4a was registered in four cases (4.2%). At 12 months the MACE rate was 9.5%, cardiac death 1.1%, MI 2.1% and clinically driven TLR 6.3%. All incidents, apart from one TLR, appeared in the LM subgroup.\nConclusions: Our registry might suggest that PCI using the BiOSS LIM C in coronary bifurcations is feasible and might be an option for percutaneous revascularization."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056389881","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e5d81240970766fb03705a","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"3a7d0438-cabd-4cfe-ba3d-c5f6cee742a1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Twelve-month-clinical-results-from-the-new-cobalt-chromium-sirolimus-eluting-dedicated-bifurcation-stent-BiOSS-LIM-C-Registry,19,39873,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616068002467f006f77e1c92","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3cd79feb-3346-4f74-b71d-dd1831e49ef3"},{"objectId":"5e7094ee878c28a0473c7243","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Bil","uuid":"3B546C2DB955C25476CDA25200F0C3D000E0CEA16EBDE4010073AF2848E86396C4AF820279B0A673885FB1AB5CCB3252119B93D6E10F081B7DA8A2EC6D1A71D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-8724-5611","documentHash":"12cfe162-2da7-48d1-8591-86d8c47f39ca"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a04739671e","name":"Robert","lastName":"Gil","uuid":"6290B5E2A3002089F420F25B49E33FDBDB8F16FAD5D601D9CA60B946DCC25000ED8D4EAE1F9FD93D6EDD227373BE6521E427537BBAA5C3671F3025359DBB7D76","orcidId":"0000-0002-9041-3313","documentHash":"7e0f5859-27d5-4a5c-a020-6e74e215cc36"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a04739012d","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kern","uuid":"3EC2B339358FD478E68AD689803AF81840258140C801690DA2480FE73EF9E3A40587CB9E70F6E789F3C0E88FA4B6409DD3E3C7D053E864F92CEBE7DDDED79DE2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3341-3701","documentHash":"16ef98a0-5a80-4367-9644-b636e5ef816b"}],"doi":"10.5114/aoms.2020.92974"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The

present an asymptotic analysis of adaptive methods for Lp approximation of functions f ∈ Cr([a, b]), where 1≤p≤+∞. The methods rely on piecewise polynomial interpolation of degree r − 1 with adaptive strategy of selecting m subintervals. The optimal speed of convergence is in this case of order m−r and it is already achieved by the uniform (nonadaptive) subdivision of the initial interval; however, the asymptotic constant crucially depends on the chosen strategy.

The treatment is mainly surgical and involves proximal tibial osteotomy and deformity correction. The aim of this study was to assess the change in the quality of life of patients with tibia vara deformity who underwent correction via the Ilizarov method. Material and methods: A total of 23 Blount’s disease patients who had undergone bilateral varus deformity correction with the Ilizarov method were included in this study. The following parameters were assessed retrospectively: duration of treatment with Ilizarov frames, baseline and postoperative values of the medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and mechanical axis deviation (MAD). The quality of life was assessed with a Short Form (SF)-36 survey. Results: The study population comprised 13 females and 10 males (mean age of 28.43), in whom the Ilizarov fixators were kept for an average duration of 106.65 days. MAD values diminished significantly after the surgery. We also observed significant increases in the MPTA values. The SF-36 scores increased across all of the questionnaire’s domains, which indicates a significant improvement in the postoperative quality of life. Conclusions:\r\nSimultaneous bilateral correction of the varus deformity with Ilizarov external fixators is a safe and effective treatment method. It helps reduce pain and improve gait, which translates to improving the quality of life in all its aspects. The duration of treatment depends to a large extent on the degree of patient cooperation, their attitude, and self-discipline.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747056392887","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.archivesofmedicalscience.com/Changes-in-the-quality-of-life-of-patients-with-Blount-s-disease-undergoing-simultaneous,135942,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66056441409707626338613a","name":"Paweł ","lastName":"Małdyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b44fded-bfcc-4ffb-95ca-46c38d892beb"},{"objectId":"660564414097076263386139","name":"Andżelika ","lastName":"Pajchert-Kozłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0d29ab0-f5b3-4a54-a940-eb875dfbc6c5"},{"objectId":"660564414097076263386138","name":"Ryszard ","lastName":"Górski ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8087408e-209b-4a1c-bc16-f0c6437f29c4"},{"objectId":"660564414097076263386137","name":"Karol","lastName":"Mochocki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b36df15d-225d-4035-80a9-5b316e9ab7ef"},{"objectId":"660564414097076263386136","name":"Radosław ","lastName":"Górski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c028d26f-98e8-4609-af5e-2bf29903daad"},{"objectId":"660564414097076263386135","name":"Sławomir ","lastName":"Żarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70456972-4609-42ed-9312-65498f44d64b"},{"objectId":"660564414097076263386134","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szelerski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b8f77905-5ee2-4b68-ae2c-85d47e123ba6"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d02","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Morasiewicz","uuid":"E65620B1D22E9F5C963BB6D98BE6B0843DDA0F548588152C3FA7380A377FB51053274A076A73D2DA8FDD220BC24C910F1708D08520F562445F9F7BA01C92EABD","orcidId":"0000-0002-7587-666X","documentHash":"d5d9fc26-50a7-4f3e-af70-bab3429d0399"}],"doi":"10.5114/aoms/135942"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aided phytostabilization","Immobilization","Nanoremediation","Soil risk minimization","Freeze-thaw cycle"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921c878c28a0473900c5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Co-application of nanosized halloysite and biochar as soil amendments in aided phytostabilization of metal(-oid)s-contaminated soil under different temperature conditions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f8","mniswId":"3525","title":"Chemosphere","doi":null,"issn":"0045-6535","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"58ab338e-e160-4952-ac84-e8a482aef1f5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616073e62467f006f77f60d8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["616073e62467f006f77f60d9","5e70921c878c28a0473900c5","616073e62467f006f77f60da","616073e62467f006f77f60db"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The threat posed by the degradation of the soil environment by metal (-oid)s has been lead to the improvement of existing or search for new remediation methods; in this case, the application of environmentally friendly nanomaterials falls into this trend. The study applied a technique of aided phytostabilization for the immobilization of metal (-oid)s in soil with the application of nanosized halloysite and biochar (nBH), along with Lolium perenne L. Its effectiveness was assessed in terms of changing temperature conditions (16 cycles of freeze and thaw cycles, (FTC)) on the content of As, Cu, Pb and Zn in the soil, roots, and above-ground parts of the tested plant, chemical fraction distributions of metal (-oid)s and their stability (based on reduced partition index, Ir). The biomass yield in nBH-amended soil was 2-fold higher compared to control soil, but it decreased by 1.6-fold after FTC. nBH facilitated more bioaccumulation of As, Pb and Zn than Cu in plant roots, before than after FTC. nBH increased pH in phytostabilized soil, but it was not affected by changing FTC. In soil nBH-phytostabilized total concentration of metal (-oid)s significantly decreased compared to control soil, for As and Cu below permissible value, regardless of FTC. Soil amendment and changing temperature conditions affected metal (-oid)s redistribution in soil. As a result, the stability of As increased from 0.50 to 0.66, Cu from 0.49 to 0.52, Pb from 0.36 to 0.48 and Zn from 0.39 to 0.47.

These novel data may be helpful in estimating new threshold residue levels significant in food safety especially intended for children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056396195","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61710c4b2467f03b4195f26b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"371","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"00c808ec-464a-4b86-b99a-1ed4b4a37af7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"371","pagesFromTo":"131179","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0308814621021853?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b78df","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Jankowska","uuid":"9934D3C4F456C1298977806070BF5EADFC4E52978D1AE75F386F66335753F8BDCD073F653EE7E405074E797C2BAE01304232E2049F0727307D85443AFB6345A4","orcidId":"0000-0001-9049-2624","documentHash":"b4b982ad-f728-4ce4-ae70-06e906d677ed"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afd0b","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Łozowicka","uuid":"227A3531CB28F0C83AA3EFD3DC102BD396778BD6593CAE8AED24CD9555D9E31B6BB14A7FFCE934C16DA059EC46D8CC72BCF52D209F499B352D1A076BEBE9F5B0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2760-3333","documentHash":"9b03ab2a-55cc-427e-8c0d-e2cc41f8e705"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.131179"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Angiogenesis","Genetic association studies","Ligament healing","Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","parentUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","rootUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

Little is known on the impact of weather conditions on the transmission of COVID-19.\n\nObjectives: We aimed to assess correlations between 6 different meteorologic parameters and the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in 16 administrative regions (voivodeships) of Poland.\n\nPatients and methods: Data for analysis were obtained from epidemiologic reports of the Polish Ministry of Health. For each voivodeship, one synoptic station was selected to provide meteorologic data on daily maximum and minimum temperatures, variability of daily temperature, sunshine duration, relative humidity, and wind speed. The periods with significant weather impact were determined using multiple linear regression. Cross-correlation function (CCF) and random forest models were used to assess correlations between meteorologic parameters and the incidence of COVID-19 as well as the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19.\n\nResults: In all voivodeships, the incidence of new COVID-19 cases correlated with relative humidity (CCF = 0.41), daily maximum temperature (CCF = –0.41), variability of daily temperature (CCF = –0.40), and sunshine duration (CCF = 0.35). For all parameters, a similar time lag of 10 to 14 days was noted. There were no significant correlations for wind speed in most voivodeships.

in forest extent in the corridors of four rivers of the Polish Carpathians over the last 130 years and their relation to changes in planform river geometry were investigated through the analysis of 1:25000-scale maps from the 1870s and aerial images from the mid-20th century and 2009. Average proportions of river and its geomorphic units as well as floodplain and its land cover features in the total width/area of the analysed river corridors were determined and compared between the three dates. All the analysed rivers narrowed significantly over the study period. This increased considerably the proportion of floodplains in the area of the river corridors, while lateral parts of the former, wide channels became a place of forest development. In the Koszarawa and Raba valleys, forest developed also on parts of the former floodplains following a decline in agricultural and pastoral use of lands with shallow, poor soils. The proportion of forest in the total area of the river corridors increased from 0–7.5% in the 1870s to 28.5–46.5% in 2009, and the forest expansion was mainly driven by the timing and scale of channelization works that reclaimed parts of the former channels from the rivers. A reduction in flow and sediment dynamics of Carpathian rivers over the 20th century enabled development of islands in their active zones. However, channelization works eliminated islands from most river reaches and thus islands persisted only in scarce unmanaged reaches. The expansion of floodplain forests in Carpathian valleys improves functioning of the river ecosystems but the resultant increased delivery of large wood to river channels may generate flood hazard. Optimal river management should avoid removal of riparian trees to maximize the environmental benefits but enable undisturbed transfer of driftwood through bridge cross-sections to minimize the flood hazard resulting from floodplain forest development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056399321","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"802","pagesFromTo":"149853","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969721049287?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b7502","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Hajdukiewicz","uuid":"0F8BB370C637A7DF301CC23268F6F0588D7D2F0E5C41E82CCBC50C9A10E23336F27D8EC48BC9A62FECC379443005319C27D571E8C9D2D19828E4119DCDA3E88D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3076-5840","documentHash":"4459ac9c-df55-4568-a2f2-a342df3e3f4d"},{"objectId":"5e7093ec878c28a0473b3660","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Wyżga","uuid":"A70D66BD9CEC441ADE049F6A04F4BA173ACF4C9C036A20900C03F11F78340A331AB7D21F4D7DA0F115B830428D965693DEA883E77726A66CC0D08B0A6BE781C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9923-2148","documentHash":"d8556ee4-a66e-4400-b19b-0597ace00302"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149853"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Metylacja DNA","Choroba Hippel-Lindaua"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DNA methylation","VHL","Hypoxia","HIF1A","Kidney cancer"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7827e8085dcb410a25e932","5e7092c0878c28a04739c011","5e709368878c28a0473a8f5a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An IDH-independent mechanism of DNA hypermethylation upon VHL inactivation in cancer","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b2a","mniswId":"5874","title":"Epigenetics","doi":null,"issn":"1559-2294","eissn":"1559-2308","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8277551d-2719-4ee5-8f67-f46900ae8b47"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2021-09-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6164090b2467f014219d7b96","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c0878c28a04739c011","5e70938b878c28a0473ac51e","66017bcc40970762631c9817","66017bcc40970762631c9818","66017bcc40970762631c9819","66017bcc40970762631c981a","66017bcc40970762631c981b","66017bcc40970762631c981c","5f7827e8085dcb410a25e932","5e709368878c28a0473a8f5a","66017bcc40970762631c981d"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hypermethylation of tumour suppressors and other aberrations of DNA methylation in tumours play a significant role in cancer progression. DNA methylation can be affected by various environmental conditions, including hypoxia. The response to hypoxia is mainly achieved through activation of the transcriptional program associated with HIF1A transcription factor. Inactivation of Von Hippel-Lindau Tumour Suppressor gene (VHL) by genetic or epigenetic events, which also induces aberrant activation of HIF1A, is the most common driver event for renal cancer. With whole-genome bisulphite sequencing and LC-MS, we demonstrated that VHL inactivation induced global genome hypermethylation in human kidney cancer cells under normoxic conditions. This effect was reverted by exogenous expression of wild-type VHL. We showed that global genome hypermethylation in VHL mutants can be explained by transcriptional changes in MDH and L2HGDH genes that cause the accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate – a metabolite that inhibits DNA demethylation by TET enzymes. Unlike the known cases of DNA hypermethylation in cancer, 2-hydroxyglutarate was accumulated in the cells with the wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056399380","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"894-905","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9423849/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66017bcc40970762631c981d","name":"Egor B.","lastName":"Prokhortchouk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f51f0e59-95a2-4c04-b562-2764dbb94a1f"},{"objectId":"66017bcc40970762631c981c","name":"Alexander M.","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0a66ab9-dc8a-4ea7-a6d2-c41e6593c9ec"},{"objectId":"66017bcc40970762631c981b","name":"Alexey","lastName":"Sokolov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47b33e51-b646-4b16-84d6-01227fc33a8d"},{"objectId":"66017bcc40970762631c981a","name":"Alexey","lastName":"Starshin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"819e1984-3e34-4ff9-89ef-aae995f4f82a"},{"objectId":"66017bcc40970762631c9819","name":"Daria","lastName":"Kaplun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0868a30e-fb77-4f66-af88-f666e378d324"},{"objectId":"66017bcc40970762631c9818","name":"Svetlana","lastName":"Zhenilo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6e7e19b-65de-4ee2-afab-1d8d772fdefb"},{"objectId":"66017bcc40970762631c9817","name":"Artem V.","lastName":"Artemov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d8f6ccf-712d-4e5b-a703-34b322c8c7ef"},{"objectId":"5f7827e8085dcb410a25e932","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Szpotan","uuid":"D3B06C8D6FAEC9548608324062325524A36B8435B984687F1D2F662B7A9648A9B2967772ADD1170BE52C828389DFDE7D549914077B2A71C1A7468703C1D4832B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5403-9144","documentHash":"f2ac4196-b282-4ef5-8283-402bad63df4c"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac51e","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Modrzejewska","uuid":"5942EF2BEFF49F81FC95512714D8B2C0610EE570553C864F50095B971FF380DB8906725259BD11053115AC5C9DA5BB518DE6F1DC2B23652953B305FCA5A54471","orcidId":"0000-0002-9464-8419","documentHash":"bfe37aee-9577-4243-97df-a425eeb7a8e1"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8f5a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Gawroński","uuid":"3D4B9279073133264ACDDCB5913E402F979B6D24DBD8111BA52604952D76131C83A6F7ABEF0F2330DAE7E47A71CC0FE6A25BC6B520C703F095D14A7B3999605D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2369-8996","documentHash":"30ab93c2-e014-4ce3-8075-c4432b829d0c"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c011","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Gackowski","uuid":"BC7D15FEE6A81B5506BBE088117F6C7A55F5F7F320F088D1C4594DF18140029921CCEB3301AAF1FEE2BA9C127FFDAFCE758B773298778C1928A3E6780E93A6A3","orcidId":"0000-0002-7259-1511","documentHash":"10482946-c20c-4adf-acbc-06aa333e122a"}],"doi":"10.1080/15592294.2021.1971372"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dairy  cows,  Fourier  transform  infrared  spectroscopy,  milk  fatty  acids  composition, ruminal acidosis, short-chain fatty acids"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a6327","5e709347878c28a0473a63f4","5e7092cd878c28a04739d0db"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The effect of ruminal fluid pH on milk fatty acids composition in cattle","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705d","mniswId":"1208","title":"Annals of Animal Science","doi":null,"issn":"2300-8733","eissn":"2300-8733","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9ad2d791-0b35-4f1d-b31b-bff2ea927f31"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6163f79e2467f014219aba78","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709346878c28a0473a6327","5e7092cd878c28a04739d0db","5e709347878c28a0473a63f4"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of ruminal fluid pH on the fatty acids (FA) \nprofile  of  bovine  milk.

Moreover, milk \nfrom low-rumen pH cows was characterized by the lowest level of short-chain FA (SCFA; \nP ≤ 0.05), and consequently, the highest medium-chain FA to SCFA ratio (P ≤ 0.01). The \nregression  analysis  showed  that  these  traits  explained  a  small  proportion  of  rumen  pH \nvariance, which makes  them unreliable indicators of subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) \nin dairy cows. However, despite the extensive variability in milk fat composition observed \nin this study, the effect of ruminal pH on SCFA in all the analyzed herds showed the same \ntrend. Future research aimed to identify SARA biomarkers should therefore be \nconducted using techniques that allow detection of more individual FA in milk, including \nSCFA."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056400079","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"625-631","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85115985209&partnerID=MN8TOARS","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a63f4","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"783E83AF047CECBD841E41E044290934CE7F25CC813AEC4FCD59597013D4BF6A66F45CDFD40B6AE63D820C2359C8CC934195E3C73DC5234A091639243076B167","orcidId":"0000-0001-8766-6478","documentHash":"3a997fa7-d562-425d-b547-14cd6ec2db27"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a6327","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Komisarek","uuid":"C119053F79F767582AB9ED8CAC16B0603557E57FFEBF4DF15186AE5F40A02859607AE8B925F6522AA078B3813E15D01C0C8BB9552117DA935F01AE43E56947F2","orcidId":"0000-0003-0934-3598","documentHash":"8a58826d-d674-4ed0-84f8-fc1e160ce03f"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d0db","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Stefańska","uuid":"384DCB2FF6185C3590EB105A646E41E2ADFFBDC68526E3FFD1BEA88AED8C0E0FCE29BB20F4B1C4180F210AC27DE077D526921DCA98D8BCF4B91DE22AB5760773","orcidId":"0000-0001-5421-3165","documentHash":"908dadd4-76b7-46c1-a1de-ae8d8a7ff2fb"}],"doi":"10.2478/aoas-2021-0063"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["3D surface models","grain damage","image recognition algorithms","seeds infection","surface mapping"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390efd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Image processing algorithms in the assessment of grain damage degree","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479caa","mniswId":"21232","title":"Bio-Algorithms and Med-Systems","doi":null,"issn":"1895-9091","eissn":"1896-530X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b31de767-0a87-45ed-87ee-785b7e3f659a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"617283c62467f04d13a78fa5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662a38ab40970762633a3345","662a38ab40970762633a3346","662a38ab40970762633a3347","662a38ab40970762633a3348","662a38ab40970762633a3349","5e70922b878c28a047390efd"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives\r\nThe paper presents preliminary results on the assessment of algorithms used in image processing of the grain damage degree.

Fetuses underwent routine genetic testing by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) supplemented with polyploidy testing, and those with either a normal result or an abnormal result not consistent with the observed phenotype underwent exome sequencing (ES). Interpretation of variants was discussed by a panel of specialists to identify pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants.\nResults: The study group comprised 55 fetuses. A chromosomal abnormality consistent with the observed phenotype was detected in 24 (43.6%) cases. After exclusions, 26 (47.3%) cases underwent further molecular testing by ES, of which 18 (69.2%) were classified as having abnormal ES results, thus increasing the diagnostic yield by a further 18 (32.7%) cases and giving an abnormal genetic test result in 42/55 (76.4%) fetuses overall. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic sequence variants in 14 different genes were detected across 18 fetuses. Seven genes are already listed in the International Skeletal Dysplasia Society Nosology and seven are not typically found to be causal for skeletal dysplasias and are not listed in the Nosology.\nConclusions: In fetuses with skeletal system anomalies, chromosomal abnormality was the most common genetic diagnosis. Exome sequencing increased the diagnostic yield over that of CMA and polyploidy testing. Fetuses with skeletal abnormalities should undergo extended genetic testing following routine testing, as many genetic anomalies responsible for skeletal defects may otherwise be missed. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.\nCONTRIBUTION: \nWhat are the novel findings of this work?\nWe identified genetic causes in 76% of fetuses with a skeletal anomaly diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Chromosomal abnormality was the most common genetic diagnosis and exome sequencing increased the diagnostic yield over that of chromosomal microarray and polyploidy testing. In a significant number of fetuses, we observed pathogenic variants in genes that are not typically found to be causal for skeletal anomalies.\n\nWhat are the clinical implications of this work?\nIt is important to consider exome sequencing in fetuses with a skeletal anomaly, as pathogenic genomic variants responsible for skeletal defects cannot be diagnosed with routine testing or even next-generation sequencing

RT-PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swabs confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in only 18 cases (n = 18/69; 26.1%).\n\nResults\nDermatoses described include chilblain-like lesions (n = 173; 88.3%), maculopapular rash (n = 16; 8.2%), erythema multiforme-like lesions (n = 12; 6.1%), varicella-like exanthema (n = 1; 0.5%), and urticaria (n = 1; 0.5%).\n\nConclusions\nThis publication aims to summarise existing data on dermatoses and to draw attention to how identification of dermatological symptoms in paediatric patients can provide a quick and reliable indicator of COVID-19."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056406121","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6353ab2a4097070bd14bfe32","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"39","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"c1563db8-f43c-4dbe-9854-70fa75c0ce6f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"491-508","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Dermatological-manifestations-of-the-Coronavirus-disease-r-n2019-in-children-a-systemic-review,7,41868,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616433c82467f006f7e3c52a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Szczerba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97a30324-3116-41fd-a8b0-26a19cbae2c4"},{"objectId":"616433be2467f006f7e3c271","name":"Klaudia E.","lastName":"Dopytalska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e3d6c97f-600f-402a-a603-a457f1560818"},{"objectId":"5ebed5b8752340254fc403c5","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ciechanowicz","uuid":"744B1086A90FAC36F211273191DCDC3419B3DBA2936C9116C07CDC78370D41503D30AB1C672EF5564C79A54B7CFD98ECF58573ADD2D745D6970F04D78016C176","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0a0b3ad-2dc4-4895-97f4-2c9442dd16ae"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6c65","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"628FADD5A587E062EED56A8424BC84B32AADB8BBE996FBD67EA1864ACDF226E8096CB5669F3C08D66F7FEB62CC353A2549849E45024FF60FB44F94CA327F481C","orcidId":"0000-0003-1287-8016","documentHash":"c941a4b0-0562-4e88-bac7-c0fcc79aeed6"},{"objectId":"5e7094ab878c28a0473c1553","name":"Irena","lastName":"Walecka - Herniczek","uuid":"A84A5C8FE6355BDCBCD3F9D94A97125F6FB7351E2570AA58DE6F2D691BA9A10DED17562E708CAE2FFFC468BD22F597FEB921C555AFB02411BD94F2552F119CE5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3502-3339","documentHash":"5d73e80a-452d-47a8-8c75-43ab2551053a"}],"doi":"10.5114/ada.2020.99294"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70926a878c28a0473954a4","5e7092b9878c28a04739b7cc","5e70926a878c28a047395493"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Multistability and synchronization: The co-existence of synchronous patterns in coupled pendula","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478de0","mniswId":"14093","title":"Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","doi":null,"issn":"0888-3270","eissn":"1096-1216","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3c20161a-1c98-415e-a89d-459912f663c1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6172ebc02467f04d13af84e1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b9878c28a04739b7cc","5e70926a878c28a047395493","5e70926a878c28a0473954a4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate the dynamics of the 3 DOF model of two self-excited pendula suspended on the oscillating beam. The research is focused on the analysis of possible multistability of the synchronous configurations. The regions of different behaviours (both unique, as well as the co-existing ones) are shown and the influence of the model's parameters on their occurrence is studied. We exhibit, that the pendula can synchronize in a classical phase-locked way (apart from the in-phase and the anti-phase patterns) and the phase shift between them strictly depends on the angle at which the beam oscillates. The basins of attraction of different solutions are discussed and the conditions leading to the desired states are indicated. The bifurcation analysis of the system shows possible scenarios of transitions between various attractors, which are supported by the energy diagrams determining the energy flows for the dynamical elements. We apply the probability methods to measure the basin stability of possible states and to estimate their occurrence, when the initial conditions are uncertain. Our results have been obtained for both identical, as well as non-identical pendula and we describe the phenomena that can be observed in various models of classical mechanics in general."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056406298","journalIssue":{"objectId":"640f25c7409707703509f08b","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"166","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"7c41a4e0-ba76-4cc0-bdba-b3092cd2e844"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"166","pagesFromTo":"Brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327021007937?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7cc","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Dudkowski","uuid":"32F518AA0527DDA5CBAAD77124C385DD8EAD1ADBB1CE84F3A63AF58E731B99526081DF7E66E7DF15E138196C0A789135C2807FCFB0B760579B918D2C38A8F7E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3171-2698","documentHash":"2a561209-7126-4139-ba0d-d312aeb82d08"},{"objectId":"5e70926a878c28a0473954a4","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kapitaniak","uuid":"9B60F8090803FDE545A9AB67675838BE2103D0B62F134643012D2E4A2914D83C69DDA928DE6FE366F9B756A3385A7FD4C6C87C7BEF17F9B8B9E5F4BE1809654E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9651-752X","documentHash":"0d96a52a-dbb4-44e0-8f5b-3c42335a53fa"},{"objectId":"5e70926a878c28a047395493","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Czołczyński","uuid":"174EF7219073B54A692DDDD34C2DFEA6DD3907785D9B7EC3B882C0E441797562BAA0B07E26C56AF4C35E27BB621B2C83D16DD438F33B390B007523C7AA8B4C8A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4058-4114","documentHash":"6f6eb208-eb94-4104-9a41-464ee69d8632"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ymssp.2021.108446"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Poland","Freebirth","Unassisted birth","Homebirth","Medicalization","Maternity services"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933b878c28a0473a561d","5e70933b878c28a0473a5657","5e7094b3878c28a0473c1e6a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"\"I knew there has to be a better way\": Women's pathways to freebirth in Poland.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479ad9","mniswId":"20327","title":"Women and Birth","doi":null,"issn":"1871-5192","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"eb6aad76-61d9-4af5-adf6-9673bb23ca49"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6164369f2467f006f7e4ab0d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70933b878c28a0473a561d","5e7094b3878c28a0473c1e6a","5e70933b878c28a0473a5657","616436b52467f006f7e4b201"]},"issue":"(4)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nEach year a small number of women decide to birth at home without midwifery and medical assistance despite the availability of maternity services in the country. This phenomenon is called freebirth and can be used as a lens to look into shortcomings of maternity care services.\n\nAim\nBy exploring women’s pathways to freebirth, this article aims to examine the larger context of maternity services in Poland and identify elements of care contributing to women’s decision to birth without midwifery and medical assistance.\n\nMethods\nA qualitative methodology was used employing elements of ethnographic fieldwork, including digital ethnography. Semi-structured interviews with twelve women who freebirth, analysis of online support groups, secondary sources of information and elements of participant observation were used.\n\nFindings\nWomen’s decisions to freebirth were born out of their previous negative experiences with maternity care. Persistent use of medical technology and lack of respect from maternity care providers played a major role in pushing women away from available Polish maternity services. While searching for a better environment for themselves and their babies for the subsequent births, women experienced a rigidity of both mainstream and homebirth services and patchy availability of the latter that contributed to their decisions to freebirth.\n\nConclusions\nFreebirth appears to be a consequence of inadequate maternity services both mainstream and homebirth rather than a preference.

Thus, detection of all relevant precancerous lesions remains very important. The present study investigates Linked Colour imaging (LCI), an image-enhancing technique, as compared with high-definition white light endoscopy (HD-WLE) for the detection of polyps in this patient group.\n\nDesign This prospective, randomised controlled trial was performed by 22 experienced endoscopists from eight centres in six countries. Consecutive Lynch syndrome patients ≥18 years undergoing surveillance colonoscopy were randomised (1:1) and stratified by centre for inspection with either LCI or HD-WLE. Primary outcome was the polyp detection rate (PDR).\n\nResults Between January 2018 and March 2020, 357 patients were randomised and 332 patients analysed (160 LCI, 172 HD-WLE; 6 excluded due to incomplete colonoscopies and 19 due to insufficient bowel cleanliness). No significant difference was observed in PDR with LCI (44.4%; 95% CI 36.5% to 52.4%) compared with HD-WLE (36.0%; 95% CI 28.9% to 43.7%) (p=0.12). Of the secondary outcome parameters, more adenomas were found on a patient (adenoma detection rate 36.3%; vs 25.6%; p=0.04) and a colonoscopy basis (mean adenomas per colonoscopy 0.65 vs 0.42; p=0.04). The median withdrawal time was not statistically different between LCI and HD-WLE (12 vs 11 min; p=0.16).\n\nConclusion LCI did not improve the PDR compared with HD-WLE in patients with Lynch syndrome undergoing surveillance. The relevance of findings more adenomas by LCI has to be examined further."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056409382","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6400a6734097072cdecff544","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"71","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"206935a6-ba6a-4d07-8277-719d3eda582b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"71","pagesFromTo":"533-560","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/early/2021/07/14/gutjnl-2020-323132.full.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616437192467f006f7e4c1f7","name":"E.","lastName":"Dekker","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b93b119-de75-4464-b658-77d532f5ab51"},{"objectId":"616437192467f006f7e4c1f6","name":"Jasper

We sought to investigate if echocardiographic parameters can detect and predict an acute cellular rejection (ACR) or antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) episode in HTx patients.\n\nMethods and results\nData of 403 consecutive HTx recipients between 2003 and 2020 from our centre were reviewed. Patients with severe ACR (n = 10) and AMR (n = 7) were identified. Each HTx patient presenting with rejection was matched to a control HTx patient. Echocardiographic variables from the moment of rejection and 3, 6, and 12 months before were analysed and compared among groups. At acute rejection episode, patients with rejection had lower values of global longitudinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) compared to controls. HTx patients with AMR showed a progressive decline of GLS and GCS in the months preceding acute rejection, while controls and ACR patients had stable strain values except for the moment of rejection. In our cohort, a GLS cut-off lower than 15.5% and a GCS cut-off lower than 15.2% could distinguish with a sensitivity and specificity of 100.0% AMR from controls 3 months before rejection. LVEF and other conventional echo parameters could not differentiate among groups.\n\nConclusion\nGLS and GCS show a progressive decrease months before AMR becomes clinically apparent. Our data suggest that global strain assessment by echocardiography allows an early detection of a developing AMR, which could improve the clinical management of HTx patients."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056414941","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e243db409707409b812fcb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"d1f7a1ad-9223-49bb-adc3-a7394d9a0fab"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1520–1529","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://academic.oup.com/ehjcimaging/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ehjci/jeab212/40832770/jeab212.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6177b6f32467f05aebd32ff3","name":"Jens-Uwe","lastName":"Voigt","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0575-1888","documentHash":"296132ff-7880-4260-af0f-d49d90a134dc"},{"objectId":"6177b6f32467f05aebd32ff2","name":"Johan","lastName":"Van Cleemput","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9246-6382","documentHash":"9af80bd0-73b7-4191-a818-54943f57b8ee"},{"objectId":"6177b6f32467f05aebd32ff1","name":"Walter","lastName":"Droogne","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"00f91476-2c20-48ac-868f-b194aaaf9c2c"},{"objectId":"6177b6f32467f05aebd32ff0","name":"Filipa","lastName":"Cordeiro","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"efe87bb5-2d3e-48fb-a8a5-f199eb96bbbe"},{"objectId":"60c041389543c72336543289","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Ciarka","uuid":"2EC476E23C64DB7A0B8C01A6CC5506BCE80FE3A91A2448606D8C85D785D0FC099B8E21B66CC869F8F1D0D6A85AA72CA5481D977B826DE09DD99A896A8AA8F4DC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c86ed727-4097-4a9a-a632-4dda843aae83"}],"doi":"10.1093/ehjci/jeab212"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apical rocking","cardiac resynchronization therapy","heart failure","mitral regurgitation","septal flash"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Relationship of Mechanical Dyssynchrony and LV Remodeling With Improvement of Mitral Regurgitation After CRT","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454783b6","mniswId":"9803","title":"JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging","doi":null,"issn":"1936-878X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"38d6e5f6-57a8-49f4-b490-37b83ca5691b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6177b6572467f05aebd31c66","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ee43ea37523404d1000e9a2","658c280c4097076c14535c9f","658c280c4097076c14535ca0","658c280c4097076c14535ca1","658c280c4097076c14535ca2","658c280c4097076c14535ca3","658c280c4097076c14535ca4","658c280c4097076c14535ca5","658c280c4097076c14535ca6","658c280c4097076c14535ca7","658c280c4097076c14535ca8"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives\r\nThe aim of this study was to explore the association between mechanical dyssynchrony of the left ventricle before cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and improvement of mitral regurgitation (MR) after CRT.\r\n\r\nBackground\r\nMR is very frequent among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and conduction delay.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nEchocardiograms (pre-CRT and 12 ± 3.8 months thereafter) of 314 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and any degree of MR, who underwent CRT device implantation according to guidelines, were analyzed. Left ventricular (LV) mechanical dyssynchrony was assessed by apical rocking (ApRock) and septal flash (SF), while MR severity was graded from I to IV on the basis of vena contracta width, regurgitation jet size, and proximal isovelocity surface area.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nAt baseline, 30% of patients presented with severe MR (grade III or IV). In 62% of patients, MR decreased after CRT, and these patients more frequently had left bundle branch block, had more severe MR, had more dilated left ventricles, had lower ejection fractions, and more often had ApRock and SF. Reverse remodeling was more frequent among patients with MR reduction (ΔLV end-systolic volume −35.5% ± 27.2% vs −4.1% ± 33.2%; P < 0.001). In a multivariable logistic stepwise regression, only ApRock (odds ratio [OR]: 3.8; 95% CI: 1.7-8.5; P = 0.001), SF (OR: 3.6; 95% CI: 1.6-7.9; P = 0.002), and baseline MR (OR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.0-1.9; P = 0.046) remained significantly associated with MR reduction.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nApRock, SF, and severity of MR at baseline are strongly associated with MR reduction after CRT, while LV reverse remodeling is its underlying mechanism. Therefore, in patients with heart failure with LV dyssynchrony on optimal medical treatment, CRT should be the primary treatment attempt for relevant MR."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056415035","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"212-220","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1936878X21006379?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535ca8","name":"Jens-Uwe","lastName":"Voigt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bcbbf476-a553-476b-bb9a-ae9bae2a14fa"},{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535ca7","name":"Marta","lastName":"Cvijic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c818452f-3ba7-4769-96c8-b04ecc4d6d4a"},{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535ca6","name":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Fehske","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a42e47f-54c4-4d21-8ef4-4474a58a9d10"},{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535ca5","name":"Svend","lastName":"Aakhus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89a548b8-2424-47c5-bf2f-23314e2d0c9b"},{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535ca4","name":"Lothar","lastName":"Faber","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf9571de-bcf5-4da5-bc85-bbfaeeddca3f"},{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535ca3","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Winter","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f40f122-f5d5-4b03-ab5c-fd7368f79c3e"},{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535ca2","name":"Marit","lastName":"Aarones","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30f4128d-5936-4dff-8888-9efcaff09840"},{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535ca1","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Ciarka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4b3b34e1-7cd0-4283-9640-735717a1f81b"},{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535ca0","name":"Efstathios","lastName":"Pagourelias","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fdb0bced-bcc2-45cb-a22c-52e0c29c5f72"},{"objectId":"658c280c4097076c14535c9f","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Stankovic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8bd3ab32-7a7b-46fd-aa19-6835e2aaaf60"},{"objectId":"5ee43ea37523404d1000e9a2","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Michalski","uuid":"54398C193A4DD472B7CBB02D13CB3CC93859894CFA233FEEB6E3382C093C1A10CB769A98ACD3712EBFDA957FA800B49DF0912E3607841BAD7961820B493704F6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26a4865c-ece1-43ac-9b16-e33b259118e1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jcmg.2021.08.010"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["grasslands","roots","belowground richness","metabarcoding","observer error","species detectability"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709316878c28a0473a2b76","5e709316878c28a0473a2b2d"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094af878c28a0473c1890"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Is it possible to understand a book missing a quarter of the letters? : unveiling the belowground species richness of grasslands.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f23","mniswId":"674","title":"Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0167-8809","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4960c788-239f-4628-b7b2-878b946458f7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6177bb0c2467f07e3b56bee1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64cd28254097077ac1dc2530","64cd28254097077ac1dc2531","5e709316878c28a0473a2b2d","5e709316878c28a0473a2b76","64cd28254097077ac1dc2536","5e7094af878c28a0473c1890","64cd28254097077ac1dc2535","64cd28254097077ac1dc2533","64cd28254097077ac1dc2534"]},"issue":"brak","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Knowledge of species richness patterns in plant communities is biased toward its hidden belowground part and is derived only from the part visible aboveground. Studies on the relationship of the above- to belowground parts of plant communities suffer from the lack of a consistent and uniform approach to assess their taxonomic composition, particularly in species-rich ecosystems. This study described the proportion between above- and belowground parts of vegetation in three grassland types along with the environmental factors that affect them, using eDNA metabarcoding and an observer survey. The internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region was used to analyze the total plant richness in the soil and the aboveground “green” part of plant communities. Considering all samples, eDNA metabarcoding successfully assigned about 93% of taxa on the species level. Our findings support the notion that metabarcoding analysis of the belowground plant community revealed up to 66% higher species richness than was identified above the ground by a conventional vegetation survey. However, this difference decreases to about 25% when an eDNA-derived taxonomic assignment was applied for the aboveground part of phytocoenosis. We also found that the difference between the below- and aboveground parts of the plant community decreased with increased soil fertility. Finally, the management intensity was found to significantly influence species richness only in the aboveground part of vegetation with the belowground part of grassland remaining unaffected. Overall, since DNA-based metabarcoding and traditional vegetation surveys have limitations, their complementary use is recommended to obtain the most reliable vegetation description. However, it should be considered that metabarcoding analysis is destructive and may not be applicable in protected or private areas or on permanent research plots."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056415385","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"324","pagesFromTo":"107683 (1-12)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016788092100387X?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd28254097077ac1dc2536","name":"Maja","lastName":"Boczkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b5c3d2c4-cd1b-407c-bed1-b8ab8adba91a"},{"objectId":"64cd28254097077ac1dc2535","name":"Jan G.","lastName":"Kosiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a3e68222-a063-4bf9-bb02-6f0cbd85cbeb"},{"objectId":"64cd28254097077ac1dc2534","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14b085cb-e9af-4200-a094-ec59966108a4"},{"objectId":"64cd28254097077ac1dc2533","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bf70a20-3950-48e8-bdee-7c41523e7750"},{"objectId":"64cd28254097077ac1dc2531","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Świerszcz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc4d6ce9-5c91-4b90-ade6-363dca8c0299"},{"objectId":"64cd28254097077ac1dc2530","name":"Anna","lastName":"Rucińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3478b204-e68a-41e1-bb3b-52e820bd9e2a"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1890","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Olszak","uuid":"D96413B6386091CABB1E6993D13C6F9F67FC67403E53AE350FFA2A7364FC583704A32729B64A3AD94B2789E2E89B9068479C60002B9DC24FAC9E3CD464263CC1","orcidId":"0000-0003-3375-4506","documentHash":"ea132d3f-8c95-43cf-9057-3a8b3e84c7d4"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a2b76","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Zubek","uuid":"43E3BF6A3FC01D845FF025F6A5FC2888C539B088BD0CC4FD42D623A6CEE7E4CDB0A12DF283657FAE80E2F6DAC47C9CD400E6AC64430AEF88B9B5D090411D25BE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95925508-1d1c-42cd-8bdd-45fcc34f79e5"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a2b2d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Nobis","uuid":"E7715603B1041AD9BDC0D989B8FD668CA2DA5EA201413A646EBEF7D8085F9E9E89FEEBB264642FA32E4A72B5569F4994081B169DA634909EC5773694EC9E71A8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57e2f2d4-95d4-4c57-94e7-e827e3aeb323"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.agee.2021.107683"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Indirect prey-taxis","Pattern formation","Taxis-driven instability","Hopf bifurcation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1a","uid":"bo-gzHUCaPNoq216Hhf4uRQ","uuid":"04d8f337-6a41-4c73-b0ee-a3f1a9293995","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Informatyki i Mechaniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a7914"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Indirect taxis drives spatio-temporal patterns in an extended Schoener’s intraguild predator–prey model","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477133","mniswId":"1485","title":"Applied Mathematics Letters","doi":null,"issn":"0893-9659","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d6a00940-ccb9-4673-9a1e-abadebd12f45"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6177caf12467f05aebd6f9bd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6177caf12467f05aebd6f9bf","5e709356878c28a0473a7914"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In Schoener’s model of intraguild-predation a prey-predator interaction is mixed with the competition of the prey and the predator for food resource supplied to a system with a constant rate. In this work the model is extended to examine the impact of indirect prey taxis which counts for the movement of predator towards the odor released by prey rather than directly towards gradient of prey density (prey taxis) and indirect predator taxis which refers to prey movement opposite to the gradient of a chemical released by predator. The constant coexistence steady state in the model was shown earlier to be globally stable when Schoener’s O.D.E. model is generalized to reaction–diffusion or even prey taxis system. Existence of global-in-time solutions to Schoener’s model with indirect prey taxis is proved for any space dimension while for the case of indirect predator taxis only in 1D. This study reveals that sufficiently large value of taxis sensitivity parameter disturbs the stability of the coexistence steady state giving rise to pattern formation governed by the Hopf bifurcation. Numerical simulations illustrate emergence of taxis driven spatio-temporal periodic patterns."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056418081","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fdcd3640970719735ce80d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"125","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"c2bc6521-48b6-409a-bef0-612ed137abb3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"125","pagesFromTo":"107745:1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0893965921004006?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6177caf12467f05aebd6f9bf","name":"Purnedu","lastName":"Mishra","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8585-255X","documentHash":"06ad7566-1218-41f9-bb01-6edb191d6c87"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a7914","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wrzosek","uuid":"F09182CC8AFD2BA035B6CFB75D889EF52040DC36E48D30C00DCAED8FED46D2FD930D2F5F08361B9E536A56FA188EBC9B4967A10CA88CDA4FD3F1948DF7DB06A9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2774-124X","documentHash":"05f1d99a-396a-4cb8-aba8-30a2aaa3ede7"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.aml.2021.107745"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["incomplete data","FDR control","penalized regression","spike and slab prior","stochastic approximation EM","health data"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fb878c28a04738e0e8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Adaptive Bayesian SLOPE: model selection with incomplete data","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454785ae","mniswId":"10607","title":"Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics","doi":null,"issn":"1061-8600","eissn":"1537-2715","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fc67126e-9360-4494-a31a-2553be8842da"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6177c4fa2467f05aebd61356","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091fb878c28a04738e0e8","63ea1bfa4097076b4a83dea9","63ea1bfa4097076b4a83deaa","63ea1bfa4097076b4a83deab","63ea1bfa4097076b4a83deac","63ea1bfa4097076b4a83dead","63ea1bfa4097076b4a83deae"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider the problem of variable selection in high-dimensional settings with missing observations among the covariates. To address this relatively understudied problem, we propose a new synergistic procedure—adaptive Bayesian SLOPE with missing values—which effectively combines SLOPE (sorted l1 regularization) with the Spike-and-Slab LASSO (SSL) and is accompanied by an efficient Stochastic Approximation of Expected Maximization (SAEM) algorithm to handle missing data. Similarly as in SSL, the regression coefficients are regarded as arising from a hierarchical model consisting of two groups: the spike for the inactive and the slab for the active. However, instead of assigning independent spike and slab Laplace priors for each covariate, here we deploy a joint SLOPE “spike and slab” prior which takes into account the ordering of coefficient magnitudes in order to control for false discoveries. We position our approach within a Bayesian framework which allows for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation while handling missing data. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate satisfactory performance in terms of power, false discovery rate (FDR) and estimation bias under a wide range of scenarios including complete data and existence of missingness. Finally, we analyze a real dataset consisting of patients from Paris hospitals who underwent severe trauma, where we show competitive performance in predicting platelet levels.

blooms constitute a recognized danger to aquatic environment and public health not only due to presence of main group of cyanotoxins, such as microcystins, cylindrospermopsin or anatoxin-a, but also other emerging bioactivities. An innovative approach identifying such bioactivities is the application of cellular biosensors based on reporter genes which detect the impact of cyanobacterial cells and components on actual human cells in a physiological-like setting. In the present study biosensor cell lines detecting four different types of bioactivities (ARE – oxidative stress, NFKBRE – immunomodulatory pathogen-associated molecular patterns, AHRE – persistent organic pollutants, GRE – endocrine disruptors) were exposed to concentrated cyanobacterial cells from 21 environmental bloom samples and from eight cultures (Microcystis aeruginosa, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Planktothrix agardhii and Raphidiopsis raciborskii). The AHRE and GRE biosensors did not detect any relevant bioactivity. In turn, ARE biosensors were significantly activated by bloom samples from Jeziorsko (180–250%) and Sulejów (250–400%) reservoirs with the highest cyanobacterial biomass, while activation by cultures was weak/undetectable. The same biosensors were stimulated by microcystin-LR (250%) and anatoxin-a (150%). The NFKBRE biosensors were activated to varying extent (140–650%) by most bloom and culture samples, pointing to potential immunomodulatory toxic effects on humans. Lipopolysaccharide and lipoproteins were identified as responsible for NFKBRE activation (probably via pattern recognition receptors), while peptidoglycan had no bioactivity in this assay. Thus, the holistic approach to sample analysis with the application of cellular biosensors geared towards 4 separate pathways/bioactivities was validated for identification of novel bioactivities in organisms with recognized public health significance (e.g. this study is the first to describe cyanobacterial lipoproteins as potential environmental immunomodulators). Moreover, the ability of cellular biosensors to be activated by intact cyanobacterial cells from blooms provides proof of concept of their direct application for environmental monitoring, especially comparison of potential threats without need for chemical analysis and identification of toxicants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056421884","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"807","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969721057235","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656db3c240970749a862f367","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Rudnicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02a5e43e-c904-42fd-abb1-9c8cb625d906"},{"objectId":"656db3c240970749a862f366","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Remlein","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd6f07b4-a6e3-49fb-8c40-acc0aafd9c2a"},{"objectId":"656db3c240970749a862f365","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Kokociński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2af3cc4-6e5d-4272-901a-f8ec748c33cc"},{"objectId":"656db3c240970749a862f364","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Ratajewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"869cd672-6759-400e-893a-2a06eb1946fb"},{"objectId":"656db3c240970749a862f363","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Jaros","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c25abc9-7703-4253-b79d-ef3557605ff1"},{"objectId":"656db3c240970749a862f362","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Karwaciak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34a7f863-65ef-4144-a920-238c6ab1024f"},{"objectId":"656db3c240970749a862f361","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Gągała-Borowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf47edc4-b990-4fb0-a3fa-3e8c5fadac4a"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473adc6c","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Mankiewicz-Boczek","uuid":"6F702B26C008369D6DEE9CE9C9B524217E4FC667632DCC6894DF6287640D70C4F76B27CE0E9A7E8C16E2657F3326E7C4D6EFCC6997102868F61FF7E8DBCC1282","orcidId":"0000-0001-7358-0673","documentHash":"935c2859-9b34-40b0-8fcd-ac6ff7e53ab1"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa980","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Jurczak","uuid":"9B031036E1D38C9A0629EB482393FF10753D084BD548162AD705EFFF9CFA5346178B9E6859ADC22FE331AB467E8F217F2AA3B53E099B5A895513BF1E4DB7D4BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1576-6741","documentHash":"851833ef-e445-4c4f-bce6-39993bbb63a4"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1c52","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pułaski","uuid":"DC4633B01E4F29C9EDA5398DAA8176055D4DB04E46CDCC6A07D019A88001E193B766A0A5AEC562075FCD60EFF4C2BE35FD4A3E695D05263C4433E3BECAF93FAA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8063-801X","documentHash":"c3c2928c-6b39-4a1e-9c9c-e79204ace119"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150645"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["small mammals","herpetofauna","malacofauna","palaeontology","cave sequences"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Small vertebrate and mollusc community response to the latest Pleistocene-Holocene environment and climate changes in the Kraków-Częstochowa Upland (Poland, Central Europe)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547949e","mniswId":"16945","title":"Quaternary International","doi":null,"issn":"1040-6182","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8dcabf08-e6d8-46bc-8c86-fc0d71bcb0af"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616732842467f037d5cd2978","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b13ff","65e5c8404097076263d15539","65e5c8404097076263d1553a","65e5c8404097076263d1553b","65e5c8404097076263d1553c","65e5c8404097076263d1553d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Holocene has always been considered a crucial epoch where the major cultural steps of humankind took\r\nplace. Understanding past Holocene climatic variability, shifts in vegetation, and faunal communities are among\r\ncrucial challenges in predicting the upcoming changes of the natural environment. In Central Europe, the Krakóww-Częstochowa Upland is one of the best study areas for detecting faunal, environmental, and climate shifts. For that reason, we choose to study the small vertebrate and mollusc communities of three archaeological sites with Holocene horizons: Sąspowska Zachodnia Cave, Ciasna Cave, and Małe Rockshelter. We analysed the faunal community shifts, and we compared our results with the major Holocene sites in the area with the correspondence and cluster analyses. The environment and climate were reconstructed through Habitat Weighting, Quantified Ecology, malacological spectra and Bioclimatic methods. Environment and climate values showed a temporary replacement of the Late Glacial tundra and grasslands with boreal forest mixed with open wetlands during the Preboreal and then stable landscapes dominated by temperate forests. Models based on rodent data show that temperature and precipitation generally increased,\r\nstarting from the Boreal, to reach values near, or sometimes overwhelm, the current climate values of the area during the Atlantic and Subboreal. The climate values obtained from herpetofaunal analyses show very slight changes between the Preboreal and the Atlantic (Ciasna Cave layers 3 and 4), except for the winter temperatures, whereas results obtained for Sąspowska Zachodnia Cave are probably biased by a very low number of recovered remains. Among rodents, a major negative oscillation detected in layers related to the edge of Early Holocene was related to the Preboreal Oscillation or long-lasting effect of the Younger Dryas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056421887","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"633","pagesFromTo":"6-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104061822100481X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e5c8404097076263d1553d","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kot","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f0c0b1f2-3b67-4fa7-aa8f-506e4e64c620"},{"objectId":"65e5c8404097076263d1553c","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Pereswiet-Soltan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce3878f3-1bf4-48d9-9eee-094f5eb0f6a9"},{"objectId":"65e5c8404097076263d1553b","name":"Hugues-Alexandre","lastName":"Blain","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"174aebd2-3c95-4338-ac74-c46e852a8f65"},{"objectId":"65e5c8404097076263d1553a","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Szymanek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90df4944-f6d7-4bb5-be08-e320dae90d83"},{"objectId":"65e5c8404097076263d15539","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Berto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f6f6f82-f55d-4619-907b-8409b08e3e15"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b13ff","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Krajcarz","uuid":"6A91EB68AF3684CD00B68B2D2C7C9B9DFC9FE9DDEB359A42B18D029F02ADD8948AD732A6AC93DB32BBDF1B201328C4A04271C0EEB2EE61E96F305B6D8E8FCCAB","orcidId":"0000-0003-3720-5926","documentHash":"51d043e8-1870-4b66-80c7-025ed43bb335"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.quaint.2021.09.010"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

We investigate the response of the heliosphere to fluctuations in the local interstellar medium (LISM) as compared to the\ninfluence of solar-cycle fluctuations.\nAims. We discuss the di\u000Berences between e\u000Bects coming from the two types of drivers of time-dependent e\u000Bects in the heliosphere in\nthe context of the shape of the heliosphere, the thickness of the inner heliosheath, and the position of the ribbon of enhanced energetic\nneutral particle emission, as observed by the IBEX mission.\nMethods. Our study is based on a comparison of fully time-dependent simulations obtained with a three-dimensional (3D) model of\nthe heliosphere.\nResults.We show that density fluctuations, taking the form of entropy waves and originating from the LISM, may reduce the thickness\nof the inner heliosheath to a similar extent as the solar-cycle e\u000Bects. However, the relative motions of the termination shock and the\nheliopause in the two types of simulations are di\u000Berent. The amplitude of variation of the heliopause position is greater for the LISM\nfluctuation. The IBEX ribbon position is shown to be not significantly a\u000Bected by the two types of drivers, although the e\u000Bect of LISM\nfluctuation is stronger than that of the solar cycle. In this context, slight systematic changes of the position of the IBEX ribbon in its\ndi\u000Berent sectors (i.e., changes in the heliospheric nose followed by variations in the heliospheric flanks) may serve as an indicator\nof the passage of a density fluctuation in the LISM, as suggested by our study.

The positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) spectroscopy has been employed to study changes in atomic-deficient structure in these composites under aging. Under light-curing polymerization initiating crosslinking of monomer chains, fragmentation of free-volume holes in resin matrix dominates over enhanced fraction of trapped positrons, since filler–particles assemblies get to be more tightly covered by surrounding polymer causing disappearing of interfacial voids at the filler–polymer surface. Therefore, the PAL spectra-transforming trend in light-cured composites obeys inverse positron-to-Ps trapping conversion. In contrast, the PAL spectra-transforming trend in these restoratives under aging obeys direct Ps-to-positron trapping conversion. After dry-air aging, the observed changes in the density of annihilation sites are ascribed to a strong agglomeration of Ps-decay holes in polymer sub-system accompanied by weaker agglomeration and appearance of positron traps in filler–polymer sub-system. Under the water aging, the agglomeration of Ps-decaying holes in the polymer sub-system is suppressed due to absorbed water molecules, this effect being slightly revealed at lower polymerization. New positron traps are observed at the filler–polymer interfaces in all light-cured composites. The agglomerated Ps-decay holes in a polymer matrix and positron traps inside filler–particles assemblies and filler–polymer interfaces of artificially aged composites cause their progressive microcracking."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056425693","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629db12a4097073d58665a32","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"65db870e-1393-408d-bf9c-4542b5bab648"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"449-457","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13204-021-01681-2","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616942b12467f04c0321c26e","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Slobodzyan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b4aeec6-d177-4c3e-80ff-bbb5af9b11ca"},{"objectId":"616942b12467f04c0321c26d","name":"Olha","lastName":"Shpotyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2593e128-3e3b-497f-bd32-d80914f6ad35"},{"objectId":"5e7094a6878c28a0473c101b","name":"Yaroslav","lastName":"Shpotyuk","uuid":"C809DB828E39DA78B5D9AE8447917F6BFEE763AB848C1D3E46AD6BCA205AB861282EC512593C5DD902B472207801768394416CD69847621A6217A57A638EAF65","orcidId":"0000-0001-6710-7839","documentHash":"60022424-7589-4b1d-8dd4-b8a785931c66"},{"objectId":"5e709240878c28a047392670","name":"Oleh","lastName":"Shpotyuk","uuid":"D576C10D3453A9034C9CD8B6176F56554B13E9B1E77B0A87AE2039BFDB17CAB94534FF2E933B99AB4C97C0A5716D6D7E32038DCB48747BBF50FC42A8E58608C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2455-1857","documentHash":"1e94b82c-d089-46c8-9cd5-55a093d7f4d5"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a047392549","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Filipecki","uuid":"03F6486BF95FD8C9C5A2B838901A43EF95B29D977B00B979625C019A748994E939DB3CA60984BC419F79D39437F0632DF75BDE8CDB40B3159751EAA274D8E565","orcidId":"0000-0001-6832-654X","documentHash":"c5cc5d35-8a78-4a64-9495-314b294212d0"},{"objectId":"5e709222878c28a047390692","name":"ADAM","lastName":"INGRAM","uuid":"731A8B5EC214A7469A9E8CB15402C1F42DDFE50F1D932CFE34C04C0E54127C4FBD473D8CDE6894AEF80EAEB00D21DF72339983F72BBAE50DFD9071F9663A55FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8424-2298","documentHash":"ffdbde9a-6ec8-4f10-b85d-8d9db9e5de7a"}],"doi":"10.1007/s13204-021-01681-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"615ac5692467f07ea9652f16","doi":"10.4324/9781003165965","title":"Trust, Organizations and the Digital Economy.

Building social media relationships with Generation Z members (Gen Zers) is a huge challenge for today’s enterprises, not only because they are the least studied generation, but also because they represent different values than those of the previous generations, and in order to earn their trust, enterprises have to meet certain conditions. The aim of this chapter was to identify enterprises’ social media activities that earn the most trust in the brand among Gen Zers, inducing them to make purchasing decisions. Studies were conducted twice among students of the Management Faculty of the Czestochowa University of Technology (in 2018 and 2020). The method used in the study was a survey, as part of which the CATI surveying technique was used. For analysis of the study material, descriptive statistics measures were used. Analysis of the collected empirical data provided the basis for verifying the research hypotheses and for concluding that enterprises’ social media activities impact purchasing decisions of Gen Zers. Also, enterprises’ social media activities that earn the most trust in the brand among Gen Zers and positively impact their purchasing decisions were indicated. The strength of the relationship between the analyzed variables and the respondent’s gender was verified."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056428779","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003165965-20/building-brand-trust-managing-relations-company-representatives-generation-anna-korombel-olga-%C5%82awi%C5%84ska?context=ubx&refId=9fd70dfc-1095-4b8c-a12b-51a3496c71a7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e8ab","name":"Olga","lastName":"Ławińska","uuid":"03B48854136C9CFD768977CF51FEAB846E44F558D953B143B0E1EF04EC31B5361F651B746417FE6004993A03FE574796E66E8B74D5D1ED01D2E19D446663F436","orcidId":"0000-0003-1960-8211","documentHash":"989db4b9-f187-46ec-bba3-f48abdf08e45"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e88e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Korombel","uuid":"D660A4808308229AC2EE9DBDE2E068541A6A18E2C0E7B8CB9C968DBA8E2895F0C9987CBDA26D7BDC3185D39A821AA241000EBD37A2A47A80A18AC9F131F0CFD5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0546-9708","documentHash":"b657d7ec-8335-4b15-87ac-1cc09ce5bbce"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet

personality has been tested as a predictor of sexual behaviours, little is known about the contribution of personality to the number of sexual partners. This study aimed to examine the models of association between the number of lifetime sexual partners and personality traits in lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual people. A web-based questionnaire was administered to the 768 Polish adults aged between 16 and 42 years old, including 61% women. Of the participants, 61% identified themselves as heterosexual, 22% as bisexual and 17% as homosexual. A series of multiple regression analyses were conducted to find the best predictors for the association between Big-Five personality traits and number of lifetime sexual partners. Age, gender, and sexual identification were also included in the analysis. Higher level of extraversion and lower level of agreeableness were the best predictors of a higher number of sexual partners. Sexual identification was a moderator of the relation between emotional stability and the number of sexual partners, whereas age and gender were separate moderators of the association between extraversion and number of sexual partners. Scientists and cclinicians may use these predictors to prepare prevention and therapy for people at risk of sexual addiction or STIs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056440291","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"147-164","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2020.1752786","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661d35d240970762634848cf","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Tofel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e1f913d0-800e-4464-bac5-9de981ea18b2"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a0473966e2","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Rogowska","uuid":"FBDE895006E489DA0C9C545FDB439A38D12B71CBB49EA354F51C72D713E9D4F059194257ED872FD1644AC859570BC87B10146172FCB1A22D5B0E3AB39CB917F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4621-8916","documentHash":"56752fe8-e59d-45d0-8c32-127a934e0084"},{"objectId":"5e70925b878c28a0473944eb","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Zmaczyńska-Witek","uuid":"08E8BCA796C4DCDFEA0C6EF67ED9B6D5368879A3FE06CC25BFD7FD370AA3995D2BE97042B4271836050DFC8308A136BE55EC444BAE1CE9F7F74145B95B436D4A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5472-2576","documentHash":"8980d17f-5165-4e07-ba76-06916e22b701"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a04739448b","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Kardasz","uuid":"2DAC013F2C92DC69FF91FAA1B4149F950DBF45B0EA61F45FEBD59D9C6CFBBF7EB7488CF4BAF2CB0CB44BB4B7650050B567814C9680126E135839B542375036A2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4339-4065","documentHash":"030d2983-342d-4ac7-b495-fb93d65025f4"}],"doi":"10.1080/19419899.2020.1752786"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa96c","5e709378878c28a0473aa8be","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6e0"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeed"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis and cytotoxic activity of 1,2,3-triazoles derived from 2,3-seco-dihydrobetulin via a click chemistry approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788b4","mniswId":"11918","title":"Journal of Molecular Structure","doi":null,"issn":"0022-2860","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6a90b3fb-ffdb-4989-8b77-5343a0ab6e9e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-10-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6179ad662467f06ca13138fd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6e0","6179ad662467f06ca1313901","6179ad662467f06ca1313902","6179ad662467f06ca1313903","5e70937a878c28a0473aa96c","5e709378878c28a0473aa8be","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeed"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In search of new cytotoxic derivatives based on the lupane scaffold, the seco-lupane azides were coupled with a number of alkynes under the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) conditions to afford 1,2,3-triazoles. Phenylalkynes having different substituents at the para position were used as starting materials. Similarly, coupling of the seco-lupane thiocyanate with sodium azide gave 5-thiotetrazole. The cytotoxicity of thirteen derivatives were investigated, as well as the effect of substituents in the phenyl ring on the activity of 1,2,3-triazoles. Limited activity was observed for some of these products. Most of the studied compounds were inactive in cancer cell lines and healthy fibroblasts. Triazole 46 exhibited cytotoxic activity against CEM and MCF-7 cancer cell lines, however, it was also toxic to normal human BJ fibroblasts. Two other derivatives – triazole 45 and tetrazole 49 – exhibited low cytotoxicity. Compound 49 showed good selectivity towards tumor cell lines compared to normal fibroblasts. This compound did not affect the growth of normal human fibroblasts and therefore has a wide therapeutic window."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056440611","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1250","pagesFromTo":"131751","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022286021018767?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6179ad662467f06ca1313903","name":"Miroslav","lastName":"Strnad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de76d702-8244-4e86-9770-16d850544217"},{"objectId":"6179ad662467f06ca1313902","name":"Marie","lastName":"Kvasnicová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db84765e-b712-4563-b13b-e31a05759c90"},{"objectId":"6179ad662467f06ca1313901","name":"Lucie","lastName":"Rárová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f5f56f9-0213-4d90-b016-742c83eafe94"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeed","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Fiałkowski","uuid":"1C26E79E9EB8F34650F31105B6CF183CD092FEC5FF6880B2BE0052C47B15B5DCFC9882182D7FA3313C72FCBC5B1AE2D3E1915CED064C74CD21663F9D21F32AAB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1529-2539","documentHash":"8aa183e2-f661-4718-bf0e-a59b7091f68f"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6e0","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Kuczyńska","uuid":"57B2DA7C4A8ACD24F816896835715F0B33175D0765610921E32DA4722E85F2A8F343344E6D5E8B49FE88B251DB192146398AFEF1A65F9BD4DA032ABC0E3FDE7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7526-177X","documentHash":"17527a56-9609-49ae-95f7-5595374e5d30"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Bończak","uuid":"C9CF64DD69F437F68ADC88042449758EDAB0FBFED5919D083B81D041CD3175B9BC73BF8CE3BD3EED7552EAC50D2AF5BA1D0980E854B77D4C1C7A5C1D2261D966","orcidId":"0000-0002-6581-7420","documentHash":"21268306-0066-4e34-8b95-4b97a81ec913"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa96c","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"PAKULSKI","uuid":"B0BDEE4BBC9340D66F18B1741A28D2AD59759CFDBCB7340DBE7DC89E52260F8DE2F13E6F08A1938A62FC28388D5EA356D3260F34F3A07092B33A7D302C839E07","orcidId":"0000-0002-8085-0050","documentHash":"89fe3701-7039-4acd-8895-09d848d15ff4"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa8be","name":"Piotr","lastName":"CMOCH","uuid":"A10DC8E8AB70828BFAAF1E4F2CB344E7C14E1702E0E81DC1B010857EDB0A0137894653BA2D9F0057905342E51679BB71701C09B882839C6324286D8CB11375CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8413-9290","documentHash":"788fafb8-5ff3-4d3f-9b73-21a9bee8484c"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molstruc.2021.131751"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6123a1e62467f00614a47ed4","doi":"10.4324/9781003017349","title":"The Politics of Memory in Poland and Ukraine.

L’article présenté traite de la poterie peinte identifiée au groupe régional de Haute-Silésie-Petite Pologne de la Civilisation Lusacienne a partir de contextes funéraires (cimetiere d’incinération et cimetieres bi-rituels) et des établissements. Un regard plus attentif est porté sur les découvertes inédites de récipients polychromes provenant du cimetiere, sur le site Dobrzeń Mały, excavés au cours des années 1970.

Der Beitrag befasst sich mit bemalter Keramik der oberschlesisch-kleinpolnischen Regionalgruppe der Lausitzer Kultur, die aus Siedlungs- und Bestattungskontexten geborgen wurde (Feuerbestattung und birituelle Gräberfelder). Ein Detailblick wird auf die bisher unveröffentlichten Funde polychromer Gefäße vom Gräberfeld in Dobrzeń Mały geworfen, das in den 1970er Jahren untersucht wurde.

This paper builds on and develops these generic concepts to make them specifically relevant to today’s corporate globalization. The central place process is represented by multi-nodal global city-regions, and the central flow process is represented by inter-city capital investment flows.

The most numerous were domestic fowl (chicken) and geese, and their anatomical composition, age, sex and biometrics are described. A small percentage consists of wild species. The significance of birds for the castle elites in all periods was assessed through a comparison of archaeo-ornithological and historical data. The bird remains (and eggshells) from these castles largely represent the waste from food preparation, but some can be connected with hawking, the use of feathers and down, as well as for particular species kept for ornamental purposes.

aim of the present study was to estimate the range of climate variability in Central Poland during the Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5e). High resolution pollen records are available for all seven RPAZs typical of this interglacial in Central Europe. These pollen records were used to estimate total annual precipitation and mean annual temperature, as well as the mean temperatures of the warmest and the coldest months based on the plant indicator method and the modern analogue technique. The reconstructions indicate that the combination of these two methods provides a much clearer insight into the climate changes of the Eemian optimum. The results confirmed no drastic drop in temperature in the Middle Eemian, with high total precipitation in the hazel phase, and that this was followed by a decrease in temperature in the Late Eemian (fir-spruce and pine phases). A drop in precipitation occurred during the youngest part of the Carpinus phase, while coincided with a marked lowering of the water level in lakes and their transformation into peatbogs. The last part of the Eemian is characterized by decreasing temperature, particularly during the coldest month, rising water levels due to a combination of lower evaporation and higher air humidity, and a transition to glacial conditions. Principal Component Analysis found all investigated sites to follow the same pattern of changes. Mean winter temperature, annual temperature and precipitation were found to have a strong positive correlation with the occurrence of thermophilus temperate broadleaved trees (hazel, linden, and ash) typical for the mid-Eemian optimum. These three factors also have a negative correlation with the presence of cold tolerant boreal trees (birch and pine) and open land taxa characteristic of the beginning and end of the interglacial. Mean July temperature was found to be positively correlated with the occurrence of temperate broadleaved trees (oak, ash and elm) typical for early stages of the Eemian and negatively with that of coniferous trees (fir and spruce) characteristic for later stages of the interglacial."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056460689","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"632","pagesFromTo":"21-35","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618221004857","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ba20f94097073e10b15e6c","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3fff4a31-44e9-4976-90ef-ea9e974c0fd1"},{"objectId":"65ba20f94097073e10b15e6b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Hrynowiecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"655fd770-19a2-4370-a95f-d2b4ce2ca7fc"},{"objectId":"65ba20f94097073e10b15e6a","name":"Anneli","lastName":"Poska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3861ad6-b25b-42ca-af4b-0230a31296a1"},{"objectId":"65ba20f94097073e10b15e69","name":"Irena Agnieszka","lastName":"Pidek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd3a6749-c12a-4f80-93e8-41f23f9dc0eb"},{"objectId":"63b3a13975234021979c8b70","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Brzozowicz","uuid":"88FC5F38A31BABF30ED9AFB819E9EB33382FCBEA30E6AFB0A20E6A7C9A8042E0FE62BD2EC3D605E19C2F0A2C8152F0EF43E1301F708E6C6662449E06555F2AC3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8074217a-e169-48e8-8876-e49a080764fe"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.quaint.2021.09.014"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bilberry","Antioxidants","Accumulation","Forest pollution","Toxic elements"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e222","uid":"bqUMsPRTnkdr3xb8gKTDKbg","uuid":"61f7b6ee-2f6b-4841-b62c-d6ff496bd8bf","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Instytut Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f14e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evaluating the Accumulation of Antioxidant and Macro- and Trace Elements in Vaccinium Myrtillus L.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547734f","mniswId":"2449","title":"BIOLOGICAL TRACE ELEMENT RESEARCH","doi":null,"issn":"0163-4984","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"6a7d2351-d3c6-41fb-a9c9-f6a1a3145b25"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-10-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"617c0bab2467f07067145b64","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ec878c28a04739f3e5","5e7092ea878c28a04739f14e","5e7092ec878c28a04739f459"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study was conducted in order to characterise the accumulation ability of Vaccinium myrtillus L for trace elements such\nas Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb and Zn and selected macroelements Ca, K, Mg, Na and P. The accumulation of nutrient elements\nand trace elements (ANE and ATE) and changes in the ecophysiological responses in bilberry in diferently polluted areas\nwere compared. The accumulation of the elements in the roots, stems and leaves of bilberry from four sites (in the nearest vicinity of a zinc smelter, a Mining and Metallurgical Plant, a main road with a high trafc volume and an unprotected\nnatural forest community) were measured using optical emission spectrometry with excitation using inductively coupled\nargon plasma after wet acid digestion. The highest Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations were found in the V. myrtillus samples\nthat were growing under the infuence of the emissions from the zinc smelter. Moreover, the level of the total accumulated\ntrace metals (ATE—17.09 mmolc kg−1) was also highest for the bilberry at this site. However, in the same area, the sum\nof the accumulated macronutrients (ANE—296.92 mmolc kg−1) was lower than at the other sampling sites. An EF>2 was\nfound for Cd, Pb, Zn and Mn, which suggests that bilberries may be enriched in these metals. According to the translocation\nfactor, V. myrtillus was an accumulator of Cd, Zn and Mn. An analysis of the ecophysiological responses showed that the\ngreatest concentration of ascorbic acid was found in the leaves of V. myrtillus at the most contaminated site (3.32 mg g−1\nfresh weight). There were no signifcant diferences in the total phenols between the contaminated and non-contaminated\nsites. However, the lowest value of the total phenolic content (490.77 mg g−1 dry weight) was recorded at the site where the\nhighest Fe concentration was detected in the leaves. A signifcantly positive correlation between the Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations and a strong negative correlation between the Mn concentration and ascorbic acid content in the leaves of bilberry was also observed. The results provide evidence that the ANE method, which is used to interpret the chemical composition of bilberry has made determining the impact of toxic trace metals on the mineral composition of V. myrtillus signifcantly easier and also that a non-enzymatic antioxidant such as ascorbic acid can be a good biomarker for determining the oxidative stress that is caused by toxic trace metals."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056460944","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12011-021-02989-4.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f459","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Nadgórska-Socha","uuid":"3155D6D006BBD52E9E6217C8F1E364951660C6EFD76D0CF5476137B1B676BAFEBE800460C3E51557A68DD3117ABD1FF49A939268E490965B901306012E0E0A2A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5073-2363","documentHash":"ce7a7cf9-0576-455f-9aa7-04b1a9d2a53b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f3e5","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kandziora-Ciupa","uuid":"20A48A15121AF03CD405250C608BD7E376D9629A4387011CBF10580CCE85541D1302975D5C61974A8CCF564262766BD3EC7C8A05D9522916537C9E33491FAC3D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1254-8917","documentHash":"367b05fb-b13c-406d-96ed-d3644aa974f2"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f14e","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Dabioch","uuid":"B251878282728972DD67C99F1058017AAB9433A40D0F22CA761914DB89A4822B07CFBB73710E21B57CFA8C0D55F5C0FE7E801611EE27441FC7A18611D709D459","orcidId":"0000-0002-6859-1631","documentHash":"185050a7-4768-4b79-a4bb-6e934dd7de44"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12011-021-02989-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f5da89543c7410626f3b3","5e7093dd878c28a0473b2235","5e709347878c28a0473a6436","5e709344878c28a0473a6211"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials of the Effects of Soy Intake on Inflammatory Markers in Postmenopausal Women","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547891e","mniswId":"12067","title":"Journal of Nutrition","doi":null,"issn":"0022-3166","eissn":"1541-6100","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cd8393c4-0801-4ef3-a179-32b172036948"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616fbca02467f01411a008de","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709344878c28a0473a6211","5e7093dd878c28a0473b2235","616fbca02467f01411a008e2","5e709347878c28a0473a6436","602f5da89543c7410626f3b3","616fbca02467f01411a008e5","616fbca02467f01411a008e6","616fbca02467f01411a008e7"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nElevated concentrations of serum inflammatory cytokines, specifically TNF-α and IL-6, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), are commonly observed after menopause.\nObjectives\nBecause soy isoflavones may have some anti-inflammatory potential, the aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to explore whether soy intake affects serum markers of inflammation in postmenopausal women.\n\nMethods\nPubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched up to August 2020. All RCTs that met the following criteria were included: 1) studies of the effects of soy intake on inflammatory markers; 2) any date of publication; 3) conducted on postmenopausal women; 4) with sufficient quantitative data for meta-analysis. Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% CIs. A total of 24 RCTs assessing the effects of soy intake on serum concentrations of CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6 were included in the analysis. A random-effects model was used to determine the overall effect.\nResults\nSoy supplementation significantly reduced CRP by 0.11 mg/L in postmenopausal women (95% CI: −0.22, −0.004 mg/L; P = 0.0414), but did not affect IL-6 or TNF-α. Significant reductions in CRP concentration occurred when natural soy products were given (WMD: −0.23 mg/L; 95% CI: −0.29, −0.17 mg/L; P < 0.001). This is equivalent to a ∼9% reduction in CRP concentration from baseline.\nConclusions\nAlthough our meta-analysis found evidence that soy products significantly reduce CRP concentrations in postmenopausal women, the mechanisms by which soy foods and their constituents affect inflammatory biomarkers still need to be clarified.\nThis systematic review was registered at

A","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the recent literature, the influence of lean fuel, type of fuel, velocity profile and the flow direction on the performance operation of solid oxide cells (SOCs) is commonly investigated. SOCs generate electricity when they operate in fuel cell mode (SOFC – Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) or produce hydrogen in electrolysis mode (SOEC – Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell). They consist of several layers, including two porous electrodes separated by a gas-tight electrolyte. Typical anode porosity (fuel electrode in SOFC mode) varies from 20% to 50% (after sintering). The porosity value may limit the mass transport and the overall performance of SOC. This work investigates computationally and experimentally, the existing challenge such as diffusion mechanism in porous medium using the example of SOC electrode. A set of mass transport models (Fick’s laws, modified Fick’s law, Maxwell-Stefan Model, Dusty Gas Model) are described and discussed, highlighting their similarities, differences, advantages, and disadvantages as well as restrictions in usage. Finally, a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the diffusive transport in porous electrode was elaborated and validated. An experimental campaign was conducted using anode supported SOC, fabricated at the Institute of Power Engineering in Poland. Simulations were performed of the mass transport of pure hydrogen and pure water vapor or carbon dioxide (substitute of real product of electrochemical reaction in SOC for validation purposes) through porous anode. Tests were conducted in the wide flow range 10 [ml/min] up to 200 [ml/min] for both gases. The results demonstrate that hydrogen mole fractions reached similar values (0.5-0.6) at both outlets only for the maximum residence time or high porosity of anode. This implies that residence time and gas diffusion can be controlled by a combination of operating and microstructural parameters and can be estimated by numerical simulation using computational fluid dynamics. The main motivation and outcome of this work were to reduce the cost and time required for the optimization of the mass transport process through SOC’s porous electrode."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056466098","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"239","pagesFromTo":"","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544221021265?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65c9f38340970762634a2334","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kupecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"504e5f7e-feba-4014-856a-fde06d0a6226"},{"objectId":"65c9f38340970762634a2333","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Błesznowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c645d551-437e-4795-9f12-934e4960ebc4"},{"objectId":"602f826f9543c7410626f56a","name":"Monika","lastName":"Jałowiecka","uuid":"0C43CE202CA8DE87DD20E14664F252457707ED96EF9E3F099CDC90AD0AF2F8544E2AA7BEB8F21D31C605D4B1DDEE329C3F0F09400D04A5FD9EEB9D0E5BA4520C","orcidId":"0000-0003-0467-2157","documentHash":"ebbbba50-7fbb-4d4f-82c3-a6f9e1e0f6ae"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e479","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Makowski","uuid":"47736E1427EC525175D14973206BE17EA11CF56089F538ACFE1AFE12C7B5BC56E825B9B05978DEA4D9B1C492E25C13EEEB4A9A17A73B04DD8147A05B5CA2ECEE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4033-5393","documentHash":"b5902a8e-4c44-4658-978e-31972c417922"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e474","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Orciuch","uuid":"C0D071396D9EC31D938280307E026933DA6EEF38D5ED8964561C260DF71788412CE12045855EBB494EE4C5F788A37FD9AE357779714692BAB7996EFEECB09DA2","orcidId":"0000-0002-4263-893X","documentHash":"4d8c652c-9df7-4a22-91d6-4ed11b39fa41"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.energy.2021.121878"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1a","uid":"bo-gzHUCaPNoq216Hhf4uRQ","uuid":"04d8f337-6a41-4c73-b0ee-a3f1a9293995","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Informatyki i Mechaniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940c878c28a0473b571b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Proteome-pI 2.0: proteome isoelectric point database update","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479083","mniswId":"15242","title":"Nucleic Acids Research","doi":null,"issn":"0305-1048","eissn":"1362-4962","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"16633a9a-cee2-4e0c-8845-6574ce983010"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2021-10-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"617fc9c32467f069f58dfce5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940c878c28a0473b571b"]},"issue":"D1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Proteome-pI 2.0 is an update of an online database containing predicted isoelectric points and pKa dissociation constants of proteins and peptides. The isoelectric point—the pH at which a particular molecule carries no net electrical charge—is an important parameter for many analytical biochemistry and proteomics techniques. Additionally, it can be obtained directly from the pKa values of individual charged residues of the protein. The Proteome-pI 2.0 database includes data for over 61 million protein sequences from 20 115 proteomes (three to four times more than the previous release). The isoelectric point for proteins is predicted by 21 methods, whereas pKa values are inferred by one method. To facilitate bottom-up proteomics analysis, individual proteomes were digested in silico with the five most commonly used proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, trypsin + LysC, LysN, ArgC), and the peptides’ isoelectric point and molecular weights were calculated.

As a consequence, many unclear taxa have been described, and their taxonomic position needs to be re-evaluated. We here present a checklist and revision of some previously described species from the Crato Formation and the description of new specimens. We propose a new species, Protoligoneuria heloisae sp. nov., based on a previously described adult erroneously referred to within Oligoneuriidae. Further adult specimens of Hexagenitidae are here described in detail, presenting new morphological data and variations that were, up to now, unknown for Hexagenitidae of the Crato Formation. Lastly, we briefly discuss the genus Cratohexagenites. Our new findings further add to the taxonomical and morphological diversity of the adult mayfly fauna of the Crato Formation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056469825","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"34","pagesFromTo":"875-884","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08912963.2021.1952196","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656db53940970749a863002f","name":"Taissa","lastName":"Rodrigues","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a6f4714-4270-400f-b990-b8166364520c"},{"objectId":"656db53940970749a863002e","name":"Arnold H.","lastName":"Staniczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3d05564-451b-482c-b4a9-c7d5fd13242c"},{"objectId":"656db53940970749a863002d","name":"Antonio A.F.","lastName":"Saraiva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c59b97d4-29c0-442f-b366-b63f31e9bdf2"},{"objectId":"656db53940970749a863002c","name":"Frederico F.","lastName":"Salles","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"108999d6-e5fb-4e03-9659-04af54bbe55f"},{"objectId":"656db53940970749a863002b","name":"Arianny P.","lastName":"Storari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38632f88-4431-4e23-846f-6b9526f5425c"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7f25","name":"Roman","lastName":"Hodunko","uuid":"352462D586263938BDC90646D10ECD9EB2A4432FE5381CA0F76F8C691AD294E975DD2F9FBD7E06CC62C06BC9F088A7D83DAC22DC4E2A5EE111AE0BDC513152A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2196-3327","documentHash":"44831279-cd49-4f40-9a79-3389772658a3"}],"doi":"10.1080/08912963.2021.1952196"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["maize","petrolatum–wax test","root system structure","root-box and root-basket methods","shoot and root dry matter","soil compaction stress"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e087","uid":"bb1eAT2BMBTGkk695wKT43A","uuid":"7c53f923-c0ac-4e2d-82db-2c93b9fd6578","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Rolniczo-Ekonomiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930a878c28a0473a1a0b","5e70930a878c28a0473a1a10"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The hybrids selected for the study differed in their susceptibility to growth under soil compaction stress conditions. We used appropriate methods of non-destructive cleaning and analysis of all intact compartments of the root system. Petrolatum–wax test, proved as an effective screening technique for selecting resistant and sensitive maize hybrids, was also employed. The seedlings were grown in custom-made ‘root-box’ and ‘rootbasket’ containers. The penetration resistance (PR) strength of 0.52 and 1.07 MPa was satisfactory for estimating root penetration index (RPA) among maize hybrids. The soil compaction stress affected root system structure (RSS) in maize hybrids. The resistant hybrids showed a lower decrease in root dry matter (DM) in M and H treatments at 0.0–15 cm soil depth, and an increase in the number of roots growing at an angle of 0°–30° in relation to the main growth axis, comparing to sensitive hybrids. The soil compaction stress lowered root number (RN) and length (RL), shoot and root DM, and increased shoot to root ratio (S/R). The changes were greater in sensitive than in resistant hybrids. In addition, a regression coefficient (R2 ) between stress susceptibility index (SSI) and relative trace change (RTC) marked for changes in dry matter of shoot (S), roots (R), shoot to root (S/R) ratio and root length (RL) and number RN was statistically significant. Seedlings of maize single-cross hybrids demonstrated differences in their responses to soil compaction stress, which caused changes in shoot and root dry matter and the distribution of roots in the soil profile."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056475597","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bff37b40970702a6693083","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"208","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"43c5fc8c-43a4-44fc-947a-875949688baa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"208","pagesFromTo":"106-119","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jac.12530","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616412362467f014219ef30e","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e40efac9-143b-4a4b-888c-7c33746e4385"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b918f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maksymowicz","uuid":"8241B19A1191887E8D6B16C595AB4B1CBE1948137F9DAA1FE639C9FA03CB5BBBF8C6F95A37AEA46B6B2F4C6B8981E9D59EF52850AB2FD7245484C3A1E4F83C14","orcidId":"0000-0001-5263-0184","documentHash":"2496d623-8d76-412b-8463-d0325f08064e"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b87","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":"586C7D776F6EE582438795652B553784FC957256E2BFAE854F81907449CB5149C95D15533442C034C7EB9C5E544D1E2EB1606EAB91437F6B14349B6D3D2318BA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0743-2095","documentHash":"3f357c1d-9cc8-446b-96f4-7b33b28bd222"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1a10","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Jurczyk","uuid":"B12AB37720C74243F7A9900438528AE342F219E40B9DFE2DBA6012278CEE5D7EA1D995DC326F1B4ECE706701ADA5264FA346E20035C197491102A15AAA5A9AEC","orcidId":"0000-0001-7203-4048","documentHash":"6b38b225-6363-419c-9a26-6c32eb0fded0"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1a0b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Hura","uuid":"BE2E4767958EBD60D259AA717DF6E24E77FCA8403B2A2D184EC71F55055C3BE5125FC7721F4BA946A90C94D85C54093EC80EA6C2E2401C15A20C2FA172F16673","orcidId":"0000-0001-5697-2886","documentHash":"b96f5aba-6b0a-4611-a997-84ba62b4159e"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a0473981bd","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Rut","uuid":"B20AC6E32044E95C6F12730ABEF026F4714939203EB02D336151300401E4BA39CED9573253447D1FA7DDC0E217BFF876684D979085A2968374C7797C35C69FB9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6719-3060","documentHash":"2d1eb0b0-9ecc-44ba-827b-b8b70becc030"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a04739808d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Rzepka","uuid":"17D620CB96A49D596085415CC025C5C1A41553D0C06E1A3C46AF243B494749E1B7E1BAC20F2C42F3A87243B0F7BF8AB7FD08BEE2B92E200E9AB763C4CFB5D93F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3344-7768","documentHash":"8d3f5dbb-a062-4ba5-989f-18a7a3b8d1cb"}],"doi":"10.1111/jac.12530"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fetal growth","large-for-gestational-age","macrosomia","postpartum hemorrhage","shoulder dystocia"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ef878c28a0473c740b","5e7094e7878c28a0473c69c9","5e7094e7878c28a0473c69c7","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1950","5e7094e7878c28a0473c69ca"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Large-for-gestational-age or macrosomia as a classifier for risk of adverse perinatal outcome: a retrospective cross-sectional study.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478856","mniswId":"11767","title":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","doi":null,"issn":"1476-7058","eissn":"1476-4954","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"02a1cd1d-487b-498d-87ec-ff331c8f1199"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6164351a2467f006f7e3e960","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094e7878c28a0473c69ca","6164351c2467f006f7e3e9b2","616435282467f006f7e3ecf3","5e7094e7878c28a0473c69c7","5e7094e7878c28a0473c69c9","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1950","5e7094ef878c28a0473c740b"]},"issue":"25","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective\nSmall for gestational age (SGA) fetuses and neonates are of great interest, while those who are too big are much less studied. The aim was to analyze the classifiers described by ACOG “Fetal macrosomia” practice bulletin as predictors of adverse perinatal outcomes for overgrown fetuses and their mothers.\n\nMaterials\nFrom a database of 53,586 singleton term births, appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA), large for gestational age (LGA), and macrosomic deliveries were selected. AGA served as a control. The crude and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated for large-for-gestational-age >90th centile, and macrosomia >4000 g, >4250 g, and >4500 g.

New data have emerged on the successful application of radiomics and machine-learning techniques to the prediction of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).\n\nObjective\nTo systematically review the diagnostic performance of radiomic techniques in predicting MIBC.\n\nEvidence acquisition\nThe literature search for relevant studies up to July 2020 was performed in the PubMed and EMBASE databases by two independent reviewers. The meta-analysis was inducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Inclusion criteria comprised studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of radiomic models in predicting MIBC and used pathological examination as the reference standard. For bias assessment, Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 and Radiomic Quality Score were used. Weighted summary proportions were used to calculate pooled sensitivity and specificity. A linear mixed model was implemented to calculate the hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic (HSROC). Meta-regression analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity.\n\nEvidence synthesis\nEight studies with a total of 860 patients were included. The summary estimates for sensitivity and specificity in predicting MIBC were 82% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77–86%) and 81% (95% CI: 76–85%), respectively. The area under HSROC was 0.88. There were no relevant heterogeneity in diagnostic accuracy measures (I2 = 33% and 41% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively), which was confirmed by a subsequent meta-regression analysis.\n\nConclusions\nRadiomics shows high diagnostic performance in predicting MIBC. Despite differences in approaches, radiomic models were relatively homogeneous in their diagnostic accuracy. With further improvements, radiomics has the potential to become a useful adjunct in clinical management of bladder cancer.\n\nPatient summary\nRapidly evolving imaging analysis methods using artificial intelligence algorithms, called radiomics, show high diagnostic performance in predicting muscle-invasive bladder cancer."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056481470","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f89171409707099271fa44","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"8","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"1b014b1b-61ea-4314-bf45-b37717234c6d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"728-738","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405456921001577?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616436ae2467f006f7e4af8b","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Miernik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"300712bf-ac1d-40e9-a3df-b6fab2622677"},{"objectId":"616436ae2467f006f7e4af8a","name":"Shahrokh F.","lastName":"Shariat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83ecd536-3a00-4cf2-96b4-585870be58b9"},{"objectId":"616436ae2467f006f7e4af89","name":"Christian","lastName":"Gratzke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"991b825a-de54-4fcc-9791-715ed433ee8b"},{"objectId":"616436ae2467f006f7e4af88","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Bilski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c68772a9-576e-4485-a797-6e7070b7b207"},{"objectId":"616436ae2467f006f7e4af87","name":"Rafa","lastName":"Osiecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6068c51-9511-4064-99c1-905526c332d2"},{"objectId":"616436ae2467f006f7e4af86","name":"Rodrigo","lastName":"Suarez-Ibarrola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e7a222c-60e7-4cab-adaf-7da8e19ffcbb"},{"objectId":"5e7093e1878c28a0473b27d0","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Dobruch","uuid":"57BEC094AD3E36F93D8FB0AF106626C9E355CB2F7FF4ECCC35540A32E6DBF99A30E2622BB186CDF363144A72881954B39B2EF4D8C2905742D9F86609BBE00147","orcidId":"0000-0002-0772-3696","documentHash":"9872f742-db04-4dc3-a1e6-82b2400d0239"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9d59","name":"Mieszko","lastName":"Kozikowski","uuid":"9861CA453C5468A5130C9E4DADABE932E48054B9ABBAE41570079CBEFB11C339D087CE8F2660D6595B768D652AF87C752ED12F15C8428929A24A1ADD67F40420","orcidId":"0000-0002-7533-4297","documentHash":"1388d43e-9981-45c8-b638-84ba178ab742"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.euf.2021.05.005"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["population structure","population genetics","Synurbization","human wildlife conflicts","genetic isolation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","uid":"bqvFVl6-FYxc-KjUUrbTwDw","uuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","parentUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","rootUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","name":"Instytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5887","5e70946f878c28a0473bcf0b","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fa0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Can attitude toward humans cause isolation?

This process is often accompanied by genetic and behavioural changes, and as a result, urban populations may form distinct entities within continuous range of the species. In this paper, we present the results of an analysis of the spatial distribution of genetic variation in urban/suburban populations of wild boars Sus scrofa. We used a genetic variation of 12 microsatellite markers to analyse the population structure of wild boar inhabiting a large city (Kraków, Poland) and its rural surroundings. We discovered a profound differentiation between urban and rural areas, with urban individuals forming a distinct genetic group within an otherwise more continuous range of the species. The genetic distinctiveness of the urban wild boar population seems to be maintained not only by physical barriers but plausibly by behavioural differences. Although the chronology of the highway bypass construction may partly explain some of the genetic relatedness between wild boar populations, our results suggest attitudes towards humans may be an important factor influencing immigration to the areas of increased human presence. We discuss possible implications for the management of the wild boar in the city."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056481523","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"34-40","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.4404/hystrix-00459-2021","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70946f878c28a0473bcf0b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bojarska","uuid":"1CD6F8BF56BABD6840899C7AFF17A6996219F0A766C08845B246724D0A83F5CF99CFA77B4A1F4D99B5042D1EA0D2277514345411A2C4E887222A7B9250687100","orcidId":"0000-0001-7141-3118","documentHash":"624cfc0a-4c4a-4664-a932-a2fa1ccf81d5"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5887","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Baś","uuid":"8D16CAA901830928CAEDA89A7158BDFC0BA79BD18A68886586A590C496406623106DF727F65AE896629C2F38F3D170C13FCFA4F6A5B388FFE335B7B824F0FBDC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12dda416-37ce-433b-8e51-e49fb4af0755"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fa0","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Konopiński","uuid":"ECA9A876300C84C5AC2AAA737DC8E478A5624CB1EB8E9717E5943794469A777AC9674BC2D030FEA60A2D3DBD5C66D4BB28F4396B5855722A4B9F7A6140409780","orcidId":"0000-0003-0893-0846","documentHash":"df1f2533-8f62-45b1-90f7-02cc926ed5f9"}],"doi":"10.4404/hystrix-00459-2021"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Road salt","De-icing reagents","Water quality","Ecohydrology","Eutrophication","Groundwater"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df62","uid":"bsq32O8WjxMhkpQii6EvcZw","uuid":"6700d816-d124-4a54-9d44-4f1b7f01494b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","name":"Wydział Biologii i Ochrony Środowiska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa9d7","602e5d729543c7410626f1ba"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The effects of road salt on freshwater ecosystems and solutions for mitigating chloride pollution - A review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61653d1c2467f021e6915593","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa9d7","6528fe9c4097071396622710","602e5d729543c7410626f1ba"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Road salt (mainly NaCl) is commonly used during the winter to ensure road and pavement safety; however, the long-term application of NaCl has negative consequences on soil and the water environment. The aims of the present review were to evaluate the impact of road salt on catchment processes which accelerate the eutrophication of waters, and to identify a possible approach for reducing the impact of winter salt treatments of roads and sidewalks, on water body quality. The objectives were implemented in accordance with the ecohydrological approach, which recommends using hierarchical steps to solve problems. The first step was the monitoring of threats, in which the causes of high chloride (Cl) concentrations in groundwater and surface water were identified. The results indicate that long-term winter application of road salt increases the annual mean concentrations of Cl in rivers and lakes, due to Cl entering groundwater. The second step was a cause-effect analysis of the impact of NaCl on the abiotic processes in soil and water, and on the biotic response to chloride exposure. Chlorides appear to decrease the biodiversity of aquatic animals and plants but favour the growth of phytoplankton, especially cyanobacteria. Moreover, Cl reduces the self-purification processes of water by decreasing nutrient accumulation in macrophytes, decreasing the denitrification rate and reducing organic matter decomposition. The third step was to evaluate possible solutions for reducing the negative impact of NaCl on the environment, and to improve the effectiveness of alternative de-icing agents. An analysis of available literature indicates that a system-based approach integrating engineering knowledge with an understanding of biological and hydrological processes is necessary to indicate solutions for reducing environmental risks from road salt use."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056481601","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"805","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969721053663","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6528fe9c4097071396622710","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Szklarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e9cf66f7-ea52-4cec-8f15-8a3cb3956719"},{"objectId":"602e5d729543c7410626f1ba","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Górecka","uuid":"57B42B304168AA39444D21ACD34A086BAB1ADE6A9F15A10FCEA774596AE355F2B5F5FF54F4E845CA8FF7CA74E07EFB373DC65BBF51D02320C98AB852E3ACBD1C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7573-2180","documentHash":"7e21c946-7818-4269-a027-20dd9d45cf0b"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa9d7","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Wojtal-Frankiewicz","uuid":"9780C1D9844B3F4E3005985B1AF17AAA2D67077849E2CCF9EA483E31316C07F7184ECD33C6391A75E25DA3266B2992B6072BB64F5DAF64D2D3D79237118D8F70","orcidId":"0000-0003-3509-6076","documentHash":"c20a2ae2-5bd6-4cae-a84c-84fe9e57fe71"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150289"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bottom sediment porosity","Bottom sediment surface area","Bottom sediment negative surface charge","Organic carbon","Sorption capacity","Ecotoxicity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","parentUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","rootUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The study found higher content of trace elements caused higher potential toxicity of bottom sediments. However, the PCA analysis indicated that ecotoxicity to Heterocypris incongruens was not related to the trace element content in the sediments. It was found that some of the physicochemical properties of bottom sediments determine the behavior of the test organism. The study revealed a strong relationships between the properties of bottom sediments and trace element sorption, which results from significant differences in the carbonate and organic matter contents. The obtained relationships showed a significant role in trace element sorption of negatively dissociating functional groups (carboxyl, phenolic, alcohol, and carbonyl groups) of Cha, Cfa, Cnh and DOC fraction and of clay minerals. Positive correlation between the metal content and the volume of ultramicropores, cryptopores and residual pores suggest that these pore groups contain reactive sites capable of effective element sorption. In contrast, larger pores turned out to be of marginal importance in trace elements sorption, probably participating only in their migration within the bottom sediment structure.

In Poland, a decentralized system functioned with 3278 municipal wastewater treatment plants, and less than 80% of the population were connected to public urban wastewater treatment systems. The paper presents the technology selection and implementation of circular economy at WWTPs and the practical approach to challenge of energy-positive and environmentally friendly wastewater and sewage sludge sector. The modernization of technological lines of wastewater treatment has led to a significant improvement in the quality of treated sewage, at the largest WWTPs in Warsaw, Cracow, or Gdansk. Eleven WWTPs produce 34% of the total volume of approximately 337 GWh of electricity from biogas in Poland. The potential of producing electricity from biogas in WWTPs in Poland can be estimated at approximately 700–850 GWh per year. According to the data of the Statistics Poland in Poland, approximately 25% of sewage sludge was used directly in agriculture and for land reclamation. Simultaneously, more than 100 WWTPs produce compost at a high quality. However, only few produce organic/organic-mineral fertilizers, mainly with addition of calcium. Decentralization leads to different technologies used in wastewater treatment plants, and environmental, economic, and social conditions determine the direction of changes and introduction of a circular economy paradigm in the Polish wastewater sector."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056481823","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.25","pagesFromTo":"519-535","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10098-021-02178-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e7d6","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kacprzak","uuid":"9B65F42D267EC15668AA35A40A64BBB8EEC13887D5EF5C5932934909D2984639AE21CADAE58C69F7827BC61E151A39E37CA47AEC6596E2BDCAEFC1503EB9B41B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3897-8659","documentHash":"5f1e3c2d-aacd-4e2c-b09b-5342619af170"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e7c0","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Kupich","uuid":"B29623DB0D693A5191EF7ECF34858CA1D374B3E34633178D150D14454C75000796C9196ADE78CF8E1F65A88D23667DF9FED766AE89178C1DBDB9912CDD4351E2","orcidId":"0000-0002-1686-4810","documentHash":"de198a51-7afe-4fc4-9bda-3f82f1d1e4a1"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10098-021-02178-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Supercritical anomalies in liquid ODIC-forming cyclooctanol under the strong electric field","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788ad","mniswId":"11911","title":"Journal of Molecular Liquids","doi":null,"issn":"0167-7322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e2167a97-56be-4ac4-81e7-457a12a26deb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"617452f02467f015c6e9f635","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602cd1849543c7410626e3d7","65ca01cc40970762634bc4a4","65ca01cc40970762634bc4a5","65ca01cc40970762634bc4a6","65ca01cc40970762634bc4a7","65ca01cc40970762634bc4a8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747056481865","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"345","pagesFromTo":"117849","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ca01cc40970762634bc4a8","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Orzechowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d3ec5e8-8714-4f33-beaa-f9a0a8c7d5e9"},{"objectId":"65ca01cc40970762634bc4a7","name":"Joanna","lastName":" Łoś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e84d1a55-5fd3-451a-b45d-e544da83eddc"},{"objectId":"65ca01cc40970762634bc4a6","name":"S.","lastName":"Starzonek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d1f957f-c359-40c4-88fe-53848d1bba47"},{"objectId":"65ca01cc40970762634bc4a5","name":"S.

It argues that even though Burroughs can be called a fresh social critic of his times, anticipating and being in dialogue with a number of influential cultural theories, what makes him distinct is his placing language as the ultimate foundation of whatever he satirizes or derides via his fiction. More importantly, however, the article traces how Burroughs keeps being trapped in a dialectic of two poles of countercultural approach to language. On the one hand, he yearns to go beyond language, aligning himself with the mystical tradition of the likes of Aldous Huxley, Alan Watts or Allen Ginsberg. On the other hand, his overall pessimism and skepticism throws him into the arms of the bohemian-rooted Dadaist subversion of language partly reinforced by the theory of General Semantics and exemplified in his cut-up technique. Burroughs, however, never fully commits to the subversion, working from within language and never lets go of the dream to “rub out the word forever” and “reach silence on objective levels.”"}],"lastRefresh":"1747056487765","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6176791a2467f004c37a5037","year":"2020","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"704f9196-31be-40bb-aa8c-150dbebac0a3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"63","pagesFromTo":"57-66","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00111619.2020.1817842","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bc7","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Stopel","uuid":"66387541989235310154F0001F7EC9B7394823E59C1C9BE44A0C4F6BBEA83DBA6A3E4A1DDDCD48D7D48193B2C72F46B59B801F030E637960A92DD4190AE31385","orcidId":"0000-0002-2100-2182","documentHash":"18002523-1f24-456a-84cb-a80a5fe05eb0"}],"doi":"10.1080/00111619.2020.1817842"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c9878c28a04739c9ec","5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f3a","6576c7b64097071b8ef77526","6576c7b64097071b8ef77527","6576c7b64097071b8ef77525","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f7e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Multiple sclerosis in a child with neurofibromatosis type I - clinical management of a challenging case.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705a","mniswId":"1204","title":"Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine","doi":null,"issn":"1232-1966","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"761f7660-d21f-4cb0-b78c-7c6b42d2b952"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2021-09-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61667d642467f04c031693df","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f3a","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f7e","5e7092c9878c28a04739c9ec","6576c7b64097071b8ef77525","6576c7b64097071b8ef77526","6576c7b64097071b8ef77527"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747056487831","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"309-315","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.aaem.pl/Multiple-sclerosis-in-a-child-with-neurofibromatosis-type-I-clinical-management-of,142267,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6576c7b64097071b8ef77527","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Filipiuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c9d37c2-969d-4a75-95bc-bdb48acef704"},{"objectId":"6576c7b64097071b8ef77526","name":"Agata","lastName":"Kozakiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"316249dc-10bf-43ef-bab0-8e92a2702ca3"},{"objectId":"6576c7b64097071b8ef77525","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kośmider","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0dade587-5ebe-48c7-81ba-bd615ace4ad9"},{"objectId":"5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f3a","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Sławińska","uuid":"9877B682C745B2D6D760AC7BAFFC1227BB8F65C64F02510B9E9B698706B96269567B08782A1AB55526492797E0958177FD65F7E7DCE1707C0E1E747749CD695C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9180-3498","documentHash":"74d4b1db-0a08-4901-801a-4baa8262520f"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f7e","name":"Monika","lastName":"Lejman","uuid":"CBE9608AC02E5DD9C147924981367A7AC2BB66EA331861D2CB1907B69A154DE62944F516A7AF9B481485923E2015B1DD0B82F3B88A371C7A521B4C9BAC5D328B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8760-0775","documentHash":"2ecbfb79-446d-451a-8607-774c2220488d"},{"objectId":"5e7092c9878c28a04739c9ec","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zawitkowska","uuid":"6320D7D504576A99993CE24FE5B9D749E530850DAE2633D6B47CCCBBE4ADC2EC636E727E84968F2B2131D211BA8C86AFAC139DF9125C2AECE770388AC904BCEC","orcidId":"0000-0001-7207-156X","documentHash":"a6d5db38-2dd0-4155-9ef1-1f10dc7e5214"}],"doi":"10.26444/aaem/142267"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"615ac5692467f07ea9652f16","doi":"10.4324/9781003165965","title":"Trust, Organizations and the Digital Economy.

Trust is essential to foster cooperation, knowledge-sharing, and innovation. Trust helps people to live in a risky and uncertain situation. Increasing engagement, improving communication, and influencing organizational performance are among the benefits of trust. The aim of this chapter is to present the meaning and interdisciplinary nature of trust in the digital economy based on a critical literature review and propose opportunities for future research in this area. In this chapter, the definitions of trust and future research are presented, drawing findings from disciplines such as psychology, sociology, economy, management, and information systems (e-commerce, virtual communities, artificial intelligence, and security policy). The chapter concludes with the limitations of the study and general future directions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056488074","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003165965-1/meaning-interdisciplinary-nature-trust-digital-economy-future-directions-joanna-paliszkiewicz-jerzy-go%C5%82uchowski-kuanchin-chen?context=ubx&refId=c9990f2f-6343-4f3c-92c0-973f6d0387e3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616573cd2467f021e69c0c35","name":"K.","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d22df7d-eb96-45c8-a077-9f7fbac01726"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e270","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Gołuchowski","uuid":"54A0B1C2E82945C3941682157447C3729733ECC75B4BAEDB6F8187D4E32325A0063A640FDC10673CAEBAD0B0613FD0FEF250F106B6D69399803FACA1FD879ED1","orcidId":"0000-0003-3130-7358","documentHash":"4088abe9-2175-4070-b0ce-5b250d68db23"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a047392175","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Paliszkiewicz","uuid":"722A7B3850D263DCBA08DF4B5ED2979577177871E0F5FAB06543E93D18619892E8E69C7A0A76A49887B0727A1C3D69FCF112D0B27D5F73A31B47C228CEBEC655","orcidId":"0000-0002-6250-0583","documentHash":"289f53da-6d66-4748-9e1e-1cb196593d12"}],"doi":null}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1NjQ4ODA3NA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
