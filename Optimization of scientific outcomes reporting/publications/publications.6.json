In those years, there were two very different social regimes. The first was the Hungarian People’s Republic (1949–1989), which was a communist regime with an avowed aim of favouring the working class. The second is the modern liberal democracy (1989–2017), which is a free-market economy. We find five surprising things. First, social mobility rates were low for both upperand lower-class families during 1949–2017, with an underlying intergenerational status correlation of 0.6–0.8. Second, social mobility rates under communism were the same as in the subsequent capitalist regime. Third, the Romani minority throughout both periods showed even lower social mobility rates. Fourth, the descendants of the eighteenth-century noble class in Hungary were still significantly privileged in 1949 and later. And fifth, although social mobility rates did not change measurably during the transition, the composition of the political elite changed rapidly and sharply."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056491114","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6388bc5d4097074ca320eaf5","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"35","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"8c3bbf5e-514c-4b2b-8ca2-5fcef1923735"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"1551–1588","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00148-021-00875-w.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6176c63f2467f004c3897e33","name":"Rita","lastName":"Pető","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae1a2414-56d3-44b4-b1eb-85a8617041a1"},{"objectId":"6176c63f2467f004c3897e32","name":"Attila","lastName":"Gáspár","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7247-6997","documentHash":"d6186a7f-9905-468e-afa6-dc8f66f9cbc2"},{"objectId":"6176c63f2467f004c3897e31","name":"Gregory","lastName":"Clark","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c13f5b3-df52-4bd0-9240-5af38ebcd48b"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac83d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bukowski","uuid":"5FE3B8E3931BF260E31BE9603A7661728AFBD619DC7C61C62CE8F6A37A8A6AC4ACE9FEBABD0C4C4D3920D8DBA435739D83F7909CC76F900E6CEC916A9039382A","orcidId":"0000-0003-3795-6308","documentHash":"6a02446e-89df-4eba-b0dd-c5272610917f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00148-021-00875-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Initial coin offering","corporate finance","innovation","entrepreneurship"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739707e","5e709265878c28a047394f83"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"What determines initial coin offering success: a cross-country study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bf93","mniswId":"5391","title":"Economics of Innovation and New Technology","doi":null,"issn":"1043-8599","eissn":"1476-8364","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a309506a-f1cd-40ba-bc03-bab43cc718c2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6176c3d62467f004c389561b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6176c3d62467f004c389561d","5e709265878c28a047394f83","5e709284878c28a04739707e"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigates the determinants of the presence and success of initial coin offering (ICO) campaigns using data on 503 ICOs from 60 countries launched between 2015 and 2018.

The results show that while insider retention and resource-related signals, such as the number of team members and advisors, contribute positively to the ICO’s funding success and post-ICO activity, presale offers and bonuses contributed negatively. Additionally, the results highlight that a country’s financial system development and ICO-related legal friendliness boost the market.

Also, we need to identify the factors that affect the SpO2 measurement. In this paper, the effect of compression of the cuff during noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement on the SpO2 results was investigated. A custom-made system was used for simultaneous measurement of NIBP and SpO2. The study was conducted on 213 subjects aged between 21 and 93, with a systolic blood pressure of (94 to 194) mmHg, diastolic blood pressure of (52 to 98) mmHg, and 994 NIBP readings were used for the analysis. During the NIBP measurement, momentary changes in SpO2 can reach ± 17% and are in most cases positive (mean 2.9%). The change was not correlated with sex, age, height, body weight, BMI, HR and blood pressure. The obtained results show that frequent NIBP measurements may lead to wrong conclusions about SpO2. In our study, pressure measurements mainly caused the increase of blood oxygenation

purpose of the study was to explore relationships between narcissistic strategies, self-oriented activity on Facebook, and conspicuous consumption.\n\nMaterial and methods\nThe sample consisted of 323 young Polish adults. Participants completed the Conspicuous Consumption Scale (CCS), the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire (NARQ), and questions regarding Facebook use.\n\nResults\nEmpirical support was found for the assumption that conspicuous consumption was predicted by narcissistic rivalry. Although the direct impact of narcissistic admiration on conspicuous consumption was non-significant, this strategy influenced status consumption through self-verified behaviours on social media, the strongest predictor of conspicuous consumption.\n\nConclusions\nThis shows that narcissistic rivalry directly affects the propensity to conspicuous consumption and narcissistic admiration is related to self-verified activity on Facebook. The involvement of Facebook usage in this manner increases the acquisition and display of expensive, glamorous products as external signals of status."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056497465","journalIssue":{"objectId":"627a61224097077f84f01680","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"002cb758-f504-4850-a404-a633dd2994d3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"21-31","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Narcissism-activity-on-Facebook-and-conspicuous-r-nconsumption-among-young-adults,75,45045,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399139","name":"Karol","lastName":"Konaszewski","uuid":"67DAC1B2EC51F9AA37532C21E734273DF9AA254B912D211917A507D0EEB259E68D5846456C85D653E9776E959728C51F6C258ADB523085175E7317E670DE610A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1362-4245","documentHash":"1093defe-60aa-4004-b4ce-9e68b77cc47e"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a04739786c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Niesiobędzka","uuid":"C140F5CDB0BF19B6A2AC836F872FCB84C0F84FDF835AF0E68E162ED65F49D4EAC314B9FA2CC0D04DDCFB9D1217723399784DC44F58BF7EC31DED259103B50AA4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4303-5361","documentHash":"4fd034ea-a4e0-4968-b6ad-b284f0299e74"}],"doi":"10.5114/cipp.2021.108751"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["identity development","Life projects","Narrative identity","Females"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a0558"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"What do females really dream of?

The study was carried out to test the possible mediation roles of the fear of intimacy and negative mood regulation expectancies in explaining this relationship. A convenience sample of 258 Polish adults (mean age: 30; 45% male), completed selfreporting measures related to adult attachment (RAAS), alexithymia (TAS-20), fear of intimacy (FIS) and negative mood regulation expectancies (NMRE). The results showed that alexithymia directly and indirectly predicts insecure adult attachment. Alexithymia positively predicts the fear of intimacy, which, in turn, positively predicts insecure adult attachment. Finally, alexithymia negatively predicts NMRE which, in turn, predict insecure adult attachment. It emerges from our data that the fear of intimacy and NMRE may be mediating factors in the relationship between alexithymia and adult attachment.

During the autopsy it was found that the bison had become pregnant, despite an advanced stage of tuberculosis. Material collected from the organs and foetus was placed on Lowenstein and Stonebrink media and incubated at 37°C for 12 weeks. Results.

creative industries are recognized as one of the most perspective sectors of the economy\nwith high potential to both contribute to local and regional prosperity and employment generation.\nGlobally, the cultural and creative industries (CCIs, or culture and creative sector) became a large part\nof the economy in the first decade of the 21st century. They made a 3% contribution to the global economy. They generate US $2250 billion and create 29.5 million jobs worldwide. In parallel to economic\nbenefits, the cultural and creative sectors also deliver benefits to people. They foster sustainable\nurban development, creativity, and culture. Furthermore, they support the implementation of the\n2030 Agenda. Creativity and culture also have significant intangible value. They promote social\ninclusion and encourage dialogue and understanding between people. Culture is both a driver and\nan enabler of sustainable human development. It empowers people to take responsibility for their\nown development and boosts innovation and creativity, which can drive inclusive and sustainable\ndevelopment. The presence of CCI in a particular area is an important factor of competitiveness,\nimage, and economic development. This paper presents the results of a study on the determinants of\nthe development of creative industries in the Baltic Sea Region. The summary of the main results\nof the study focuses on the economic importance, innovation in creative enterprises, and the needs\nof organizations to grow. It shows that creative industries, which are characterized by rather small\nentities and elastic work organizations, acquire new ideas and approaches primarily through the\nmobility of independent employees. Since creative industries make a decisive contribution to the\ncompetitiveness of the national innovation system and enhance sustainable growth at the same\ntime, it concludes with implications and challenges for regional innovation policies to improve the\nframework conditions for creative industries. This article presents the conclusions of research that\nwas conducted in four countries of the Baltic Sea Region (Germany, Sweden, Lithuania, and Poland).\nThe research was conducted by using a Computer Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) survey. A total\nof 682 correctly completed questionnaires were obtained. The results were subjected to statistical\ninference, in which the technique of detecting hidden interdependencies between the examined\nphenomena using the V-Cramer method was also applied. The main aim of this article is to verify\nthe state of the creative industry in the Baltic Sea Region.

Patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed with different stages of CKD and healthy subjects were enrolled in the study. UEVs were isolated using low-vacuum filtration followed by ultracentrifugation. Correlation analysis, multiple linear regression and principal component analysis were used to find differences between spectral fingerprints of UEVs derived from both groups of patients. Electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis were applied to characterize the size and morphology of UEVs. We observed significant correlations between selected Raman bands measured for UEVs and clinical parameters. We found significant differences in the area under the specific bands originating mainly from proteins and lipids between the study groups. Based on the tryptophan and amide III bands, we were able to predict the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Principal component analysis, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and correlation analysis of the UEV Raman spectra supported the results obtained from the direct analysis of Raman spectra. Our analysis revealed that PLSR and a regression model including tryptophan and amide III bands allows to estimate the value of eGFR."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056506582","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"102468","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1549963421001118?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd2fd04097077ac1dd5081","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gala-Błądzińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f003b52e-59f8-4a8d-8839-99fbc1dbfc91"},{"objectId":"5e709496878c28a0473bffe9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"71AAC35E2B481E85B1DE611E4BA969F01E27C3634D1DB1FE2B64E220B01BD1A0CAC90D3AB628B64FBCFB4D6B9C3B4C4D10C8446388638D1296D9652B44D81DF7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b680ab4-13b5-4573-963c-86b047255cb0"},{"objectId":"5e70943b878c28a0473b889e","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Roman","uuid":"8BFB78C357EBB70B5030D485C28DAE2851EB2444D7CF0DD0E705CA27BBAAE62EE858DFAE03FDC20CF26B66108D51ACB02BA56260EF85411C87F4BF29E97F88A2","orcidId":"0000-0003-0921-426X","documentHash":"0c4f776e-bf6b-4461-a9b0-6d4ff568599a"},{"objectId":"5e709322878c28a0473a362f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Stępień","uuid":"E2DDEB0F4EBFA471FDA064D591F920131F798A2FC5C83306C2A8C5D1021DA1402957D369D0836AE2DC63585FD061F91D18A30050B18EE8B29E6D4AF0C28EB670","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31363057-c87a-4dc5-9ca6-fe2f65f51e89"},{"objectId":"5e709322878c28a0473a3588","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Małecki","uuid":"506B9B08671D7E821E5B9DB400BFE22D5D3F05D2E2237779C16F0E5EDD48A96014810A9A810905E1A02377D6EC2339F16F7DDE0AB83161417DF68F0C21159AB3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53f240e7-baf8-4cb4-9430-741e62279bf1"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398df1","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kamińska","uuid":"34A4A6D74DCAF907F0462C91AD7AA7AE1B886E6E44674D73950C22D397F3C6BB3EF8423B21F3BC26F919DEADC0B3BB5C8DAE984869DBEA0D11F4A27249D00C69","orcidId":"0000-0003-0278-725X","documentHash":"f7fe8066-5e9b-4b4b-b7a5-aa91c1b5754d"},{"objectId":"5e70920b878c28a04738efeb","name":"Czesława","lastName":"Paluszkiewicz","uuid":"6584DF5FC914751E9B8161CD3C03AB5E584BA0F2764F38E59C129AEAB0BDCEE7992DB144D836DAE6A873FD967C761526F19084F8F7D2CC51193181CD5C40FD22","orcidId":"0000-0003-0186-8090","documentHash":"2437335a-b71b-42f2-a12b-eb863760eb9a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.nano.2021.102468"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-227-9475-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","uid":"bc8mEkzUvIyODmqQ0WYOUYA","uuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Uniwersytet Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej w Lublinie","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a028a","5e7092f7878c28a0473a026f","5e7092f7878c28a0473a0271"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"I Międzynarodowy Kongres Etnolingwistyczny.

It is also an essential parameter for the implementation of phage therapy to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens. This study investigates the phenotypic and genetic responses of five <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> strains (PAO1, A5803, AA43, CHA, and PAK) to the infection by seven phages with distinct evolutionary backgrounds and recognised receptors (LPS/T4P). Emerging phage-insensitivity was generally accompanied by self and cross-resistance mechanisms. Significant differences were observed between the reference PAO1 responses compared to other clinical representatives. LPS-dependent phage infections in clinical strains selected for mutations in the “global regulatory” and “other” genes, rather than in the LPS-synthesis clusters detected in PAO1 clones. Reduced fitness, as proxied by the growth rate, was correlated with large deletion (20–500 kbp) and phage carrier state. Multi-phage resistance was significantly correlated with a reduced growth rate but only in the PAO1 population. In addition, we observed that the presence of prophages decreased the lytic phage maintenance seemingly protecting the host against carrier state and occasional lytic phage propagation, thus preventing a significant reduction in bacterial growth rate."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056513154","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"533–542","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-021-01096-5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616ea6db2467f070ae3bebfc","name":"Rob","lastName":"Lavigne","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2af484a-0b6f-4dd3-ab5a-219d29ccdcb4"},{"objectId":"616ea6db2467f070ae3bebfb","name":"Vera","lastName":"van Noort","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"300d50ae-a7e1-486d-b6db-deeb225ff173"},{"objectId":"616ea6db2467f070ae3bebf9","name":"Cédric","lastName":"Lood","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7826-3378","documentHash":"cdd06468-bce2-46ec-84c2-46064d0dc7c8"},{"objectId":"5ec34cc77523406cb1a7eab2","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Markwitz","uuid":"FAB3E778F56668E0726D9977A4BAE8C2FC058F0CCAB62CDEB46539E8E4D372C2E080120826E71CD3FF44E0E46ECE63A5EB50FA1884A5225E0A40D87930B1271B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3511-1101","documentHash":"dfa59d4b-f464-41f8-b005-b55cf5a40965"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5861","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Olszak","uuid":"EF569C88120778B6DECBDFDB9F7B00C6F5D364FAA27EE508AB104A159329F13964D38990032A8F4519343BCD4526E226F421E5862ABBC6CA7432EBDFEAEDE8F9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8631-8084","documentHash":"e81b2154-56ba-47bf-93e7-58bf0d5fbf82"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473913bf","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Drulis-Kawa","uuid":"D35972E42BABB55AFC390F3D5D90941E48BDB0DA21AFAEE967F77835707A43095AFC80449494CA2AF19A68B1116813467895A7D6BCE6D01DC6EBF2EE6DC5A85A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4733-4660","documentHash":"bc2b9f00-466c-435c-ad18-9fd21a3c4951"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41396-021-01096-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Phosphorothioates","phos- phoroselenoates","borane- phosphonates","nucleotide analogues"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","uid":"b4-9zzGvUfyUhirAhWcr-QA","uuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","parentUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","rootUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","name":"Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7e895a085dcb410a25eb80","5e70934a878c28a0473a68c9"]},{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f082","uid":"b9SXTF1Zzo_eiHN0JX9AfyA","uuid":"951ff117-fef4-4ad2-81fa-149f6095a5a7","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Centrum Nowych Technologii UW","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ba878c28a0473c2b25"]},{"id":"5e7091c1878c28a047387ded","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Stockholm University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934a878c28a0473a68c9","616e94802467f070ae38a73d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Second generation of nucleotide analogues","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547923f","mniswId":"16038","title":"Phosphorus, Sulfur, and Silicon and the Related Elements","doi":null,"issn":"1042-6507","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"223f42f4-1db6-4bdb-bd71-e075463939e1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616e94802467f070ae38a739","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7e895a085dcb410a25eb80","616e94802467f070ae38a73d","5e7094ba878c28a0473c2b25","5e70934a878c28a0473a68c9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The most common type of modification of a phosphorus center is the replacement of one or two non-bridging atoms of the phosphate group with different heteroatoms (e.g., sulfur, selenium) or groups of atoms (e.g., methyl, borane).

Here we report a preliminary account of our work on introducing additional modifications on the sulfur or selenium heteroatom of nucleotide analogues."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056513345","journalIssue":{"objectId":"616e94802467f070ae38a741","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"4175508a-da1f-46aa-b42f-2d07f5c4dd7c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"197","pagesFromTo":"511-514","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10426507.2021.1989689","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616e94802467f070ae38a73d","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Bartoszewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1534-2690","documentHash":"d4b7cfe2-1c78-4f72-94b8-b43e10fca7eb"},{"objectId":"5f7e895a085dcb410a25eb80","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Gołębiewska","uuid":"B6AA38B3519E327D7E00EF438713A966E553E90E3D0AC375255E5E65947409C1374F09960105AF2A9D0A7BAF114CC57EC00E61BC765F8C75495E4A915BAE3772","orcidId":"0000-0001-5409-0134","documentHash":"0f8c8daf-b2b1-4970-8f07-865d77698cc5"},{"objectId":"5e7094ba878c28a0473c2b25","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kałek","uuid":"845E81C331967D2E7A5B7F4F5676B910075FC1EFE80F73763991DDDFBE418707DC6A0E7A0FAC0FDFFD4E3BB491DAF896ECE6BFEB59DBAD77D584DC163DF5DEC4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1595-9818","documentHash":"76d9ab7b-b7e4-4a4d-968b-45357a9b68ed"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a68c9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Stawiński","uuid":"9038E6B8367EA0AE3A8CDE7BD10017A755DC11936962165F1470C0D78B3FB0A4D35A334BC2678F97D8AA571425AB5CF4348ECD4A6A7950AE61C3FEDD2DC05163","orcidId":"0000-0001-9350-3018","documentHash":"3b298861-6f5a-4820-bd1d-2291eef55b17"}],"doi":"10.1080/10426507.2021.1989689"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Beckner-type inequalities","Concentration of measure","Modified log-Sobolev inequalities"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1a","uid":"bo-gzHUCaPNoq216Hhf4uRQ","uuid":"04d8f337-6a41-4c73-b0ee-a3f1a9293995","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Informatyki i Mechaniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936f878c28a0473a98b1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Functional Inequalities for Two-Level Concentration","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547934e","mniswId":"16420","title":"Potential Analysis","doi":null,"issn":"0926-2601","eissn":"1572-929X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7f32d9d9-7264-4b08-844d-bf749e5d621c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-07-03","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616deef12467f047de723add","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["616deef12467f047de723ade","5e70936f878c28a0473a98b1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Probability measures satisfying a Poincaré inequality are known to enjoy a dimension-free concentration inequality with exponential rate.

We show that a similar phenomenon occurs for the Latała–Oleszkiewicz inequalities, which were devised to uncover dimension-free concentration with rate between exponential and Gaussian.

This is due to the possibility of measuring thermal effects with very high resolution. The article describes and verifies a new possibility of implementing, using this method, diagnostic task, consisting in the measurement of changes in mechanical stress states in PVD thin-film systems under the influence of thermal energy. The present paper provides a description of the measurement method and a set of results of diagnostic test, performed with its use, for the thermal stability of stresses in the substrate-coating system samples. The obtained results were also compared with the results of tests carried out using other “traditional” methods and with the results of operational tests of tools with modified, involving the same coatings, working surfaces. The results document a complete applicability of the method developed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056525973","journalIssue":{"objectId":"617bda3b2467f07067103aeb","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"187","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"6d3814ee-0a76-44df-bbdd-53f3617bc93c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"110380","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0263224121012732?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c19f5","name":"Adam","lastName":"Gilewicz","uuid":"C7682ECB8BBF7DDA242D0307A3A85DD1705AEA656610AD501F27720610F08340F836151239F00C37906FF9FAA44FD3AE6317061A4C7C64865C203B156EAF119A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4061-4333","documentHash":"90310eb0-5864-48a5-93d6-b5667f03c6b3"},{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b77fc","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Sutowska","uuid":"E0AADCC3E6829E93C23107983D5E3920E2628CBAAA8531AA45F5890890F48435C7DAA92209A69F46F1C4D071CE3319EA654C4118C1346CC86A8058A475A5ABC7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0321-0022","documentHash":"3aa930ca-2bb7-4c7f-be80-ef7f95236607"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b635b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Myśliński","uuid":"5AD0975FEF86B4A6E62AB04BF0AAD02F741F95CF14DF80A899056465547351DFDE716E774E471C0D0287D58EB9B41BD2F7AEC7C1FD986AD1478FCD1A562FC470","orcidId":"0000-0001-5032-1652","documentHash":"2768dbec-0961-4383-ae94-d1cf4df464fb"},{"objectId":"5e709369878c28a0473a90f4","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Mydłowska","uuid":"B23E5E9C23338660C95E87EC3EF1932602AEE85CB153D62CF81CC6A42B74715542932D922189EE37E7B856197015A2DCE7859173CBADC80882FD1F8EB9792E4C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0288-0510","documentHash":"c2d3df7c-763e-4f91-8b1b-62facad28534"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9b0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nadolny","uuid":"16097EA55E08AB73C9F4F287F5E968183BFCE585664FD297C4C91DE777E7163195A51903DFA1DFEB183DB0237987DAE2810D57C3B966F2A926012AC20303A486","orcidId":"0000-0002-2753-2782","documentHash":"9ccc10dc-ea0a-4555-b98a-5978663b4696"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9af","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Sutowski","uuid":"D7A9CB19273EB5D6DAE05784BBC069CDFE839272DDB0D25709D50D63440CD0E8ACBBABA5E02A0AEA33E9E0739048BF5150D3D82B9C8E30FAB2DC234569616724","orcidId":"0000-0003-2863-5414","documentHash":"eae256db-ff39-4b37-b6bc-7c01962660ae"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a82a","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Warcholiński","uuid":"553AC49D84C6EDC1468B96A21A604EF56ADAE36780306C550A063568BAD1C8531E0BB0E6E8CABF999F011A1F41413B8779EDD473CE614449A6B73FB334C7B42E","orcidId":"0000-0001-5331-8539","documentHash":"2822489d-7069-4b80-b9aa-936cb39bd564"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2021.110380"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["non-formal education","first movers","rural areas","sustainability","environmental awareness"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac78c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A new narrative for sustainability: exploring biogas plants as ‘first movers’ in raising energy awareness","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547baf9","mniswId":"2135","title":"Australian Journal of Environmental Education","doi":null,"issn":"0814-0626","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3ae3e6c3-7328-44bd-9e2f-3180aba29ec8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616f398f2467f04c03ba7457","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac78c"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It is not only worth talking about the chances of survival in the fight against emerging environmental and socio-economic threats, but it is necessary to use all possible means to influence public awareness. It is awareness that shapes our attitudes and literacy. The core of these tools is cross-sectoral place-based education. This raises the question of the role of new energy actors in the education process. As ‘first movers’, they have enormous power in the local community. Are they therefore merely energy producers, or perhaps, using their position, are they actively involved in creating local energy behaviours? A combination of social research methods including qualitative studies helped respond to this question. As the study shows, an opportunity for effective education is contextualisation, embedding educators in the local social structure and including first movers – energy producers – in this process. Biogas entrepreneurs transpose the knowledge of renewable energy – a globally known issue – to the local level. The provision of comprehensive education requires institutional support focused on building partnerships between policy makers, teachers and practitioners, enabling not only trans-sectoral contact but also the exchange of experience."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056526202","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"152-167","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/australian-journal-of-environmental-education/article/abs/new-narrative-for-sustainability-exploring-biogas-plants-as-first-movers-in-raising-energy-awareness/D8124459E749098C02CCDAB76E4EF1DC","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac78c","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Chodkowska-Miszczuk","uuid":"3C6DFB428E237B95AD806576426E82F91116E0B3D2FF0DF26DCD4DDE69ADFB2E099E4575EE8C53724CCFDB7DDD659FAA32AD94F60B8C73CD64DE79BBBC089A31","orcidId":"0000-0002-4436-475X","documentHash":"f6e3c0bb-deff-42f0-808d-021705dee884"}],"doi":"10.1017/aee.2021.17"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Late Paleolithic","Hamburgian culture","refitting method","spatial analysis","mobility system"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","uid":"bJjSI9Xh5XWd377BL7x5oLA","uuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","parentUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","rootUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","name":"Instytut Archeologii i Etnologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709392878c28a0473ad13b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Seasonal Aggregation Site in Late Paleolithic – Intrasite Analysis of Large Hamburgian Encampment in Myszęcin, Western Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d55878c28514547b063","mniswId":"13712","title":"Lithic Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0197-7261","eissn":"2051-6185","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3bb34114-76fe-49e0-98d5-25c8b74f33e2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"617beed32467f070671289c7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709392878c28a0473ad13b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The pioneering colonization of the North European Plain by the communities of the Hamburgian culture was considered a cultural phenomenon related archaeologically to episodic short-term occupations.

The presented article shows the results of a spatial analysis of the Hamburgian culture site in Myszęcin, in western Poland. The use of the refitting method to analyze the flint inventory made it possible to determine the relative chronology of concentrations and to reconstruct the spatial organization of the camp. The results of the analysis indicate the existence of large encampments in the settlement system of the Hamburgian societies. The presence of such structures suggests that the Hamburgian groups functioned within a dualistic settlement model with seasonal aggregation, which was a permanent element of the post-Magdalenian traditions of the Late Paleolithic communities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056526267","journalIssue":{"objectId":"617beed32467f070671289cb","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"46","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6dcc2974-42c7-4ff2-a4ce-0c2f4c7e32df"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"46","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01977261.2021.1967580","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad13b","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Mugaj","uuid":"609A15F7CEC6ED203814B6F12F8D287BA03A44183E2413978DD7F1F52040AF765D57DC71CF913CE67A5CBD5EE6BBAA680CD36524CF7B8FFB5B611FE637614035","orcidId":"0000-0002-2822-2962","documentHash":"bc3bdacb-271d-459d-a9eb-15ad40b01206"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MIS 3","geochemical weathering index","leaching","decalcification","hiatus"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092bc878c28a04739bd0a"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5aa7"]},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f82c","uid":"bW6UmF5uUXnumJ4PLD8QbxQ","uuid":"da53ef4a-4e78-45bf-8b53-36a8ba11acd3","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Wydział Biologii (od 1.10.2019 r.)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473b9f7c","5e70922b878c28a047391035"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A palaeoenvironmental record of MIS 3 climate change in NE Poland : sedimentary and geochemical evidence","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547949e","mniswId":"16945","title":"Quaternary International","doi":null,"issn":"1040-6182","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8dcabf08-e6d8-46bc-8c86-fc0d71bcb0af"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2021-08-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"616f394e2467f04c03ba6f6b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092bc878c28a04739bd0a","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1891","5e709410878c28a0473b5aa7","5e70922b878c28a047391035","5e70944d878c28a0473b9f7c","5e7093c9878c28a0473b0b56","660be5624097076263dc7360","660be5624097076263dc7361"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In Eastern Europe Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 represents a period characterised by severe climate change of very rapid onset, which is recorded in the regional sedimentary record. Hitherto this work, the geomorphic impact of these abrupt changes to NE Poland’s 1st-order-stream valleys has been under-represented in studies. Here the combined results of lithological, geochemical, and palynological analyses—coupled with sediment OSL dating—demonstrate that MIS 3’s earlier events (60–45 ka) mark an interval when contemporary dry valleys functioned as active stream corridors, places where deep fluvial incision had occurred. Prior to this MIS 3 fluvial activity there is an observed depositional hiatus encompassing sediments from MIS 5d to the oldest part of MIS 3. Valley-bottom sediment accumulation began ~44–40 ka, commencing at a time when shallow water reservoirs began to function. The resultant mineral infill is devoid of calcium carbonate and organic matter (OM). This sedimentation occurred under dry and cold climate conditions—i.e. under the influence of permafrost aggradation. The geochemical composition of the MIS 3 deposits indicates that environmental conditions are deteriorating. In effect, calcium carbonate was completely removed from the deposits, which resulted in the reduction of mobile elements (such as Na), removal of selected soil horizons, and an increased content of immobile elements—e.g. sedimentary Al, Rb, Ti. These processes are confirmed in the study sediments by magnetic susceptibility analysis. Here, in MIS 3 lake deposits, the presence of fissure structures filled with grey clay or fine sand is a common feature. Climatic changes during MIS 3’s younger part were reflected in the slight increase of OM, which in turn increased the contribution of mobile, immobile, and trace elements. Most likely these change intervals represent more humid conditions during MIS 3. Sediment-trapping lakes within dry valley bottoms completely disappeared by ~30 ka."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056526424","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"617","pagesFromTo":"80-100","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618221004481","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"660be5624097076263dc7361","name":"Mark

This is particularly important for postsocialist\r\ncountries because until 1989, there was no access to Western\r\nways of spending free time. Polish Generation Z is the first generation\r\nborn and raised entirely in a free country. Therefore, the question arises\r\nwhether the 30 years that have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall have\r\nbeen sufficient to unify Generation Z’s leisure time behaviour under\r\nglobalisation’s influence. The study aimed to determine the leisure behaviour\r\nof Generation Z in Poland in the context of cultural homogenisation.\r\nThe analysis includes 1153 surveys with representatives of Generation\r\nZ from Polish cities. The study showed that the structure of Polish\r\nGeneration Z’s leisure activities is dominated by multimedia entertainment:\r\nusing the Internet, listening to music, watching YouTube or VOD\r\n(Video On Demand) platforms. Globalisation processes leading to progressive\r\ncultural homogenisation contribute to the spread of similar forms\r\nof spending free time originating in the so-called Western culture, which is\r\nalso visible in Poland. Practical implications are presented for policymakers\r\nresponsible for creating directions for youth leisure activities in\r\ncities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056526487","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"164-179","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebedcc9752340254fc42323","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Dąbrowski","uuid":"9222E7A3CBCB4A3EC2206A7C6329EB9D7F80283ABCD4061682A2E9B64C432921DCE7FF4B3FF516F19A678889928EB3B5E1FE55BA1425D1AD316F73AE4ADF003A","orcidId":"0000-0002-7671-1242","documentHash":"526db9dc-a5ed-4d0d-9cc1-3b9680f8cd96"},{"objectId":"5e7092bf878c28a04739bf43","name":"Stefania","lastName":"Środa-Murawska","uuid":"18E002F628795D32F188042E0A4B966910DA4F17AFD0196A62BAEA4CAE2635BC75FF8CE8AA64D147E8C609DC46859A535D163EA6BF48E6DBABC143559F004D51","orcidId":"0000-0002-2357-2613","documentHash":"e45f5c3c-f796-48ff-bc73-ef2e711d5ead"}],"doi":"10.1080/02614367.2021.1975800"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["almost

It has two stereotypical, polarized faces. The first is a classical institution modelled on Italian and French academies. As official places, they aimed at elevating art to the rank of science and making it an expression and instrument of power. The opposite image of the school is an oasis of intellectual freedom, a space for inventiveness, a place for applying unusual teaching methods and organizing the academic community. The most famous examples are avant-garde acctivities. This historical division is unreliable in fact. Dissent or even rebellion can be an instrument of morality and principles that could be followed. Quite unexpectedly, a peculiar anarchism can be found in the first art academy run by the Carracci. The name ‘academy’ popularized among the Italian humanists and Marsilio Ficinno, drew attention to the informal nature of scientific associations, opposing the fossilized formula of the university existing since the Middle Ages. It is surprising then that Joseph Beuys just created the Free International University. The very name of school and its understanding indicate a significant dichotomy not only in art education, but also in art theory. The point is not that the model of education has simply loosened over time. The above-mentioned facts reflect great disputes about the essence of art, about its relationship with science, everyday life, and practical application. An analysis of specific programs will allow us to see the sense of the mutual connections between rebellion and principles in modernizing artistic education."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056538543","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"55","pagesFromTo":"596–608","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00131857.2021.1981857","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709381878c28a0473ab69e","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Kazimierska-Jerzyk","uuid":"77BBB80BBDE98A4E6ED5D23D95C95FC2BFB7699627CA4426DB7823C24E645FBCCA93B20E6A822E03899C0FCA1BD3779C4670FDFA6B4C5D1FA2BD17019CC86533","orcidId":"0000-0003-1871-7897","documentHash":"e8f7d1ae-a024-4dc8-af89-2b23aea22056"}],"doi":"10.1080/00131857.2021.1981857"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["asthma","chronic

Juices are currently a fast-growing segment in the fruit and vegetable industry sector. However, there are still no reports on the diversity of the phytochemical profile and health-promoting properties of commercial sea buckthorn (Hippophaë rhamnoides) juices. This study aimed to identify and quantify phytoprostanes, phytofurans by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS), tocopherols, tocotrienols by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detector (UPLC-FL), carotenoids, and free amino acids by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode detector-quadrupole and tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-Q/TOF-MS), and assess their anti-cholinergic, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant potential by in vitro assays of commercial sea buckthorn juices.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: Phytoprostanes (PhytoPs) and phytofurans (PhytoFs) in sea buckthorn juices were identified for the first time. Juices contained eight F1-, D1-, B1- and L1-phytoprostanes and one phytofuran (32.31–1523.51 ng and up to 101.47 μg/100 g dry weight (DW)), four tocopherol congeners (22.23–94.08 mg 100 g–1 DW) and three tocotrienols (5.93–25.34 mg 100 g–1 DW). Eighteen carotenoids were identified, including ten xanthophylls, seven carotenes and phytofluene, at a concentration of 133.65 to 839.89 mg 100 g–1 DW. Among the 20 amino acids (175.92–1822.60 mg 100 g–1 DW), asparagine was dominant, and essential and conditionally essential amino acids constituted 11 to 41% of the total. The anti-enzyme and antioxidant potential of juices correlated selectively with the composition.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Sea buckthorn juice can be a valuable dietary source of vitamins E and A, oxylipins and amino acids, used in the prevention of metabolic syndrome, inflammation, and neurodegenerative processes. The differentiation of the composition and the bioactive potential of commercial juices indicate that, for the consumer, it should be important to choose juices from the declared berry cultivars and crops."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056547830","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"102","pagesFromTo":"185-197","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jsfa.11345","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3a6a40970762633a3d2d","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Wojdyło","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0ad506b-f543-4365-b1ef-db0fa34a126c"},{"objectId":"662a3a6a40970762633a3d2c","name":"Raúl","lastName":"Domínguez-Perles","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc15f98c-5406-4ed2-babf-ce7745df4543"},{"objectId":"662a3a6a40970762633a3d2b","name":"Sonia","lastName":"Medina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31980fbf-c414-4ae4-b6de-1fadb65c425f"},{"objectId":"662a3a6a40970762633a3d2a","name":"Ángel","lastName":"Gil-Izquierdo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e36807f3-92ce-44d9-80d0-6e8c96ff9669"},{"objectId":"602f51af9543c7410626f336","name":"Igor","lastName":"Turkiewicz","uuid":"63902371BC2426DABD7BE0F7BDF750F9D22782EC581DC8B16E799548F8DA4B230FC7A1517A6B2F8A821004C6C3C475724D0A5F3661660EBA60AC153CE6CAB53C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3837-6308","documentHash":"d873a713-ea00-4a52-adeb-3bbb4e51abe5"},{"objectId":"602f4d5a9543c7410626f2fe","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Tkacz","uuid":"1A42BFDF75725015696647E178E538BE905AA16D19CDE602A0E62209A4FFDBE33C656C8FC101C82445A2B898F94B0DF36358ACCE7A280C665E9D5DE422797FA1","orcidId":"0000-0002-6596-8077","documentHash":"bc5b8014-ffd8-4349-bb1d-508dac35031e"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b90dd","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Nowicka","uuid":"A244E3A036793F004ACE1AD9E1267EC463319890D94572D24C340C4ABF9475E27123DBDE16E8AE25D915621EE7F16CF52617C13C87C9227C72CAFBD322458713","orcidId":"0000-0002-5626-2662","documentHash":"ac25e6fd-100a-4b3f-ae53-aaea38a9a430"}],"doi":"10.1002/jsfa.11345"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climate changes","sensitivity","risk assessment","Lower Silesia","Saxony"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709337878c28a0473a51e0","5e709339878c28a0473a52ff","5e709339878c28a0473a5304","5e7094ee878c28a0473c7353","5e709338878c28a0473a52e5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Climate changes and their impact on selected sectors of the Polish-Saxon border region under RCP8.5 scenario conditions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e51","mniswId":"14281","title":"Meteorologische Zeitschrift","doi":null,"issn":"0941-2948","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"36602878-92d7-47c4-916b-69207b351033"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6176776c2467f004c379e756","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ee878c28a0473c7353","6176776c2467f004c379e75c","5e709339878c28a0473a5304","5e709338878c28a0473a52e5","5e709337878c28a0473a51e0","5e709339878c28a0473a52ff"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate changes are one of the most important factors affecting various spectra of the human activity and natural environment. They can significantly impact technical infrastructure, modify structures of cultivation, and have an influence on species structure. Furthermore, some of the changes may also negatively affect the human organism which consequently influence health and tourism issues. The region of Polish-Saxon border is characterized by a high variability in terms of land use and natural environment. Thus, the problem of climate changes is one of the most important issues in this area. The goal of this paper is to assess the impact of climate changes on the sectors of biodiversity, forestry, agriculture, transport, tourism, and public health, considering the aspects of sensitivity and risk assessment. The results of climate changes indicated observed or projected significant changes in thermal, precipitation, snow and storm conditions. The analysis on sensitivity and risk showed a high spatial variability depending on sector. The northern part of the region is usually endangered in the context of biodiversity and forestry, while the highest risk and sensitivity for tourism are noticed in the mountains. In the case of transport and public health, climate changes can usually affect them in densely populated areas, whereas the central part of the region is most at risk for the sector of agriculture. The results of this research can be a basis for further analysis related to adaptation to climate changes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056552292","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6176776c2467f004c379e75e","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"7206eb2d-6c3b-4f3e-8822-dc8119f5b66e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.schweizerbart.de/papers/metz/detail/prepub/100445/Climate_change","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6176776c2467f004c379e75c","name":"Marzenna","lastName":"Strońska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"50a71b04-5d36-4136-a8aa-9a4d23f96180"},{"objectId":"5e7094ee878c28a0473c7353","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Miszuk","uuid":"8CD5D5820DEFD9C9B8FA6CDB5EB8D95E0159E0E29FF26C8965B8178FEF13DD4E290DE3F3FA8689DCDE1C5225CEDE117C4BE1DD177C209B79A9C1ACE89BBFDCA5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0030-7267","documentHash":"b84c0725-0450-4af2-a493-8be0b3b506cc"},{"objectId":"5e709339878c28a0473a5304","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Adynkiewicz-Piragas","uuid":"ADA048DAFB2AD855725C2F94A0E21670F06BA3C1A404BF59197CA84BE1AA7B65196E1FD7C4CDEF51667058E333906BF71DB5A6CA454BD78488B750AAF24C1441","orcidId":"0000-0003-3237-8916","documentHash":"7374f6e0-ded6-447e-b205-7db7f5c2f2a2"},{"objectId":"5e709339878c28a0473a52ff","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Zdralewicz","uuid":"F51A634FC99249401CB118D9D574F93E244CB219985D6A2B2A3CD0BB7B0B9357A2052223AB6D7F919B4C6029C5EA5C589D61271C23808377740DE968F4D9B471","orcidId":"0000-0002-5999-7066","documentHash":"79a765ef-5d2e-49d5-91dc-9f881e5d407c"},{"objectId":"5e709338878c28a0473a52e5","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Lejcuś","uuid":"B6B7045E648EDF3DC5439361951ECF915B00B132680B15F7A0CBBA0F50F653FC1144E661C343458E35BC918B06D200614A8F4C6AA2C7DC4FFEF180A0FAC1C7B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6678-028X","documentHash":"e551037b-d7e6-4ac8-8034-13fb4c4acfa5"},{"objectId":"5e709337878c28a0473a51e0","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"KOLANEK","uuid":"7FAF54B83879DBF15264EA79D607DC5F955D678A4F017E4574D3C9FCD352B1C5C05A46CE6B31EAAFF13CD2FA7EA8DE8BBE36465F12C6EFC9B3DD516130FDB778","orcidId":"0000-0002-2305-5763","documentHash":"4a8dd8b0-61c3-4e20-86f0-df642e820898"}],"doi":"10.1127/metz/2021/1101"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["research integrity","science policy","open science","transparency","editorial policy","management and organizational studies"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7b87"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dissecting the tension of open science standards implementation in management and organization journals","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476d99","mniswId":"53","title":"Accountability in Research","doi":null,"issn":"0898-9621","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1ea358d5-9c74-4f79-86ef-732ea75e9b50"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-10-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618390cf2467f048f1e6bf39","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709358878c28a0473a7b87"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Growing concerns about the credibility of scientific findings have sparked a debate on new transparency and openness standards in research.

Drawing on an analysis of the submission guidelines of 60 empirical management journals, I find that the call for greater transparency was received, but resulted in implementations that were limited in scope and depth.

Rich regions or prosperous cities confirm the unbalanced nature of economic growth. However, there is the lack of studies undertaking the role of regional stratification in the national economy. This study explores the transmissions channels through which regional disparities may affect the country's growth. A system or recursive equation by means of the control function approach (CFA) was applied to empirically assess the weight of these mechanisms. The level of regional disparities within the EU countries at nomenclature of territotial units for statistics-2 level was calculated applying economic polarization measures.

From a housing consumption perspective, these changes opened new housing opportunities for some households, while creating new housing constraints for others. Applying Clapham’s housing pathways framework, we explore how the transformation, as well as its legacies, were experienced by fourteen older women living alone in Poznań, a big city in Poland. Through in-depth interviews with a carefully selected and relatively diverse sample, this paper attempts to present a nuanced view of the impact of the transformation on the women’s housing pathways over time. We identify four pathways related to changes in housing consumption: self-made homeowners, accidental homeowners, pushed in precarious private renting, and ‘saved’ by municipal senior housing. By examining these women’s pathways, we aim to make sense of their unique experiences while providing a benchmark for evaluating transformations of housing systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056579540","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"1050-1067","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02673037.2021.1929861","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad2d1","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Łuczak","uuid":"95245276642A8216B2F09B73EC05B3669EB53783D47BE4DC3CBDC7B4EE51A343EC5A091469CE34836E0223884B4EB7B35C5EF896035D6A371F46E9C2342576FF","orcidId":"0000-0002-9498-7541","documentHash":"f64fe094-4a08-4513-af90-8640eb286eba"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a0473938f4","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Ławrynowicz","uuid":"ABA5EB21262ACF8BE6F31E0CA113D3496B044E6270AB8A08DA25693B8A35BC4B50C78CBF69DFD1CDF54FBE9F6FA755829458FCA53489ED65DFCC3370A26D1C63","orcidId":"0000-0002-4832-5299","documentHash":"fd7bec49-f146-48e5-81fb-f731d2150883"}],"doi":"10.1080/02673037.2021.1929861"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["egg storage duration","production system","egg quality"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","uid":"biMkjldDwyEilXl7rx-ushQ","uuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","parentUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","rootUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","name":"Instytut Zootechniki - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5af3"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de72","uid":"bp7rrXRg6cIx_NCZXugZZqQ","uuid":"8a2706f6-8163-4308-939d-e9d29bba9654","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de72","parentUuid":"8a2706f6-8163-4308-939d-e9d29bba9654","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de72","rootUuid":"8a2706f6-8163-4308-939d-e9d29bba9654","name":"Państwowa Akademia Nauk Stosowanych w Krośnie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b78e3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The effect of storage duration on quality traits of eggs from different housing systems.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705d","mniswId":"1208","title":"Annals of Animal Science","doi":null,"issn":"1642-3402","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e9d5cce1-c361-423f-b07d-f938aa6a284b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61826d6e2467f02ddc4a40f2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63da605b4097076b4a8ddde3","63da605b4097076b4a8ddde5","5e709411878c28a0473b5af3","5e70942c878c28a0473b78e3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The  effect  of  storage  time  at  a  temperature  of  8°c  on  the  direction  and  dynamics  of  changes  in  quality traits of eggs was investigated in shelled table eggs obtained from different egg production systems (cage system – cs, barn system – Bs, free-range system – frs). after 7, 14 and 28 d of storage, eggs from each housing system were tested for physical characteristics and for cholesterol content and fatty acid profile in the yolk.

This feature is especially useful when analysing ancient DNA (aDNA) extracts, which are often dominated by exogenous environmental sources. Here, we assessed, for the first time, the performance of hyRAD as an inexpensive and design-free alternative to commercial capture protocols to obtain authentic aDNA data from osseous remains. HyRAD relies on double enzymatic restriction\nof fresh DNA extracts to produce RNA probes that cover only a fraction of the genome and can serve as baits for capturing homologous fragments from aDNA libraries. We found that this approach could retrieve sequence data from horse remains coming from a range of preservation environments, including beyond radiocarbon range, yielding up to 146.5-fold on-target enrichment for aDNA extracts showing extremely low endogenous content (<1%). Performance was, however, more limited for those samples already characterized by good DNA preservation (>20%–30%), while the fraction of endogenous reads mapping on-and off-target was relatively insensitive to the original endogenous DNA content. Procedures based on two instead of a single round of capture increased on-target coverage up to 3.6-fold. Additionally, we used methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to produce probes targeting  hypomethylated regions, which improved data quality by reducing post-mortem DNA damage and mapping within multicopy regions. Finally, we developed a fully automated hyRAD protocol utilizing inexpensive robotic platforms to facilitate capture processing. Overall, our work establishes hyRAD as a cost-effective strategy to recover a set of shared orthologous variants across multiple ancient samples."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056589716","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"891-907","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1755-0998.13518","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220ce","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Suchan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e2a8110-659a-41dd-b685-1105ef985bb2"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220cd","name":"Mariya A.","lastName":"Kusliy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4571c300-ea24-4910-8fa0-0393890d75a1"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220cc","name":"Naveed","lastName":"Khan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed127ea0-81f2-44e5-90ee-d98736ee4015"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220cb","name":"Loreleï","lastName":"Chauvey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5259b238-d24c-482b-ba86-4fcbc7f949d7"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220ca","name":"Laure","lastName":"Tonasso-Calvière","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ab7fa52-e14c-49cd-ac72-47a25efdc4b2"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c9","name":"Stéphanie","lastName":"Schiavinato","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b8c05e06-fcbb-479b-8c5c-dd8d475e4685"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c8","name":"John","lastName":"Southon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"819facc9-48dc-438c-a4d5-7b476f0811f5"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c7","name":"Marcel","lastName":"Keller","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53049baf-c43c-42b7-b4d9-a1f235cbdc2f"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c6","name":"Keiko","lastName":"Kitagava","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c82ffa01-d4f7-4920-b349-8f6174265896"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c5","name":"Johannes","lastName":"Krause","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c375fb58-c250-43c1-85dc-5af5b5745f66"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c4","name":"Alexander N.","lastName":"Bessudnov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a84c887-f2e6-405e-95ea-aa61412f5ef5"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c3","name":"Alexander A.","lastName":"Bessudnov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9836e084-9d61-430f-8d9b-288f48c75a1c"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c2","name":"Alexander S.","lastName":"Graphodatsky","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ccd2d62c-3fd7-477c-94fa-d76b4502171c"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c1","name":"Silvia","lastName":"Valenzuela-Lamas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38533de5-178d-453f-9558-62b842db034b"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220c0","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Wilczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"04d2552e-69a5-44fc-ba89-1ed6e9f767d0"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220bf","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Pospuła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8bd8fed1-88ac-4e92-bfd3-63238b1e7395"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220bd","name":"Magdalenia","lastName":"Moskal-delHoyo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5fe8fc2a-b929-47c7-8ad1-574c9e8d9d22"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220bc","name":"Alexey A.","lastName":"Tishkin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0def57b5-e80a-40c6-bb66-8c18b81c92ea"},{"objectId":"64cd4e274097077ac1e220bb","name":"Alexander J.

Symptoms of secondary traumatic stress (STS) were identified in 22.9% of the clergymen and 8.6% of therapists, and secondary posttraumatic growth (SPTG) in 61.4% of the clergymen and 42.9% of therapists. STS and SPTG predictors were identified based on regression models. In the case of clergymen, regret is a determinant of STS, and positive cognitive restructuring of SPTG. Research findings highlight the need to increase awareness of exposure to secondary trauma among the clergy, and for them to acquire greater skills for coping with stress."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056589945","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"1226-1241","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01443-y","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65f2e0d14097076263daaa74","name":"Nina","lastName":"Ogińska-Bulik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df744eb6-1e60-4470-a579-af80fe9f6c29"},{"objectId":"65f2e0d14097076263daaa73","name":"Zygfryd","lastName":"Juczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"045ea655-94fc-47ed-9bfb-2259faca4d05"},{"objectId":"5e70920f878c28a04738f3f1","name":"Józef","lastName":"Binnebesel","uuid":"DC55A6A24670DC003D3F2D819D2247E1027D9A87446A129EE4E578C029E6DFB9AB6829119B39B9A6EB5FDC316DC0638494023C0D0CF1BE1E5A191A922D111BB4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2533-6013","documentHash":"80a8c3a2-bbdf-48ea-b6be-919afa9e3f6c"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10943-021-01443-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedf","uid":"blqG9vV9Ni78LQIAWFAXahQ","uuid":"1d973f03-c5b4-4907-8157-05b91969c700","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedf","parentUuid":"1d973f03-c5b4-4907-8157-05b91969c700","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedf","rootUuid":"1d973f03-c5b4-4907-8157-05b91969c700","name":"Instytut Matki i Dziecka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f9878c28a0473b437b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Kosaki overgrowth syndrome due to a novel de novo PDGFRB variant","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454776a7","mniswId":"3829","title":"Clinical Genetics","doi":null,"issn":"0009-9163","eissn":"1399-0004","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"4df48bea-1259-456b-9863-12c2303a3db5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618391462467f048f1e7032d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["618391462467f048f1e7032f","5e7093f9878c28a0473b437b","618391462467f048f1e70331","618391462467f048f1e70332","618391462467f048f1e70333","618391462467f048f1e70334","618391462467f048f1e70335","618391462467f048f1e70336"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a previously undescribed, de novo variant of the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor receptor, beta (PDGFRB) associated with Kosaki overgrowth syndrome (KOGS) (OMIM#616592) in a 14-year-old, Spanish male.\nPhenotype comprises characteristics present in nine previously reported KOGS patients,1-3 for example, postnatal onset overgrowth, common central facial features, prematurely aged-looking skin and signs reminiscent of connectivopathies (skin hyperextensibility, pectus excavatum, dystrophic scars).\nOur patient presents neuroradiological features to date associated with KOGS: periventricular supratentorial deep white matter leukoencephalopathy, Dandy-Walker malformation and subarachnoid cysts.

First, we compared school-aged children with severe reading impairment (n = 51) to typical readers (n=71) to explore the individual patterns of deficits in dyslexia. Children with dyslexia, as a group, presented low PA and RAN scores, as well as limited implicit learning skills. However, we found no differences in the other domains. We found a phonological deficit in 51% and a RAN deficit in 26% of children with dyslexia. These deficits coexisted in 14% of the children. Deficits in other cognitive domains were uncommon and most often coexisted with phonological or RAN deficits. Despite\nhaving a severe reading impairment, 26% of children with dyslexia did not present any of the tested deficits. Second, in a group of children presenting a wide range of reading\nabilities (N = 211), we analysed the relationship between cognitive skills and reading level. PA and RAN were independently related to reading abilities. Other skills did not\nexplain any additional variance. The impact of PA and RAN on reading skills differed. While RAN was a consistent predictor of reading, PA predicted reading abilities particularly\nwell in average and good readers with a smaller impact in poorer readers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056592802","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"Nr artykułu:

In this article, we examine the relationship between Indigenous language use and community-based well-being among four Nahua ethnic groups in Mexico, taking into account the role of positive emotions related to speaking the heritage language as a mediator of the influence of its use in the family domain on community-based well-being.\n\nMethod: We employ an emic community-based well-being scale, a second scale measuring the use of Nahuatl and Spanish across different domains of social life, and a third scale measuring positive emotions related to the use of Nahuatl in order to examine the relationship between Nahuatl use and community-based well-being, in a sample (N = 552) of Indigenous Nahua participants (55.4% female, Mage = 37.9, SD = 18.3) coming from four different regions of Mexico.\n\nResults: Results from the mediation analysis revealed that the relation between the frequency of Nahuatl use and community-based well-being in the total sample is partially mediated by experiencing positive emotions related with Nahuatl use. Furthermore, the relation between Nahuatl use and community-based well-being was also found to be moderated by group membership.\n\nConclusions: Our study confirms that the role of heritage language use for Nahua communities in Mexico is beneficial and that this effect is also significant in communities strongly affected by language loss and assimilation.

The collection of the large number of records was made possible by the use of a small aeroplane during the first two years of the study, which enabled us to locate flocks over a large study area.\nResults\nIn total, 5685 storks were observed, with a median flock size of eight individuals, although flock size varied during the migration period and by time of day. For the 2980 birds for which age could be determined, there was a higher proportion of adults (55.7%) than juveniles (44.3%). Analysis of data from ringed birds showed that the mean (±sd) distance travelled from natal sites was 277.3 ± 245.3 km, with birds coming mainly from southern Poland and eastern Germany. Storks foraged mainly in ploughed fields and cut meadows, and such habitats appear crucial for fuelling before migration.\nConclusions\nSouthern Poland provides an important stop-over site for migrating White Storks, which originate from a potentially large area. Hence, ensuring the continued availability of autumn foraging for White Storks in southern Poland benefits not only local birds but also a much larger population."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056595513","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6217803f2467f05a132fae61","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"68","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"1f04b556-fa06-4547-b778-be36a22376a1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"190-197","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00063657.2021.1976104?scroll=top&needAccess=true","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a15d4097074fa1bcc9b6","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Tryjanowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70d9be13-f261-406e-9222-a090722c4006"},{"objectId":"6661a15d4097074fa1bcc9b5","name":"Tim H.","lastName":"Sparks","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a34b50b-5df5-44f7-9766-e2cc8b79f365"},{"objectId":"6661a15d4097074fa1bcc9b4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Profus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"073bdf96-6038-40fc-8dc7-16c90131d48b"},{"objectId":"6661a15d4097074fa1bcc9b3","name":"Norbert","lastName":"Chmura","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52b32b1f-67f1-44f4-adc2-6fcd04c90728"},{"objectId":"6661a15d4097074fa1bcc9b2","name":"Artur","lastName":"Siekiera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"733484ed-4485-42d2-a675-dd8f3f3f2105"},{"objectId":"6661a15d4097074fa1bcc9b1","name":"Joachim","lastName":"Siekiera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c1b0acff-45d8-4008-bed0-25734a763f2a"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b764e","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"JANKOWIAK","uuid":"E1F32366431A606BA729F6067FCB5C45A4A327CF9E1D890C8BB75839B81395F74FC4C08B93CAB4657FF2519DED9BE5E130EDC875DC51582A2EB8909AE40E00B1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3843-9778","documentHash":"955df4a9-f4bd-49a3-9c3b-fc67706d7f93"}],"doi":"10.1080/00063657.2021.1976104"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Group decision and negotiation","Prenegotiation preparation","Negotiation offer scoring system","Holistic judgments","UTA","DR"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092db878c28a04739e322"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Can holistic declaration of preferences improve a negotiation offer scoring system?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bd5","mniswId":"6227","title":"European Journal of Operational Research","doi":null,"issn":"0377-2217","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"b8b3712b-659f-48ca-95d5-d7d9dadef452"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6184ddfc2467f06860a1e206","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092db878c28a04739e322","6184ddfc2467f06860a1e20f"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we analyse the problem of determining a negotiation offer scoring system using an alternative approach to the classic direct rating (DR). We examine the effectiveness of the prenegotiation preference elicitation on the basis of holistic judgments, supported by a software decision support tool. This approach is based on rank-ordering of examples of complete offers, which is then disaggregated using the Utilités Additives (UTA) method. In a series of studies, we analyse the accuracy of the scoring systems obtained from these approaches, as well as the negotiators’ subjective evaluation of their use and usefulness. The technical capability of the various setups of the UTA-based disaggregation models to produce accurate scoring systems is verified by simulation in Study 1. The empirical applicability of the most promising UTA-based models is studied in two experiments, in which the negotiators used examples of both predefined and self-declared sets of offers (Study 2), or applied an enhanced UTA algorithm (Study 3). The enhanced algorithm used a predefined set of offers, implemented certain elements of DR, and allowed for iterative improvements of the scoring system. The results show that the UTA-based approach works in a technical sense, but empirically its performance is worse than DR unless the set of example offers is predefined. The enhanced algorithm produced a better scoring system, but users' subjective evaluations were mixed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056598582","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ecb4b24097072bce756097","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"299","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"da578421-26ff-4522-a90a-98a87bda291a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"299","pagesFromTo":"1018-1032","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221721008559?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6184ddfc2467f06860a1e20f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Roszkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9846eed5-afbd-47fc-9d7d-fa97de005c0b"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e322","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wachowicz","uuid":"1686F915CE16B168D2B40FAFD6FF18C59F80274E69207001E6B08CF6B235E83A0AA196D0621C0741A660D27FED99F39EF8EA26A3BE798AB5416E51C9413B2405","orcidId":"0000-0001-9485-6667","documentHash":"ddfc0d15-6f51-478d-9f1a-5ca8aab0f981"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analysis of the integrity of district crisis management plans in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781d2","mniswId":"8808","title":"International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction","doi":null,"issn":"2212-4209","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"2395dd0b-00cc-4123-9bf1-3d6678a2ece7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-10-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6183d6162467f038354fc466","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70930d878c28a0473a1e04"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747056598666","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"67","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221242092100611","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1e04","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wiśniewski","uuid":"7817B39415DF12A5BE1DAD0BB558D2AEFA3895221C6A361C8CF2FB106A861B21998776E9B12FBF913FBCD1FA4F574DE4B32732AD8F328906DCFDD27FE0962454","orcidId":"0000-0003-3435-3114","documentHash":"ca2fb055-6649-4ee2-8e28-419d6f02742b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102650"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["rachunkowość behawioralna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["behavioural accounting"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-955126-3-6","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Rachunkowość behawioralna.

Furthermore, we show that exposure of second instar larvae to an elevated temperature led to impaired retention of what was learned in a T-maze when tested after moulting into the third instar, compared to larvae raised under a more benign temperature. We suggest that climate change, involving an increase in mean temperatures as well as rare events (e.g., heatwaves) might negatively afect the retention of operant conditioning in antlions, alongside known, \nmore frequently studied efects, such as changes in body size and distribution."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056601419","journalIssue":{"objectId":"618b7f632467f01cc0b6233a","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"8f550bf0-65d4-4fbc-9fdd-2c7b380f1f8f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"509–518","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10071-021-01570-9.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"618b7f632467f01cc0b62338","name":"Inon","lastName":"Scharf","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8506-7161","documentHash":"74f9a52d-fe11-435a-8d0f-fcbe7bced428"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3d7f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Miler","uuid":"18E05A8103307AE916169004274D53958BBA6E5053DD908046E1F67532BB282F8A3B64F5DB5FEC686D29153F7E6B45AB696C1041D37742C51C17BDC37D2D3FB9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7684-0629","documentHash":"43f54d10-4211-4e87-a315-c8ee2078e8e4"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10071-021-01570-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Jaguar","Occurrence","Evolution","Size","Competition","Lion"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","uid":"bi0054EFyZHNUwKK3x5HmqA","uuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","parentUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","rootUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","name":"Instytut Systematyki i Ewolucji Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949e878c28a0473c085d"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e7878c28a0473b2fca"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Panthera gombaszoegensis (Kretzoi, 1938) from Poland in the scope of the species evolution","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547949e","mniswId":"16945","title":"QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL","doi":null,"issn":"1040-6182","eissn":"1873-4553","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"be5858f4-3896-49f7-9110-0b6d1b6c8e95"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618b7c0c2467f01cc0b59a7e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70949e878c28a0473c085d","5e7093e7878c28a0473b2fca"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Panthera gombaszoegensis was recorded over from 100 African and Eurasian localities, ranged between 2.5 and 0.3 Myr. Among them, seven cave sites, Zabia, ˙ Tunel Wielki, Kozi Grzbiet, Draby 3, Południowa, Bi´snik, and Komarowa caves, dated in the range of 1.7–0.3 Myr, were those in Poland. They were located in Sudety Mts, Krakow-Częstochowa Upland, Wielun ´ Upland and Holy Cross Mts. The material from Polish sites is not very numerous, being represented mostly by isolated teeth, metapodials and phalanges, however it is well informative diagnostically. From each site, except the Bi´snik Cave, remains of a single large-sized individual, mostly of males, were found. The oldest record from Zabia ˙ Cave, dated on 1.7–1.5 Myr, because of lack of suifficient diagnostic features, was classified as P. gombaszoegensis. Bones from the other sites were assigned to Panthera gombaszoe\u0002gensis gombaszoegensis, late Early and Middle Pleistocene chronoform widespread in Eurasia. Analysis of a large series of teeth size in the course of time does not showed any particular changes, and the size of the Eurasian jaguar was more or less comparatively large through its entire timespan occurrence. \nPanthera gombaszoegensis was ecologically flexible species able to hunt in a wide prey spectrum; its size, comparable with that of a small lion Panthera leo (Linnaeus, 1758) or island tiger Panthera tigris (Linnaeus, 1758), guaranteed this jaguar one of the leading position among large carnivores. This was a member of stabile by 1 Myr carnivore paleoguild, single, conical-toothed cat, and it was well adapted to changed environmental conditions initiated by glacial-interglacial cycles. It seems that climate changes do not affected so much on P. gombaszoegensis as previously thought. The main factor responsible for the jaguar decline was the arrival of the Pleistocene lion, which affected negatively and caused strong competition. Because to its flexibility, jaguar was able to survive relatively longer than other ancient carnivores. Gradually as the density and abundance of the lion \nincreased, a compact and wide geographic range started to shrink up to the form of isolated areas. Areas with the last, relict jaguar survivors were located far away one from another and overwhelmed by populations of P. s. fossilis. The final extinction of the species was between 350 and 300 kyr, and among them Polish find from the layer 19ad of Bi´snik Cave should be highlighted as one of the latest Eurasian record of Panthera gombaszoegensis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056601635","journalIssue":{"objectId":"60a754d12467f06d90d1a8c0","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"2f5cce94-29f9-47da-82d3-d42f5e1bd7db"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"633","pagesFromTo":"36-51","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1040618221003839?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70949e878c28a0473c085d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Lipecki","uuid":"E110EA8FF22C97E5EA5BC7E55852FE298805F19F2B9C87993E2F3B5010345ECB52D0743B71BAB440E43846006C7F43C206BF0ECC23D345139C2D5709E892FF7C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2650-9385","documentHash":"b4128b37-e7b7-4712-adfa-50e4766ae5a0"},{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b2fca","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Marciszak","uuid":"C68416A52C12EE50BC03E37C805FE348A85D52CEBCE7730418E0C6D913D56E84D668DBB1DC7B07A1D7F8745065C99E934ED798D5AD4559E82FD5A49E0FC09CE3","orcidId":"0000-0002-1472-6553","documentHash":"e10003e3-f376-4131-ad40-ba7164c8349f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.quaint.2021.07.002"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["globalne łańcuchy wartości","EŚW","przemysł przetwórczy","usługi","usługi ICT"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["global value chains","Central and Eastern Europe","manufacturing","services","ICT services"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A New Era Is Beginning in Central and Eastern Europe: Information and Communication Technology Services Exceed Manufacturing in the Global Production Chain","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547caad","mniswId":"12939","title":"Journal of the Knowledge Economy","doi":null,"issn":"1868-7865","eissn":"1868-7873","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5c003a78-703c-4000-a853-9372ec5c81e0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-07-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618b890e2467f00198e03689","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af8e5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article compares changes in tendencies of value-added fows and the places held\r\nby the Central and Eastern European economies (11 countries: Visegrad countries,\r\nBaltic States, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania; CEE) in global value chains\r\n(GVCs) in manufacturing, services, and their subgroup—information and telecommunication (ICT) services, by relying on the trade in value-added data retrieved\r\nfrom the OECD’s Inter-Country Input–Output Database, available over the period\r\n2005–2015.

We present two simple mathematical models reflecting different mechanisms of ADR with some Darwinian effects included. These effects allow bi-directional flow between resistant and sensitive compartments, meaning that not only sensitive cells become resistant but also resistant cells may become sensitive again. Basing on this mathematical approach, we conclude that, for constant continuous treatment, if there is no flow back to the sensitive compartment, then once resistant cells appear, sensitive cells are eventually eliminated, independently of the mechanism of acquiring the resistance. However, with bi-directional flow, the situation is a little better as the sensitive cells are not completely eliminated, although they are still outcompeted by the resistant ones. Moreover, if the therapy is stopped, resistant cells become dominated by sensitive cells and the situation changes. We discuss these mechanisms for slowly proliferating tumors on the example of gliomas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056607844","journalIssue":{"objectId":"647983464097071aca381890","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"45","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"0ac5b999-3e04-478d-8cf7-2d050690d2b4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"4161-4184","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mma.7893","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7bf0","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bodnar","uuid":"1ADF877830F4F308E65DB87C82C4AD665D47FF0CD394B4B0F8367FE8CD943D5078DBB011EC6C90A75170BE4D31D78972B659CAB1CA80D1CF526450E0EBD88227","orcidId":"0000-0001-5571-2476","documentHash":"89377953-4555-45a4-819b-e81419c1dcd7"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a793c","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Foryś","uuid":"0DF559CDD203E9DB89A1E08169D5C6C1D5CCD34C3104070397A8CF228286039E5AF8D2B9E548916973392B3AD566904E2509CB8FBEEEC2F1F35B1B028AE49C4D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6198-3667","documentHash":"322d35c5-60ba-4461-b087-ede2c0c7696b"}],"doi":"10.1002/mma.7893"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Petri net","double exponent","strong computer","exact computer"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6160fea975234017e050df36"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"From strong to exact Petri net computers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c561","mniswId":"9227","title":"International Journal of Parallel Emergent and Distributed Systems","doi":null,"issn":"1744-5760","eissn":"1744-5779","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"72195e8f-ffe1-491f-8046-5f6acd824154"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618b942d2467f01cc0bc3ad9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["618b942d2467f01cc0bc3adc","6160fea975234017e050df36"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Petri net paradigm of computing is concerned discussing basic types of Petri net computers and their relations. We developed a technique of parametric specification of Petri nets, built of a few connected components which are repeated depending on a parameter or a set of parameters, and composition of software to generate automatically the corresponding models in a vivid graphical form. We construct explicitly a Petri net that is a strong computer of double exponent after R.J. Lipton. Its nondeterministic computation is represented by a Petri net reachability graph to which a successful branch belongs. Then we minimise and transform the net to obtain twice smaller construct than the original one. Moreover, the obtained net possesses such a marvellous property that addingto it four priority arcs makes it an exact (deterministic) computer having a single firable sequence only. Same as the Lipton’s net, the minimized net allows the proof that the Petri net reachability problem is exponential in space. Besides, it represents an example when simple transformations allow guessing the successful branch of a nondeterministic computation. The practical significance of the approach in applications consists in a state-of-art heuristic technique of solving some NP problems in polynomial time."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056607863","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62270df62467f06c17645210","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"37","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"2c0354be-5e5a-41fc-9cfc-6f76b13ba2ae"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"167-186","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17445760.2021.1991340","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"618b942d2467f01cc0bc3adc","name":"MengChu","lastName":"Zhou","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5408-8752","documentHash":"63257b9e-8d86-4c3e-87b4-7764dbc8372a"},{"objectId":"6160fea975234017e050df36","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Zaitsev","uuid":"BA62D3A29E4943F9355A9AD76D6B2620B738556278860232559ECE04BF1195D3D73CEA66F6CF55054908F039C4B21B053198B29CC34F329D4539698D6D71EF24","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"567ff72b-a4f3-4bde-aab2-61d9c7aa3a05"}],"doi":"10.1080/17445760.2021.1991340"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["formalism","experimental jurisprudence","abstract/concrete paradox","identifiability effectt","judicial decision-making"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70931f878c28a0473a32e7","63e1c5b87523404b9db59e3c"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70932c878c28a0473a4496"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Do formalist judges abide by their abstract principles? : a two-country study in adjudication","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d59878c28514547c419","mniswId":"8569","title":"International Journal for the Semiotics of Law","doi":null,"issn":"0952-8059","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"dd0fa92d-0087-4209-91ef-47a56db53ac2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"617d12ec2467f04376d03160","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64cd3d684097077ac1df53e7","5e70932c878c28a0473a4496","64cd3d684097077ac1df53e9","64cd3d684097077ac1df53ea","63e1c5b87523404b9db59e3c","5e70931f878c28a0473a32e7"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recent literature in experimental philosophy has postulated the existence of the abstract/concrete paradox (ACP): the tendency to activate inconsistent intuitions (and generate inconsistent judgment) depending on whether a problem to be analyzed is framed in abstract terms or is described as a concrete case. One recent study supports the thesis that this effect influences judicial decision-making, including decision-making by professional judges, in areas such as interpretation of constitutional principles and application of clear-cut rules. Here, following the existing literature in legal theory, we argue that the susceptibility to such an effect might depend on whether decision-makers operate in a legal system characterized by the formalist or particularist approach to legal interpretation, with formalist systems being less susceptible to the effect. To test this hypothesis, we compare the results of experimental studies on ACP run on samples from two countries differing in legal culture: Poland and Brazil. The lack of significant differences between those results (also for professional legal decision-makers) suggests that ACP is a robust effect in the legal context."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056610847","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"1903-1935","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/299222","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd3d684097077ac1df53ea","name":"Guilherme da Franca Couto Fernandes","lastName":"Almeida","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ee6f35c-eab7-4081-a8ec-63b315bb8f63"},{"objectId":"64cd3d684097077ac1df53e9","name":"Noel","lastName":"Struchiner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8cd7f66-4a5e-43d5-b30d-0ad29a693dd4"},{"objectId":"64cd3d684097077ac1df53e7","name":"Ivar Rodriguez","lastName":"Hannikainen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1089cc67-2251-4abf-8aa0-b5a412f762cb"},{"objectId":"63e1c5b87523404b9db59e3c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Próchnicki","uuid":"2129AE503A56C13100BABE4CF07387FD4F459E23A08B4E13B9E91113BE30484579019E003735AEA47EF0A02D3D6C60645AB3A4B1C46D73F199B7221913EC31A0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d677541a-eb07-4b6d-a0dd-24725461527d"},{"objectId":"5e70932c878c28a0473a4496","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"332AA21A0F5459E761209C70FCB87C4EA32D7F209A4A5B7524FFD612842375D074DF434570865113BD8E941EFC898357402B5B8FF9208242ED74F05356268EA6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89da6a86-15ea-409e-8907-ceacf3d53d51"},{"objectId":"5e70931f878c28a0473a32e7","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bystranowski","uuid":"5EED54D80D8D9CCCECD7FFF4CDBBE60DBCBBB8BBDF49A5CFD91F59FE5EC84A57B6F816749B1FDB09805FA4D0A15FA2D659548043914FBD70CB94997F4FE59952","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f636770-8882-4b84-b75d-d43d048e8e4f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11196-021-09846-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["arts","bibliotherapy","culture","education","grief memoir","healthcare","humanities","lgbtiq+","literature","same-gender partner bereavement","stigma"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Pure Lover and the mature mourner: The literary expression of grief in David Plantes memoir and its cultural, educational, and therapeutic significance","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547cfde","mniswId":"16764","title":"Psychology and Sexuality","doi":null,"issn":"1941-9899","eissn":"1941-9902","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"94ef6e3b-6542-42e2-a037-a64a42c0b023"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618d2a052467f04138f01f35","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709289878c28a047397778"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Among multiple grief narratives published in recent decades, The Pure Lover: A Memoir of Grief (2009) by David Plante stands out in its self-reflective and nonnormative approach to grief.

As such, they can help deconstruct normative viewpoints and promote the cultural significance of the arts in grief support; provide scholars with verifiable literary data to update bereavement concepts and theories, especially in such underexplored areas as bereavement in older LGBTIQ+ adults; boost a more ethical and inclusive approach to grief-stricken patients and clients; and provide a low-triggering bibliotherapeutic tool in bereavement."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056613406","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"996–1009 ","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19419899.2021.1975805","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709289878c28a047397778","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Małecka","uuid":"D6D97B769F6797A6274F1563DB1E500599DE8EED799F69E1B1AB6B583CF918D618A55B4FBE2FAD3B23AD88E2A180EEACB817E46964D9C5E35372B4C42BC24527","orcidId":"0000-0001-5927-3650","documentHash":"bb76f3f1-cc1c-4b9a-8ccc-fdab412838e8"}],"doi":"10.1080/19419899.2021.1975805"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Superconductivity and appearance of negative magnetocaloric effect in $Ba_{1–x}K_xBiO_3$ perovskites, doped by Y, La and Pr","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e14","mniswId":"232","title":"Acta Materialia","doi":null,"issn":"1359-6454","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1ebcb216-5410-4e93-9c52-624b0e79b81b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618d91a72467f04138f356b9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f4744a5752340073806a875","5e709208878c28a04738ee71","673d94b1fdbe832d85dfbb9a","673d94b1fdbe832d85dfbb9b","673d94b1fdbe832d85dfbb9c","673d94b1fdbe832d85dfbb9d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747056613934","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359645421008168/pdfft?md5=556ba794cc7d35b4a7c626cf22d34697&pid=1-s2.0-S1359645421008168-main.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673d94b1fdbe832d85dfbb9d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Krztoń-Maziopa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6fa1fa3d-362c-477e-974e-137b63d1935d"},{"objectId":"673d94b1fdbe832d85dfbb9c","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Szostak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"319efd83-f60c-4651-ad59-ae1ca9919e56"},{"objectId":"673d94b1fdbe832d85dfbb9b","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Łuszczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df4799aa-cfb2-49f5-9a05-1cdd0f078d1d"},{"objectId":"673d94b1fdbe832d85dfbb9a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Pęczkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02196665-5560-45ce-9712-f29377fe0b7a"},{"objectId":"5f4744a5752340073806a875","name":"Naveen Kumar","lastName":"Chogondahalli Muniraju","uuid":"FFD43DD2E87C2CE139DF3C0BC29CFB2D41A2F87BE843640E6F4824916EC071850F4AEC854BD07C2F3146411215CF217954F1FF44B6D9C32031F55F4C081C3C4A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8867-8291","documentHash":"cff5a38c-6d74-4b79-a037-69bb504f9e3f"},{"objectId":"5e709208878c28a04738ee71","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"GONDEK","uuid":"0ACE2B2E95477D20894F70A57E4BD3E89D67479CE1006DE16057FFCA8E4628CF97675747A82F4FA0A5FFE6DFF059943FB29A43D982816D3270C7201DE8549AFF","orcidId":"0000-0002-4149-7944","documentHash":"4ab3cad0-2760-404a-a098-5bc82ab11bcc"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.actamat.2021.117437"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Head and neck","oropharyngeal cancer","radiotherapy","volumetric staging"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","parentUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","rootUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

We analyzed 228 oropharyngeal cancer cases treated at one institution between 2004 and 2014 to compare the predictive value of volumetric staging and tumor nodal metastasis staging system (TNM) and determine whether they could be complementary for the estimation of survival.\r\n\r\nMethods: This retrospective study analyzed 228 consecutive oropharyngeal cancer cases treated with radiotherapy (76.9%) or concurrent radiochemotherapy (23.1%) between 2004 and 2014. The volumetric parameters included primary gross tumor volume (pGTV), metastatic lymph nodes gross tumor volume (nGTV), and total gross tumor volume (tGTV), and were compared with the 7th edition of the TNM staging system.\r\n\r\nResults: Median overall survival (OS) was 30.3 months. In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, tGTV had the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66, followed by pGTV (AUC,0.64), nGTV (AUC 0.62), and TNM (AUC 0.6). The median OS for patients with tGTV ⩽32.2 mL was 40.5 months, compared to 15.4 months for >32.2 mL (p < 0.001). This threshold allowed for a statistically significant difference in survival between TNM stage IV cases with low and high tumor volume (p < 0.001). Despite both TNM and tGTV reaching statistical significance in univariate analysis, only the tGTV remained an independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis (hazard ratio 1.07, confidence interval 1.02-1.12, p = 0.008).\r\n\r\nConclusions: tGTV is an independent prognostic factor, characterized by a higher discriminatory value than the TNM staging system, and can be used to further divide stage IV cases into subgroups with significantly different prognosis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056616141","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"108","pagesFromTo":"586-591","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/HMJFBZGZCSUXHSXPA82X/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6590723b4097076c147ac654","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Lipka-Rajwa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90847a42-5b09-4819-ba3e-fddc906522d6"},{"objectId":"6590723b4097076c147ac653","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Jabłońska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8afdbe76-f055-4741-8db1-87acf609201a"},{"objectId":"6590723b4097076c147ac652","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Staniewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b3b1a686-1e73-4666-946f-22d0658ae9d8"},{"objectId":"6590723b4097076c147ac651","name":"Marcin ","lastName":"Miszczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b8335c4-f166-4bdb-8d9b-68b01e63701c"},{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4dcd","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Tarnawski","uuid":"29545D013EE94D663A15AC097E5623CE6002D5CD359E1E63004D54F675D168534BDE259472C383D84A56FA1090F5262A75FA95202C63BE2F5F1333C38A6C168E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6802-5093","documentHash":"b73b2900-52a0-4ae5-8726-66468023be78"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e4e9","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Stawiski","uuid":"D49D08722769E7724E05C6C0A13B936BFC97FA6FBF4664EDCC9363CA6A1F9AF91607495BF60D83343F624A4DCEAF94AB5EFAF46E13A738975E18A8E4562541D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-6550-3384","documentHash":"19caa457-0e10-4c5d-bf10-01ab90d6460a"}],"doi":"10.1177/03008916211050959"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","uid":"blTedeK8fuVutIuS0UC1hLA","uuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","parentUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","rootUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","name":"Politechnika Krakowska im.

The processes were performed in demineralized and natural river water. The influence of various reaction parameters on the removal degree was checked. Both, photolysis under VIS light and photosensitized oxidation of target compounds are very low-efficient processes. Ozonation and degradation in H2O2/UV system are effective methods for ibuprofen derivatives degradation. Components present in river water reduced removal degree of investigated compounds during ozonation and degradation in H2O2/UV system. The biodegradability assessment using the Average Oxidation State (AOS) and COD/TOC ratio proved the formation of more oxidized by-products during both processes. The determined second-order rate constants for ozone reaction with 1OHIBF, 4EBA and MPPE are 0.1 ± 0.01, 10.95 ± 1.36 and 3.04 ± 0.33 M-1 s-1, respectively. The calculated reaction rate constants of hydroxyl radicals with MPPE, 4EBA and 1OHIBF are 3.57 × 109, 6.83 × 109 and 1.06 × 109 M-1 s-1,

As a result of the study, the authors concluded that there is a basis for but also a need to apply a coordinated balance sheet approach to local asset and debt management using a strategic approach. It is also possible to introduce the ALM concept by using information and data from current budget and financial reporting, which should contribute to more efficient management activities and greater effectiveness in decision-making by the local authorities.

Among those methods that do not demand any such additional data, we differentiate between two approaches that rely on (i) external criteria, that is, comparisons of sample estimates to benchmarks derived from external population statistics, and (ii) internal criteria, that is, comparisons of subsample estimates to a theoretically derived aprioristic value. Our analyses demonstrate the advantages and limitations of both approaches based on an evaluation of 1,125 national surveys carried out in Europe between 2002 and 2016 within four survey projects: the Eurobarometer, European Quality of Life Survey, European Social Survey, and International Social Survey Programme. We show that the prevailing absence of design weights in cross-national survey datasets severely limits the applicability of external criteria evaluations. In contrast, using internal criteria without any weights proves acceptable because incorporating design weights in calculations of internal sample quality has only minor consequences for estimates of sample bias. Furthermore, applying internal criteria, we find that around 75 percent of samples in the four analyzed projects are not significantly biased. We also identify surveys with extremely high sample bias and investigate its potential sources. The paper concludes with recommendations regarding future research, which are directed at secondary data users, as well as producers of cross-national surveys.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747056623209","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"316-339","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/jssam/article/11/2/316/6380639","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659097064097076c147bb051","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kołczyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af60fef8-672e-4431-bd5c-c93a117a5fb7"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fc49","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Cichocki","uuid":"94514F9310CF187F7A14C34E602567B1EF245AE917A810878A38948C24E20FCF305E367B3BB422162950CEBE960409C88E89A287DBFC85E48E246FE38458DA6B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6501-9082","documentHash":"dea86976-5c83-426a-9eec-753ef2ddb72b"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e9a2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jabkowski","uuid":"43E1E065B6AB60C08B8772A78CD8B58B2A534B1BFE52222847847E5CA79DDE7BF4BA330E2D42CF58B6B21D8DD1DD38866BAEA637F6B3D6EB8C41AA99439D0213","orcidId":"0000-0002-8650-9558","documentHash":"5d94f52f-d3a5-45f8-b4b5-5b9f7fb7d63f"}],"doi":"10.1093/jssam/smab027"},{"mainLanguageName":"francuski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Waluty","finanse","rozwój"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Currencies","finance","developments"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-614-8019-76-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka

new method of preparation of aqueous electrolyte baths for electrochemical deposition of nickel targets for medical accelerators is presented. It starts with fast dissolution of metallic Ni powder in a HNO3-free solvent. Such obtained raw solution does not require additional treatment aimed to removal nitrates, such as the acid evaporation and Ni salt precipitation-dissolution. It is used directly for preparation of the nickel plating baths after dilution with water, setting up pH value and after possible addition of H3BO3. The pH of the baths ranges from alkaline to acidic. Deposition of 95% of ca. 50 mg of Ni dissolved in the bath takes ca. 3.5 h for the alkaline electrolyte while for the acidic solution it requires ca. 7 h. The Ni deposits obtained from the acidic bath are physically and chemically more stable and possess smoother and crack-free surfaces as compared to the coatings deposited from the alkaline bath. A method of estimation of concentration of H2O2 in the electrolytic bath is also proposed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056654370","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dd6bb62467f047f3adb432","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"26","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"0f6407e0-54da-401c-882b-29809ae3938c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"431-447","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10008-021-05084-9.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"618e99542467f022516a475e","name":"M.","lastName":"Próchniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2326-5242","documentHash":"d854f17b-60f9-470b-8f46-d1c02a0d02df"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b18a5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Grdeń","uuid":"29B853592821B776FA01B009BC89A857A7290C9E8C2C5C41D510D73DC754E56E239482374156E79398A6DD59D0174E08804114D5D0CC2AF8FFBE9611A87E8860","orcidId":"0000-0002-5208-5822","documentHash":"abe74a6e-b120-4fbb-b803-453aeb665394"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10008-021-05084-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["autobiography","autothanatography","collage","experimental literature","fear of death","fragment"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c2878c28a0473b05ab"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Collage autothanatographies. David Markson’s Reader’s Block quartet and Evan Lavender-Smith’s From Old Notebooks","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b1f4","mniswId":"15521","title":"Orbis Litterarum","doi":null,"issn":"0105-7510","eissn":"1600-0730","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"43711188-60d4-4837-b3c6-2384dbce3de5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618fdacd2467f001986b27d4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c2878c28a0473b05ab"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article argues that David Markson’s four last works, often referred to as a quartet or a tetralogy (1996–2007), and Evan Lavender-Smith’s <i>From Old Notebooks</i> (2010) can be classified as collage autothanatographies. Both authors construct their formally experimental books out of brief snippets that combine personal meditations on death with various facts, anecdotes, and self-reflexive comments. What grants those fragmentary texts a degree of unity is their concern with mortality: the refrain “<i>timor mortis conturbat me</i>” reverberates throughout Markson’s tetralogy while Lavender-Smith’s narrator announces that “death is the glue that holds the book together.” The article begins with an examination of the collage structure of both works.

The cinnamaldehyde (CAL), furfural (FU) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were hydrogenated under mild reaction conditions. The formation of hydrogen bronzes in Pd/WO3 and physical mixture of Pd/WO3 with supporting WO3 oxide upon exposure to H2 was also studied using the gas flow-through microcalorimetry. In both Pd/MoO3 and Pd/WO3 catalysts, the electronic interactions contributed to the promotion of selectivity toward the Cdouble bondO hydrogenation in CAL and FU, yet in Pd/MoO3 this effect was much more pronounced. On the other hand, apart from increasing the overall reaction rate, the formation of hydrogen bronzes remarkably enhances the Cdouble bondC hydrogenation in CAL, as well as the decarbonylation of FU to furan and hydrogenolysis of C–OH in HMF to 5-methylfurfural. The bronze effects are significantly stronger in HxWO3, compared to HxMoO3, which may be related to higher H-species mobility and weaker H-bonding in the W–O–H (54 kJ/mol H2) than in the Mo–O–H (100 kJ/mol H2). This may also explain very high tendency of Pd/WO3 to furan ring hydrogenation in FU and HMF as well as almost selective (>98%) hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056660256","journalIssue":{"objectId":"625568662467f052bcaafae2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"4","number":"47","doi":"","documentHash":"9093330a-5617-4e91-b35e-1d45fcd27218"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"2347-2365","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0360319921042191?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"619192f62467f0782cdbe6f4","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kołodziej","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5745-9742","documentHash":"c273c817-5431-4e4f-a188-6efa96fd9b3b"},{"objectId":"5e70948c878c28a0473bf598","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mordarski","uuid":"6958F6E0AC75E336B75C1972D8135E90C2BE64CD343A7A3405FDF2741D8D95A3786A12BAD43132D6BAFF13E2788C69054E3126BF84EDBDB259FF95637AB56584","orcidId":"0000-0002-6832-2685","documentHash":"4fd29d70-0188-47d3-aa3e-715ca732b605"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f1d","name":"Erwin","lastName":"Lalik","uuid":"BE45AD9292B7F2606D86E40AB3540E03B484CEF34164B001C2B5C4ACE11EB9889C998C84A357DC29B5FB1B1D3F277C85AD772E9FF6F45F9EAB2F0A7CFBA01149","orcidId":"0000-0003-4191-9710","documentHash":"240cd03a-2ec4-480d-8453-d6a47fcf7718"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f0e","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kosydar","uuid":"128B68BC574A686A64A18BB1A5E8F0D7A9D8652E8C51BB8E955B7072A58EC31F43BC3EF33BEFF4B2B6FBBF97400FAFFD04DFB5A836047C3F0EFC7BC04ACFD075","orcidId":"0000-0002-7666-9806","documentHash":"97dedfbd-b5f5-4444-bc6e-d4aa2fb28f31"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397dc0","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Gurgul","uuid":"3AADA009D6D852B8B4A1226CFD889C391FE18DBBBECB348250859F37FB90D182D8FD4077550CC9FBC3780E9FEB0B7D31CF82BEF465A19C5A4FC91FF983908A88","orcidId":"0000-0002-8001-145X","documentHash":"be547f86-3928-4b2d-acbb-6339e0605546"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979df","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Drelinkiewicz","uuid":"3AC9726236014C2B0AD10DE5C0917FA1562C2867C9048692EFDD2A4DDE70701C49AC03707DCF4F4491EF55633BE8F746DE8D6FB76B36240823A6521194151791","orcidId":"0000-0001-7649-2118","documentHash":"c3e490aa-f4fa-4f97-8872-300b5b4bec35"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2021.10.162"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Camouflage","Genetic

studied the relationship between the variability and contemporary distribution of pelage phenotypes in one of most widely distributed felid species and an array of environmental and demographic conditions. We collected 672 photographic georeferenced records of the Eurasian lynx throughout Eurasia. We assigned each lynx coat to one of five phenotypes. Then we fitted the coat patterns to different environmental and anthropogenic variables, as well as the effective geographic distances from inferred glacial refugia. A majority of lynx were either of the large spotted (41.5%) or unspotted (uniform, 36.2%) phenotype. The remaining patterns (rosettes, small spots and pseudo-rosettes) were represented in 11.0%, 7.4%, and 3.9% of samples, respectively. Although various environmental variables greatly affected lynx distribution and habitat suitability, it was the effect of least-cost distances from locations of the inferred refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum that explained the distribution of lynx coat patterns the best. Whereas the occurrence of lynx phenotypes with large spots was explained by the proximity to refugia located in the Caucasus/Middle East, the uniform phenotype was associated with refugia in the Far East and Central Asia. Despite the widely accepted hypothesis of adaptive functionality of coat patterns in mammals and exceptionally high phenotypic polymorphism in Eurasian lynx, we did not find well-defined signs of habitat matching in the coat pattern of this species. Instead, we showed how the global patterns of morphological variability in this large mammal and its environmental adaptations may have been shaped by past climatic change."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056663357","journalIssue":{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fdf","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f3af62ae-5f50-47a4-9df4-9025e0b3c9aa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10914-021-09580-7.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fdb","name":"Tomáš","lastName":"Jászay","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a307f9b6-458d-4953-b290-66727fe54077"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fda","name":"Jose A.","lastName":"Godoy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f3b1519-dfa1-4574-ab12-d456c258ffab"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd9","name":"Mohammad S.","lastName":"Farhadinia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0d3618c7-f666-4d77-a968-f6c5cb036f8d"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd8","name":"Alim B.","lastName":"Pkhitikov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46946b18-7948-4f53-bbff-2f6298ba1165"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd7","name":"Sergey A.","lastName":"Trepet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c409dc24-7942-4930-b06b-ddcb494cf953"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd6","name":"Mehmet Kürşat","lastName":"Şahin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"342dc207-cfd6-4582-9c8e-23ce0f28ead8"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd5","name":"Vazha","lastName":"Kochiashvili","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd8d9c55-7371-4863-81b5-c12522cf7722"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd4","name":"Giorgi","lastName":"Sulamanidze","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f6ea7f6-8d42-4d15-bd2f-38cc62e2b419"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd3","name":"Muzigit I.","lastName":"Akkiev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6cef3720-86dc-4853-a891-b2cef8556819"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd2","name":"Yuriy A.","lastName":"Yarovenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7d3d9e8a-7836-496c-bc3d-2aa04e59051d"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd1","name":"Jimsher","lastName":"Mamuchadze","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4add488d-a2e7-44ed-906e-7057ed4c59f8"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fd0","name":"Innokentiy","lastName":"Okhlopkov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"42056563-828b-4577-97f7-7074d951619c"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fcf","name":"Naranbaatar","lastName":"Galsandorj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"907b068a-7d1d-47b7-88de-670d358dbc89"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fce","name":"Mikhail G.","lastName":"Dvornikov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c91d0b57-804e-4a3e-b2cb-4d78631aa7fa"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fcd","name":"Bledi","lastName":"Hoxha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e58f92d1-b80d-47a5-afaf-3149d286cf9f"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fcc","name":"Aleksandër","lastName":"Trajçe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05b089b8-da4c-40e8-8c7c-6ea9479967c8"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fcb","name":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Stojanov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8559866-9b1f-4d89-9194-bc7c89aec5a2"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fca","name":"Dime","lastName":"Melovski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9152737a-6f87-4874-9d0b-94400b9f8af9"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fc9","name":"Igor","lastName":"Khorozyan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8418f74-3853-420a-b761-91ac00c34ab5"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fc8","name":"Peep","lastName":"Männil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e9e2c7f-d133-4040-be82-b4ce5cc7745c"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fc7","name":"Janis","lastName":"Ozolins","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"838e4de7-5e06-44a9-a656-e33603fbe972"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fc6","name":"Aivars","lastName":"Ornicans","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a7a7a5c9-38aa-4d5e-9004-4a3abe8d5af8"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fc5","name":"Guna","lastName":"Bagrade","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1468a8c0-4c9a-4def-966a-80682c61c35c"},{"objectId":"619364592467f07011af7fc3","name":"John D.

The ability to accumulate cadmium depends on genetic, anatomical and physiological characteristics of the varieties. The published data show that the level of fertilization affects many metabolic pathways, the development of plants and cannabinoid concentration. In addition, there are inconsistent data on the cadmium accumulation capacity depending on the mineral nutrition and pH. A study was carried out to assess the potential of two hemp varieties (‘Henola’ and ‘Białobrzeskie’) as a decontaminator of cadmium, depending on soil pH and phosphorous fertilizer level. The influence of pH, fertilization and cadmium concentration in the soil on plant morphology and on the yield of seeds and biomass were also assessed. The soil with two different pH was used in the experiment: acidic (pH 4) and alkaline (pH 7.5). Two concentrations of aqueous solution of cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2) were added to the soil to obtain final concentration of Cd: 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg of soil, respectively. The phosphorous fertilizer was supplied in the amounts of: 50 kg/ha, 100 kg/ha, 150 kg/ha. The cadmium content in soil and in hemp plants was determined with a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry and a plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), respectively. Based on two years of experiments, the highest cadmium concentration in seeds and biomass, were revealed for Henola variety, when fertilizer was applied in the amount of 150 kg/ha. The results revealed that the fertilization ant pH level are important factors in the cultivation of hemp. They affect the intensity of cadmium uptake from the soil. Higher soil pH was correlated with the highest concentration of Cd in seeds and straw of Białobrzeskie variety. Such a relationship has not been demonstrated in the case of the Henola variety. The highest BCF (bioconcentration factor) value was calculated for Cd uptake in ‘Henola’ biomass. Increased cadmium concentration in the soil did not adversely affect development and growth of two hemp varieties studied. The phytoremediation potential of individual hemp varieties is different. Higher pH increases the cadmium uptake by some hemp varieties, but in the case of other varieties this relationship is reversed. It is necessary to assess the phytoremediation potential of each hemp cultivar in different agrotechnical conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056666732","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61926c452467f06c223e1a23","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"175","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"2feb1938-5352-4c0b-94b7-8652c8e61ea3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"175","pagesFromTo":"art.

landscapes have changed substantially in recent decades, shifting from the dominance of small fields (S) with diverse cropping systems toward large-scale monoculture (L), where landscape heterogeneity disappears. In this study, artificial nests of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, were placed in S and L landscape types on the perimeter of oilseed rape fields representing different oilseed rape coverages (ORC, % land cover). The local landscape structure around each nest was characterised within a 100, 200, 500, and 1000 m radius using ORC and 14 landscape characteristics, which were then reduced by non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) to two axes: nMDS1 characterised the dataset primarily according to land fragmentation and the main crop, whereas nMDS2 captured the prevalence of more natural areas in the landscape. Pollen diversity and insecticide risk levels in the pollen provisions collected by the bees were analysed, and their dependence on the landscape structure was tested. Thereafter, the effects of pollen diversity, insecticide risk, and landscape structure on the life-history traits of bees and their sensitivity to topically applied Dursban 480 EC were determined. Pollen taxa richness in a single nest ranged from 3 to 12, and 34 pesticides were detected in the pollen at concentrations of up to 320 ng/g for desmedipham. The O. bicornis foraging range was relatively large, indicating that the landscape structure within a radius of ~1000 m around the nest is important for this species. Pollen diversity in the studied areas was of minor importance for bee performance, but the ORC or landscape structure significantly affected the life-history traits of the bees. Contamination of pollen with insecticides affected the bees by decreasing the mass of newly emerged adults but their sensitivity to Dursban 480 EC was not related to environmental variables."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056666932","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"809","pagesFromTo":"151142","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/287910","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd2c8c4097077ac1dce983","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kocjan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13feec81-ba19-45e1-ab9c-3c680dc8fb55"},{"objectId":"64cd2c8c4097077ac1dce982","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wnęk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9d973495-eb6c-4cb8-ba39-3ed5bd37b9bd"},{"objectId":"64cd2c8c4097077ac1dce981","name":"Jayasravanthi","lastName":"Mokkapati","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8e4303b-0ca1-4eaa-a673-fa6a4f93ee01"},{"objectId":"64cd2c8c4097077ac1dce980","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Teper","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e98c81d0-3a49-4598-bdef-5b6bf885d0a7"},{"objectId":"64cd2c8c4097077ac1dce97f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kaczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"016db0da-d06b-4c58-aacd-2258441ea760"},{"objectId":"64cd2c8c4097077ac1dce97e","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Łozowicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3796856c-37ea-49cd-9614-45cf681074ba"},{"objectId":"5e709496878c28a0473c0055","name":"Renata","lastName":"Śliwińska","uuid":"AD9C396A85CD6DF9393CFF75020A133455967E3BF953DE74CD9AC439B775D660CB7DDD211AD0926B562DDC64E71810932BC48EBBD828AD241DB551F7E4550DE4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfe82e52-dc2e-405d-8603-45043d49200d"},{"objectId":"5e70944e878c28a0473ba2c5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"7BD4FF97BA94C0FB47D96CFFF734D3B84F1469C4196405E5269F6B4740B867B6809B6D307F7B5DC6BC061E5715CC85C599687CD9DE3A6B9401D28F155CD859B8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56ebb002-d22c-4ce8-90c4-3103b9f986eb"},{"objectId":"5e709319878c28a0473a2cd0","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Ziółkowska","uuid":"51892CE28E27A15FE63B24D8A5873F76093DDA0920F7BC4E7FE2A71AE99F173B912425E38D7847EEBDA452296F83307076CCC645CAC33C8D7E1066212767C949","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"388165fe-4e3e-4d85-8281-0eb80639f9bb"},{"objectId":"5e709317878c28a0473a2bba","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Bednarska","uuid":"AF5EE5B1442BE91E591692A38FB891CA1880428E5EE3FA988859A3C9F5AF79E89A1693D250ECD5211D0A5C07627FE63F5D52BE9DBF3B5713DD5019569DB8918A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1030-3414","documentHash":"8de1b39a-8585-4e64-93de-7800782e836d"},{"objectId":"5e709313878c28a0473a26e6","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Laskowski","uuid":"B92E4A0F0BEE1C155BB05912B78329B036F90CAEB384D3D38A51BA36599EEFA2B4ED07540AE0E85FA1001E86AC0FB546C734B9A16A6987FC094B3E5975917C25","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4d5156a-4cf2-4eb2-a426-8b9ae3f13439"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151142"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1a","uid":"bo-gzHUCaPNoq216Hhf4uRQ","uuid":"04d8f337-6a41-4c73-b0ee-a3f1a9293995","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Informatyki i Mechaniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a793c"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739db68"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A non-standard discretized SIS model of epidemics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478dac","mniswId":"14016","title":"Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"1547-1063","eissn":"1551-0018","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2ab03032-90bb-42f6-a17f-9d434b427e2e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61940c2b2467f0303655ff37","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d6878c28a04739db68","61a222a82467f013cce2ae03","5e709356878c28a0473a793c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">&lt;abstract&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this paper we introduce and analyze a non-standard discretized SIS epidemic model for a homogeneous population.

Firstly, we discuss basic properties of the discrete system. In particular, boundedness of variables and positivity of solutions of the system are investigated. Then we focus on stability of stationary states. Results for the disease-free stationary state are depicted with the use of a basic reproduction number computed for the system. For this state we also manage to prove its global stability for a given condition. It transpires that the behavior of the disease-free state is the same as its behavior in the analogous continuous system. In case of the endemic stationary state, however, the results are presented with respect to a step size of discretization. Local stability of this state is guaranteed for a sufficiently small critical value of the step size. We also conduct numerical simulations confirming theoretical results about boundedness of variables and global stability of the disease-free state of the analyzed system. Furthermore, the simulations ascertain a possibility of appearance of Neimark-Sacker bifurcation for the endemic state. As a bifurcation parameter the step size of discretization is chosen.

The combination of AgNPs with bioactive substances, such as antioxidants, can lead to the development of new systems of desired anticancer properties. In this research, AgNPs were prepared with the use of diverse antioxidant combinations including gallic acid (GA), (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and caffeine (CAF). The insightful physicochemical characteristic revealed that each type of AgNPs exhibited spherical shape, comparable size distribution and negative surface charge. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) delivered the information about the chemistry of AgNP stabilizing layers, which turned out to be a crucial factor tuning toxicity of AgNPs toward murine B16 melanoma cells (B16-F0) and human skin melanoma (COLO 679) cells. EGCGAgNPs were the most cytotoxic among all the investigated AgNPs. They strongly reduced the activity of mitochondria, damaged cell membrane integrity, and penetrated inside the cells causing DNA damage. In turn, the toxicity of GAAgNPs strongly manifested via the induction of oxidative stress in the cells.

Polish energy market heavily relies on coal. Pressured by the European Union, the Polish government has recently decided to accelerate coal phase-out and to gradually shut down all coal mines by 2049. In that context, it is necessary to assess the Polish energy market’s state regarding energy efficiency, especially in the building stock. This paper aims to provide an overview of the current state of energy efficiency of residential buildings in Poland and insights into its future trends. A literature review was conducted, accompanied by focus group discussions with Polish building energy efficiency experts. The Polish energy sector is under a remarkable transformation that may be going too fast. A large gap between expectations, practices, and requirements can be observed. Raising awareness and  capacity building in  the  energy efficiency sector, and  a  set  of  accessible guidelines should be developed so that the transformation is implemented correctly. A SWOT analysis results define the key opportunities and threats that are critical to meet net-zero emissions goals.

The integrated datasets from the application of two geophysical methods, of which one is the standard magnetic method used on sites in the Nile Valley and the other ground-penetrating radar, enhanced the archaeological interpretation, focused in this case on a reconstruction of the urban layout of the 16th–18th-century Funj settlement within the walls of the Dongola Citadel. The magnetic method, the effectiveness of which has gone unquestioned with regard to the study of silt architecture in the Nile valley, was successful in mapping the general outline of the settlement on the Citadel hill and in the quarter north of the walls. The GPR survey (450-MHz antenna) provided a much more detailed image of the street grid and was much more effective than the magnetic method in tracing the course of mud-brick walls in a sandy matrix containing baked brick rubble. Verification of the geophysical results through the excavation of selected parts of the Citadel not only satisfied the objectives of the archaeological project, which was to establish the overall street and building layout in the research area, but also confirmed the effectiveness of the two prospection methods applied in combination and the potential of integrated research with the use of the GPR and magnetic methods for the study of mud-brick and baked brick architecture on settlement sites in Sudan."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056679003","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63eb93554097075ca514ee0d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"29","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"b9f27056-5655-4e2f-a52e-6d969544f370"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"259-273","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/arp.1850","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e0878c28a0473c5dfb","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ryndziewicz","uuid":"1435280B0C5446C12167C217EE3030F7F75760F09F2BACC18433924B6001C0B2FF01972B1248A950879EB1708CF46A58C38B3A75CCFCB4BB74853CA4DAF5420B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8443-8362","documentHash":"53683877-7dd8-4f06-8a0c-5e34f40a5e9b"},{"objectId":"5e70948e878c28a0473bf88b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Herbich","uuid":"3E6B3C1E7A9699F8E841C139A8FB79E12EF5EEED01EA4EF0BA428E68A1407BD0D923E3A2D5B092A7F2B9ACA900FF82513E1E968779E1C575B41D0279AB0AA037","orcidId":"0000-0003-1037-1246","documentHash":"353384b2-93aa-4bfb-991a-78eb227a6ff0"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af92a","name":"Artur","lastName":"Obłuski","uuid":"086AC8980F8E6AC8972C0A66638D70001D660570099EED206AB86EC945C7EE47ECC3652E11BD1795837ADDAAFFC51D9078DEF0D54FD224CCBD24F43AFB3ABE0A","orcidId":"0000-0001-8527-3523","documentHash":"26f33f4d-5ebe-46d1-a389-6830813b45a7"}],"doi":"10.1002/arp.1850"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["assessment","child maltreatment","child protection","child safeguarding","child welfare","collaboration","decision making","family work","partnership","professional judgement","risk","risk assessment","risk communication","social welfare","social work","Poland"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cooperation in child welfare decision making : qualitative vignette study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547aa76","mniswId":"21551","title":"Child Care in Practice","doi":null,"issn":"1357-5279","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"85c5811a-5ed3-4a3a-a721-92cdf532dfc1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6192d5f72467f00198a4633a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b0c","65f2e0eb4097076263daab77"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Many social work decisions are the outcome of collaborative working with other professionals and organisations, although there is little study of these decision-making processes. In this qualitative study conducted in Poland, the frame of reference was social work practice experience rather than a theoretical model. A vignette was presented to five respondents from each of nine groups of workers who have roles in child welfare decision making: counsellors, family assistants, family judges, family mediators, police officers, probation officers, school teachers, social workers, and voluntary probation officers. Qualitative data were gathered through interviewing respondents about the vignette. Two themes from the study related primarily to the assessment process and individual judgement prior to actual partnership engagement: “Reaching beyond the presenting problem”, and “Framing the decision through problem identification”. Two other themes related to early stages of engaging with another organisation: “Clarifying responsibilities with other organisations”, and “Using the diagnosis of another organization”. The fifth and final theme related to work required to help the family: “Identification of ‘the one big problem’”. There seemed to be some reluctance to own responsibility for addressing a problem faced by the family. The themes were analysed using elements of risk communication and collaboration theory. The study highlights the need for leadership in partnership working built on an understanding of the realities of the practice environment and the specific responsibilities of each profession and organisation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056684487","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"137-152","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13575279.2019.1701412","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65f2e0eb4097076263daab77","name":"Brian J.","lastName":"Taylor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4cb558cc-86b2-4a56-b41f-774edab3992e"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b0c","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Przeperski","uuid":"C4DDD5A7116BF947AD9E09B6F0278478D90039A82EC1CA373A07F924075919636F03611D0A4889ECDCA9E02E603554CAC472F3869A2436F9F1E8D507C77ED360","orcidId":"0000-0002-5362-4170","documentHash":"9e52d527-8ef6-4460-8e68-06f669b2c65a"}],"doi":"10.1080/13575279.2019.1701412"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Research by design","Integrated water management","Planning practice","Spatial planning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The potential of the research by design method in balancing water problems: An integrated water and space management program for a part of the Warsaw agglomeration","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547766a","mniswId":"3717","title":"Cities","doi":null,"issn":"0264-2751","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c7cddcb5-58e1-4ef5-8c54-81950139bb90"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6183d1872467f038354f5315","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b5b","6183d1872467f038354f5317","6183d1872467f038354f5318","6183d1872467f038354f5319","6183d1872467f038354f531a","6183d1872467f038354f531b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The need for integrated water management is no longer just a declared ideal which is currently being promoted but an increasingly perceptible challenge – even more so along with noticeable climate changes. Therefore, searching for methods to streamline and improve research and implementing solutions for solving water and spatial problems is the need of the moment. This search is essential in those countries that do not quickly and effectively implement adopted national and regional policies and regulations at the local level, and this applies among others to Poland. Our study proposes using the research by design method to identify optimal water and space management scenarios in a problematic area – the Kampinos National Park and its surroundings, located in the Warsaw agglomeration. We describe how we used this method, and first and foremost, its essence. We propose using the research by design method as an advanced planning tool, drawing attention to the advantages but also some inconveniences related to its use. The approach presented in this article and the method adopted can be applied in other places with complex water management problems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056686706","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"121","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275121003541","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6183d1872467f038354f531b","name":"Adam","lastName":"Pyjor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"575ecbfc-e51d-4c65-8c7e-37aa9e1c668d"},{"objectId":"6183d1872467f038354f531a","name":"Bartosik","lastName":"Zbigniew","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c5a4cbd-decf-472d-bc74-80a9d3ade986"},{"objectId":"6183d1872467f038354f5319","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Solarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e52f354c-ade5-4218-a4b9-60128a295409"},{"objectId":"6183d1872467f038354f5318","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Mierzwicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a5496213-c815-4b87-996e-acdc33d45361"},{"objectId":"6183d1872467f038354f5317","name":"Artur","lastName":"Pudełko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77d5d912-262b-40a5-83a5-0a65db2d9746"},{"objectId":"5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b5b","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Solarek","uuid":"88C00A354A0D1C3499BBA9FAD4EB86E3F56A090698AEDCBDC11F9043E6F5A7C02534708C94CC56AE6D82ADE852B17B4710C80FE320B3258252CFA723A416342F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1993-2505","documentHash":"c660c3c1-dec4-47be-9765-960f17e390bd"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cities.2021.103455"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fluorine","HR-CS","Molecular absorption spectrometry","CaF","Gasoline","Alkylation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Calcium monofluoride as a target molecule for determination of organic fluorine in gasoline and its components using high-resolution continuum source flame molecular absorption spectrometry","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d7a","mniswId":"6898","title":"Fuel","doi":null,"issn":"0016-2361","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d4ae314e-1a3b-4521-be1a-8b1df1d6bf7c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6183d34c2467f038354f7948","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709419878c28a0473b6306","5e7093ea878c28a0473b32a9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"High-resolution continuum source molecular absorption spectrometry (HR-CS MAS) is widely applied to determine fluorine in various materials, and its graphite furnace option with calcium monofluoride as a target molecule is popular. However, up to now, the idea of using the molecule in flame molecular absorption spectrometry seemed impossible or impractical due to the expected low sensitivity and detectability. The following paper completely changes this view. The CaF molecule has been proven to be an excellent tool for determining organic fluorine in gasoline using flame molecular absorption spectrometry, giving benefits over previously used gallium monofluoride. The following favourable circumstances decide about it: 1) relatively high population of CaF molecules in preferable air-acetylene flame, 2) possibility of using oil calcium “standard” as a source of calcium, which is well dissoluble in both xylene (solvent) and gasoline, 3) extremely good stability of baseline in the used spectrum range, 4) relatively high freedom from spectral and chemical interferences and 5) possibility of summing of many pixels response. The analysis relies on simple sample dilution in xylene, with the addition of oil calcium “standard” to obtain 1500 mg L−1 Ca in measured solutions. Simplified standard addition calibration is used to overcome the effect of variability of samples (various physical properties and combustion characteristics). The signals of four CaF rotational “lines” are summed. The only undesirable spectral effect is a molecular absorption at the second “line” (606.0368 nm), which is attributed to the absorption by the CaOH molecule formed in the flame. The effect can be easily overcome by using the least square background correction, LSBC. The characteristic concentration and the detection limit for solutions are 6 and 0.6 mg L−1, respectively. The detection limit recalculated for the original sample is 2 mg kg−1 in the case of alkalyte, reformate and gasoline, while it is 6 mg kg−1 in the case of volatile isomerizate, mainly due to necessary higher sample dilution. The calibration curve is linear over at least two orders of magnitude. Heptafluorobutanol has been found a suitable standard. The agreement of the results of the proposed method and standard combustion ion chromatography is satisfactory."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056686916","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"309","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236121020731?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b6306","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Kowalewska","uuid":"6AE1A2F6AF24BBA5FA7354A50209FEF9862FF7DB6E74D36F1AEC3D41B1FC7C35B79803CD4D48EB028726FBEBB828E585B99FF03F84F06FAF99BC4D49E44CA9CC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2093-4161","documentHash":"3ee4eac7-f9dd-40fa-89ef-8f777fe5c2e0"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b32a9","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Brzezińska","uuid":"84BD4FB61B7906BF77BDFC749B9BB5000AB25E743C6A1A125A5B781965CE6CA44E7A016BBFADB72CFEC5893637732EF46DE195A8D37D7E08CA2F3C33AB3917A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-2297-3554","documentHash":"94c2e29c-172d-4b32-818c-2d7e58d7eee9"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.fuel.2021.122197"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1NjY4NjkxNg=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
