The energy model for electric vehicles shows high accuracy and versatility, requiring vehicle velocity and acceleration as input data to predict energy consumption. This research article also provides recommendations for the energy modeling of electric vehicles and outlines additional steps for model development. The implemented methodological approach and its results can be used by transport decision-makers to plan new transport policies in Italian cities aimed at optimizing vehicle charging infrastructure. They can also help vehicle users accurately estimate energy consumption, generate maps, and identify locations with the highest energy consumption."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945050","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd176bfdbe836fcb7ad876","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"19","doi":null,"documentHash":"9dcad991-6c59-45c1-91d8-163286b133dc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/19/4913","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc5efdbe83317426296c","name":"Tiziana","lastName":"Campisi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1765e3b0-5dbc-4e3e-9d4e-5fd37ea3f9c7"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c478","name":"Maksymilian","lastName":"Mądziel","uuid":"D0D9ACBEC38E6B6F30464D84A61138751DAE4EE50BC4079F9038E346E6BA07D2B57D57D635DDAF889D8E201707A8160D8D855832C1E45C9A391840A6FD405181","orcidId":"0000-0002-3957-8294","documentHash":"ae9ec52f-e3af-4211-81f9-1faf88e143a1"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17194913"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["renewable energy","environmental sustainability","emission reduction","Environmental degradation","Poland"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Besides, Poland is the only EuropeanUnion (EU) country lacking a climate neutrality objective and policyinstruments to mitigate ecological concerns. The AutoregressiveDistributed Lag (ARDL) bounds model and the Dynamic Ordinary LeastSquares (DOLS) procedure evaluated yearly data from 1990 to 2018. Theempirical outcomes of the DOLS point out that economic growth andfossil fuel energy use enhance GHG emissions despite reducing the loadcapacity factor in Poland. Instead, renewable power, globalisation,technological innovation, and forest cover might help to reduce GHGemissions and enhance the load capacity factor in Poland.

This study analyzed data from road tests and the OBDII diagnostic interface, focusing on CO2, CO, THC, and NOx emissions under both cold and warm engine conditions. The key results showed that random forest regression provided the best predictions for THC in a cold engine (R2: 0.76), while polynomial regression excelled for CO2 (R2: 0.93). For warm engines, polynomial regression performed best for CO2 (R2: 0.95), and gradient boosting delivered results for THC (R2: 0.66). Although prediction accuracy varied by emission compound and engine state, the models consistently demonstrated high precision, offering a robust tool for managing emissions from aging vehicle fleets. These models offer valuable information for transportation policy and pollution reduction strategies, particularly in urban areas."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945054","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd176bfdbe836fcb7ad876","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"19","doi":null,"documentHash":"9dcad991-6c59-45c1-91d8-163286b133dc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/19/4924","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c478","name":"Maksymilian","lastName":"Mądziel","uuid":"D0D9ACBEC38E6B6F30464D84A61138751DAE4EE50BC4079F9038E346E6BA07D2B57D57D635DDAF889D8E201707A8160D8D855832C1E45C9A391840A6FD405181","orcidId":"0000-0002-3957-8294","documentHash":"ae9ec52f-e3af-4211-81f9-1faf88e143a1"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17194924"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Heterogeneous material","StepScan mode","Rubber composite","Modulated temperature","Specific heat capacity"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Reducing energy consumption in public transport can be achieved through better organisation of the transport system, changes in infrastructure, the use of new energy-efficient means of transport, and other ways to achieve intelligent mobility. The operation of a city bus involves frequent stops. These stops are due to the need to exchange passengers at bus stops and traffic conditions. Each stop and the subsequent acceleration process require additional energy consumption. In this paper, an analysis of bus operation within the Rzeszów ITS on a selected route is carried out to determine the energy consumption in these special modes. First, the number and duration of stops were determined based on data recorded during the bus operation using the tracker. Then, taking into account the idle fuel consumption and the energy consumption required to reach a set speed, the total energy consumption associated with the stops was determined. The results obtained on the selected route indicate a significant share of energy associated with stops at bus stops and outside bus stops in total fuel consumption. These shares are about 26.2% and about 42.5%, respectively. The opportunity to improve the energy efficiency of the city bus on the route due to the reduction of stops at bus stops by introducing on-demand stops as one of the elements of ITS has been evaluated.

This study introduces an eco-friendly and cost-effective approach for synthesizing Al2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) using extracts derived from the leaves of Calligonum comosum L. The primary objective of this investigation is to assess the photocatalytic efficacy of the synthesized catalyst in addressing organic pollutants. The Al2O3 NPs exhibit a spherical morphology with crystalline arrangements, as evidenced by an average crystallite size of 25.1 nm in the XRD analysis. The band gap energy of the Al2O3 NPs is determined to be 2.86 eV. In terms of mechanical properties, the Al2O3 NPs show significant potential in enhancing both flexural and compressive properties, thereby making them a viable choice for improving the mechanical performance of composites. Notably, the Young’s modulus of the hybrid composite (comprising plant material and Al2O3 NPs) exhibits a remarkable increase of 34.4% in flexion and 78.3% in compression compared to the plant material alone. The catalytic performance of the Al2O3 NPs is evaluated using methylene blue (MB) as a cationic dye and Rose Bengal (RB) as an anionic dye. Impressively, the Al2O3 NPs demonstrate degradation efficiencies of 98.2% for MB and 90.5% for RB. The degradation processes occur under solar light irradiation, with a contact time of 120 m, a maintained pH of 7, and a temperature of 25 °C. This study found that Al2O3 nanoparticles are a promising, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly option for water treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945061","journalIssue":{"objectId":"633ec2cc4097077179681bd0","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"1bf13daa-b14b-4ea1-ab0d-733f84be2a16"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/14/7/848","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bacafdbe833174261d5b","name":"Johar Amin Ahmed","lastName":"Abdullah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bdef25c7-6c31-43a0-84b5-03be64386f11"},{"objectId":"6839bacafdbe833174261d5a","name":"Gamil Gamal","lastName":"Hasan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a44ec93c-da96-4c49-bf6f-59a3dcfa9ee9"},{"objectId":"6839bacafdbe833174261d59","name":"Ilham Ben","lastName":"Amor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ce2bf5a-6826-4dbd-9c8c-744960ed3b31"},{"objectId":"6839bacafdbe833174261d58","name":"Mohammed Taher","lastName":"Gherbi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8d6ec1a-483a-4a7e-92b2-fcd15bebc03b"},{"objectId":"6839bacafdbe833174261d57","name":"Hadia","lastName":"Hemmami","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"536c1605-89f5-4171-aa1a-d8ef7b408472"},{"objectId":"6839bacafdbe833174261d56","name":"Ahlam Hacine","lastName":"Gharbi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75ee4535-0e02-46b5-a717-bf8fbf226da7"},{"objectId":"6839bacafdbe833174261d55","name":"Mahmood M.

The symmetric heat exchanger plate made of aluminum alloy consists of square cross section channels with a hydraulic diameter of 1000 µm and a length of 100 mm and rectangular inlet and outlet plenums. The heat exchanger operates in a counterflow configuration and the working fluids are hot and cold deionized water, respectively. The flow in minichannels is considered laminar due to its maximum Reynolds number limited to approximate value of 2200. Experimental measurements were carried out for various combinations of hot and cold side Reynolds numbers for the purpose of seeking optimal thermo-hydraulic performance. The minichannel geometry and operating conditions were chosen to operate in the laminar thermal entry length in order to achieve higher average Nusselt number along the minichannel length compared to the Nusselt number in the fully developed laminar flow. The general analytical model for prediction of the heat transfer performance of these types of heat exchangers is presented and includes the heat transfer process in the inlet plenum, the parallel configuration of the minichannels, and the outlet plenum. A comparison of the overall heat transfer coefficient resulting from the experiment and the analytical model is presented. The thermo-hydraulic performance of the investigated minichannel heat exchanger and exemplary microchannel heat exchangers is also presented. The main advantage of the presented minichannel heat exchanger is a very high overall heat transfer coefficient up to 3000 W/(m2K) and relatively low pressure drop on the one side of the heat exchanger up to 6.5 kPa, while still maintaining the high compactness and ease of manufacturing compared to microchannel heat exchangers. The comparison of minichannel heat exchanger considered in this paper and exemplary microchannel heat exchangers reflected slight decrease of the overall heat transfer coefficient, while still being approximately of the same order, together with incomparably lower pressure drop, on average of two orders of magnitude."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945070","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839babbfdbe833174261ce5","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"231","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"a4a38aed-c7db-4d77-b0db-d672ad616c0c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0017931024006562","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c48b","name":"Maria","lastName":"Tychanicz-Kwiecień","uuid":"B4135178C5FFA115A27CC06AECF4254D5A8F1C6CA819DEB5BD1FC15321593B416F7BB5572F644050A873989A48CCD997317646DD6D527D0C38B636EAC6490695","orcidId":"0000-0003-4312-2772","documentHash":"2dab8ed2-7611-48ec-9b78-f4a06ea8e08b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c445","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Gil","uuid":"96AC6EC691EFAA5D696FB70B627CCDA1C8F3EFFA85C908576C2A39521EB739F227C6DC8B29465BAAD67144D8A3C30DB3ED8B563468184026AED194F2D0F3D392","orcidId":"0000-0001-9931-3012","documentHash":"8103bfb0-9b45-47d3-8bc3-48c1494de49d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2024.125825"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electronic banking","payment cards","cashless payments"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This makes studies on the reuse of dismantled blades an urgent need for our generation; however, their recycling is very difficult due to the specific makeup of their composite material. In this study, the authors determined a concept for the reuse of turbine blade sections filled with concrete for geotechnical structures, retaining the walls, piles, or parts of their foundations. Working out detailed structural solutions to the above problem should be preceded by the identification of material parameters. In particular, getting to know the interface stress-strain characteristics is crucial. Therefore, this research focuses on the cooperation between recycled FRP composites and concrete in load-carrying, including experiments and numerical analyses. Regarding the two types of destructive stress, which may occur at the interface under both compression and bending, two types of tests were executed: the ‘push-out test’, modelling the interface’s answer to shear stress, and the ‘pull-off test’, demonstrating the interface’s reaction to normal stress. Additionally, the strength parameters of the materials used were tested. The numerical model for the push-out process was calibrated on the basis of the tests, and this way the shear bond strength and the coefficient of friction between the concrete and the recycled FRP laminate were assessed."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945476","journalIssue":{"objectId":"675be9f4fdbe834a822912d9","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"24","doi":null,"documentHash":"36be91ce-e6db-46b9-af58-d1d492d4b92b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/24/6186","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839be17fdbe833174263739","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Broniewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b114f359-294f-4c7b-bda4-6c0089bb3764"},{"objectId":"6839be17fdbe833174263738","name":"Anna","lastName":"Halicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2f758c2-212b-48c7-8ff3-b1c478be4ab5"},{"objectId":"6839be17fdbe833174263737","name":"Filip","lastName":"Broniewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd451979-6387-48ff-aee8-c2a0bd11d5d7"},{"objectId":"6839be17fdbe833174263736","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Jabłoński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"683a8aaf-08a5-4298-844c-6ce8aab7e6db"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5b1","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Buda-Ożóg","uuid":"86ADC1C8416360BBA1507134F28FA713B965B9037C43799839833B9E1FDEDAA07966B690BA69748609F56A7567F3D5CBDC268D94B996B55F036B547665FDA28F","orcidId":"0000-0002-1205-1345","documentHash":"c45b98a8-4881-4d70-8eae-6d91ba0bd17a"},{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b6a2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":"611589F88D48DF4D4A249C4F357EB2704346A8CCE18651B19E96FB2F2C8FDD6833C0AF4494D8EDC00A522ED6703A4109968732524AEDCA50B228B0FFA4DAFADA","orcidId":"0000-0003-1800-5697","documentHash":"4ef2ce86-5604-460d-a7a2-e3299c08cf29"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17246186"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["robot programming methods","virtual reality","industrial robots","augmented reality","digital twin","laser tracker"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In the case of digital twins of robotic stations, modeling accuracy and two-way communication with the real station proved to be crucial. The article proposes a methodology for solving the basic problem of off-line robot programming, i.e., the limited accuracy of the representation of the station and the details. The algorithm of proceeding in the case when the station already exists and its digital model is built and the case when the digital model is first created and the real solution is built on its basis is shown. According to the developed methodology, a digital twin of a real robotic station was created and the possibilities arising from the use of virtual tools were shown.

Design/Methodology/Approach: Achieving the research goal defined in the article requires the use of a comprehensive research approach, carried out in several stages, and combining several research methods. At the beginning, a critical review of the literature on the subject is conducted and the method of reasoning by analogy is used. Then, a financial benchmarking proposal is presented (on the example of companies from the energy sector in Poland) including selecting the subject and object of comparison, collecting external data, calculating indicators and analyzing results using descriptive statistics, the TOPSIS method, and creating appropriate rankings. Research methods such as literature review, reasoning by analogy, Spearman's rank correlation descriptive statistics (mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, variation coefficient, kurtosis) and TOPSIS method are used in the study. Findings: The analyses carried out indicate large application possibilities in the context of using financial benchmarking in companies from the energy sector. Properly selected areas and indicators in financial benchmarking can support management in additional financial dimensions. This, in turn, translates into more effective creation and implementation of strategies, and an increase in the efficiency of operational management (focused on business processes) in companies from the energy sector. Practical implications: The implementation of financial benchmarking can lead to an improvement in the quality of the management process in companies from the energy sector. Properly selected areas, measures (indicators), methods and objects of comparison in financial benchmarking allow for drawing valuable conclusions (including in the scope of the strengths and weaknesses of the company compared to the competition, inefficient use of resources, inappropriate actions) and setting new directions or methods of development. This allows for improving the process of creating, implementing and monitoring strategies in companies, and increasing the efficiency of operational management (focused on business processes). As a result, these activities lead to an increase in the value of companies from the energy sector for shareholders (including an increase in the capitalization of companies from the energy sector on the stock exchange). Originality: The article presents the possibilities of the application of financial benchmarking in supporting management, using descriptive statistics and the TOPSIS method. The financial benchmarking proposal is based on the example of companies from the energy sector in Poland, but it contains general assumptions that can be implemented in any entity regardless of the sector in which it operates."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945480","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bd21fdbe833174262f51","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"XXVIΙ","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"65616434-9e84-4c6a-9f60-24f88c9af935"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"837-865","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3552","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d628","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Rokita","uuid":"FF28AC1AFF48ACFE8889977B66C24544994E693A18FC51959EB6C74C43A11B8E1A209F92624D0781D02A5400D5C8DAC0B3B84C1B882EDF60CEC68F3C5554F51E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2185-6399","documentHash":"b1c088be-8b77-4aa6-896a-51c755707106"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d595","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szydełko","uuid":"CB16030DD6C8AEA7642B2C2EFE2329D766776F5CC2633B7F46AC8DFB3BD6374B589A244D6ADC6352D860EF5E6589FA48D33B662F8B4DC06DF4D57388196F2F56","orcidId":"0000-0002-6370-3999","documentHash":"74b54847-0c51-4545-b692-e5cf2fe87146"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3552"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Polish Power System","demand profiles","clustering","commercial customers"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The aim of this research was to develop a simple yet reliable approach for matching electricity usage patterns with specific profiles while relating them to the overall profile of the Polish power system. This offers valuable insights into how commercial customers utilize electricity and their actual contributions to the system’s peak load, which can further contribute to more efficient energy management and production planning within the Polish power system. Furthermore, the clustering analysis provides a new understanding of consumption patterns, allowing for better predictions of peak load behavior and more refined energy management strategies across sectors."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945482","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67458308fdbe832eab8f02a4","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"07250765-b035-4219-a84f-0df0eb040f81"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/23/6120","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdbafdbe83317426346d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Zabkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2b4079c-304f-43f8-b705-0b270d9b19f3"},{"objectId":"6839bdbafdbe83317426346c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Gajowniczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e1df108-3778-42ad-8fd9-bdbe9d1f0176"},{"objectId":"6839bdbafdbe83317426346b","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Matejko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4cc6edc-ed53-465c-99b7-8be2bb2c9891"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d61b","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Brożyna","uuid":"F296B3D65A3DD3842235EA31A4DBE33B146F0D8873C6F4598257E39AE63DD23CF01F044071A7FCC3A7BF0ADBDA85B85FB5381CA6E4EAC2C1194EE31920C309FE","orcidId":"0000-0001-5632-7262","documentHash":"e516f6bc-19fa-4456-8f15-adf58589014b"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17236120"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sausage quality","smoked sausage","PAH","food quality","food quality management","smoked meat","food chemistry"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The aim of this study was to analyse the level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) generated during meat smoking using traditional Polish methods. In particular, various meat products such as: Kornetka from Górno, Country sausage from Górno, Dry pork from Górno, Homemade ham, Steamed bacon, Pork kabanos were prepared. Within the treated meats, the following PAH compounds were determined: benzo(a)pyrene - BaP, chrysene - CHR, benzo(a)anthracene - BaA, benzo(b)fluoranthene - BbF, 5-methylchrysene - 5-MeCHR, benzo(c)fluorene - BcF, benzo(g, h,i)perylene - BghiP, benzo(j)fluoranthene - BjF, benzo(k)fluoranthene - BkF, dibenzo(a,e)pyrene - dBaeP, dibenzo(a,h)anthracene - dBahA, dibenzo(a,h) pyrene - dBahP, dibenzo(a,i)pyrene - dBaiP, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene - dBalP, indeno(c,d)pyrene - IcdP. After the smoking process, cold cuts samples were taken for chemical analysis to determine the presence of PAHs. Samples were taken 7 times, at 2-week intervals, in an amount of approximately 1.5 kg, immediately after heat treatment, cooling and packaging. The amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was determined by liquid chromatography (HPLC). Research carried out shows that the lowest average PAH content was found in dry sausage and was 5.87μg/kg. In three of the meats tested, the total PAHs content assessed ranged from 10.78 to 16.62μg/kg The results of this study provide information on PAH levels in traditionally smoked meats and assess compliance of these levels with current health and safety regulations. This research is crucial to understand the possible health risks factors that could be associated with the consumption of traditionally smoked meat and to guide the development of safer smoking practices."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945483","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67bc7a1cfdbe833d4376bcba","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"28","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"0e9b8628-e4f5-45b3-bbad-82fa9e353398"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"221-234","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.2478/aucft-2024-0018","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70946d878c28a0473bcd28","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Antos","uuid":"337E3D34AB89D2DED384F549F10D7B480238D2437AE6E31B75EB39F0CBE33211C98791BDED22E343175FC31F98DF6BD92ACC18C7AFF836E3DE79B2CBFAF21A4B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3384-2776","documentHash":"0f06f3c9-7cf2-4c45-a1e1-7a5ee4d75c4d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b5a4","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"6DF2506E46847BE4DC0EE832485CEDBA57946F773D2F0A5C19C94F6F66A174946949452241AF2855E192874DC2180F9534CD96BEB8C36B19863331EBF74C99D3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2304-3455","documentHash":"9989c015-5c2c-461f-9690-3e40a6ac0895"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395271","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Tereszkiewicz","uuid":"10DF9BEBB06088AC0C9575A49CA688CB224E170953B3C50A0670D1CE6B8E6BBA0DB4807FD2911E1F737A768DB3C250D70EA0027D20DDD484FB11C7BEE7193EC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5017-7646","documentHash":"10371107-0c68-4890-8330-39bf2dd41975"}],"doi":"10.2478/aucft-2024-0018"},{"mainLanguageName":"ukraiński","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-966-934-622-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Проблеми охорони праці, промислової та цивільної безпеки: Збірник матеріалів ХХХІ Всеукраїнської науково-методичної конференції","mainLanguage":"ukr","journal":null,"pages":139,"publicationPlace":"Kijów","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2024-12-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839ff17fdbe833174265079","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646945485","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"6839ff17fdbe83317426507a","mniswId":null,"name":"POLITECHNIKA KIJOWSKA","documentHash":"d9a5ad4f-f9b2-47b6-a7ad-d5292bf8ac26"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://confopcbproc.iee.kpi.ua/issue/view/18594","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sectoral reference documents","public administration","sustainability","EMAS scheme"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Design/methodology/approach: The assumed research method was based on the analysis of secondary sources in form of environmental statements. The selection of sample was targeted and the research involved a complete analysis among 19 organisations conducting business activity identified with the NACE code 84, for which sectoral reference document introduced by the Commission Decision (EU) 2019/61 of 19 December 2018 is applicable. Additionally, each organisation runs office activities. The described analysis allowed to identify most frequently used practices oriented on reducing environmental impact of office operations. Findings: Most frequent practices identified among the research participants include printing on both sides, printing only necessary documents, electronic document flow, turning off redundant equipment and light, monitoring and reporting failures of water supply system, waste sorting and rational planning of commuting and business trips. Practices listed above can be implemented in organisations with different profile of activity, and also in households. Research limitations/implications: The described research was limited to a certain extent, because some organisations had not indicated environmental management practices in their reports, or listed only part of the implemented actions. Further research might focus on practices used in public administration bodies, e.g. in the area of mobility or sustainable energy and climate policy. Practical implications: The key input of the described research are examples of environmental management practices that could be implemented in organisations with different profile of activity and also in households. Social implications: This study presents examples of activities important for the fulfilment of the EU sustainability goals, mainly focused on the improvement of overall quality of life. Originality/value: The outcomes of the study can supplement previous research concerning the EMAS scheme with examples of specific solutions implemented in public administration bodies (and possible to implement in most organisations) in order to reduce the negative environmental impact."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945487","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677fbe3afdbe831a91d48a08","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"208","doi":"","documentHash":"aaf86968-2925-475e-8dc6-270e2898a41f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"475-490","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/208-Nycz-Wr%C3%B3bel.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d59a","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Nycz-Wróbel","uuid":"C42BC809597A4CC0F60CDB8C9E1BA0E9014A8ABD0E0105B4E265A3489909E2C2CF612FAFF1EDBEFABC3D6D6007D28E573DC5646EBAD0546A67A39D1096216FFB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2100-6765","documentHash":"9535e653-8c9a-47be-a199-da96d847f6fb"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.208.27"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["voice control","command recognition","collaborative robot"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The WEDM is worth considering for machining fasteners used in assembly processes. This paper presents a study of the WEDM cutting process of aluminum 2017A using an WEDM machine of the FR 400 type. After applying different cutting speeds, the characteristics of the cut surface were evaluated. Despite some differences in the shape of surface profiles and surface morphology noted after WEDM cutting at different speeds, the analysis of variance concluded that the WEDM cutting speed in the studied variation range of 23-125 μm/s has no significant effect on surface roughness. At the highest speed studied, machining efficiency can be increased, affecting cost and energy reduction, while maintaining an acceptable and comparable level of surface quality after WEDM cutting."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945493","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ced47bfdbe83617c4adfc2","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"123","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"3462dac9-6595-4ef1-a0b7-7922260a6475"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"3-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.prz.edu.pl/tiam/article/view/1617","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd2dfdbe833174262fb6","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Jamróz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e8d701d-d8ea-4505-9656-62c093316d63"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5ff","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Gałda","uuid":"3DB219BB35751A68936731EEF5E888F270447BEB4213940FFC7EF2547C23B4E846B839C7E7EB2C239B08EC579433ED0468CD8A599E42737BAB1CC33E48C5AE48","orcidId":"0000-0001-8603-9907","documentHash":"04c68436-11ae-4d02-be3b-fceff3963cda"}],"doi":"10.7862/tiam.2024.1.1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coefficient stability","singular Sturm–Liouville problem","exact three-point difference scheme"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This process is influenced by both the mineral composition of individual rock components present in the aggregate, as well as their structural and textural features. The presented work presents the results of petrographic analyses performed to identify rocks and potentially reactive components that cause the ASR (alkali silica reaction), reaction in concrete. As part of the mineral evaluation, reactive siliceous phases were identified. An analysis was also carried out regarding the internal structure of the minerals, identifying single-crystalline quartz and polycrystalline quartz with a mosaic structure or in a state of internal stress. Attention was paid to secondary mineralisation processes affecting the reactivity of concrete. The following processes were identified: silicification, sericitisation, pyritization in aggregates. The conducted mineralogical and petrographic tests confirmed that the cause of the destructive expansion of the tested concrete is the alkali-silica reaction, caused by the identified reactive components and secondary mineralisation processes."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945498","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6698e914fdbe83588aac2386","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"21","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"18605fbc-4d1e-4ca7-b100-f9866ccc493d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214509524012658?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839be6afdbe833174263a19","name":"Silvia","lastName":"Vilcekova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5095eaa-ac45-4047-bd4b-d4162a94e9cc"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d5ab","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Pękala","uuid":"6AB43389183A353BD02F9E68F58A817020A99E97C4D4816063C1483D5409CA6659D99370803D62DFE38ACD5B1ACA5F380F8FBD41C551EB9AF6D5F00B71280F6F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5011-3060","documentHash":"c39821c7-d376-4171-88f0-83c37e1bc3da"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cscm.2024.e04113"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["extreme behavior in professional situations","mobbing","lack of readiness to oppose illegal influence","socio-pathological phenomena","dysfunctional behavior","Police"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The necessity of improving manufacturing efficiency and quality at an affordable cost requires deep knowledge of the resistance spot welding (RSW) process and the development of artificial neural network (ANN)- and machine learning (ML)-based modelling techniques, apt for providing essential tools for design, planning, and incorporation in the welding process. Tensile shear force and nugget diameter are the most crucial outputs for evaluating the quality of a resistance spot-welded specimen. This study uses ML and ANN models to predict shear force and nugget diameter responses to RSW parameters. The RSW analysis was executed on similar and dissimilar AISI 304 and grade 2 titanium alloy joints with equal and unequal thicknesses. The input parameters included welding current, pressure, welding duration, squeezing time, holding time, pulse welding, and sheet thickness. Linear regression, Decision tree, Support vector machine (SVM), Random forest (RF), Gradient-boosting, CatBoost, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet machine learning algorithms, along with two different structures of Multilayer Perceptron, were utilized for studying the impact of the RSW parameters on the shear force and nugget diameter. Different validation metrics were applied to assess each model’s quality. Two equations were developed to determine the shear force and nugget diameter based on the investigation parameters. The current research also presents a prediction of the Relative Importance (RI) of RSW factors. Shear force and nugget diameter predictions were examined using SHapley (SHAP) Additive Explanations for the first time in the RSW field. Trainbr as the training function and Logsig as the transfer function delivered the best ANN model for predicting shear force in a one-output structure. Trainrp with Tansig made the most accurate predictions for nugget diameter in a one-output structure and for shear force and diameter in a two-output structure. Depending on validation metrics, the Random forest model outperformed the other ML algorithms in predicting shear force or nugget diameter in a one-output model, while the Decision tree model gave the best prediction using a two-output structure. Linear regression made the worst ML predictions for shear force, while ElasticNet made the worst nugget diameter forecasts in a one-output model. However, in two-output models, Lasso made the worst predictions."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945502","journalIssue":{"objectId":"675be9f4fdbe834a822912d9","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"24","doi":null,"documentHash":"36be91ce-e6db-46b9-af58-d1d492d4b92b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-46","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/24/6250","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839be35fdbe833174263827","name":"Alejandro","lastName":"Pereira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4926ac1-60b2-49bd-8043-a6166fd36472"},{"objectId":"6839be35fdbe833174263826","name":"Marwan T.","lastName":"Mezher","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad392ab6-3002-4a6a-be98-edfd62a69d8c"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17246250"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65e1d8044097073bbafda08b","doi":null,"title":"Studia i Analizy Sądu Najwyższego.

In many situations, when seeking solutions to such equations, we utilize fixed-point theorems. Among the most well-known and useful in this regard are the theorems of Darbo and Sadovskii, which generalize the classical results of Schauder and Tikhonov. These theorems have seen many generalizations. The aim of the paper is to strengthen (by weakening the assumptions) several known Darbo- and Sadovskii-type fixed-point theorems in the so-called power version for Fréchet spaces, which are particularly useful for studying the solvability of equations defined on an unbounded interval. A theorem on the existence of solutions to a nonlinear integral equation, illustrating the application of our main result, is also provided."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945506","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bd5efdbe83317426313c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"45","number":"7-9","doi":null,"documentHash":"6a14ae78-0e7c-40e1-b12f-2e854cdf20fd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"441-455","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/01630563.2024.2384860","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d56c","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Zając","uuid":"1E0AD5686672E83C0B75AEABB12F7A26A49317DFD6E20EB59E9826120F16920120CA1F92BD86CE5A4693D778F20FA5464DD584BF0655953BF148FCF0350C1DE7","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-3817","documentHash":"62ae8ddd-d2ba-4f14-8042-23e82414929c"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395233","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Olszowy","uuid":"D4E181F520B80DC7C3EB3DC8F1923BECE2F2F17186AF65D2EB554FB2E17613D8C3A9FDABAC9BDA13FA861E88C184F19BF657F123B234A0CEF14FF20098E56EE0","orcidId":"0000-0002-6175-8478","documentHash":"b34bfb42-09d8-4db7-ad19-48bfdee68f4a"}],"doi":"10.1080/01630563.2024.2384860"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b792b","5e70945e878c28a0473bba13","60c34cdd9543c7233654441b","5e7092cd878c28a04739cfd4","5e709297878c28a0473989f7","5e709498878c28a0473c01d5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Constraints on ore vectoring from geochemical fingerprints of porphyry style pyrite","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-05-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839be89fdbe8368347cfd7c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709297878c28a0473989f7","60c34cdd9543c7233654441b","5e709207878c28a04738ed17","5e709207878c28a04738ed95","6839be89fdbe8368347cfd7d","5e709498878c28a0473c01d5","5e7092cd878c28a04739cfd4","5e70945e878c28a0473bba13","6839be89fdbe8368347cfd7e","5e70942c878c28a0473b792b","6839be89fdbe8368347cfd7f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The sulfur isotope compositions of three generations of pyrite originated from skarns, stockwork, and late-stage, post-hydrothermal veins from three various zones of the porphyry style Myszków Mo–Cu–W deposit (center, circum-deposit, and periphery) were investigated as a proxy for the mineralized core of porphyry system. Overall, the mode of δ34Spyrite decreases with time, from skarn- through main- up to late-stage of ore mineralization (with average values of + 6.13, + 5.65, and + 3.34 ‰, respectively). The gradual decrease in δ34S values outwards from the deposit core (av. 3.95 ‰), through circum-deposit (av. + 3.40‰) to distal zone (av. + 3.05 ‰) was detected only for late-stage pyrite. Both the temporal and lateral zonation of δ34Spyrite could be explained by the progressive temperature decrease of the mineralized system and the mixing of ore-forming solutions with more dilute meteoric waters. The trace geochemistry of late-stage pyrite shows relatively constant values of Tl (from 0.13 to 0.14 ppm), Ti (9.10–10.30 ppm), Cr (9.94–12.37 ppm), and Mn (6.94–7.59 ppm) regardless of the zone of the Myszków Mo–Cu–W deposit. While, As (24.96–184.80 ppm), Sb (0.50–13.52 ppm), Bi (0.57–1.54 ppm) in pyrite and Sb/Te (0.06–1.62), Co/Bi (3.32–34.23), and Ag/Ni (0.006–0.140) increase with the proximity to the ore, contrary to Ag/Co which rises towards the periphery of the deposit (0.04–0.13). Ultimately, these results indicate that sulfur isotope data supported by trace geochemistry of late-stage pyrite can be potentially used as vectoring proxies to predict the likely direction to the mineralized center of a porphyry system"}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945507","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677fc7b7fdbe831a91d64526","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"41689a60-19d6-4a7b-b2cc-eed6fe48f85b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"18696","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99918-5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839be89fdbe8368347cfd7f","name":"Jaroslav","lastName":"Pršek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b9fea37-e33b-4dc9-ad7d-986bb1df7e2e"},{"objectId":"6839be89fdbe8368347cfd7e","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Woszczyna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea365d54-0fff-4174-9f8c-1ed5ad509813"},{"objectId":"6839be89fdbe8368347cfd7d","name":"Dimitrina","lastName":"Dimitrova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b198e513-53e5-48bd-956b-dea8ef6b441c"},{"objectId":"60c34cdd9543c7233654441b","name":"Artur","lastName":"Sosnal","uuid":"838A0DEB26FAF34A10C3F5CC5B0CB4FAA8D2964B099708B20AFE512096146EBF8B694FFDFCFB7473785C3A603351C2BAB66A4C8549ECE66B11672A23C97F4AA7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c00fb62-34ca-427e-943d-e27a38c1e53b"},{"objectId":"5e709498878c28a0473c01d5","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Habryn","uuid":"3E417AAD5E5E5C0920CF636C9C60AF93B4CF47622446BC3BB36C757724BCC9E9E1B4C61686C7ACEDFA58E64A11FCD8812B5D022C50A6605BECA2F53E1F45A662","orcidId":"0000-0002-2699-9727","documentHash":"77dfab19-90b9-4e29-87da-59428fb7e309"},{"objectId":"5e70945e878c28a0473bba13","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Czupyt","uuid":"BC7F23E5F487B79E6A39C53105AD5B6399D0CDCE46C2744AC8B119D0C85922170911BE1A50463CAFB6054432EBD212AD3B7AD33F1A20CE9918819ED0FB17F49B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3416-9475","documentHash":"7426ae9b-4db5-4869-9b7c-0eee77f70046"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b792b","name":"Marek","lastName":"Markowiak","uuid":"3E0B7B91C79B831C2B6E111A2334C88B92D7502B73E208292C66ED6603F3C22FE05F984641FFC4067F798E492EF127C3B1EBEF58035033762C979A11EAB1C905","orcidId":"0000-0003-0374-7268","documentHash":"32ca392c-d10d-463c-a606-65dfb47d4f38"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739cfd4","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Derkowski","uuid":"F3D17C7C68C30C72C8D0B7AA3275E7AE50E39E3C6E47DE518EED3E5E32AA22EF61D0294F06F3CC8ACD8CD3C63FBD16037C0DA4A8DF5F2F1C65946A630CF42B69","orcidId":"0000-0002-4067-1242","documentHash":"8d00a3e9-fa7c-4f91-8938-c2a25e51497c"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a0473989f7","name":"Beata","lastName":"Naglik","uuid":"FAC6217C556A61C516D2C12D0B1DD9E835D83441152F5CC30C25B0BE2CEB09A7F082A9D1F0B39F422D81E03C7A288672BA5566BC73FC528CD1AC0E4D8A8A4592","orcidId":"0000-0002-4452-3378","documentHash":"1332d733-9cc1-4ee2-82c0-7fa5be399ce2"},{"objectId":"5e709207878c28a04738ed95","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"TOBOŁA","uuid":"C7198EA84ED0A3587F742E72561ECB437A8517BD1395087D2B06E7899F639D5E89C846B3FE4AF47242328DDB94E123D0226EA2ED3F3EFEF32975B4291F49F5A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-6513-729X","documentHash":"82101f63-88bd-4195-91fa-7a425c127737"},{"objectId":"5e709207878c28a04738ed17","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Dumańska-Słowik","uuid":"328B385DC133EC88FFA2F33A94BCA5F62D52D252AC1746547528D7153F6AC8465F85059A943D138200931594F713C86AC2A512A4C49C1AC6D55DC656390C6BAC","orcidId":"0000-0002-0877-8920","documentHash":"d20aa476-811b-41c5-976d-c56377271e3d"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-025-99918-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ball Abrasion Test","wear","Chromium","friction coefficient","Niobium"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The resulting microstructures contain carbides embedding in a metallic matrix (MMC). Significant changes in mechanical properties are expected depending on the morphology, size and distribution of carbides. Results pointed out to an improvement in wear resistance of Fe-Cr-C-Nb alloy although it showed lower values of hardness and volume fraction of carbides in comparison to the other alloys.

Raw materials were ground, and the obtained powders were cold pressed and sintered. It was demonstrated that this method can be used in the recycling of aluminium alloy scrap characterised by a high surface-to-volume ratio, and also that chemical removal of the oxide layer from chips is not necessary. The finest particles, with 50 vol.% of their population below 36 μm, were obtained after grinding for 60 min at a 1000 rpm rotational speed. Such an intensive grinding was necessary to fabricate the compact composite material with a homogeneous microstructure and a low porosity of 0.7%. The corrosion resistance of the composites was studied in 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution using cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and corrosion rates in the range of ca. 342 and 3 μA∙cm−2 were obtained. The corrosion mechanism includes aluminium alloy dissolution at the matrix/reinforcement interphase and around intermetallic particles localised within the matrix grains."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945512","journalIssue":{"objectId":"671f3930fdbe8307b0be31f8","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"21","doi":null,"documentHash":"a98ebe0f-c811-4b40-80fe-beaad22fd55d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/21/5331","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd12fdbe833174262eda","name":"Diana","lastName":"Groch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71002c05-d529-404a-88ac-88f6c297f7a4"},{"objectId":"5e7094bd878c28a0473c2d70","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"C37ECD0C1228F3EF862ED25D0AE1998BCFFD6304675454BD9E0ED4E1316A9A9A981D03D8057A5847DFF09EEB78CA285D1C91D325B556403D9F23300FFB1E5D83","orcidId":"0000-0002-5285-4900","documentHash":"36fd7f47-c67e-4808-aea0-64c282b363f0"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7dfa","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kwolek","uuid":"05DA19E27E5B92807D909778DDA9A6B3303108206B876191C79DBEA30EE8E3460206E33A451FA8144B55B3E6BAA9F443334EC20ABA8FA1FC867E2477FFD048D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-0376-5917","documentHash":"0271cd35-bd0a-4d32-9e1d-40452a71a251"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aaea1","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Kościelniak","uuid":"AAC6921496E0398B7909DBB31667CE3B594B3C02ADA211502C46E6C99F9D8C13AC286E334D7F8C423382525DD6DC6BCF7A827031A96D3447FD89CE2D0F6C7359","orcidId":"0000-0002-1683-0354","documentHash":"3259c9f7-fe47-4c25-a2eb-caa9cce15f4c"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739527f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Drajewicz","uuid":"512C674C9A8ACF3998E773B8AF28A7E53274695C561D79DE39947A31D840A6AEE0C5EBE9BE3B353970686DEE05D05D46F67E9F1B120AAB5E87E56D29F7054E8B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9600-6938","documentHash":"415b7f80-adc5-45ef-9c40-997732dc461c"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17215331"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["low molecular weight compounds","LDI-MS","silver-109 nanoparticles","mycotoxins","LDI-MSI"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Alternative  methods, like  laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) offer unique advantages but face challenges like high background noise and low ionization efficiency for nonpolar compounds. This study concernsthe detection and quantification of mycotoxins using silver-109 nanoparticles on a steel plate, produced via a novel pulsed fiber laser method with a 2D galvanometer scanner.

The base alloys Al0.7CoCrFeNi and Al0.7CoCrFeNiV0.5 were obtained by induction melting. The results showed that the presence of vanadium changes the microstructure of the material. In the case of the base alloy, the structure is biphasic with a visible segregation of alloying elements between phases. In contrast, the Al0.7CoCrFeNiV0.5 alloy has a homogeneous solid solution bcc structure. The presence of vanadium increased hardness by 33%, while it significantly reduced friction wear by 73%. Microscopic observations of friction marks indicate differences in the wear mechanisms of the two materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945522","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67406cedfdbe832d853b35ae","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"64051828-5f95-4984-b33a-8ac6a987172f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/23/6021","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdcafdbe8331742634ed","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Tokarewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df169301-2e2d-4b8b-94c9-6ee92f7384e7"},{"objectId":"6839bdcafdbe8331742634ec","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Walczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b4f34cc-35cc-41a2-a9c9-f9b7a8269f51"},{"objectId":"6839bdcafdbe8331742634eb","name":"Miroslaw","lastName":"Szala","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b2e33cc-3008-49d5-b08b-c5cc26397d11"},{"objectId":"6839bdcafdbe8331742634ea","name":"Malgorzata","lastName":"Gradzka-Dahlke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c082aa0-7c1d-4ef3-b073-c50f607b23be"},{"objectId":"5e7094bd878c28a0473c2d70","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"C37ECD0C1228F3EF862ED25D0AE1998BCFFD6304675454BD9E0ED4E1316A9A9A981D03D8057A5847DFF09EEB78CA285D1C91D325B556403D9F23300FFB1E5D83","orcidId":"0000-0002-5285-4900","documentHash":"36fd7f47-c67e-4808-aea0-64c282b363f0"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b746","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Gradzik","uuid":"972224633B2907FFF730B28311D920D620936DD788EE9D9470E27A7882E70172D2BBC743EA5F2E3E0BAB03936121EC4926F1AE16628BF69FEE8F8BA5562DBD19","orcidId":"0000-0003-0491-8890","documentHash":"d765d9f6-5a4e-46a7-8919-34b6958f4ace"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17236021"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-0-443-15483-6","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The results of the tests and comparisons of the displacement and strain values of the components obtained using different measurement methods are presented in this paper. The force–strain and force–displacement relationships obtained from the tests were used to validate numerical models of slope protection walls and excavations designed from used wind turbine blades. According to our research, there is a high degree of variability in the strength parameters and deformation of the composite elements made from the wind turbine blades. Therefore, in the case of this type of material, characterized by a significant variation in carrying capacity, deformability, and the nature of the failures, the use of different measurement methods makes it possible to obtain much of the data necessary for assessing the reusability of wind turbine blades in building."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945526","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd33b0fdbe836fcb7c7e1a","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"19","doi":null,"documentHash":"3ee66309-c977-47ab-9edd-372f1f9c2c6f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/19/4934","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc8cfdbe833174262aeb","name":"Filip","lastName":"Broniewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c8e0fc4b-2e90-4a80-8c09-d4b05b7d500d"},{"objectId":"6839bc8cfdbe833174262aea","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Broniewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75f6e30c-6ad3-43c9-989f-35425de70106"},{"objectId":"6839bc8cfdbe833174262ae9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Halicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"303cbf00-c07e-4b40-afd0-caf89446d85a"},{"objectId":"6839bc8cfdbe833174262ae8","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Jabłoński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"50f3aba7-8bf0-4793-9caa-a07d67f6efca"},{"objectId":"5fc534ed085dcb1e6ae0ba73","name":"Damian","lastName":"Nykiel","uuid":"AF5020CE7A9503D8783F2988DEB5526D001A40EC51E5373F357D149EFB6726BA2DEFFF5E646BB9575D542AE635CF6F2FD5A2FF0F956EB6841248B424A4A55AF4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2259-5917","documentHash":"0bea2117-f8e3-436d-a64c-236a48dfd011"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5b1","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Buda-Ożóg","uuid":"86ADC1C8416360BBA1507134F28FA713B965B9037C43799839833B9E1FDEDAA07966B690BA69748609F56A7567F3D5CBDC268D94B996B55F036B547665FDA28F","orcidId":"0000-0002-1205-1345","documentHash":"c45b98a8-4881-4d70-8eae-6d91ba0bd17a"},{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b6a2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":"611589F88D48DF4D4A249C4F357EB2704346A8CCE18651B19E96FB2F2C8FDD6833C0AF4494D8EDC00A522ED6703A4109968732524AEDCA50B228B0FFA4DAFADA","orcidId":"0000-0003-1800-5697","documentHash":"4ef2ce86-5604-460d-a7a2-e3299c08cf29"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17194934"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-1-64195-243-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Reinforcement for Concrete Structures (FRPRCS-16)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":814,"publicationPlace":"Farmington Hills","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839feb7fdbe833174264aa3","editors":[{"objectId":"6839feb7fdbe833174264aa7","name":"John","lastName":"Myers","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf6046c0-cf3a-46de-9fc3-3a0553d728e8"},{"objectId":"6839feb7fdbe833174264aa6","name":"Pedram","lastName":"Sadeghian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6cab9368-a3b8-41c0-a313-247f51e64c24"},{"objectId":"6839feb7fdbe833174264aa5","name":"Ayman","lastName":"Okeil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"418d9227-ac53-44fb-acb8-bb78d874b2c5"},{"objectId":"6839feb7fdbe833174264aa4","name":"Maria","lastName":"Lopez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7178c95a-cfd6-457d-85af-e53ce5d1f3be"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6839feb7fdbe833174264aa4","6839feb7fdbe833174264aa5","6839feb7fdbe833174264aa6","6839feb7fdbe833174264aa7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646945529","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5ec006c1ad49b31cced9cf76","mniswId":null,"name":"American Concrete Institute","documentHash":"abc1d635-e888-4379-8d42-c907ba6bbd07"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.concrete.org/Portals/0/Files/PDF/Previews/SP360_preview.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["satysfakcja studenta","efekty satysfakcji studenta","modele satysfakcji studenta","determinanty satysfakcji studenta"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Although there is research in this area, there are still no solutions supporting the assessment of environmental impact in this sector. Therefore, it is important to look for and conduct various types of analyses that will be useful in this area. Therefore, the objective of the research was to analyse the ecological footprint of mining machines in the first phase of the LCA life cycle (obtaining and extracting materials). The analysis was based on the example of a hydraulic actuator, which is considered crucial to control machines in the mining industry. The ecological footprint burdens analysed included direct and indirect land take, sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and the use of nuclear energy. Life cycle assessment was carried out using the OpenLCA software with the ecoinvent v3.10 database. It has been shown that the largest amount of emissions occurs during off-site treatment of nonsulphide waste, cogeneration of heat and energy (hard coal), production of ferrochrome, high carbon, 68% Cr, and heat production in an industrial furnace using hard coal. It is proposed to carry out improvement activities that will first contribute to reducing the main environmental burdens. Then, it will be possible to significantly reduce the negative environmental impact of the hydraulic actuator's extraction and processing of materials. The results from the analysis may be useful not only for products from the mining industry but also in other areas of activity using this type of machine."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945533","journalIssue":{"objectId":"676e76affdbe831a384144b0","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"29","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"0bc940dc-2285-482a-a350-e42a9522aa6c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"384-392","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://actamont.tuke.sk/pdf/2024/n2/12pacana.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bcb4fdbe833174262c15","name":"Takyi","lastName":"Kwabena Nsiah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d4f3f9d-f719-4e0a-8e75-e3c288dc2a98"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.46544/ams.v29i2.12"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["footbridge","glass fibers","DFOS","Optical sensors","monitoring"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This was also the case with the widening of an existing Carpathian bridge in the centre of Rzeszów (Poland). The new footbridge located next to the bridge consists of five simply supported spans of 4.17 + 23.55 + 23.67 + 23.67 + 23.47 m, with the total length of the superstructure 104.95 m, and is believed to be the longest Polish footbridge made of FRP composites. The footbridge spans were created in the form of sandwich panels, which were manufactured in a single infusion process by the VARTM (vacuum-assisted resin transfer moulding) method. Since the footbridge spans are made of innovative but not fully recognised / proved construction material, a decision was made to equip the structure with a reliable structural health monitoring (SHM) system. The system based on distributed fibre optic sensors (DFOS) was selected and implemented for monitoring. One of the spans was equipped with sensors in the form of SM9 / 125 single-mode fibres in an acrylic coating. The optical fibres of the DFOS system were placed inside the composite structure between the fabrics of the selected laminates, before the infusion process. Because of that, the sensors are completely integrated into the material and are not exposed to damage or the influence of the environment. The paper presents the DFOS SHM system, its implementation in the FRP structure, and the measurement results obtained during the proof load tests performed on the new structure before it was open to the public."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945535","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839fccafdbe833174264733","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"64","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"24f7cb64-2237-4e0b-8286-719e3a8be3e6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1673-1680","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452321624007649","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d535","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kulpa","uuid":"790D759C417F50A6620906E9A13EC3DFC8B19327848731DC4677A87F2585D690A7D8EF4F552C30710DEA51241C7D3588B2770060CD19C6E73838497AAA0C3B9A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8550-7382","documentHash":"eb8b0b8b-00f6-4656-b102-e3c2345c36b4"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395160","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Siwowski","uuid":"60E8AE045DE688D769347355C56C8ACF612FC404CCB43774DF91B6FB20CB70B23B67D3647BC155D695119572CBE4E944782E8D58B9D096B9ABC47EF17FDFF467","orcidId":"0000-0002-2003-000X","documentHash":"ce87cefc-d930-4bec-971d-b5a30ea41ab0"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.prostr.2024.09.172"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gender equality","gender equality in education","gender equality plan"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

However, disparities still exist in terms of wages, academic promotion, and women's representation in leadership positions. The main objective of the article is to present the issue of gender equality and assess its state among the academic staff at the Rzeszów University of Technology. Design/methodology/approach: In order to assess the gender equality situation at the Rzeszów University of Technology, both quantitative and qualitative research methods were employed. The quantitative research focused on analyzing data related to gender distribution in the employment structure, leadership positions, academic degrees and titles, participation in university bodies, and involvement in research projects. The qualitative research involved conducting an anonymous survey among 300 academic staff members. Findings: The study revealed that the Rzeszów University of Technology largely ensures gender equality in recruitment processes and professional development. However, subtle forms of discrimination still exist, such as inappropriate behaviors and limited representation of women in leadership roles. Most respondents appreciated the university's efforts in supporting work-life balance and acknowledged PRz as an employer committed to gender equality. Research limitations/implications: The study presented in this article is limited to the group of academic staff at the Rzeszów University of Technology (PRz). Future research could track the impact of the implemented actions over time, include comparative analyses with other technical universities, and involve a broader group of participants Originality/value: The article highlights the state of gender equality among academic staff at the Rzeszów University of Technology. It presents a topic valuable for academic leaders, decision-makers, and researchers interested in gender equality issues."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945537","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677f883cfdbe831a91cefbed","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"209","doi":null,"documentHash":"82bab52e-270f-4b1e-9a77-f67e47f34209"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"685-696","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/209-%C5%BBuczek.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"651b803640e3ff22d347ce2a","name":"Olga","lastName":"Żuczek","uuid":"BDA19AA52B93AAC2B4E9A9EEC2F507156A2E5423330A6FC4E1846FB15674CD7C19888CCE40470C777898FF678F8467D5E3C501809ACD5B235262193E8DFDFE37","orcidId":"0009-0001-9606-6199","documentHash":"92ecb2ac-c2c8-44c9-8797-46f8ed9bbe98"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.209.41"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67e29461fdbe834633ebb9ff","doi":null,"title":"Studia i Analizy Sądu Najwyższego.

This study uses Pearson correlation analysis, Wilcoxon pairwise rank test, descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression to build eight ROA econometric models, four for each group. The research shows that in the energy sector, in particular, variables relating to the capital structure (total equity/total assets, long-term liabilities/total assets, short-term liabilities/total assets and long-term liabilities/short-term liabilities ratios) have a statistically significant impact (positive or negative) on the profitability (ROA). The aforementioned ratios appear in various combinations in all eight ROA models. The use of equity to finance the activities of companies in this sector seems to be particularly beneficial, as the total equity/total assets ratio occurs in as many as seven out of eight models and, moreover, it always has a positive impact on the ROA. The remaining analyzed variables relating to the structure of assets (fixed assets/total assets ratio), financial liquidity (current ratio) and the age of the company appear in the models as statistically significant quite rarely, having a different impact on the ROA (positively or negatively). However, variables such as the fixed assets/current assets and total liabilities/total equity ratios do not have a statistically significant impact on the ROA at all in any of the studied groups of enterprises. The research results suggest that managers, in order to shape profitability (measured by ROA), should pay special attention to the capital structure, i.e., the proportions of the use of equity, long-term liabilities and short-term liabilities to finance the operations of energy companies as these independent variables appear most often in ROA models. Other analyzed factors, such as the assets structure (the share of fixed assets in total assets) or financial liquidity, also have an impact on the return on assets; therefore, their use in energy companies should also be considered. Moreover, the research shows a large diversity of factors shaping ROA in econometric models, the way they affect the dependent variable (positive or negative) and the degree of model fit (R2 ), both in individual years and in the two groups of companies studied. This proves that it is not possible to clearly and finally determine which factors and how (positive or negative) they affect the profitability. This influence can change over time depending on the circumstances, which indicates the need for the continuous involvement of decision makers in the management process and making decisions based on reliable and appropriate-to-the-situation analyses."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945543","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6718a993fdbe8353f7589f5c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"20","doi":null,"documentHash":"c4126a68-fc57-48c3-941f-ea8834141c75"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/20/5135","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d628","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Rokita","uuid":"FF28AC1AFF48ACFE8889977B66C24544994E693A18FC51959EB6C74C43A11B8E1A209F92624D0781D02A5400D5C8DAC0B3B84C1B882EDF60CEC68F3C5554F51E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2185-6399","documentHash":"b1c088be-8b77-4aa6-896a-51c755707106"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395250","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Chudy-Laskowska","uuid":"735E70402C9B0C7983261628D22B6169C79EFC91CA7B3789D517A8914BEADF1226458E338AB4F307265B1FCC5C81242D02A278047EE0892D686511CD1DA395B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7797-2858","documentHash":"a4cc7ca7-ff20-41a6-9258-a558f395ecdd"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17205135"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wear","fretting","titanium alloy","friction"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Fretting experiments were conducted using the Optimol SRV5 tester (Optimol Instruments, Munich, Germany) under dry gross fretting conditions. A ball of WC ceramic was pressed against a disc from the titanium alloy Ti6Al4V. Experiments were carried out at elevated temperatures of 100, 200, and 300 °C. The displacement frequency was 50 Hz, the stroke was 0.1 mm, and the test duration was 15 min. The normal loads used were 40, 60, and 80 N. Ball burnishing led to a substantial reduction in the roughness height and an increase in the microhardness of samples from the titanium alloy. Burnishing, in most cases, caused an improvement in the friction resistance of sliding assemblies. Ball burnishing also led to wear reduction compared to the turned disc sample. The best tribological performance of the sliding pair was achieved for the disc sample burnished with the highest pressure of 40 MPa. An increase in temperature from 100 to 200 °C caused small changes in disc wear volumes and coefficients of friction. A further increase in temperature to 300 °C led to an increase in disc wear rates and friction coefficients."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945546","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67406cedfdbe832d853b35ae","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"64051828-5f95-4984-b33a-8ac6a987172f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/23/5960","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d611","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Świrad","uuid":"21D59C9A2DCC5B98BFFCD7435B2D93D46DEA319418025AB11363CB68C237A073A99E49C54C6BE3DA049347A250E983ABD9BB82B4899BC2DF572C7E0F3D42F03B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4937-1868","documentHash":"14724fa2-8c5e-4ac4-b89d-4ca65a4ea9ae"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395226","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Pawlus","uuid":"218754B7785C056EC29BC780B8DCF5ACC1CC4B33E85175276209C25216DCB76AB7A3B8AB605EA80B53E01A5D1D2F75494C70178BAAABDC46EA7370D754798CCA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5630-5300","documentHash":"600efb5f-a0b9-4411-bd22-f1c03b85b8a4"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17235960"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["TGS","Pyroelectric sensors","Tryglicine Sulphate"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

For the first time, experimentally determined polymerization yields were included in the calculation, by analyzing the polymer synthesis process using various organic solvents, different methods of regenerating the catalytic complex (meaning ATRP approach), or using the miniemulsion system as eco-friendly reaction medium and presenting the possibility of effective solvent recovery and reuse. The majority of the values of E-factor were below 16, falling within the scope intended for fine chemicals (5–50). The significant and innovative part of the presented research involves verifying the feasibility of using higher concentrations of the dispersed phase in the case of miniemulsion polymerization (increased to as much as 100 % vs. aqueous phase from a typical 20 %), while the use of recycled water allowed a 3-fold reduction in E-factor value. Polymerization in a miniemulsion environment is also attractive due to its low cost, considering the price of distilled water, which is over 580-fold lower than that of DMSO – a typical organic solvent. These observations allow for the reduction of environmental impact and process cost. Importantly, the observed trends in E-factor changes allowed for the identification of ATRP development directions in line with green chemistry and the circular economy."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945557","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bce3fdbe833174262d7c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"313","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"1803a367-f7d6-4622-a8e6-98dab7cbebd7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032386124010735","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bce3fdbe833174262d7d","name":"Faustyna","lastName":"Stopyra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"91624fb4-8271-49a4-aa34-6f10fa855121"},{"objectId":"66fcb029ece39865c2f7f6d8","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Ślusarczyk","uuid":"B185FF9F0AA5D628E4D3F854A843000D70C03E19890FFA71E1F196A8BEC160EC6505FF11DC004D9F74FCAA18D1ADB295EC9BEFCB69CC12AC09F31BD1AD481941","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0be648ad-fc72-4109-ab38-4e00ee7fabf2"},{"objectId":"602e30549543c7410626ee25","name":"Monika","lastName":"Flejszar","uuid":"E2203B12356A9609D20125CB91518BFD31DD57347F01400210F1FC8AFE693231FDCFECB6D69FF7C81A02C2850675164421833DC1C81DA0A37A470774EEDC25FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-8014-3543","documentHash":"da4fc6c0-bc02-4987-b224-a8fe21ea8bc5"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b654a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"6A3E7B547B6E79C49B5BC8C0B3CBEDE6F7CB6809ACB2F42C4006D62F70B2CD0683DA760527EA0EEE6F2D9C4086F525889DACC4CF86132F3B2557EBC0E485545F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9101-6264","documentHash":"db4553da-d2f7-4416-b876-2d53f3ec7758"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.polymer.2024.127737"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["metoda SonReb","metody nieniszczące (NDT)","wytrzymałość betonu na ściskanie","metoda ultradźwiękowa","metody pośrednie"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["metoda sklerometryczna"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This article presents the results of research on the influence of forming process parameters (step size, tool rotational speed, feed rate and forming strategy) on the roughness of the outer surface of conical drawpieces with a slope angle of 45° from commercially pure titanium sheets. The following variable process parameters were used: tool rotational speed varied from –600 to 600 rpm, feed rate varied from 500 to 2000 mm/min and step size varied from 0.1 to 0.5 mm. The SAE 75W85 synthetic gear oil was used as lubricant. Two basic roughness parameters were analyzed: the mean roughness Sa and the maximum height Sz. The influence of SPIF parameters on surface roughness was analysed using multi-layer artificial neural networks. It was found that reducing the feed rate with the climb strategy causes a decrease in the average roughness Sa. The opposite relationship was observed when forming according to the conventional strategy. At low tool feed rate (500 mm/min), reducing the step size caused an increase in the Sz parameter. At high tool feed rate (2000 mm/min), the effect of the step size is negligible."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945565","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b766fdbe833174260453","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"41","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"bb475064-47f7-47ca-93e6-6ebb53480245"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"221-231","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.prz.edu.pl/amme/article/view/1841/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bed6fdbe833174263d87","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Szpunar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"534ed607-4404-4293-a8f6-0b9c1aad8a0b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d58f","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":"390306FF93E6180C7BEA404074409E570FEEB33FEAD83C3547B020829AE9AAE9566A478C7EF36B10374546DA8F84D5F99C47FCAAD722BFABAB730B2AB0881EC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-1702-0767","documentHash":"33a66e49-4a34-416d-89cc-a4f873374871"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395221","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Dzierwa","uuid":"CFD1D73D2FB41EB9EB42D9422D425C999083F84218852178D009D5586C99017AB005EB588D7719FD793A4A04908613FD40BC2017305E2CD307445BA6A8EA1069","orcidId":"0000-0003-4545-1748","documentHash":"dd77a741-5719-4a8d-8e88-bcf6dd484d02"}],"doi":"10.7862/rm.2024.19"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["correlation","fit to data of measured points","band of uncertainty","WTLS weighted total least squares criterium","linear regression of nonlinear functions","covariance matrix"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Although the public health system is based on the National Health Fund, which is still the main source of funding for health care, private health insurance is becoming an important complement to it. The following article presents some key aspects demonstrating that private health insurance is increasingly contributing to the security of the public health system in Poland. It also shows their impact on specific elements of the overall system, including accessibility and prevention. Design/Methodology/Approach: Own research, analysis of source data. Findings: It is a matter of creating a social awareness conducive to a change of mentality in which market-based (competitive) solutions embedded in the principle of social solidarity, which is important for the health care system, must apply. Practical Implications: There should be one health system in Poland, based on both public and private financing. For the safety of all citizens, the state should be the organizer of this system. However, the role of insurers in the Polish health care system should be complementary, because any efficiently organized private health insurance system will reduce the burden on state expenses. Originality/Value: Private health insurance means more prevention, earlier diagnoses and fewer people requiring care that is many times more expensive."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945574","journalIssue":{"objectId":"672de13cfdbe83502228ec5b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XXVII","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"2cc8ad97-9dda-46f9-9664-7bac7b9e9eec"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"791-804","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3549","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e5878c28a0473c65d0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"0921D3A8B70E10FE30D58CFD5290208AB294F929E2545AEB14FBF29DB68840CB931AF84EECA7C61B5D4E6C904C6DD0E5A2FE379367E7941F34BEEDF2DC3DEE67","orcidId":"0000-0003-4134-7628","documentHash":"885db933-bfb0-416e-b410-87b2080fb9fe"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3549"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["flexspline","MEM","polymeric materials","harmonic drive","FDM","3D printing"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Their advantages are the reason why attempts are made to use them in space vehicles or control systems. The next step is to test the feasibility of manufacturing these gears in space using rapid prototyping (RP) methods. Harmonic drives can be produced there from polymer materials because their load in space will be multiple lower. This article presents an analysis of the deformations of the flexspline performed by various rapid prototyping methods from different polymer materials. For the flexspline only deformed by the wave generator, no significant differences were observed between the materials used, but after loading, the most favourable results were obtained for PA 2200 polyamide. The results obtained for various polymer materials will contribute to further work on the design of the harmonic drives, which will be prepared using the RP methods in space."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945576","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839be86fdbe833174263b0e","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"31","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"5f4c30ca-af13-4103-8008-3036a124a009"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"2087-2093","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://hrcak.srce.hr/en/321944","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739520f","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"D9201C9992B766440C08E7D355CCE5B9ACC7566DD92485527212BBEED8E4BF230EB29F892D198E2316B3F4087549E987FE0CA1EE2DFACA689DA994A96ADE17AF","orcidId":"0000-0001-7495-9319","documentHash":"eae1b07b-431a-423d-9ada-bb256a24a08d"}],"doi":"10.17559/tv-20230203000316"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tensile test","metallography","clinch-bonding","clinch-rivet-bonding"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

However, current modern car body concepts require the use of a combination of joining techniques.

Adhesive joints were made using two-component epoxy adhesive Loctite EA 3430. Half of the formed joints were strengthened by pneumatic shot peening of the overlap zone. The shot peening time was 120 s, the ball diameter was 1.0 mm, and the compressed air pressure was 0.5 MPa. The adhesive joints were then subjected to different variants of ageing in natural conditions. Individual variants differed in the length of ageing. The next step was to examine the load capacity of the adhesive joints using a static tensile test. The results were subjected to statistical analyzes, including analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression and correlation analysis, and Student's t test. Based on the analyzes, it was found that for the assumed range of input factor variability, ageing of joints not subjected to shot peening increased their load capacity by 38%. Aging of joints strengthened by shot peening resulted in a 62% decrease in their load capacity. The ageing length had a significant effect on the load capacity of the adhesive joints."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945581","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677f789dfdbe831a91cd2b98","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"126","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"67bc17ba-4503-4b98-aada-a04eae6d1156"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"19-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.prz.edu.pl/tiam/article/view/1756/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c51","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Ozga","uuid":"B165D98C4884B735AEE99E4662410A2858B258BDF4BA8AAF3A302B246C0208E3006FEF146498309C18C020F8E8B0702F2A7B09B96D9BAEA49FEC2CDE5D08B9A8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7359-6007","documentHash":"91ad54f5-95cf-4f82-b47b-acc9b477a300"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739522b","name":"Władysław","lastName":"Zielecki","uuid":"E87A51DD5B727EC27F7974A765E5A0C940D11AA49E4590084477986CCEDF90FA5043117BDF585DBAD19BD9D0517D63876775AC01C3E27CB3A069C1A99C335C32","orcidId":"0000-0002-7864-5525","documentHash":"3a30ad59-262d-46a7-8b70-e42a773a4572"}],"doi":"10.7862/tiam.2024.4.3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["real-time monitoring","information exchange","internet of things","predictive maintenance","ship maintenance","maintenance optimization","digital twins","operational efficiency","maritime industry","data integration"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The proposed TRNG uses jitter in capacitive oscillators as a source of entropy. These capacitive oscillators exploit the input/output (I/O) buffers of a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chip. A specific connection between these buffers allows cyclical charging and discharging of a parasitic capacitance associated with an external FPGA pin. If a few pins of an FPGA chip are not connected to any external components, they can be targeted to build the TRNG. The proposed TRNG requires only three external FPGA pins dedicated to capacitive oscillators, as well as 18 look-up tables (LUTs) and 20 flip-flops (FFs). Its throughput amounts to 11–13 Mbit/s. To pass all NIST SP800-22 statistical tests for a wide range of operating temperatures, the TRNG requires a post-processing circuit. The characteristic feature of the proposed TRNG is that it internally generates a signal indicating that a random bit was just produced. Therefore, no external clock signal is needed to sample the output."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945584","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67499f04fdbe83251666efbf","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"23","doi":"","documentHash":"fd502825-bded-42a7-b3d2-20c65d92410b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/23/4819","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951a9","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Hajduk","uuid":"63DFA2F6941031D7A3081D84067557FBDFB5DA8C8343E4F395FCD2AEBA9CEE32A04F9D63C39D70F4B2BBB11A59681021191E5DC76D65DA9CDB11E3E8C024FB17","orcidId":"0000-0002-1375-7219","documentHash":"b129e8a9-2274-4c37-98b7-b0476c336a18"}],"doi":"10.3390/electronics13234819"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["nowe technologie","usługi spedycyjne","technologiczne trendy rozwojowe"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The aim of the study is to describe the actual force-displacement F-Δ relationship for the tested joints and to represent it numerically by validated models with varying degrees of geometry detailing in the finite element analysis. Validation involves determining properties of plates, bolts and the entire shear joint based on individual experimental testing. The obtained shear characteristic include all main stages of F-Δ connection behaviour, as elastic phase, friction, slip and bearing. Although bearing joints are analysed, friction-slip mechanism resulting from tightening of the bolts is also examined. Analyses also take into account existence of threaded portion of the bolt shank in bearing. FEA model with bolt thread confirmed its validity in terms of predicting load-bearing capacity with an overestimation of 1% with respect to the experimental average. However, simplified cylindrical model of the bolt shank appeared to be more reliable in terms of initial bearing stiffness, where the value was 20% higher comparing to the empirical results. An analytical characteristic of the considered joint was also derived based on the component method, which required certain assumptions and adjustments to include the actual phases of connection behaviour. This approach provided a satisfactory match to the experimental results, characterised by underestimations of maximum force and initial bearing stiffness of 2.5 and 7.6% respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945588","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f287c0fdbe8327371d78f9","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"18","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"08282bc4-20f0-4cfb-bb45-6e1743e20e69"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"33-50","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Validation-of-Numerical-and-Analytical-Model-of-Bearing-Type-Bolted-Steel-Lap-Joint,192527,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc7ffdbe833174262a8c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Snela","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07eeaff0-df22-4806-ba91-109f7f965ba2"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c37","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Budziński","uuid":"C6C613423DF233A81FD05A1377CDAC82E28110EF26E437FB5B698855B219BD487AB7CBB518B5C8BDA9BE37B3A7691AB4959BD950EE291BD6F05A96C871E8D63B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9890-845X","documentHash":"d7b29626-afbf-48a9-b2d1-32ad82b2bb86"},{"objectId":"5e70920c878c28a04738f1ed","name":"Lucjan","lastName":"Ślęczka","uuid":"B93BCA1B377C62E0255E31CA82064117A64875051460207B52F31A4CFFAA7E40EB5543C94CCDF6FC8D4D78DEFCF4B022DE54236142EEA12B13455F8771AF7DDB","orcidId":"0000-0002-8979-7073","documentHash":"ca849cc2-95a7-4d39-af6b-15e8ff133614"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/192527"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["R accuracy","data mining algorithms","mean square error","Python"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The question was asked whether the difficulties in modeling the ecological security of the state are a consequence of limitations in the coherence of four dogmas: ecological security, sustainable development, social responsibility and environmental management. The model was developed after conducting an archival search of literature and management practices on the example of 18 regional cities in Poland. It was assumed that the properties of environmental aspects of cities are a natural quantity influencing the ecological safety of these cities and therefore of each country in the contemporary global civilization system. The research view provided a synthetic picture of regional cities studied in an \"isolated\" way in the context of the organizational maturity of city development in micro-communities for which regional city development policies were adopted. The multi-criteria method allowed us to identify and describe these micro-collections in order to map the macroscopic observation of the development of regional cities emerging from the entire development of the country. This method also allowed us to determine the level of maturity of implementation and respect for the four doctrines in the development of cities, i.e.: ecological safety, social responsibility, sustainable development and environmental management. The research structure is based on the organizational coherence of these doctrines and represents holistic realism, which enabled the use of a synthetic research approach \"from specific to general\". Findings: A synthetic approach to the theory and practice of state development, regional cities and development doctrines allowed for an assessment of the maturity of the coupling of doctrines in all areas of regional city development. The study was inductive and empathetic, therefore it indicated how to improve the maturity of the state management process. The model emphasizes the importance of adopting best development practices, using eco-innovative public services and supporting the involvement of city stakeholders in order to increase the organizational culture of the country's ecological safety. I have developed 13 catalogues of elements of the structure of the development strategy of regional cities in Poland, containing 1 390 public services. Practical implications: The model is needed to improve the diagnosis of administrative decisions and the selection of intervention investments with positive environmental aspects. The model can be used to develop a diagnosis of the development of each city, update the strategy of urban development and analyze social conclusions from the point of view of the environmental aspects of the entire country. The environmental aspects of the state and its cities are still not identified. Originality/Value: This means that the model creates necessary and sufficient boundaries of the state's development, optimizes the state management process, emphasizes the role of the authorities in achieving development efficiency, i.e. in reducing external costs by optimizing the environmental aspects of the state."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945596","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66cc540ffdbe8333b7b969c2","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XXVII","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"7a1170a2-8249-4f0b-aac5-335f545ab1ef"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1432-1454","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3847","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70920c878c28a04738f292","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Lipińska","uuid":"EC13CEEEC62A901B08C22877AD19F90BA1478267C88E93192C0589F4140E57B965A3EC961C9EFD2779C16383551F41F0BD6944A1F1CA33C68C3CA009871D1242","orcidId":"0000-0003-4097-7046","documentHash":"679837c1-89e9-4e6c-acd9-86a5ea07f822"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3847"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["elektrownie jądrowe","ochrona odgromowa","parametry wyładowań atmosferycznych","wyładowania atmosferyczne"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In this regard, the authors have adapted the open-economy multiplier to assess the economic effect of social expenditures. Based on the correlation analysis of the relationship between the share of social expenditures (% of GDP) and the multiplier of social expenditures, conducted on the example of EU countries, two groups of countries are identified depending on the impact of social expenditure multiplier on GDP: the first one embraces those countries that are characterized by a growing economic return from social expenditures; the second one is where the return is declining. To determine the optimal levels of social expenditures, which can be expected to have a positive economic effect in the form of GDP growth, we have identified critical limits of the multiplier of social expenditures according to the principle: the maximum value is seen in the group of countries with positive impact; the minimal one is experienced in countries with inverse dependence of the share of social expenditures and their multiplier. As a result, the experience of financing social expenditures in the EU leads to the conclusion that the optimal share of social expenditures in GDP ranges from 28% to 30% – within these limits multiplier values exceed 1.0, i.e. there is a positive impact of social expenditures on GDP in the form of the growth of economic results over the resources consumed."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945598","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661ab3c4097074fa1bd4336","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"32c062b8-99b7-42c1-b1c5-ab2eb34e427e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"182-195","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.economics-sociology.eu/files/12I_ES%20Yurchyk%20et%20al.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839beb4fdbe833174263c97","name":"Marinko","lastName":"Skare","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2e3f1b5-c330-4e9c-bddd-b9fed36f53b3"},{"objectId":"6839beb4fdbe833174263c96","name":"Halyna","lastName":"Yurchyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c89ebc39-41d7-4662-b3f1-84f378356444"},{"objectId":"6839beb4fdbe833174263c95","name":"Halyna","lastName":"Mishchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"86512098-aeff-46b4-9336-e2abd110bd95"},{"objectId":"5e7094ec878c28a0473c6e69","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Bilan","uuid":"D468226D398B72748054431E9B854CA4E6DCD90834FE02561018F15C75823A3342F8E017A7ED4681028C75F81C2AEC7358C65458B744CEBA51C4A1E1BD2F3CBC","orcidId":"0000-0001-9814-5459","documentHash":"12d23cfb-16e8-4597-808c-1853554b6fcd"}],"doi":"10.14254/2071-789x.2024/17-1/12"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6839fed1fdbe833174264c59","doi":null,"title":"International Heritage and Cultural Conservation Conference Proceeding","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-629-98726-6-5","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://publisher.uts.edu.my/index.php/e-book/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"1a3ed409-887a-4952-8df2-127c2cbac7c6","publisher":{"objectId":"6839fed1fdbe833174264c5a","mniswId":null,"name":"UTS Publisher","documentHash":"69f04617-cc68-4e40-9f18-67daae795a79"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In addition, a tool life model was developed, taking into account the cutting blade work angle parameter, the laser marking method for the round cutting insert, and a wear measurement methodology. The developed tool wear model provides an accuracy of 90% in predicting the flank wear of the cutting blade.

The obtained polymer microspheres were characterized using different instrumental and physicochemical techniques, modified with a zero-order PAMAM dendrimer, and impregnated with palladium(II) acetate solutions to immobilize palladium(II) ions. The resulting materials were preliminarily examined as catalysts in the Suzuki reaction between 4-bromotoluene and phenylboronic acid.

It was assumed that the level of sub-productivity of countries is indicated by resource productivity, efficiency and closed-loop. As a result of the realised comparative analysis of Poland and Slovakia, it was found that during the analysed period, there was a general trend of productivity growth in both countries. These countries are successively implementing the activities associated with the transformation of a closed-loop economy and the provisions of the SDGs. The analysed countries in part of the examined tasks related to the provisions of Agenda 2030 achieve a result higher than the EU average, but they have not reached the goal that is most related to the subject of the undertaken analysis (doubling the level of consumption of closed-loop materials by 2030 concerning 2020). The productivity level of the two countries and the rate of their growth in relation to the EU were considered moderately satisfactory. Recommendations arising from the benchmarking exercise mainly relate to further implementation of the rationale of a closed-loop economy and improvement of the legal and institutional environment stimulating activities associated with optimising the use of resources through sensible design and keeping materials in circulation, decoupling economic development from the consumption of scarce resources, developing innovation and stimulating the development of new technologies."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945602","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839becefdbe833174263d62","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"23","number":"3A (63A)","doi":null,"documentHash":"e76d4a67-1562-4ce1-9495-3127eb778ed2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1147-1163","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.transformations.knf.vu.lt/63a/article/prod","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839becefdbe833174263d63","name":"Beata","lastName":"Gavurova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fbf91d16-de73-43e4-adf1-ac4dcf0a1a81"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b199b","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Czerwińska","uuid":"64CDB60500769BC1EF7D66A65C268878DC166F4ED13BCAAA0CC929A4C83EACBA5CD9A71C0B05643EE54D9B3C838E1D0E40373205A3815DF7DD7052EB763E1E8C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2150-0963","documentHash":"ee3ced10-96cf-4de4-9a16-0f1d6dc68ed6"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Green technology innovation","Environmental information disclosure","Green energy development","Green finance development","Industrial structure transformation"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Environmental information disclosure (EID) has become a widely used form of third-party participation ecological regulation, and the study of its impact on green energy development (GED) is receiving more and more academic attention. However, the research on this issue is still insufficient in academia. Based on resource-based theory and information processing theory, with IPE project of pollution information survey in China as an exogenous impact, this paper analyzes the causal impact of EID for GED using panel data of 285 Chinese cities from 2000 to 2020. The findings revealed that EID is a strong driver of GED in the long run, further amplified by the smart city pilot program. Besides, industrial structure transformation (IST), substantive green technological innovation (SGTI), non-substantive green technological innovation (NOSGTI), and green finance development (GFD) are important mediating mechanisms through which EID facilitates the GED. Concerning resource endowments of different regions and cities, the heterogeneity test asserted that the promotion effect of EID for GED is best in resource-based cities and old industrial parks. These results emphasize the importance of public participation in urban sustainable development and provide new ideas for promoting green growth."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945603","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bd85fdbe8331742632a5","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"237","number":"C","doi":null,"documentHash":"cfbc11df-747d-4dbe-a15f-fefdba8df104"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148124017701?via=ihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd85fdbe8331742632a9","name":"Irum","lastName":"Shahzadi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9588548f-c569-43f2-82f0-2d73d1184fdf"},{"objectId":"6839bd85fdbe8331742632a8","name":"Ximeng","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8be67a6d-d81c-4077-be29-fb70a9a7c137"},{"objectId":"6839bd85fdbe8331742632a7","name":"Jian","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d6d400e-0e26-45ea-bc7f-f30ef0660d26"},{"objectId":"6839bd85fdbe8331742632a6","name":"László","lastName":"Vasa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a8407da-0df5-44d5-bdbd-9e317b9e8d7b"},{"objectId":"5e7094d7878c28a0473c522b","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Wolanin","uuid":"7BDA9391E92B0F6AE522A9E357C4C9813657C6CCEDEF94FCFF33D8BED0037490E0074D46E01E5F0EBFE390934E218A540E598647091CD15613F3865199D337C1","orcidId":"0000-0003-0387-4275","documentHash":"7f0b7d95-4352-4c85-81d3-78008ecd168f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.renene.2024.121702"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["boundary integral equations","fast multipole methods","modified upward translations","clusters"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

For large-scale problems, the BEM system is solved iteratively by speeding up matrix-to-vector multiplications by applying a kernel-independent fast multipole method. Multiplication starts with source-to-multipole (S2M) translations, whose accuracy predefines the overall accuracy. We aim to increase the accuracy of these translations. The intensities of sources are assembled into clusters by an algorithm suggested. Each of them is characterized by its representative source, whose intensity equals the sum of the intensities of cluster sources. Thus, with growing distance, its field tends toward the field of the cluster. The accuracy of S2M translations is increased by subtracting from and adding to the far field of the cluster the far field of its representative source, and by using the proposed modified kernel to evaluate the difference of the fields, which decreases faster than the field of the cluster itself. Numerical results for typical kernels show a notable increase in the accuracy provided by the modified S2M translations. Keeping in them merely the added field is acceptable for many practical applications. This simplifies the modified S2M translations by avoiding calculation and storing matrices specific to each of the clusters. The improved translations may be also used for multipole-to-multipole translations, performed on next, after leaves, levels in upward running a hierarchical tree."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945603","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d56908fdbe8351d922a2c0","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"17","doi":null,"documentHash":"3a5a6615-3ebc-4358-b5aa-ea6fb916227c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/17/7543","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d56a","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Rejwer - Kosińska","uuid":"941197C00D7E6AC884E293A33DF243222823D2855DD1C49FBD0BC033CB1AC3E2A094D52782C79EAA62C3F0B811E1623D0112CADF9E3BC747F05BD6A91E8341FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-8788-2090","documentHash":"a5a4e0c5-c557-4f6d-8f41-1c513622d08c"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395235","name":"Liliana","lastName":"Rybarska-Rusinek","uuid":"A3B6158FFF3F1A06E991CFC219D019DD1976521E56745DB97E4F76FC8DB8BB3ECB9EC54CEC41FC70E5F2F686AC82410199BFAEBC51EA9FDBF07663445EC079BA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7978-6285","documentHash":"1f282a82-bf36-4a1e-92cd-7a65df807a7e"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395232","name":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Linkov","uuid":"A0F728362291ED3155E7EAD1773797C1FDBB7811ADEC5285CF607B2EC618C30030E551E8348CD37E1C6D20936EB7CD5D5560A6A58D317CC1ED3C5A1B488D2BAA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0971-3499","documentHash":"838a8772-1a4f-48e3-81fa-74f2928d96ef"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14177543"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7934-737-7","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

What was, is and will be the research context related to employee well-being? Q2. Who is the most influential author who it is worth collaborating with in research? Q3. Which scientific organizations should be contacted when planning research projects? Q4. In which journals should one publish to reach the largest number of people interested in the issue of employee well-being? Design/Methodology/Approach: The analysis covered publications obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection for the period from 1989 (the first publication in this area of knowledge) to the end of 2023. The collection consisted of 1,720 items. The VOSviewer program was used for the scientometric analysis, and UCINET 6 for Windows with the NetDraw 2 application for the analysis of centrality measures. Findings: The analyses allowed us to answer the following questions: Q1. The most important research contexts are employee well-being considered from the employee's perspective, the importance of employee well-being for the organization and employee well-being in the context of leadership. An evolution of interest can be observed from the initial search for definitions of concepts and theoretical models to the currently prevailing practical research using statistical modeling. Further multidisciplinary practical research should be expected, using modeling and developing specific diagnostic tools for the needs of management sciences. Q2. Based on the analysis of centrality measures, the following can be recommended as potential co-authors for further research: B.A. Bakker, A. van den Broeck, M. van Veldhoven and H. de Witte. Q3. The organizations that create the greatest potential for cooperation in projects in the field of employee well-being are: Erasmus University Rotterdam and Katholieke Universiteit Leuven. Q4. The first-choice journals for researchers studying employee well-being in the context of management should be: Personnel Review, International Journal of Human Resource Management and Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology. Practical Implications: The obtained results may be a hint for scientists interested in various contexts of employee well-being for further research and for cooperation with indicated researchers and organizations. Taking into account the indications resulting from the study should increase the effectiveness of disseminating the results of their research and acquired knowledge. Originality/Value: This is the first article to undertake scientometric research and analyze centrality measures in the field of employee well-being. This topic, although considered in the context of management sciences for 35 years, has not yet been analyzed in this way. This study helps fill this research gap."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945606","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bd98fdbe83317426333f","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"XXVIΙ","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"d5d80f37-1dfa-42cf-8e5b-b48526a731dd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"693-715","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3812","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d596","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Oleniuch","uuid":"FCBD62408CB65662DF54BC86A35AE2EEEFB48240595D29CABB5C66CD8F4F630DDD8952DA66F2756DB4A124E71538207E2E6B8D6F567E8A38133C44F805FD09A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0246-2113","documentHash":"3ffb36dc-8032-4443-96bf-def0f7822f61"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3812"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Plasma–enhanced chemical vapor deposition","Spinel cobalt oxide","Oxygen vacancies","Cobalt vacancies","Oxygen evolution reaction"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c9878c28a0473b0b8e","5e70936f878c28a0473a9903","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b5f","5e70946c878c28a0473bca86"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deee","uid":"bKZ4FIMz473eBfPKMOlBfQQ","uuid":"29b47066-4dca-4b1d-ba55-14e3ee02fb1a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deee","parentUuid":"29b47066-4dca-4b1d-ba55-14e3ee02fb1a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deee","rootUuid":"29b47066-4dca-4b1d-ba55-14e3ee02fb1a","name":"Narodowe Centrum Badań Jądrowych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7c1517085dcb410a25ea65","674fccb8ece3984d1d49c23c"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6839c4f8fdbe8368347d2b78"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","uid":"bnXIe5Gp0q3Tkxqm6btR47Q","uuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","parentUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","rootUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","name":"Instytut Wysokich Ciśnień Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709481878c28a0473bea40"]},{"id":"5e7091b8878c28a04738637d","uid":"bgYH5DTa0H-ctvBj2APXs_A","uuid":"b4a408ef-359b-46df-a6dc-5a0bb5511a72","parentId":"5e7091b8878c28a04738637d","parentUuid":"b4a408ef-359b-46df-a6dc-5a0bb5511a72","rootId":"5e7091b8878c28a04738637d","rootUuid":"b4a408ef-359b-46df-a6dc-5a0bb5511a72","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz -

Among cobalt – based materials, spinel Co3O4 is a widely studied catalyst; however, its bulk form often suffers from poor electrical conductivity and limited accessibility of active sites. In this study, we demonstrate that plasma–enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), followed by thermal annealing in air, provides an effective route for vacancy engineering in CoxOy thin films inducing both oxygen and cobalt vacancies without relying on foreign dopants or ion–exchange processes. The Co3O4 films demonstrated exceptional OER performance, with the best sample achieving a low overpotential of 343 mV at 10 mA cm–2, and a high capability for Co4+ formation, a key intermediate in the OER process. Additionally, the films exhibited catalytic activity not only at the surface, but also throughout their entire volume, highlighting the significance of deposition time and film thickness in optimizing OER performance. Ab–initio calculations, including Bader charge analysis and density of states evaluations, further elucidate the role of defect chemistry: oxygen vacancies enhance *OH adsorption and drive structural reconstruction, while cobalt vacancies reduce the energy barrier for deprotonation and facilitate the Co3+ → Co4+ oxidation process. Overall, this work establishes PECVD combined with thermal treatment as a powerful and scalable strategy for tailoring defect concentrations in cobalt oxide catalysts.

The three-span supporting structure was built in 1975 in the form of two steel plate girders, braced with crossbeams, on which a heat pipeline consists of two pipes with a diameter of 100 cm, was placed. To adapt the existing steel structure to the new live loads, the steel girders were strengthened by increasing their cross-section and depth. Furthermore, to minimise the dead load of the structure after reconstruction, lightweight FRP composite panels were used as a deck slab for the new footbridge. The FRP panels were connected to the steel girders by special connectors, but without the composite action between the steel girders and the new deck. Due to the use of new material for the deck slab, the city administration required the implementation of a monitoring system to control the technical condition of the panels. Therefore, the structural health monitoring (SHM) system based on distributed fibre optic sensing (DFOS) technology has been implemented in FRP panels. DFOS enables continuous measurements to be acquired along the entire length of the structure, which is particularly crucial for these types of bridge decks. Before the new footbridge was put into use, a superstructure proof load test was carried out to verify its load-bearing capacity and to check the operation of the monitoring system. The article presents the method of reconstruction and strengthening of the existing steel structure, the DFOS-based monitoring system as well as the results of the proof load test and the control of the monitoring system."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945608","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839fccafdbe833174264733","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"64","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"24f7cb64-2237-4e0b-8286-719e3a8be3e6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1339-1346","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452321624009739","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d535","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kulpa","uuid":"790D759C417F50A6620906E9A13EC3DFC8B19327848731DC4677A87F2585D690A7D8EF4F552C30710DEA51241C7D3588B2770060CD19C6E73838497AAA0C3B9A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8550-7382","documentHash":"eb8b0b8b-00f6-4656-b102-e3c2345c36b4"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395160","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Siwowski","uuid":"60E8AE045DE688D769347355C56C8ACF612FC404CCB43774DF91B6FB20CB70B23B67D3647BC155D695119572CBE4E944782E8D58B9D096B9ABC47EF17FDFF467","orcidId":"0000-0002-2003-000X","documentHash":"ce87cefc-d930-4bec-971d-b5a30ea41ab0"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.prostr.2024.09.369"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6839fea3fdbe83317426496f","doi":"10.1007/978-981-99-6690-5","title":"High Performance Computing, Smart Devices and Networks.

Therefore, chitosan based hydrogels have been fabricated by physical crosslinking of the polymer chains via sol–gel method using sodium β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) for silver ions (Ag) removal from water solutions. The aim of this study was to provide experimental studies under batch conditions to perform adsorption isotherm and evaluate the effect of silver adsorption onto chitosan hydrogel morphological and structural changes using SEM, XRD, FTIR and EDX analyses. Obtained results provides the data on the structural changes in the chitosan hydrogels under Ag adsorption process. The FTIR spectra confirmed that the C-NH2 and OH groups contribute to the formation of chitosan - silver ion complexes. The presence of adsorbed Ag in the samples < 0.8 gAgL− 1 were evidenced by the characteristic peak at 2θ = 46.35◦. Regarding to EDX analysis the adsorption efficiency toward Ag ions, rises with an increase in Ag initial concentration, resulting in L-type isotherm. The percentage removal of silver ions efficiency obtained 34 % for the highest Ag initial concentration (10 gAg L− 1 ).

A detailed microstructure study of both as-deposited and hydrothermally treated coatings was conducted with scanning and transmission electron microscopy supported by ASTAR orientation mapping and chemical analysis via energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. Macro-scale measurements of residual stresses were carried out using the classical sin2ψ method in an X-ray diffractometer (XRD), while the novel multi-HKL method, based on grazing-incidence XRD, was used to determine of the stresses at a specific depths. The results demonstrate that hydrothermal treatment is a highly efficient method allowing to fully transform the MAO coatings which initially contained a fraction of amorphous phase, into a fully crystalline structure, while preserving high mechanical properties. The grains of TiO2-anatase crystallographic variant grow in various forms: equiaxed, elongated or nanorods, both at the expense of amorphous phase and due to coarsening of original ultra-fine grains. The low solubility of phosphorus and sodium in TiO2-anatase resulted in a decrease in their content in hydrothermally treated coatings. For all the coatings, a favorable change in the stress field, to compressive stresses, was observed."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945611","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6836cf21fdbe833b4d1dca7c","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"343","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f9627f69-039d-465f-b2ba-0bdac0ad37e7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"343","pagesFromTo":"131001","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0254058425006479","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839e1f2fdbe8368347e7016","name":"U.","lastName":"Kolb","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d830b6e-522d-4f87-95db-1d069d800e7f"},{"objectId":"6839e1f2fdbe8368347e7015","name":"M.O.","lastName":"Cichocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"830c6939-8507-42c6-9516-724cc4311efd"},{"objectId":"6839e1f2fdbe8368347e7014","name":"F.","lastName":"Muhaffel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e62b4a7b-3c9b-42ea-81a7-f53c1cf1f62f"},{"objectId":"619c60397523402fabddfb05","name":"Anna","lastName":"Trelka-Druzic","uuid":"B48C2D3A0CE64202D8EB230CD90729F296D54E30D607D280E0E75EF84E9213A0402E915F1A08F96317396622A85B339FAE7A4B8A2306600BE4B8A172A37E8319","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61ebd636-697a-4efb-86cc-1fae1662c18e"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bea4b","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Kulczyk","uuid":"266BA9C0F5498C6FCEC667D702897DCEE4646EAC022DD31D61A1775D88A73ECB233D2B23B8C5E55E790BDA76C32328EA5332C9A00CABAF24DA18139A0D0EEF8E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6892-8070","documentHash":"093dd194-2f29-44c6-bf24-d9b143a4d8e6"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0fe","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wierzbicka - Miernik","uuid":"A438E4256952DED19D40507FB0BFABD544BFE31CB10A13028D78640A7F2B8E8EEB1B8DEA56DE8EFE9E9EFFF0A6232C736FBB299A99CC8B442EE0F83505079131","orcidId":"0000-0002-3343-2374","documentHash":"5747b0f8-c606-46d6-b5cd-16d9061dc67c"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0f8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Góral","uuid":"739D14B53839140BF4FAA72C138780472B0F9273A64ABC3BC9B6ECF0DFF15A3A02879BEF666E6CB61E50CA2F0EE32C91875EF942B6697C8691CFDD7DF4CF13FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-7823-0496","documentHash":"a9ed6836-d8fe-4ebf-b090-ff4d51ca35e5"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac999","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Maj","uuid":"C89EB61A18127031891E7F8D10A54CE2EBED0CC12790A1B98166E236B878F3665E7173745435E2597A0775AF07D43685F90EF850882974B4A1C885F259B40363","orcidId":"0000-0001-8287-0146","documentHash":"9c64ecb7-a325-4f78-b31c-88abe2a0bbd8"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b740","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Petrzak","uuid":"6E21319E8E61106EE2C0B02FAAEA3199FE1D7B97AA1F8B42117BC97B61891B12D0ED9C4C30BFA14A52A4364F5B0F455A299EE516F22C40986D979AC09865348D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8981-1480","documentHash":"10093047-7623-4978-9f65-d66f837c7c55"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.matchemphys.2025.131001"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nutrition knowledge","alcohol","nicotine","substance use","medical students"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc81","uid":"bjwG-H5KkyMtacXPwfRFCTQ","uuid":"6df72f86-fe9b-4e01-9121-db36db218bd8","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc81","parentUuid":"6df72f86-fe9b-4e01-9121-db36db218bd8","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc81","rootUuid":"6df72f86-fe9b-4e01-9121-db36db218bd8","name":"Uniwersytet Dolnośląski DSW we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709304878c28a0473a12eb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Impact of Dietary Habits and Nutrition Knowledge on Harmful Alcohol Use and Nicotine Dependence Among Medical Students: A Single-Center, Cross-Sectional Study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"NUTRIENTS","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2072-6643","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"e4b0a5e0-ccb5-47f4-acc5-f024bb369bf3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839c036fdbe8368347d0dc5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709304878c28a0473a12eb","6839c036fdbe8368347d0dc7","6839c036fdbe8368347d0dc8","6839c036fdbe8368347d0dc9","6839c036fdbe8368347d0dca"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Harmful alcohol use and nicotine dependence are major public health concerns. One group particularly at risk may be medical students, who might resort to substance use as a coping mechanism for stress. Various factors may influence these behaviors, either positively or negatively—among them, dietary knowledge and eating habits. Methods: In this study, we used the KOMPAN questionnaire to assess dietary habits and nutrition knowledge, the AUDIT questionnaire to evaluate problematic alcohol consumption, and the Fagerström Test to assess nicotine dependence. A total of 2801 medical students participated in this study, including 2374 alcohol users and 379 smokers. Results: Smoking students demonstrated significantly lower dietary quality (p < 0.0001) and nutrition knowledge (p = 0.0004). Among alcohol users, lower levels of problematic alcohol consumption were observed in individuals with better dietary quality (p = 0.0006) and higher nutrition knowledge (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Future research should explore additional factors contributing to the clustering of unhealthy behaviors and the underlying causes of alcohol consumption and poor dietary habits among healthcare professionals."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945613","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839c036fdbe8368347d0dc6","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"fa78fddf-8903-4d97-aaf8-6d98149d6f69"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1788","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/11/1788","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839c036fdbe8368347d0dca","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Hariasz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be6ef974-a4cc-4f9c-9b64-c5014be9244c"},{"objectId":"6839c036fdbe8368347d0dc9","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Makles","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ae18202-b3e4-42b3-b974-953da41870b2"},{"objectId":"6839c036fdbe8368347d0dc8","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Kuźnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8e811f4-80b4-41d4-8a6e-456ac3edc69e"},{"objectId":"6839c036fdbe8368347d0dc7","name":"Bartosz Bogusz","lastName":"Adamczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f1c6d000-0d27-4884-81d8-45f35743b1b9"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12eb","name":"Aureliusz","lastName":"Kosendiak","uuid":"F4276692E357AF65B6AB175E7BEF615C4BD13AE9528E2033CB112A79510D71088EC19BE5CF7808F2DE78A3C7C3C8AF85DAA9B38FBA6413FF1338FE15242AF9A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2075-5438","documentHash":"e187b212-846d-4619-8e66-4df7f17f914c"}],"doi":"10.3390/nu17111788"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["risk assessment techniques","risk identification","risk mitigation strategies","Project risk management and methodologies"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Using density functional theory calculations, we identify the impact of indium content and temperature on the mobility of nitrogen, gallium, and indium atoms, revealing key differences in their migration energy barriers. Furthermore, we investigate the lateral diffusion of indium and gallium atoms, as well as complexes of substitutional metal atoms with vacancies, through a vacancy-mediated mechanism in individual metal layers of In(x)Ga(1-x)N/GaN. Our results show that increasing indium concentration reduces migration barriers, enhancing defect mobility, particularly for indium atoms. These findings highlight the critical role of indium sublattice in promoting lattice relaxation and defect redistribution, while also elucidating the temperature-dependent dynamics of vacancy-mediated diffusion."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945616","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839cf87fdbe8368347da170","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"a19328a0-318d-49b9-92d4-56354b11a43e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"53003","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/add049","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc49bb9085dcb1e6ae0b866","name":"Roman","lastName":"Hrytsak","uuid":"D66F338E20487FFFFA9641D2C21F10778CDE17E93E466511216D76A05EBD2917F004FE6FD9CE54E9085FE17D76EC33D6DC7F6AAAE04A163A4D81198666F75AE4","orcidId":"0000-0002-5467-0953","documentHash":"78a8b650-0373-4ef8-b472-0f8a59ad26e4"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bea67","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Grzanka","uuid":"4FE27496E14EE1D5DF8E57912FDCE77A8E8757E42C5D4F67091333389DE8843C272FA4CCFB6099419845DD5B684B0760AEBE2B8B8B21392A18E2C225C7B64C2F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5123-1480","documentHash":"07a91e49-8a0d-4e59-b4e4-e4e737ba7bfe"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5917","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kempisty","uuid":"297D4BB0037ABCF2BD2C107CAF3939A7B26192FEEC3392E1F9C5A7C6B5E4FA233F2E7F2132C9B094CCDCFC8AA82CE07355C68241555366CF0E35751E36170E70","orcidId":"0000-0003-0700-5560","documentHash":"06eda3d9-1b7f-4f6b-86fe-4bdf31f919bc"},{"objectId":"5e709216878c28a04738fb34","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Sznajder","uuid":"6DC2B29A2ED99F729310C2F571AF44663CE09A422C1D761DC4959572F8F527146285E864F6C6B81EAAE7AF9837A989228C01641BD3389036A35543AB7E0DE77E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4701-9991","documentHash":"8fccf1ff-e227-42c6-99a0-59010f1a21b6"}],"doi":"10.1088/1367-2630/add049"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.
