A qualitative analysis of the distribution of microstructure components was performed based on surface mapping. Precipitates differing in their degree of grayness and shape were identified based on microanalysis of their chemical composition. The porosity assessment of coatings performed in five randomly selected areas amounts to an average of 9%. The applied coatings exhibit good adhesion to the substrate, as evidenced by the absence of delamination during scratching tests using a diamond Rockwell indenter loaded with a force of 10 N.

Home appliances have a great potential to optimize electricity consumption by mitigating peaks in the grid load or peaks in renewable energy generation. However, such functionality of home appliances requires their users to change their behavior regarding energy consumption. One of the criteria that could encourage electricity users to change their behavior is the cost of energy. The introduction of dynamic energy prices can significantly increase energy costs for unsuspecting consumers. In order to be able to make the right decisions about the process of electricity use in households, an algorithm based on machine learning is proposed. The presented proposal for optimizing electricity consumption takes into account dynamic changes in energy prices, energy production from renewable energy sources, and home appliances that can participate in the energy optimization process. The proposed model uses data from smart meters and dynamic price information to generate personalized recommendations tailored to individual households. The algorithm, based on machine learning and historical household behavior data, calculates a metric to determine whether to send a notification (message) to the user. This notification may suggest increasing or decreasing energy consumption at a specific time, or may inform the user about potential cost fluctuations in the upcoming hours. This will allow energy users to use energy more consciously or to set priorities in home energy management systems (HEMS). This is a different approach than in previous publications, where the main goal of optimizing energy consumption was to optimize the operation of the power system while taking into account the profits of energy suppliers.

On the basis of the measured values of the total cutting force F and the roughness parameters Ra and Rz of machined surfaces, the relationships between specified cutting parameters and the analyzed roughness parameters were determined. Regression model of cutting force F was developed considering statistically significant cutting parameters. The developed model was validated using an additional set of recorded force values. Regression models were also created for the roughness parameters Ra and Rz of machined surfaces but they were found to be too inaccurate for the prediction of the aforementioned texture parameters. After analysis of the results obtained, it was found that the cutting speed vc had no effect on the value of the total cutting force F, while its influence on the roughness parameters was noticeable. It was also shown that, of the technological parameters ap, ae and fz within the assumed ranges of variation, the depth of cut ap, has the greatest effect on the cutting force F, the width of cut ae and the feed rate fz have a smaller effect. It was also shown that in the case of low cutting speeds vc the parameter Ra of the machined surface roughness strongly depends on the depth of cut ap and width of cut ae. At the same time it was noticed an increase in the Rz parameter with decreasing cutting speed vc. The remaining technological parameters, however, also significantly affect the obtained values of the Rz roughness parameter measured on the machined surface."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945622","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6763dc73fdbe837ab135d81d","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"18","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"a17fe703-0c04-4653-901a-fc4a7da65f0f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"181-190","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/The-Effect-of-Milling-Parameters-of-Vanadis-4-Extra-Steel-on-Cutting-Force-Values,193805,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f6878c28a0473c809e","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kawalec","uuid":"FFFB0CE089B887F3CA4C234BC943594893B63D7B83A2514FFCBF7657F3CC3560B0D9A9D6D4E7E76232DEC9BF735AAF3C55AED8D6129B913E4E31105D4242B206","orcidId":"0000-0003-3612-0971","documentHash":"6de550cd-f03b-48c5-aea9-3cc1dde2b73f"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c4e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Tymczyszyn","uuid":"BF9B0FB4D607D17BE8FE312F109C3960A0516AF53535E2D5FB2E8A8B7B9324D3185636BC120E20250A5A157A1893F60429672C3A30545E9572F6A35583ABF861","orcidId":"0000-0003-2972-5112","documentHash":"15b09549-db8a-4125-9428-3d3824337323"},{"objectId":"5e7093df878c28a0473b24da","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kubik","uuid":"344F9068432AFE3E7160E1535208F631528EB25B6C7B5E1CC5583C808005E2E7BA7BE14BA9C959ED04A6E53C9794695CCC2C31B6C8DD81F25B4F8FC7FD66B65F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8529-0884","documentHash":"2ddf456d-c38b-4e03-853d-66339294142a"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d590","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bazan","uuid":"967FA371E29ED24ABF925F07CF6105EBD710EFFB90D7C575C0B3F590212E5F0CCB7B0DF7314061152A17200174064F63FFA47AA54CA7A33B2DCED033D81E5ABB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3958","documentHash":"2774275d-15c9-4ad4-9054-26be33ad88fb"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c46e","name":"Artur","lastName":"Szajna","uuid":"254F9B409DE716F59BE0EE1B14EA5C65FA7ECBD0BD72A6915BC40A7FBF48609798BF7ED59ACED13D57AA5EC8DAAB8C2D8F884C1A96BA0043A125A45870F80FB2","orcidId":"0000-0002-3820-7272","documentHash":"3380212d-1a43-41ee-badd-83e5c6188bf8"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c44e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Rydzak","uuid":"E00BA1218ACA91FFFF0E4C2E310214324E2B9EA6E8E1C7E7C75053769F76F4E64965DE389145825C8C180339CFDA94697D14DB2B0926A5277CA2C2A5290F6D59","orcidId":"0000-0003-0766-3360","documentHash":"7ca41dfa-3ae9-416a-ac76-cc27710c2c6a"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/193805"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"66546ee04097075a84f33fcd","doi":null,"title":"Współczesne konteksty bezpieczeństwa","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7934-710-0","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1435744567","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"d47d3c7d-c01a-468a-a000-4a64dd870a2b","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb89a","mniswId":"48500","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This requires a significant amount of Portland cement, and the cement industry, in turn, causes a significant amount of CO2 emissions. Therefore, the development of concrete with a reduced cement content is becoming an urgent problem for countries with a significant level of production and consumption of concrete. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to critically investigate the possibility of using inert granite dust in combination with highly active silica fume in reactive powder concrete. The main physical and mechanical properties, such as the compressive strength at different curing ages and the water absorption, were studied using mathematical planning of experiments. The consistency and microstructure of the reactive powder concrete modified with granite dust in combination with silica fume were also analyzed. Mathematical models of the main properties of this concrete are presented and analyzed, and the graphical dependencies of the influence of composition factors are constructed. A more significant factor that affects the compressive strength at all curing ages is the silica fume content, increases in which to 50 kg/m3 lead to a 25–40% increase in strength at 1 day of age, depending on the granite dust content. In turn, an increase in the amount of granite dust from 0 kg/m3 to 100 kg/m3 in the absence of silica is followed by an increase in strength of 8–10%. After 3 days of curing, the effect of granite dust becomes more significant. Increases in the 28-day strength of 25%, 46% and 56% were obtained at a content of 50 kg/m3 of silica fume and 0 kg/m3, 100 kg/m3 and 200 kg/m3 of granite dust in concrete, respectively. It is shown that the effect of inert granite dust is more significant in combination with silica fume at its maximum content in the range of variation. The pozzolanic reaction between highly active silica and Ca(OH)2 stimulates the formation of hydrate phases in the space between the grains and causes the microstructure of the cement matrix to compact. In this case, the granite dust particles act as crystallization centers."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945626","journalIssue":{"objectId":"675be9f4fdbe834a822912d9","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"24","doi":null,"documentHash":"36be91ce-e6db-46b9-af58-d1d492d4b92b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/24/6025","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdf4fdbe83317426361f","name":"Vitalii","lastName":"Marchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7a14e22-48c3-4e25-8ec2-090b28523bcb"},{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c43be","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Huts","uuid":"C76C4A58A5B7DDAB06FFD2E218C738ED841A48DD132B236A30D08AB6A9E8A8CA9D29E0E79495256D1B754F62389276BF46A653E269157D7398E7A6567FA0EBF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-4428-8339","documentHash":"dde7dff7-a33a-43d3-a66f-50df3e445402"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395182","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Konkol","uuid":"5CA9C7674C6B3FEDAB01A1F7D6FEE7E8C12B44133A4917730A202F0B1C5D8946D730CFC499953B173383DBB21211B746D23C45492C4F17D336FF3205191666A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2474-4958","documentHash":"a3cf5c8b-ba70-432b-b636-b8b9645f871d"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17246025"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6656e614409707281753e6e6","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-44955-0","title":"Proceedings of CEE 2023: Civil and Environmental Engineering and Architecture","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-44954-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-44955-0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"9602de13-200e-40bb-85d4-63f311d8503e","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Unfortunately, the design and organization of such processes pose a significant problem, due to, among other things, the high variability of the process as a consequence of both the degree of wear and tear and the quality of the remanufactured components. This article presents a method for optimizing the flow of the brake caliper remanufacturing process in the MTO (make-to-order) model. For the optimization process, the system dynamics (SD) method, which belongs to a group of simulation methods, was used. The developed model allows, in particular, the prediction of the number of components at the input to the regeneration process and the method of defining the size of the transport batch and evaluating its impact on the length of the production cycle of the batch of regenerated products. The issues of staffing management at individual positions and the organization of transport operations with variable production batch sizes were also discussed. The provided experiments have shown that reducing the size of the transport batch contributes to shortening the production order execution time, both with standard and increased staffing."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945629","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ae510e40970719776fa7d7","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f36e35cf-41f2-4a47-b8b5-5bb240842ada"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/12/1/16","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdb8fdbe83317426345a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd520a9c-83c5-4284-bf67-7975f75f885b"},{"objectId":"6839bdb8fdbe833174263459","name":"Michał","lastName":"Cioch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aee9c9d8-d76e-47cd-b6c4-67e255488b28"},{"objectId":"6839bdb8fdbe833174263458","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Gola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1559c57a-5d41-4dc7-aebb-dcb73208648a"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951fb","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Litwin","uuid":"F22A85D5EEC362FCE69CA96396B12BEFCFEE814BC098DFDA77099B30BE716C68F49F11D839C4886CB81D40A05CCF68FDB6D6F0531AC440F6034AB27B3D8D4021","orcidId":"0000-0002-4497-6553","documentHash":"d755a6b3-5efe-452e-9bab-e9a1e49b4338"}],"doi":"10.3390/pr12010016"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["risk management","small and medium-sized enterprises","Poland","risk"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The samples were prepared in HQ (High Quality) mode with a layer height 0.016 [mm]. The tests included a static torsion test using a specialized research stand by the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Rzeszów University of Technology. The scope of research significantly expanded the standard procedure, which complements the material data available with significant functional parameters due to the use of models.

This is how a few derivative frame systems of special trapezial forms are created in relation to the  basic rectangular frame characterized by vertical single-branch columns and a horizontal lattice girder. The specificity of the loads imposed on the flat systems is fastening of each roof cladding with each corrugation to the upper chord of the considered frame girder. Thus, the imposed load should be considered as a uniform distribution over the entire length of the chord. The presented results are to be used in the next steps of the research, where the flat transverse frame systems changing their shapes along the length of a building are to be analysed. The obtained results are going to be implemented in a future method for parametric shaping of unconventional forms of buildings and their optimized structural systems. The elaborated structures constitute a certain uniform area of analysis of flat lattice girders, selected from a large number of areas analysed or planned for research, including related to oblique lattice girders or frames with diversified static schemes."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945636","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b853fdbe833174260b59","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"71","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e070ffac-9050-4cf0-b97a-e2c6975e2e40"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"67-81","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.prz.edu.pl/jceea/article/view/1820","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e0524935","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Chrzanowska","uuid":"7AC6462451C098BAAEB6A67F7F58A9754CFD0400EC42EBA434D45D4E7212DAC89EB1F811B5201E0359AC1C4A8C7A3E1C08D29CD3C967A2EFC403A99BD1D6E636","orcidId":"0000-0002-6873-6984","documentHash":"c3546baf-b605-454f-8df1-ae9506d735cf"}],"doi":"10.7862/rb.2024.5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["roof trusses","failure testing","reinforcement of connections","timber structures","design of connections"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Standardisation changes, i.e. the introduction of Eurocodes in 2010, resulted in, among other things, increasing the values of recommended climatic loads. Due to the above, in structures built several years ago, the load capacity limit for both timber and fasteners is exceeded. Modernisation of structures with these trusses usually leads to the need to strengthen existing nodes. The issue of strengthening connections with punched metal plate fasteners is poorly recognised in experimental (failure) tests, and thus there are no detailed standard guidelines. The purpose of the experimental tests was to identify the behaviour of tension connections on metal plate fasteners and to evaluate the impact of the additional reinforcement in the form of perforated plates and screws. The analysis of the results obtained from the experimental tests allows us to conclude that the reinforced nodes achieved a much higher ultimate load than the one resulting from the design calculations"}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945637","journalIssue":{"objectId":"675ffdcbfdbe834e36a409f3","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"70","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"b334b9e5-c9c9-4746-9f85-ee7cce014d95"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"599-613","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/151912/edition/133487/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc534ed085dcb1e6ae0ba73","name":"Damian","lastName":"Nykiel","uuid":"AF5020CE7A9503D8783F2988DEB5526D001A40EC51E5373F357D149EFB6726BA2DEFFF5E646BB9575D542AE635CF6F2FD5A2FF0F956EB6841248B424A4A55AF4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2259-5917","documentHash":"0bea2117-f8e3-436d-a64c-236a48dfd011"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6cb","name":"Angelika","lastName":"Raczak","uuid":"FE997E0F909E2A0D9799B297E0476579D55FC632DFB3F28F391390976C29F867F3392559DA7668924EA8C96BE93B4232E468DA9038099B7DEA9759022E6BC744","orcidId":"0000-0002-0960-3583","documentHash":"c08cec5c-9b2d-428a-9e1c-e9d706f8eb2f"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739516b","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kubiszyn","uuid":"E6EE610D621E3D4C86546ED8400003E803F1B57FC729CCAE8F465AC95D5AD7A07F4354B1C0E4CB4FAD11A9559DC82F4F20E4DCA9EC3A4869B49102680D6327A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4222-9228","documentHash":"33de3925-f9f1-42df-be59-c94b68738929"}],"doi":"10.24425/ace.2024.151912"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["warm mix asphalt","synthetic zeolite","bitumen foaming","natural zeolite"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The compositions of the SMA 11, SMA 8 LA and SMA 11 LA mixtures based on modified bitumen with PMB 45/80-55 (reference mixture) or PMB 45/80-55 with Na-P1 or clinoptilolite were determined. Their resistance to permanent deformation, water sensitivity, water permeability and susceptibility to changes in texture and skid resistance during the period of use were verified. Adding zeolites reduced the production temperature by as much as 15 ◦C for the SMA 11 LA mixtures and 20 ◦C for SMA 8 LA. The addition of zeolites did not significantly affect the resistance to permanent deformation, the water permeability or the mass loss. The mixtures with clinoptilolite were resistant to the harmful effects of water, while the mixtures with Na-P1 proved more sensitive to water. Water permeability tests showed a higher permeability for SMA 11 LA compared to SMA 8 LA due to the higher nominal aggregate size. The Cantabro test showed greater particle loss for SMA 11 LA than for SMA 8 LA. A skid resistance and macrotexture analysis indicated that the SMA LA layers required special maintenance on the road due to the clogging of pores in the mix structure"}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945638","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67406cedfdbe832d853b35ae","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"64051828-5f95-4984-b33a-8ac6a987172f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/23/5848","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839beecfdbe833174263e3a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Gierasimiuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ffdb233f-b1d2-44c6-9fa5-798a14c6b69d"},{"objectId":"6839beecfdbe833174263e39","name":"Roman","lastName":"Pacholak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe53a169-6b85-49bc-858f-8421f6a564ee"},{"objectId":"6839beecfdbe833174263e38","name":"Władysław","lastName":"Gardziejczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"250cd9c2-bd5e-4f75-903d-261543b63158"},{"objectId":"6839beecfdbe833174263e37","name":"Marta","lastName":"Wasilewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9d1ea13-f702-4c28-9e29-e7810aa4a957"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395160","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Siwowski","uuid":"60E8AE045DE688D769347355C56C8ACF612FC404CCB43774DF91B6FB20CB70B23B67D3647BC155D695119572CBE4E944782E8D58B9D096B9ABC47EF17FDFF467","orcidId":"0000-0002-2003-000X","documentHash":"ce87cefc-d930-4bec-971d-b5a30ea41ab0"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739515d","name":"Lesław","lastName":"Bichajło","uuid":"35E97EB5452F30F79DC64CF0D218A6E13DB874B5768A86D9690BDA2F1CB48885D6874D6AD20C01DBC02445FEFFFE8EEA2F81CE707D3797AA0F8CA237A08701BD","orcidId":"0000-0002-2463-9672","documentHash":"d3699845-8984-480e-944d-27804491234e"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17235848"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ochrona prawna","sygnaliści (prawo)","sygnalizacja (prawo)"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67e8144efdbe836c46f4d2b2","doi":null,"title":"Ochrona sygnalistów : komentarz","year":2025,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788383900711","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://e-pbp.inp.pan.pl/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=485876","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"f644b32b-5a65-404d-9f1f-4225b6fe4e97","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb921","mniswId":"64400","name":"Wolters Kluwer","documentHash":"1ed0a2c9-59fd-4252-afdb-e03f6e7ad85a"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709228878c28a047390dc5"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Zakaz działań odwetowych i środki ochrony roślin.

This method achieves machining accuracy ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 mm. However, components with complex shapes still require grinding and polishing. During the grinding of aircraft blades, achieving high precision and maintaining strict dimensional control are essential. This involves monitoring the thickness of the blade at key cross-sections, as well as the radii of the leading and trailing edges, chord lengths, twist angles, and more. The paper introduces a developed robotic blade grinding process featuring iterative laser measurement of geometric parameters. A custom measuring device with laser heads was designed, calibrated, and tested for repeatability. The measurement data were then used to determine the blade feed rate and machining path via a fuzzy logic decision system. The proposed method was validated on a series of PT6 aircraft engine blades in collaboration with Pratt and Whitney Rzeszów."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945645","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bcbefdbe833174262c5c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"20","doi":null,"documentHash":"58ead233-1b8b-41da-b596-adaae14e4316"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/20/4077","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b089c","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Szybicki","uuid":"3184CE43A966B827271AB341FD343CC65E16CEBFF22591D787FCDFF47712C3D64152B1AE8282EE89C889ABB227B0D8D26CD9E3F9F302CF65D53F7D8DE5C23DFF","orcidId":"0000-0003-3648-9808","documentHash":"3098d625-11ba-4f7c-be95-954bb17e3c9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d587","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Muszyńska","uuid":"A441FDF2233C6A61BDA223B4E1DBE934FC7F2032123A73C095DEA86D95AAEB92C654FF56C75DBAFA7B36D6003698E47A976FC0F665C0567697DC26499B906EBE","orcidId":"0000-0002-0113-6159","documentHash":"c8c5917e-a68c-4342-8df4-31cf215aa226"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c462","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Pietruś","uuid":"6C774099EE048C71B8F5290CBF73B601D268B57875208A221FF5748B5D8C1A03F7E526ED58C356F3211F01074515FCB339DB652F31AD6A68C78DB7DD92D665FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-6428-0959","documentHash":"3fde39fc-af29-4823-85cf-8a0febb4676e"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951e0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kurc","uuid":"74F235D69A7A463F08F9A49EC48CA825E32D4A9C7D2C9AF7F566C088460A091C702B0E8B08A097DE2B102A1B943258858896E9D8761EEE73C9F728BBDED79FBB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1765-2430","documentHash":"2dc037f1-cb22-4841-8377-b92bffc2eb98"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390877","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Burghardt","uuid":"5477EB69F03D447B93C6BB5A1A2DA921216E60FED63F4B96E5BC38A30E53A29E9D56630ED9FEB371B51497AF370B88A16F7C076E4B1700DB8305B07DC238ADE5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7358-4866","documentHash":"abc55ed2-ab67-496b-a59b-957c85f1448e"}],"doi":"10.3390/electronics13204077"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["symulacja komputerowa","przetwornik napięcie-czas","modulacja szerokości impulsu"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pulse width modulation","voltage-time converter","computer simulation","electronic system design"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

They are characterised by small overall dimensions and significant rotational speed reduction while maintaining the high positioning accuracy of the driven device. Spiroid gears require a lot of lubrication with oils, which separate the mating parts. In the case of spiroid gears, they separate the face wheel teeth and the worm thread. The resulting oil film reduces the coefficient of friction and lowers the temperature of the mating surfaces. The modelling of toothed rim lubrication is a complex problem. To separate the surface of the face wheel mating and the worm, one needs to consider the phenomena of fluid mechanics, heat transfer and tooth deformation. The formation of an elastohydrodynamic oil film of an appropriate height is determined by the type of oil, the mechanical properties of the worm and face wheel materials, relative speed, load and the geometry of the mating surfaces. The issues described in this paper significantly affect the correct operation of gears and have not yet been fully understood for spiroid gears. This paper presents the results of a study on the properties of the elastohydrodynamic oil film and describes its characteristics, with the unknown quantity being the rotational speed of the input shaft that ensures that the oil film separates the mating toothed rims.

This study evaluates the hydraulic efficiency of three different geometries of forced-retention hydraulic systems and compares the results with the efficiency of a traditional single-chamber retention tank and a traditional linear system without retention under two operational scenarios. Given the identical capacities of the solutions studied, an evaluation procedure was proposed based on the system's resilience time, which was measured until a set level of stormwater accumulation was reached in the system. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the models was performed using statistical tools and machine learning. This also provides a basis for verifying the applicability of artificial neural networks in assessing the efficiency of such solutions. The results of the global sensitivity analysis indicated that the inflow rate and the permissible level of stormwater accumulation in the system were key factors affecting the hydraulic efficiency of forced retention facilities, with high value of impact strengths of 121.651 and 76.035, respectively. In the scenario with a lower accumulation level, forced-retention hydraulic systems, particularly ring-shaped solutions, exhibited higher efficiency, with the hydraulic efficiency coefficient reaching 5.500. In contrast, in the scenario allowing for a higher level of system fill, the efficiency and selection of the most effective solution were closely related to the hydraulic conditions, with the efficiency of the forced retention units, describing the ratio of the analysed retention unit capacity to a conventional retention tank, ranging from 0.300 to 1.140. Based on these findings, it was concluded that forced retention can serve as an alternative to classic network tanks, especially in urban areas with limited available space."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945659","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ed571bfdbe83567c6efa80","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"370","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"3f2ca098-0369-4256-84dc-7f6bf0939105"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030147972402872X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d546","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Pochwat","uuid":"919EF138994879CDF26CBE18537D8955313BBB839BAFC2A97CBC44769EBA5158A8BB6D63F2090045949D1139554DB0EF191FB62171E5375392057580624E784C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3190-9551","documentHash":"4124a913-9fa8-48c2-9301-98e9fe56bf16"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122886"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["geopolityka","polityka energetyczna","infrastruktura energetyczna","bezpieczeństwo energetyczne"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Celem artykułu jest ocena bezpieczeństwa energetycznego z naciskiem na rolę mechanizmów państwowych – zamiast rynkowych – w zapewnieniu ciągłości dostaw energii. Główna hipoteza sugeruje, że napięcia geopolityczne i globalne trendy energetyczne bezpośrednio wpływają na poziom bezpieczeństwa energetycznego. Kluczowe pytania badawcze obejmują rolę państwa w zabezpieczaniu zasobów energetycznych, identyfikację ryzyk wynikających z niestabilności geopolitycznej oraz ocenę wymogów dotyczących odporności infrastruktury. Analiza badawcza wykazuje, że współczesne bezpieczeństwo energetyczne wykracza poza samą ciągłość dostaw, uwzględniając aspekty ochrony cybernetycznej, adaptacyjne polityki regulacyjne oraz zaawansowane technologie w produkcji energii odnawialnej. Wnioski podkreślają potrzebę przyjęcia przez państwa proaktywnych strategii na rzecz dywersyfikacji struktury bilansu energetycznego, bezpieczeństwa infrastruktury oraz gotowości kryzysowej, zwłaszcza w odpowiedzi na trwającą wojnę rosyjsko-ukraińską, która przekształciła globalne rynki energetyczne i wzmocniła unijny nacisk na zrównoważone, niezależne systemy energetyczne."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945661","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bdaefdbe833174263404","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"16 (52)","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"ec392461-25ba-44cc-803e-90d974c4f524"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"157-171","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.tnkul.pl/index.php/rns/article/view/1606","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdaefdbe833174263405","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Turowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"22411f0d-08ba-45b8-aa39-3f5c8d92df32"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0892","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Ruszel","uuid":"A6BAE682DAAF088ED496569AC40D28D40D3C6DFF186B779167FAD5EEDAABB1F4BC81794CD3F14636341029762F1A2C2772BC5F05F84B6179047BB5145999ED17","orcidId":"0000-0003-1546-6754","documentHash":"141428e3-c4c2-48f1-810f-32d3b22c5771"}],"doi":"10.18290/rns2024.0047"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

One way to prevent such dangerous failures is to use an additional machining to create dimples in the surface, which are a place to collect lubricant but also abrasive particles. The article presents a method of burnishing a cylindrical surface after carburizing treatment and after hardening, after which the hardness of the surface layer was about 60 HRC. As a result of using appropriate tools, it was possible to create regular and reproducible dimples in the surface. A surface topography parameter was also proposed, which makes it possible to evaluate the increase in oil capacity of the created cavities quickly and with high quality standards."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945673","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677f789dfdbe831a91cd2b98","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"126","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"67bc17ba-4503-4b98-aada-a04eae6d1156"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"37-43","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.prz.edu.pl/tiam/article/view/1825/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5ff","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Gałda","uuid":"3DB219BB35751A68936731EEF5E888F270447BEB4213940FFC7EF2547C23B4E846B839C7E7EB2C239B08EC579433ED0468CD8A599E42737BAB1CC33E48C5AE48","orcidId":"0000-0001-8603-9907","documentHash":"04c68436-11ae-4d02-be3b-fceff3963cda"}],"doi":"10.7862/tiam.2024.4.5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["estimation","pH","uncertainty","water","measurement"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In turn, the use of BIPV on curvilinear roofs is an interdisciplinary issue covering geometry, environmental engineering, architecture and construction. The article presents an approach to designing efficient steel bar structures of the modular solar canopies using genetic algorithms and their evaluation. Shaping effective forms of solar roofs was subordinated to the idea “form follows environment” in the original way as the roof form, and thus the shape of the structure depended on the amount of solar energy absorbed by the roof surface. The structures designed on a regular polygon plan were created from three, four, five, or six hyperbolic paraboloid (HP) modules arranged radially. Algorithmic definitions of their forms made it possible to obtain many variants of canopies with the adopted preliminary criteria, as well as to conduct genetic optimization, which helped to obtain the best results. For the best solutions in terms of geometrical forms, structural optimization was carried out due to the structures’ minimum masses. As a comparative criterion of structural effectiveness, a coefficient was used that specified the mass of the considered structure per square meter of the covered area. The proposed shaping method may constitute some guidelines for rational shaping of the steel bar structures with radially arranged modules, in which their effectiveness can be established already at the initial design stage. However, the best optimization results, that is, efficient and aesthetic canopies, can be ecological solutions to be used in practice."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945678","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bcb8fdbe833174262c37","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"95","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e358a885-7947-40bd-bbf3-6e8d3c7d3f50"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710224017935?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"615bb8a875234017e04eda7e","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Lechwar","uuid":"DBFD147AB3C6BF42D05B5183CBE06750EF381F5FEFDECE6769666F32827E13603B72F6B3456570E6FB71FB5398C7019A86E68F95927292E44BF91210829E1E3F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7202-6312","documentHash":"c7a1257d-5b49-4d93-a097-bf21befeaa19"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395189","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Dźwierzyńska","uuid":"1F78EE5F317A44AFC30131E7528DAFC8FF7918330A7A8417BBE84F44CBEE6E2D1A4A58AA84F6929EACD6747054D39E4D15905CBF56679DD0E065486C629D61EA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0634-5328","documentHash":"ae72d02b-d60d-4d89-bfe4-8bffb63cf7f6"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jobe.2024.110225"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Heatmaps of CQ show a bidirectional relationship between the AI market and clean energy at lag one with negative cross-quantile dependence evident throughout most quantiles, especially in normal market conditions. It also indicates a positive relationship between AI return rates and the clean energy market, but only when both datasets are in the same extreme quantiles (10th and 90th). Additionally, WMLC results reveal that time, scale, and investment horizons influence the interaction between AI and clean and non-clean energy industries. A considerable positive association exists between the AI market and traditional energy markets, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. However, during the pandemic, this dependency turned negative, and it has since been minor, with an uptick in co-movement during Russia – Ukraine conflict. Several policy implications are suggested for the clean energy and conventional energy markets in line with AI."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945679","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bebcfdbe833174263cc6","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"136","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"152e90d0-bf4d-4efb-bed6-36cb195fd8ad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"92-103","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1342937X24002557","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bebcfdbe833174263cc9","name":"Sunil","lastName":"Tiwari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f2901cc-cd64-4b71-b6d5-c1de4b3d6522"},{"objectId":"6839bebcfdbe833174263cc8","name":"Kamel Si","lastName":"Mohammed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8dfa3fab-60b2-4613-a41d-500a94cbfbd8"},{"objectId":"6839bebcfdbe833174263cc7","name":"Salahuddin","lastName":"Khan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3a84e74-ea14-4748-9184-3358371695f3"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a018","name":"YURIY","lastName":"BILAN","uuid":"AEA595284BF2D10689C55DA1D532510D84B833C50A8D36C4E476ED44E908E98ABC42FAD57C43A323B3AF2E1ACA676BAF519A01E6ADD37EDC5E46BF93B79B1E3E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0268-009X","documentHash":"304f8a94-c91f-4bca-a33b-1d413ef4a687"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.gr.2024.08.013"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-0-7354-4852-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Proceedings of the 3rd International Advances in Applied Physics and Materials Science Congress & Exhibition","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":106,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839feb1fdbe833174264a2d","editors":[{"objectId":"6839feb1fdbe833174264a33","name":"Bahar Şölen Akdemir","lastName":"Yılmaz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e2083c3-b69c-402f-beab-4d5257394cc4"},{"objectId":"6839feb1fdbe833174264a32","name":"Fatmanur Kocaman","lastName":"Kabil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f358a65e-736a-41bd-8c70-529e2bc712c4"},{"objectId":"6839feb1fdbe833174264a31","name":"Vala Can","lastName":"Aşkan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b9b52570-8093-45f4-9953-63e47fa15225"},{"objectId":"6839feb1fdbe833174264a30","name":"Zehra Banu Bahşi","lastName":"Oral","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a05513ab-8202-43ee-8063-b9076f944f17"},{"objectId":"6839feb1fdbe833174264a2f","name":"Ahmet Yavuz","lastName":"Oral","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b36a9e3-1945-41eb-bc14-ca8536fd1a6a"},{"objectId":"6839feb1fdbe833174264a2e","name":"Onur Alp","lastName":"Aksan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a9313374-a4e2-41dd-af8e-9cbafcb9868e"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6839feb1fdbe833174264a2e","6839feb1fdbe833174264a2f","6839feb1fdbe833174264a30","6839feb1fdbe833174264a31","6839feb1fdbe833174264a32","6839feb1fdbe833174264a33"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646945681","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"AIP Conference Proceedings","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb79c","mniswId":"14900","name":"American Institute of Physics","documentHash":"d96464ff-a2b8-41c9-90e8-f37ff6c1ef66"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/issue/2924/1","numberInSeries":"2924","authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["protein adsorption","protein release","hydrogels","temperature-sensitivity","pH sensitivity"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The hydrogels, whose covalent skeleton contains pendant anionic units due to the presence of the sodium methacrylate co-monomer, exhibited both thermo- and pH-sensitivity with different extents, which depended on the content of ionizable moieties and the cross-linker density. The hydrogel composition, temperature, and pH influenced the zeta potential of the hydrogels and their swelling properties. The proteins selected for the study, i.e., bovine serum albumin (BSA), ovalbumin (OVA), lysozyme (LYZ), and a monoclonal antibody (mAb2), differed in their aminoacidic composition and conformation, thus in isoelectric point, molecular weight, electrostatic charge, and hydrophobicity. Therefore, the response of their adsorption behavior to changes in the solution properties and the hydrogel composition was different. LYZ exhibited the strongest adsorption of all proteins with a maximum at pH 7 (189.5 mg g−1\uD835\uDC54\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC59 ); adsorption of BSA and OVA reached maximum at pH 4.5 (24.4 and 23.5 mg g−1\uD835\uDC54\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC59 ), whereas mAb2 was strongly adsorbed at 9.2 (21.7 mg g−1\uD835\uDC54\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC59 ). This indicated the possibility of using the hydrogels for pH-mediated separation of proteins differing in charge under mild conditions in a water-rich environment of both the liquid solution and the adsorbed phase. The adsorption affinity of all proteins increased with temperature, which was attributed to the synergistic effects of attractive electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. That effect was particularly marked for mAb2, for which the temperature change from 5 to 37 °C caused a twentyfold increase in adsorption. In all cases, the proteins could be released from the hydrogel surface by a reduction in temperature, an increase in pH, or a combination of both. This allows for the elimination of the use of salt solution as a desorbing agent, whose presence renders the recycling of buffering solutions difficult."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945683","journalIssue":{"objectId":"671215d0fdbe831eab2c910e","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"29","number":"20","doi":null,"documentHash":"eae69e24-8b5f-4864-bddd-0d4b70c8c789"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/20/4858","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bca1fdbe833174262b86","name":"Adam","lastName":"Strachota","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"747a6a27-b5d5-4141-8b73-47aa1f508417"},{"objectId":"6839bca1fdbe833174262b85","name":"Beata","lastName":"Strachota","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99bfb732-93e1-45ec-8fe4-4c7e152a9868"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739519d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Poplewski","uuid":"27A09DD47EEFC915BAC8CF2C447BBDACA160EAE717ACE7AB74206AB1F3CCE3E49F3767C99B833962E9A810DF35747950F11FEB6559084255A9A0CF24B8E99E84","orcidId":"0000-0001-9604-5606","documentHash":"89340893-1467-4245-af1f-83aa4b3b8e45"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739519c","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Poplewska","uuid":"760A2DDC97E384667F905E7DC6021CF4E79DFF9FC31F5716E731D82B308EB366BF8991C55FF60D9A9586FFF18C163E79997721D6318CBFDD151961271AD038ED","orcidId":"0000-0001-7722-0413","documentHash":"9fb73250-3721-459b-b95f-b6a9a78f8f79"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395194","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Antos","uuid":"41F1949A79E9F2CCA5DA05E449BE58DD6991FEEC6689608B2AAA8E2A55BEECF5CF3C795F80FDC9D5F157BF99A1C8D5AACDF2D18D9034FBD0CC75BDFF48345723","orcidId":"0000-0001-8246-5052","documentHash":"6cfc2713-1b76-4663-ae9a-85f8d16c0b1d"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules29204858"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["state support","risks","state guarantees","project","public-private partnership"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The  cost  of  services  provided  to  society  is  usually  regulated  by  the government.  The  participation  of  private  investors  in  such  projects  is  associated  with significant risks that arise at the project level and in relation to the state as a partner. On the other hand, the implementation of PPP projects requires significant amounts of funding, which  often  necessitates  the  involvement  of  financial  institutions.  To  implement  such projects, it is necessary to provide state support. The article presents the forms of state support used in world practice. The essence and types of state guarantees as a form of state support for PPP projects are disclosed. The principles of their provision are systematized.

Their usefulness is mainly due to the changed thermal properties, which allow for more effective use of the existing industrial infrastructure. However, despite nearly 30 years of research into these materials, many of their properties remain incomprehensible. This chapter presents two of the most important from the application point of view groups of properties—thermal and rheological properties. Particular emphasis is placed on how to properly investigate these fundamental properties—current measurement techniques are presented along with the information on how they can be used. Current work in the field of thermal conductivity modeling and newly created databases of physical properties are described. Finally, the possibility of a qualitative description of the stability of nanofluids has been outlined. As stability cannot be considered a physical property, techniques are presented that indirectly provide information on this subject."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945689","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"25-49","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780443154836000044?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d569","name":"Gaweł","lastName":"Żyła","uuid":"D0A433801D85F75BD8BE2C3BB9471368B9F135CDA22C349CAA85B3FA1C3E94D885B6AB56EBD5D536CD56F4605D157AB3FB8A5BE4300E7490EE62481F7B01D566","orcidId":"0000-0003-1588-8762","documentHash":"ccbef41f-7940-4b97-acfe-4f8734fc6491"}],"doi":"10.1016/b978-0-443-15483-6.00004-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7934-723-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

A mathematical model was created that links the main rotor and free turbine rotor speed parameters, based on which a relation with the engine output power was established. In this research, a differential equation was obtained that links fuel consumption, output power, and rotor speed, which makes it possible to monitor engine dynamics in various operating modes. A fuel consumption controller was developed based on a neuro-fuzzy network that processes input data, including the desired and current rotor speed, which allows real-time adjustments to improve the operational efficiency. In the research, based on the flight data analysis obtained during the Mi-8MTV helicopter with a TV3-117 turboshaft engine flight test, improved signal processing quality was obtained due to time sampling and adaptive quantisation methods (this is confirmed by assessing the homogeneity and representativeness of the training and test datasets). A comparative analysis of the developed and traditional controllers showed that the neuro-fuzzy network use reduces the transient fuel consumption process time by 8.92% while increasing the accuracy and F1 score by 18.28% and 21.32%, respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945695","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67349c4ffdbe8361a57b2b88","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"e1cf7aa4-f80c-4b46-8161-714238773663"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/22/5755","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd9bfdbe833174263356","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Vladov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba2b00a7-dc75-4d64-adfa-dc63f9f66a52"},{"objectId":"6839bd9bfdbe833174263355","name":"Victoria","lastName":"Vysotska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff98bc47-c854-4904-b00f-da729f657ef6"},{"objectId":"6839bd9bfdbe833174263354","name":"Oleksii","lastName":"Lytvynov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4ebf2ba-2cf6-45cf-ae77-e94e2b2c3e83"},{"objectId":"6839bd9bfdbe833174263353","name":"Victor","lastName":"Vasylenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49cfcbfb-7939-4f31-a50e-541928a48e52"},{"objectId":"618b3cb97523400e636ef11d","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Bulakh","uuid":"3B867DE27B63FFC7D27BEA718A673CE67F49423294BD6C0CBDC747AF650E6FEA1DDDDAB9F26F3C528154C064F0985C04A61E5995EC0A83F00ACBB9DF1C846087","orcidId":"0000-0003-4264-2303","documentHash":"7c7031d8-3918-434d-b326-51d823d945f1"},{"objectId":"603de6039543c711bc6e9ef3","name":"JAN","lastName":"CZYŻEWSKI","uuid":"D2A735434F398D41F6F18118B3AD6A69DCABBC8EC0005F0C380A2A6F6E9AF549AD43CE66F436F8BA1D2BD55D7535ADD466267770B740D83D6E7F45956206EB77","orcidId":"0000-0003-3198-4367","documentHash":"87147900-53ff-47d0-b7a0-de1439e14239"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17225755"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["friction effects","set-point prefiltering","current driven servo","pole placement","double integrator","2DOF PID"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The PID settings provide a triple real pole of the closed-loop system to assure smooth transients. The weights b, c eliminate overshoot of the step response. In the case of continuous control, the weights are fixed, independent of the design data. In the discrete case, the weights decrease when the discretization step increases.

They are also frequently applied as robust transient models describing the work of a single catalyst pellet or as a part of a more complex model, for example, a reactor model, where mass balances for the gas phase and solid phase are necessary. So far, approximate models for diffusion and reaction processes have been presented for processes described by a single balance equation. In the present work, approximate models without the mentioned limitation are presented and discussed. In addition, simple rules are shown for the development of other complex approximate models without tedious derivation in the complex domain. The formulas considered in this work are typical long-time approximations of the transient process. The accuracy is good, especially in the range of small and intermediate Thiele modulus values."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945699","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839f4f0fdbe833174264488","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"5","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"3a8c7133-7a00-4367-9b8d-ed0c70ee6bad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"305-317","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2624-781X/5/2/15","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395190","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Chmiel-Szukiewicz","uuid":"71492D06EC649F345FF322F9158F894AD61AD35A6349D02F9176C14E05D3A4E85D7D39C7BB9BEA7EC8356D773CE0916804B72EB59389FC2264C8EE8270BC7773","orcidId":"0000-0002-5000-2296","documentHash":"196969e6-54f3-4a91-a9ae-2b990035cba4"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e438","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Szukiewicz","uuid":"9C4013F682B5BD22DE97F87391D51C4D2E38758ED71E7A8F6B9B28B05BBA6B3FD302F3F8AC868B0FEDF957668A8C2C09637627AB53E814292A7A9D7AA98E26A1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9136-4907","documentHash":"bbc941c6-6df9-448e-9fa5-7588a31c8f5b"}],"doi":"10.3390/reactions5020015"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rms source current","switched reluctance motor","DC/DC converter","source current ripple"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Source current ripple negatively affects the power source by introducing a variable frequency component and increasing losses in the power source. Reducing the source current ripple is important, especially in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The solution proposed in this paper for reducing source current ripple is to use a classic DC/DC boost converter connected in series with the SRM power supply system. The key to reducing source current ripple is the DC/DC converter control method proposed and described in this article. This method involves controlling the DC/DC converter synchronized with the speed of the SRM motor DC/DC. To verify the correct operation of the proposed solution, simulation and laboratory tests of an SRM drive were performed, the results of which are shown in this paper."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945701","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67349c4ffdbe8361a57b2b88","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"e1cf7aa4-f80c-4b46-8161-714238773663"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/22/5711","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f817641085dcb410a25ecc3","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Daraż","uuid":"E22A60E7A552B9BB18519B4A019F498DEF22609469012391806F16B76475F4398ACF0E847E741F5073A7AC0EB4B0432034A270E2BA81C9BC6FEE2E5D61AA4B8B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6038-4075","documentHash":"447eb853-511f-491c-b842-652b6b038525"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951b7","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bogusz","uuid":"B525851DE99BBC64304018F8E76CFDA12483E14F57C71E9B55D344B2A98170217CB2A9BBA854D9E39775BD934237DB18534F33AAE1F670D5CCA5896FECDAEF49","orcidId":"0000-0001-8726-5172","documentHash":"f90e4f6c-edad-44ef-b3f1-1c39add78082"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17225711"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["industrial production","tannery","industrial effluen"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The scientific novelty of the article lies in the development of a comprehensive approach to diagnosing helicopter turboshaft engine defects based on the vibration signals amplitude and frequency characteristics integral analysis combined with a neural network for probabilistic defect detection. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach uses the energy criterion for the vibration characteristics. It averages the assessment of unique signal processing algorithms, which ensures reliable defect classification under flight vibration conditions. The method is based on representing vibration signals as a sum of harmonic oscillations supplemented by noise components, which helps to identify deviations from typical values. The developed method includes a state function in which the amplitudes and frequency characteristics from nominal parameters estimate deviations. When the critical threshold is exceeded, the function signals possible malfunctions. A multilayer neural network is used to classify defect types, providing high classification accuracy (from 0.985 to 0.994). Computer experiments on the developed seminaturalistic modeling stand confirm that the method can detect increased vibration levels, which is the potential failure indicator. Comparative analysis shows the proposed method’s accuracy and noise resistance superiority, emphasizing the importance of introducing modern technologies to improve aircraft operation reliability and safety."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945707","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67349c4ffdbe8361a57b2b88","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"e1cf7aa4-f80c-4b46-8161-714238773663"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/22/5776","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd93fdbe833174263313","name":"Maksym","lastName":"Romanov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d20893d-4ccc-419f-8622-39bdbfad91a4"},{"objectId":"6839bd93fdbe833174263312","name":"Eduard","lastName":"Kisiliuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"efffbd77-6145-4e0f-bacd-14d127e19d94"},{"objectId":"6839bd93fdbe833174263311","name":"Victoria","lastName":"Vysotska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe774301-8011-40b6-acec-259654630e74"},{"objectId":"6839bd93fdbe833174263310","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Vladov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"064d8004-49ee-4127-9e99-deec9279cce1"},{"objectId":"618b3cb97523400e636ef11d","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Bulakh","uuid":"3B867DE27B63FFC7D27BEA718A673CE67F49423294BD6C0CBDC747AF650E6FEA1DDDDAB9F26F3C528154C064F0985C04A61E5995EC0A83F00ACBB9DF1C846087","orcidId":"0000-0003-4264-2303","documentHash":"7c7031d8-3918-434d-b326-51d823d945f1"},{"objectId":"603de6039543c711bc6e9ef3","name":"JAN","lastName":"CZYŻEWSKI","uuid":"D2A735434F398D41F6F18118B3AD6A69DCABBC8EC0005F0C380A2A6F6E9AF549AD43CE66F436F8BA1D2BD55D7535ADD466267770B740D83D6E7F45956206EB77","orcidId":"0000-0003-3198-4367","documentHash":"87147900-53ff-47d0-b7a0-de1439e14239"},{"objectId":"5ebee3be752340254fc4422a","name":"Denys","lastName":"Baranovskyi","uuid":"88EA9ACF399C7731071B2C181F64E2F5561C414C94C03E460E214CF3FC621B4F70BCFB70ED3D026A2A2E560963BDA140F324163ECFA1B3710F62448F9986897F","orcidId":"0000-0002-6516-2794","documentHash":"21902eaa-5765-40c0-8c3d-99f2c9bec4e3"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17225776"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["transmission error","Gear mesh kinematics","Spiral bevel gears","spur gears","tooth contact analysis","contact pattern"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Existing analytical and numerical methods often face challenges in convergence and computational efficiency. Our proposed approach involves defining a novel tensor notation and applying it to the gear tooth contact kinematics problem. By discretizing the tooth surfaces and using tensor operations, we can accurately determine the kinematics, path of contact, and transmission error of the gear pair. To validate our approach, we compared its results with those obtained from commercial software, KISSsoft and KiMOS. The results demonstrated high accuracy, with mean absolute errors below 0.08 for specific sliding, 0.003 for sliding factor, and 0.1 μm for transmission error. Furthermore, we applied our method to analyse non-involute gear types, such as S-gears, pin gearing and cosine gears. Our findings revealed the kinematic performance and contact characteristics of these gear types, providing valuable insights for gear design and optimization. In conclusion, the proposed tensorbased approach offers a promising alternative for gear tooth contact analysis, providing accurate and efficient results for a wide range of gear types."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945709","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bd16fdbe833174262efc","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"203","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"7a918643-d4ad-4e38-abf2-fe0dd599f14f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094114X24002556","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70937f878c28a0473ab21e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Batsch","uuid":"D492A5CE64CC9F89466934E5607022E0A295625AC0ED696A97ECD90D63CA532F65529E396D35287799F5FBB77E39462FBDAEAC41991E46D5256B394EFD671AF6","orcidId":"0000-0001-5243-2604","documentHash":"47b5d62f-b46a-48a6-9005-0fd2ad732592"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2024.105828"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crisis situations","ecologistics of the cit","security","safety culture","crisis management","ecological safety","ecosystem services"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The study is performed using the Thailand experience. The research findings indicate that continuous economic growth aligns with the country’s objectives, directly contributing to continuous social growth. This aligns with the country’s efficient planning. It demonstrates that the management aligns with the goal of achieving Thailand 5.0. Furthermore, considering the environmental aspect, it is found that economic and social growth directly impacts the ecological aspect due to the significant influence of resource consumption in the construction. The resource consumption in construction shows a growth rate increase of 264.59% (2043/2024), reaching 401.05 ktoe (2043), which exceeds the carrying capacity limit set at 250.25 ktoe, resulting in significant long-term environmental degradation. Additionally, considering the political aspect, it is found to have the greatest influence on the environment, exacerbating environmental damage beyond current levels. Therefore, the DSEM-ARIMA model establishes a new scenario policy, indicating that resource consumption in construction leads to environmental degradation reduced to 215.45 ktoe (2043), which does not exceed the carrying capacity. Thus, if this model is utilized, it can serve as a vital tool in formulating policies to steer the country’s growth toward Thailand 5.0 effectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945714","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67627668fdbe83713fee0801","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"24","doi":"","documentHash":"8ca44ba1-324d-4327-ade5-afd4d3e4ac73"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/24/10945","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bde9fdbe8331742635d7","name":"Pruethsan","lastName":"Sutthichaimethee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"858a61a9-12b3-4809-a216-3fe7989d2c6f"},{"objectId":"6839bde9fdbe8331742635d6","name":"Halyna","lastName":"Mishchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83d3827b-3892-42cf-80cb-eaffb23ccbcc"},{"objectId":"6839bde9fdbe8331742635d5","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Bilan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ffe2020b-6e4c-4b14-9fe8-dbbc073ac9ba"},{"objectId":"6839bde9fdbe8331742635d4","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Voloshyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b28ddd3-3c05-48d9-af24-1e1f2320c5fa"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d624","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mentel","uuid":"E1026B8F297A97E1E35653A0C1A2E30D2FA6DCFB2927658A518E7F0DE1CCC0F1A9BAB41D97156E169E767E02181269C28E2E93D03501F342E123A9D4E2B5EE25","orcidId":"0000-0002-6371-1219","documentHash":"ea5ff81a-7599-4377-8832-255b6610876f"}],"doi":"10.3390/su162410945"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6839feb7fdbe833174264aa3","doi":null,"title":"Proceedings of the 16th International Symposium on Fiber-Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Reinforcement for Concrete Structures (FRPRCS-16)","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-1-64195-243-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.concrete.org/Portals/0/Files/PDF/Previews/SP360_preview.pdf","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"d485bff8-9be7-420d-8d1b-8b6c17545578","publisher":{"objectId":"5ec006c1ad49b31cced9cf76","mniswId":null,"name":"American Concrete Institute","documentHash":"abc1d635-e888-4379-8d42-c907ba6bbd07"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This paper includes a review of publications on robot safety systems and digital twins. Based on this review, it was concluded that further work in this area is justified. This paper demonstrates the use of a digital model of a robotic casting mold preparation station to design safety components for an industrial cell. A key element of this paper is the presentation of developed algorithms and their applications in building digital twins of existing robotic stations. By characterizing advanced safety systems used in robotic stations, an example of using a digital twin of a robotic station to create safety zones and so-called restricted zones for the robot was developed. As part of the research conducted, a real, comprehensive example of creating safety zones based on the robot’s TCP paths was carried out."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945718","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ced78dfdbe83617c5156e1","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"21","doi":null,"documentHash":"04d7fc2b-07ff-42ba-aa29-1c19a550cf33"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/21/4179","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b089c","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Szybicki","uuid":"3184CE43A966B827271AB341FD343CC65E16CEBFF22591D787FCDFF47712C3D64152B1AE8282EE89C889ABB227B0D8D26CD9E3F9F302CF65D53F7D8DE5C23DFF","orcidId":"0000-0003-3648-9808","documentHash":"3098d625-11ba-4f7c-be95-954bb17e3c9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d587","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Muszyńska","uuid":"A441FDF2233C6A61BDA223B4E1DBE934FC7F2032123A73C095DEA86D95AAEB92C654FF56C75DBAFA7B36D6003698E47A976FC0F665C0567697DC26499B906EBE","orcidId":"0000-0002-0113-6159","documentHash":"c8c5917e-a68c-4342-8df4-31cf215aa226"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c462","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Pietruś","uuid":"6C774099EE048C71B8F5290CBF73B601D268B57875208A221FF5748B5D8C1A03F7E526ED58C356F3211F01074515FCB339DB652F31AD6A68C78DB7DD92D665FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-6428-0959","documentHash":"3fde39fc-af29-4823-85cf-8a0febb4676e"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951e0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kurc","uuid":"74F235D69A7A463F08F9A49EC48CA825E32D4A9C7D2C9AF7F566C088460A091C702B0E8B08A097DE2B102A1B943258858896E9D8761EEE73C9F728BBDED79FBB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1765-2430","documentHash":"2dc037f1-cb22-4841-8377-b92bffc2eb98"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390877","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Burghardt","uuid":"5477EB69F03D447B93C6BB5A1A2DA921216E60FED63F4B96E5BC38A30E53A29E9D56630ED9FEB371B51497AF370B88A16F7C076E4B1700DB8305B07DC238ADE5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7358-4866","documentHash":"abc55ed2-ab67-496b-a59b-957c85f1448e"}],"doi":"10.3390/electronics13214179"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["digital data","geometry accuracy","anatomical model","reverse engineering","surface roughness"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

At the first RE modeling stage, digital data processing, segmentation, and the reconstruction of the geometry of the anatomical structures were performed. During the CAD modeling stage, three different concepts were utilized. The first concept was used to create a tool that could mold the geometry of the cranial vault. The second concept was created to prepare a prototype implant that would complement the anterior part of the mandibular geometry. And finally, the third concept was used to design a customized prototype surgical plate that would match the mandibular geometry accurately. Physical models were made using a rapid prototyping technique. A Bambu Lab X1 3D printer was used for this purpose. The process of geometric accuracy evaluation was carried out on manufactured prototypes of surgical plates made of ABS+, CPE, PLA+, and PETG material. In the geometric accuracy evaluation process, the smallest deviation values were obtained for the ABS plus material, within a tolerance of ±0.1 mm, and the largest were obtained for CPE (±0.2 mm) and PLA plus (±0.18 mm). In terms of the surface roughness evaluation, the highest value of the Sa parameter was obtained for the PLA plus material, which was 4.15 µm, and the lowest was obtained for the CPE material, equal to 3.62 µm. The knowledge of the flow of digital data and the identification of factors determining the accuracy of mapping the geometry of anatomical structures allowed for the development of a procedure that improves the modeling and manufacturing of anatomical structures within the craniofacial region."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945720","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839f4f3fdbe833174264498","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"4","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"2b1a966a-a986-40e0-a0a7-5de73a4aa375"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"265-279","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-9585/4/2/14","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839f4f3fdbe83317426449b","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Grzywa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ea00068-d8cb-4a87-ac32-78d0b1580b7f"},{"objectId":"6839f4f3fdbe83317426449a","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Więcek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c311d9c1-75d4-4299-889b-c80bd7571a3c"},{"objectId":"6839f4f3fdbe833174264499","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38a2e197-281a-480c-9478-ba09c09356f1"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b089a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Turek","uuid":"184E127E4FB99D54AA64869AC593073FCF0CDC80CBDA06041D5261F813F2E7957340952D9226A38CC18CC1899D01D28C58F7ADF099EB94C708E805CD6D92EB97","orcidId":"0000-0002-5926-4815","documentHash":"4947f918-0aaa-4212-a107-b57f9be44a9f"}],"doi":"10.3390/knowledge4020014"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["post-curing temperature","utility profile","waste materials","ANOVA","polymer composites","mechanical properties"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This article describes the results of tests conducted using four types of epoxy composites, i.e., composites modified with waste rubber (WR), composites modified with waste polyethylene (PE) agglomerate, glycolysate obtained using polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste, and control unmodified mortars (CUM). Selected properties of the mortars were monitored during their maturation under laboratory conditions, as well as after post-curing at elevated temperatures in the range of 60 ◦C–180 ◦C.With the increase in the reheating temperature, an increase in the flexural strength of all types of mortars was noted, with the highest more than twofold stronger than the unmodified composites. The compressive strength increased up to a temperature of 140 ◦C, and then decreased slightly. The highest value of 139.8 MPa was obtained using PET mortars. Post-curing also led to a slight loss of mass of all samples in the range of 0 to 0.06%. Statistical methods were employed, which made it possible to determine the post-curing temperature and composite composition for which the determined properties are simultaneously the most beneficial, especially for the prefabricated elements"}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945722","journalIssue":{"objectId":"671f3930fdbe8307b0be31f8","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"21","doi":null,"documentHash":"a98ebe0f-c811-4b40-80fe-beaad22fd55d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/21/5301","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd1ffdbe833174262f41","name":"Guilherme Jorge Brigolini","lastName":"Silva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca628023-22fb-4eb8-a4d5-3e21ca4870e1"},{"objectId":"6839bd1ffdbe833174262f40","name":"Bruna Silva","lastName":"Almada","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"01636501-6e89-4ff6-a8fc-f2c405bfcdab"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d538","name":"Bernardeta","lastName":"Dębska","uuid":"9BF8087B46AE52AB7932595F0A32779753241801972E4C7624BE85C9D58D5A6E02B487D4BF2486348E19E5761CB5F0F7E36FD3335FF120D118B1EFACFB875897","orcidId":"0000-0002-4377-9937","documentHash":"64e62bc9-41f5-4170-9685-8869324f1172"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17215301"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["(1, 2̅)-intersection index","storage of supplies in crisis","(1, 2)-dominating set","graph"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Moreover, practical applications of this result are given. Design/methodology/approach: We prove the conjecture by considering cases and indicating in each case two disjoint sets such that one of them is a (1, 1)-dominating set and the second one is a proper (1, 2)-dominating set. We also use a graph to model the problem of storage of supplies in Poland in case of a crisis. Findings: For every connected graph, in which every vertex has at least three neighbors, the (1, 2̅)-intersection index is equal to zero. It ensures that in most cases there exists an optimal allocation of water and food supplies throughout a given region. Practical implications: The findings may be used by crisis management services when planning the allocation of food and water reserves. Originality/value: The obtained results and applications are new and original, they may be of value to mathematician working in the field of theoretical and applied graph theory, as well as to researchers working on crisis management and methods of efficient supply allocations."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945723","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67421bf8fdbe8348301e100c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"205","doi":"","documentHash":"dbaaf6a0-3f33-4491-b5cb-883936e52cf2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"65-71","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/205-Bednarz-Michalski.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093df878c28a0473b24ca","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Michalski","uuid":"551F6574BD5E53B2B654A978AA0AF5913D79216B7E48504B6E3060EB7BC9E898B42AE77E89445C5074875BD567B4890EC5E45C7457251EA0C2F1779E764E1CC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-8776-5270","documentHash":"7593ae70-6296-4f07-9f56-60b500aae8c5"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b77b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bednarz","uuid":"C5554A80A39D2FD16EF904D3BFDE1988B4E4640A38792A89C3FB495D2CC1770A6C1F7FA31C879B65FA20DD8B40264B634FE431B932941F15584109D8E4A5CACE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1629-0167","documentHash":"c6596cb2-0bbd-4baf-b042-adc08752fce2"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.205.4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["stress","stabilisation operations","war","operation"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Their growing popularity is determined by numerous advantages over natural wood. Smart drilling, i.e. real-time adjustment of cutting parameters, requires the evolution of cutting process variables. In addition, it is necessary to create and manage a database, process data and adjust processing parameters in real time. Machinability is one of the most important technological properties in the machining process, enabling the determination of the material's susceptibility to machining. One of the machinability indicators is the unit cutting resistance (kc1.1). An innovative method for determining the value of unit cutting resistance (kc1.1) was proposed. The obtained results were used to determine the machinability index. The results obtained during the tests showed that the specific cutting resistance is constant for a given workpiece and does not depend on the cutting parameters."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945727","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839f4f8fdbe8331742644bd","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"53718c99-ce4b-4d76-a607-e92767b6a0f0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"209-214","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://kod.tuzvo.sk/sites/default/files/full_scientific_journal_2024_1.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bbb","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zielińska-Szwajka","uuid":"49AD64364D21A828314C0596FD75085DA570E9446C8DB6631BBC544A1FCA28170DE898DB3DAEF447357C9276D0DC7A91DE17660699291FC8E8ED11D39DEBF0D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-6212-2666","documentHash":"9b674641-c845-42e0-9500-b0b5233cddde"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szwajka","uuid":"BE3DBEF640820E864475437AEC4DB8978AE4FC0B4B3B99093CD4857E27DEEA7E923758AFBB9E791E11BF13C3EA626287D3C4FCE7C77FBDA928B5DCDAAE66EFFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1038-1148","documentHash":"60c70249-8eb8-40a1-ae88-4991b4235bad"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crisis situation","lack of water","external hydrant","water supply system"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

A large-scale power failure may limit or completely stop the operation of water supply systems. For this reason, blackout is considered one of the greatest threats to the continuity of the supply of drinking water. The study assessed the preparation of a water supply company for water supply in a crisis situation based on conventional solutions. The idea of an original solution for drawing water from the water supply network during low pressure was presented. The developed water tap allows the use of water accumulated in water pipes by drawing it from external hydrants. The method of arranging draw-off points in the water supply network is presented. The accumulated amounts of water inside water pipes can provide significant support for the affected population during periods of lack of electricity supply, preventing the operation of water pumping stations.

In this work, we have designed novel phosphorus and arsenic based tungsten digermanium monolayers (WGe2P4 and WGe2As4), and their Janus phase (WGe2As2P2), respectively. We explored both the 2H and 1T phases for all three structures, finding that the 1T phase is energetically unfavorable and dynamically unstable based on total energy and phonon calculations. In contrast, the 2H phase shows excellent ground state, mechanical, and dynamical stabilities. To precisely predict the electronic properties of these monolayer systems, we employed Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) and Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) functionals were employed. The HSE06 functional notably increased the bandgap values, enhancing WGe2P4 from 0.45 to 0.71 eV, WGe2As4 from 0.41 to 0.66 eV, and the Janus structure WGe2As2P2 from 0.37 to 0.71 eV. In addition, the optical response of these narrow bandgap monolayers indicated absorption peaks in the range of 0.4–0.7 eV, making these materials suitable for infrared (IR) laser technology. Furthermore, the electronic and optical properties can be effectively tuned for these structures using biaxial strain engineering. These findings provide an understanding of the fundamental properties of WGe2X4 (X = P, As) and their Janus structure WGe2As2P2, leading to advances in optoelectronic devices including infrared detectors, terahertz (THz) devices, and many other photonic applications, which are essential in medical diagnostics, telecommunications, and environmental monitoring."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945730","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6831a5c0fdbe831466910072","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"19","doi":null,"documentHash":"01aa1e56-d514-46b3-99e3-6151ea5741eb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"19574-19584","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.4c11719","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839e83efdbe8368347eb0da","name":"Zhengbiao","lastName":"Ouyang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89cbf5fd-f59e-4b95-90f0-bfa5983f69d3"},{"objectId":"6839e83efdbe8368347eb0d9","name":"Kashif","lastName":"Hussain","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3391f082-56dc-49b5-b66e-0623234319d4"},{"objectId":"6839e83efdbe8368347eb0d8","name":"Ghulam","lastName":"Hussain","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a13d3f5-7755-48f9-aa57-4c0d92ef41c7"},{"objectId":"6839e83efdbe8368347eb0d7","name":"Ata Ur","lastName":"Rahman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe445574-e330-471d-b399-f8ec29e882a3"},{"objectId":"61a054b87523402fabdf7c91","name":"Ashfaq","lastName":"Ahmad","uuid":"01F8B669FA5166582DA45B1EF43C7E2049959C521A77007D5447B0644D419C570203ACA76CCDEAF599C3BDFB60833D247FF3B5826957D6E6A2EC4F01E2EA7C22","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca9faa4b-2578-4d3a-91ec-9523ff87351c"}],"doi":"10.1021/acsomega.4c11719"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-3-031-44350-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Modern Technologies in Energy and Transport","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":316,"publicationPlace":"Cham","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839fea9fdbe8331742649d4","editors":[{"objectId":"6839fea9fdbe8331742649d8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Yakovlieva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1079af39-e55f-444d-9d29-6de5241540b8"},{"objectId":"6839fea9fdbe8331742649d7","name":"Sergii","lastName":"Boichenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0823c0e1-f0e4-430d-b9fa-c8df43f83083"},{"objectId":"6839fea9fdbe8331742649d6","name":"Artur","lastName":"Zaporozhets","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cad2da7b-0f8a-4f7d-af7b-d7b48792b22b"},{"objectId":"6839fea9fdbe8331742649d5","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Shkilniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39700bc7-f855-4014-ac68-6de1658ee26d"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6839fea9fdbe8331742649d5","6839fea9fdbe8331742649d6","6839fea9fdbe8331742649d7","6839fea9fdbe8331742649d8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Explores the advances in development of transport and energy sector Focuses on solutions for reducing negative impact of energy and transport on environment Presents advancement in alternative motor fuels and lubricants technology"}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945732","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-44351-0","numberInSeries":"510","authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-44351-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7934-749-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Photovoltaic systems are being used in almost every industry, including autonomous power systems used on ships, space vehicles, or flying platforms, where the voltage supplying specific equipment can change in an overridingly controlled manner. Feeding energy from a renewable source into a power system with highly dynamic frequency changes is not possible for traditional grid converter control strategies. This is caused by the synchronization system, which is designed for a fixed value of the grid voltage frequency, and by the proportional-resonant controllers used. In this paper, it is shown that frequency tracking correction causes deviations from the unit amplitude of synchronization signals, causing errors in the reference signals responsible for the active and reactive components of the converter current. To solve this problem, a new variable frequency adaptation system using a generalized second-order integrator was proposed. As a result, synchronization signals of unit amplitude were obtained. Due to the proposed method, the proportional-resonant controller was able to control the active and reactive components of the current even when the voltage frequency changes, adjusting the resonant frequency."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945735","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67584acbfdbe835dc16a96ec","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"24","doi":null,"documentHash":"6285251b-203e-4a5e-987f-9187104e743a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/24/6302","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdecfdbe8331742635ea","name":"Ľubomír","lastName":"Beňa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b843701-22de-433c-a96c-7c4128d5b8db"},{"objectId":"6839bdecfdbe8331742635e9","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Pijarski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d59e0d0f-1c16-4942-a439-55abafc898b8"},{"objectId":"6839bdecfdbe8331742635e8","name":"Dušan","lastName":"Medveď","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"728f5090-24db-403a-8c78-0722b0de72c2"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951be","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Binkowski","uuid":"1DF077CC9ADFFB3E0131E8213B8B9593BB8271A6462C949DA8CE8EDB35AE271C63049F112D8166DE9B2C89ACFB3EBA6DE965BF703D9C71421DA4F4A64A9950F4","orcidId":"0000-0001-5149-319X","documentHash":"c87d0f46-0ce7-48a4-9ed4-337e2013c224"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17246302"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["data acquisition and evaluation","EV charging process","charging infrastructure","Smart Industry Lab"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In sheet metal forming processes, additionally, lubricant and tool surface roughness play a key role in changing the surface topography of the drawpieces. This article presents the results of friction analysis on the edge of the punch in a deep drawing process using the bending under tension test. A DC04 steel sheet was used as the test material. The influence of various types of titanium nitride and titanium coatings applied on the surface of countersamples made of 145Cr6 cold-work tool steel was tested by means of high-intensity plasma pulses, magnetron sputtering, and electron pulse irradiation. The influence of the type of tool coating on the evolution of the coefficient of friction, the change in the sheet surface topography, and the temperature in the contact zone is presented in this paper. An increase in the coefficient of friction with sample elongation was observed. Countersamples modified with protective coatings provided a more stable coefficient value during the entire friction test compared to dry friction conditions. The electron pulse irradiated countersample provided the highest stability of the coefficient of friction in the entire range of sample elongation until fracture. The skewness Ssk of the sheet metal tested against the coated countersamples was characterized by negative value, which indicates a plateau-like shape of their surface.

Design/methodology/approach: The method was developed based on a defined set of possible responses and their frequency, in order to identify questions that are incorrectly formulated or those for which the rating scale does not meet the assumed measurement criteria in subsequent stages. The process of survey analysis was automated, based on the average ratings, standard deviation, and properties of the normal distribution. Four main propositions were formed, methodically justified, and tested through an example. Findings: Mapping customer requirements using the Likert scale may lead to data loss and bias in customer opinions in certain cases. Using a weighted, centred rating scale may cause excessive fragmentation of respondents' answers. Variance in the standard deviation of a sample analysed for a single point on the Likert scale leads to the loss of information. Research limitations/implications: The method ensures the improvement of surveys before they are presented to a representative research group, increasing the chances of obtaining reliable and useful results. The proposed method can be successfully applied to analyse responses from any research questionnaires, especially in the early stages of their development. Practical implications: The method helps identify potential errors during the development of preliminary versions of research questionnaires. Therefore, the method allows surveys to be adjusted before their use in obtaining a representative research sample. This increases the chances of obtaining reliable and useful results. This method can be applied by any survey designer in practice. Social implications: The improved survey, according to this method, supports the process of obtaining respondent feedback in later stages of research, particularly during the main studies conducted among the target research sample. Respondents, when providing answers, have the opportunity to express their opinions more precisely, leading to the collection of accurate results. Originality/value: The developed method, which is iterative in nature, dynamically identifies inconsistencies in respondents' answers and proposes alternative solutions for selecting rating scales or analysing respondents' answers."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945744","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839beb2fdbe833174263c84","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"211","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b3516360-a116-4ca5-81ae-2ccd6587d411"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"143-160","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/211-Grzybowski-Siwiec-Pacana.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d580","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Grzybowski","uuid":"1C60518D30DD9FC16E51C65EAF5F138CA28948D76EF772BEA9586AE5174B740B32DA3B349DF38B91532EEF82E8E20F70424842A551BEF3BDE278B92A558CD47C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3207-5053","documentHash":"9f11b03a-b1c2-4ffe-8838-624e3eb85635"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.211.9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mobile robots","decision support systems","artificial intelligence","influence mapping"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The aforementioned cost can be based on time, distance, the number of required turns, and other individual or complex criteria. Pathfinding in dynamic environments is a complex issue, which has a long history of academic interest. An environment is considered dynamic when its topology may change in real time, often due to human interference. Influence mapping is a solution originating from the field of video games, which was previously used to solve similar problems in virtual environments, but achieved mixed results in real-life scenarios. The purpose of this study was to find whether the algorithm could be used in real indoor environments when combined with information collected by remote sensors."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945746","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6736fdc4fdbe8319846def32","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"d951593a-bcbd-4466-94fa-f1a0ed819ac0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/22/7240","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c46f","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Łabuński","uuid":"CF6F1439D64DFBC9DABB23515756333C8A8ECAC5EA13E99A5835627EFD1231DC26D42512D33403B7A55B802584D5FF8CB02572A7DDF3DDF4BB07B07FBE687D96","orcidId":"0000-0003-3105-1727","documentHash":"67bfce0e-0b22-4e6f-9c72-0e823c4db950"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b723","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Ożóg","uuid":"4F66E3945AD2CE67F34E868C4341D29FA329CC470837F6C117ECA5FEB1F79488DAA83F3C265A2A159A78FC6D4A412E6C7F526396C1EEBBA7A2C940CF3B195A3E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5213-9667","documentHash":"0fdde765-b74a-4119-831d-8a5ecf867c2d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b71b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Stawarz","uuid":"70813CCBE9968ADAD5586293A74C4ECEDD8363C86D52A4FA76C35828498E29C90275E3A226B530D3CDCD07DF63B294BED7A2032B464CD2A0DDDBCBF02C9307FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6124-0452","documentHash":"b37fb312-4f42-4ed6-82dc-a6ca20ff945c"}],"doi":"10.3390/s24227240"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Environmental effects of metal extraction","Coatings on metals","Alloy development","Conference Proceedings","Mechanical behavior of Metal Alloys","superalloys"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-3-031-63936-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Using two-dimensional X-ray diffraction (XRD), we measured residual stresses on both the anterior and posterior sides. Three LITECOR® composite types, with core thicknesses of 0.8, 1.25, and 1.6 mm, were examined. Results indicate that as core thickness increases, residual stress values decrease on both sides. Notably, anterior side stresses on the y-axis are relatively higher (1027–1199 MPa) compared to the x-axis, exceeding posterior side values (998–1083 MPa) at 0.8 mm core thickness. Moreover, the study compares these values with Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) and finds that SPIF generally yields lower stress values for all core thicknesses. These findings suggest that SPIF is favourable for achieving minimal residual stress in LITECOR® composites. Addressing residual stresses is crucial for enhancing structural integrity and extending the service life of sandwich panels and composite materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945751","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839ec36fdbe833174263f2c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"6","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6401959a-f7d6-4fdd-80a8-3ce8d63fb329"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42452-024-05666-y","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ec36fdbe833174263f30","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Korzeniowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1d42ff7-d57b-4cba-b892-7410e8065f83"},{"objectId":"6839ec36fdbe833174263f2f","name":"Raheem","lastName":"Al-Sabur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed7c119b-90bd-40dc-850f-f2318de6cb9d"},{"objectId":"6839ec36fdbe833174263f2e","name":"Ján","lastName":"Slota","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b14ed818-813b-4bb3-a705-2290f34fa1c3"},{"objectId":"6839ec36fdbe833174263f2d","name":"Hassanein I.","lastName":"Khalaf","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"16c4bfb2-a8bc-484e-97f3-e40dd5ee20dd"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c457","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Ochał","uuid":"927B04794B969D23DF056F1E1834D78CD5C17552EAB67D5506CCDB41B4FA8E4D2116BAD6A4A90AFE6353D3F7A5922D4D19E9DF2B8E27D24CC95471A44B3F7433","orcidId":"0000-0003-0641-0273","documentHash":"c02c88d2-bce4-4d0d-a79a-a0a951e6ae13"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b746","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Gradzik","uuid":"972224633B2907FFF730B28311D920D620936DD788EE9D9470E27A7882E70172D2BBC743EA5F2E3E0BAB03936121EC4926F1AE16628BF69FEE8F8BA5562DBD19","orcidId":"0000-0003-0491-8890","documentHash":"d765d9f6-5a4e-46a7-8919-34b6958f4ace"}],"doi":"10.1007/s42452-024-05666-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["organizational change","information technology","AI-powered digital transformation","process optimization","digital transformation","process automation","artificial intelligence"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The design of the coupled process was supported by a dynamic model. The model was calibrated on the basis of band profiles of variants determined experimentally for the mAb materials of different variant compositions. The numerical simulations were used to select the coupling configuration and the loading conditions that allowed for efficient separation of the mAb materials into three products enriched with each individual variant: the acidic (av), main (mv) and basic (bv) one. In the CEX section, a two-step pH gradient was used to split the loaded mass of mAb into a weakly bound fraction enriched with av and mv, and a strongly bound fraction containing the bv-rich product. The weakly bound fraction was further processed in the AEX section, where the mv-rich product was eluted in flowthrough, while the av-rich product was collected by a step change in pH. The choice of flow distribution and the number of columns in the CEX and AEX sections depended on the variant composition of the mAb material. For the selected configurations, the optimized mAb loading density in the CEX columns ranged from 10 to 26 mg mL-1, while in the AEX columns it was as high as 300 or 600 mg mL-1, depending on the variant composition of the mAb material. By proper selection of the loading condition, a trade-off between yield and purity of the products could be reached."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945755","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bccafdbe833174262cc8","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"1733","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"06da456b-39c1-4c85-a970-e93ac585ef07"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021967324006307","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f856771085dcb410a25eda8","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Zimoch-Rumanek","uuid":"F212E6526FDEF4C427F815E5FE3708BD13B2EE2EE62AC8D3E2750C9B9363FEF8C9BFC28F08592FF52C0CB743FF2756F28FCBB0AEE581DBD75D0367CCE5DDF375","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30e25430-7d89-4b00-ac28-52df05bdb404"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395194","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Antos","uuid":"41F1949A79E9F2CCA5DA05E449BE58DD6991FEEC6689608B2AAA8E2A55BEECF5CF3C795F80FDC9D5F157BF99A1C8D5AACDF2D18D9034FBD0CC75BDFF48345723","orcidId":"0000-0001-8246-5052","documentHash":"6cfc2713-1b76-4663-ae9a-85f8d16c0b1d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.chroma.2024.465256"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["load testing","web server stress test","performance testing","performance test application","formal software testing","application bottleneck","distributed system performance test","stress testing","application stress test","performance methodology","web application stress test"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The model was used to develop and implement performance tests in a laboratory environment and in a production system. The proposed division of the testing process into layers correlated with the test preparation steps allows to separate quasi-independent areas, which can be handled by isolated teams of engineers. Such an approach allows to accelerate the process of implementation of performance tests and may affect the optimization of the cost of their implementation."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945756","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bc8efdbe833174262afc","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"16","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"017a08ee-825a-4728-9f74-8ff3259e17c7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/16/10/366","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc8efdbe833174262afd","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Starzec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a0c8f38-cfcd-4a3d-8f2d-2cbdb274837c"},{"objectId":"621d93387523402df08b0230","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ćmil","uuid":"8039A04F68CA102104746C8E761E09F77DB8F88F51EC84BE3B2501895C359A751CBDCA8EE47DD354E3891EF6BFF744A8E3D92CBCD87C3A87895160CB9AC16835","orcidId":"0000-0002-5941-4385","documentHash":"99223f32-d1ec-42e4-b79c-f8e94ddd5727"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5cd","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bolanowski","uuid":"D8E202ECFD9AAF6D9BCBD52C5BC890F7CF939CC63F7561C2E5E29F8D9FC8C4C8F2805F51335AB38F4887E500F811C6058246D66DBDA35D11E2FE0B347C275095","orcidId":"0000-0003-4645-967X","documentHash":"57abda5b-87f7-4e60-8d69-c3b194ae426f"}],"doi":"10.3390/fi16100366"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["experiment","torsion","thin-walled stuctures","finite elements method","stiffeners","3D printing"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

However, this is problematic mainly because of the need to make many complex decisions at the early stages of product development. Due to limited research in this area, the aim was to analyse the approach of companies to sustainable development when designing new products and improving products already on the market. This approach was considered according to the key aspects of sustainable product development, i.e.: quality (customer satisfaction with use), environment (impact in the life cycle), society (changes in the social environment) and cost. Pilot studies were conducted among manufacturing companies. These were surveys with a Likert scale, in which the following were verified: i) the frequency of actions taken regarding verified aspects, and ii) the degree to which these aspects were taken into account during product development. It was shown, for example, that the most frequently undertaken actions are those related to product costs, then quality, and slightly less often, environment and society. A similar phenomenon was observed in the case of the degree to which these aspects were taken into account in product development activities, which was additionally confirmed by the results of statistical analysis according to the sign test in the STATISTICA program.

A lamp with a direct drive LED inverter was selected to present the methodology for determining the coefficient of immunity of the test object to a standardized type of surge. The choice of this configuration was important for the testing process and presentation of the methodology to estimate the immunity coefficient of the tested system. In this work, the methodology for determining the deterministic immunity factor of the model inverter to a normalized type of disturbance was presented. Considerations were carried out for a 1.2/50 µs (8/20 µs) surge in accordance with the recommendations of the EN 61000-4-5:2014 standard. This conventional surge is used in laboratory practice to test the immunity of electronic and electrical systems and devices to disturbances that can be generated in the power grid during switching processes, short circuits, and direct and indirect lightning. In the first stage of testing on test benches, the intensity of damage to the integral components of a model inverter was examined with increasing levels of disturbance. Statistical measures characterizing their impact resistance were determined for each of the elements tested. Knowing their values, the value of this coefficient was finally determined for the lamp selected for testing, and the mechanism of its damage was analyzed."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945771","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67499f04fdbe83251666efbf","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"23","doi":"","documentHash":"fd502825-bded-42a7-b3d2-20c65d92410b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/23/4607","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5eb","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Sabat","uuid":"0207333360D6B54FC7F11691CDC2BBC103FCAF15A69E09AE618E2A6E8D0DACD2FB594A9DF413248AEE9FD07907EE3F5773607AA0E5D7230CB2AB6533E492BB11","orcidId":"0000-0002-7467-5647","documentHash":"d8d079e7-82d8-498a-8ac7-c7b2536ce55b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5e6","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Kuryło","uuid":"D978D49E72AB0779835E888B4051AEAA54EF1351D320C3AF97D841CBF26549CD9F2D08CB048B3E50826108AE235A5CA7073FFFDEE4126B52285BE666EA55933B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1386-5049","documentHash":"a3c7aec4-15f2-4c57-b826-36b89995d819"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5db","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Klepacki","uuid":"87CBF5983A5D31948C56F0D5BF42C824A06109063552A53CC2ACA3AF46AB08B677AE460847F6C1B3BD19E0579475B70BB84DF1E8640DF5055E2F41A8338ED11B","orcidId":"0000-0002-4396-5262","documentHash":"008ae4be-d4b2-44e4-8811-dd788aea40fc"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951db","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Kamuda","uuid":"1D412AA71407CAA5D31BFC923475D40EB56314317792C766A13922BF8A3A8041E9ECBE84BF8E5D2DC2E687FA3B90AA233EB9933FF7073F7685C54AD9B5C5FD43","orcidId":"0000-0001-7972-2636","documentHash":"4f70cd7d-9f21-4502-8f53-f84c0bf81bc8"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951d9","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jankowski-Mihułowicz","uuid":"D88B5ADE4BD712A7B74E9BA85531387D183F63BBF42CF7E41D20A1267117874938D01D933AB485E9799599FDC3B838288A05B9CD539F90B593CF598E870E8431","orcidId":"0000-0001-7396-807X","documentHash":"ee8c0c33-030a-4831-8fdb-768fb8b58ecf"}],"doi":"10.3390/electronics13234607"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7934-720-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The technology for producing asphalt mixtures (AM) at lower temperatures (WMA—warm asphalt mix) using zeolite materials for the bitumen foaming process fits perfectly into these trends. Therefore, towards the development of this technology, the research presented in this paper presents the modification process of zeolite NaP1 from fly ash with silanes of different chemical structures (TEOS, MPTS, TESPT) and their application in the foaming process of bitumen modified with polymers (PMB 45/80-55). The scope of the work includes two main novelty elements: (1) the use of zeolite–silane composites in bitumen foaming and (2) polymer-modified bitumen foaming. Chemical characterisation carried out by EDS-XRF, FTIR, and XPS analysis clearly demonstrated the success of the zeolite matrix modification process, which directly resulted in textural changes. Simultaneously, mineralogical analysis carried out by XRD showed the complete retention of the initial phase composition of zeolite matrix. Further studies have shown that the application of zeolite–oxide composites results in less PMB 45/80-55 stiffening without imposing negative effects on its softening point and dynamic viscosity."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945775","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67406cedfdbe832d853b35ae","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"64051828-5f95-4984-b33a-8ac6a987172f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/23/5902","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdaafdbe8331742633d9","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Woszuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"648cceab-a89c-4726-90e6-f2581d18d784"},{"objectId":"6839bdaafdbe8331742633d8","name":"Roman","lastName":"Pacholak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"daf10845-dd40-4916-994e-74d266f022a6"},{"objectId":"6839bdaafdbe8331742633d7","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2403e824-3bd7-482b-9761-5fc82aa3adbf"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d54b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kołodziej","uuid":"97842B1211A2A185052BD838A138719A8D46C87CD681572DD6E3DDFB43E117754FB727EB2E7403DC14818CA6DA9E1DDBCDB572DE4E2D3B2E7F5C03F05E8C0B1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2987-6140","documentHash":"2e9cfb6e-c4ca-47d9-a21b-6244fb7adcd3"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17235902"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["inconsistency reduction","pairwise comparisons","small/medium enterprises","decision support"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

AHP relies on pairwise comparisons to assign weights to decision criteria or alternatives, but human-generated PC matrices often exhibit inconsistencies. Consistency is evaluated using Saaty’s consistency ratio ( \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC45  ), where a value below 0.10 is considered acceptable. Higher inconsistency levels necessitate matrix corrections, which are challenging if the original expert is unavailable or revision constraints exist. REDUCE autonomously reduces inconsistency in PC matrices using two different algorithms that require no expert intervention. The tool accommodates different PC matrices, enabling users to specify the desired CR threshold (e.g., \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC45≤0.10 ) and select the algorithm for adjustment. It ensures the resulting matrix is consistent while preserving the original preference structure to the greatest extent possible. Additionally, REDUCE calculates weights for the compared entities, making it a valuable tool for applications of AHP and related methodologies. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that REDUCE can improve matrices with high inconsistency (e.g., \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC45=0.25 ) to acceptable levels (e.g., \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC45=0.08 ) while retaining up to 95% of the original preference integrity, depending on the chosen algorithm. By addressing the accessibility gap for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that lack resources for costly decision-making software or expert consultants, REDUCE facilitates broader adoption of MCDM tools. This work highlights the potential of REDUCE to enhance decision-making reliability and accessibility in resource-constrained environments."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945777","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6744309afdbe832d85de024f","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"33db2ac7-0df2-4425-9b1c-3b110b55eda8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/23/11465","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdc8fdbe8331742634d8","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Vanivska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"841f7f4e-fa3a-4707-b461-466fbc12c20d"},{"objectId":"65e29d3a40e3ff25249abe19","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Demidowski","uuid":"140736668086603886E6757A5B7ED8FDEE55C180B943D0D1EBE25425B94DA85D14E054D8775A5ABDB1A585926CF373CF9B1DFCCE7F4A44D45F33A218E3D0A6AE","orcidId":"0009-0004-6376-0709","documentHash":"ca36a345-198a-4205-9f59-6b125409022f"},{"objectId":"633b9aaa7523402e340ef592","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Organiściak","uuid":"E4A1789302696CDEAFA93427B7B0D0E29E18D959414D2BC17A4B860A6BC3007A6B95AD64F4D451713660884B12D87FA52E675A61641A08381D5AD8991C19A785","orcidId":"0000-0002-5277-4038","documentHash":"6c96641e-781d-475c-9a5c-4fe9fadfa725"},{"objectId":"603dd4539543c711bc6e9e95","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kuraś","uuid":"8370DCDAE3C43EE1EBFC33FE43E9D0F310B529A914208E02309F06B498D6EDFBB52435D5F453014303DA28C5BC101F52E051A2B370A88109653DE2C6EE5A88F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-8658-0821","documentHash":"4130f367-245a-498c-9429-3c5e7e4229c1"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6fb","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Kowal","uuid":"589D84256CDE0861A79EC93B5E28EC820AAC2910CF0DC2FCD5ECF14A6575E9AC9998E503E33E051AC8B79527E672144903F35A17D9E5A5B69BD09DBBF163D4B2","orcidId":"0000-0002-7909-6484","documentHash":"546af200-7a08-4b2e-b891-0bd7a5f3add1"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951d2","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Strzałka","uuid":"3F312F0A337089C2CF0FA5E901DBA55929BFA86882E4B9C6E2E297EAD16AAD0CC1E32983D8883894E80738A749142B7A71DDAD1040F55DD68BF2571967291113","orcidId":"0000-0002-8887-4321","documentHash":"6d8a2ac3-290b-4d36-aab1-a504ebb119f9"}],"doi":"10.3390/app142311465"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0ODY0Njk0NTc3Nw=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
