The warming of the climate and more frequent occurrence of droughts can both increase the SWR phenomenon. Land management demands that mitigation measures be continually adapted to strengthen the resilience of ecosystems and risk reduction strategies be refined. The aim of the work is to analyse the persistence and strength of SWR and soil moisture content (SMC) in sandy soil on abandoned agricultural land with a second succession of pine (S1), and in soil used for growing rye (S2). The studies cover the dry period from March 2019 to March 2020. Systematic measurements of SWR and SMC are carried out in two-week intervals for soil at depths of 0–0.05 and 0.35–0.40 m. For the top layer, the average SMC values for S1 and S2 are 7.18% and 11.21%, respectively. The field studies show a more substantial and longer-lasting repellency (extreme SWR classes occurred for 10 months) at the pine site than the studied phenomena in regions with a warmer climate. These studies make it possible to verify the dependence of SWR on SMC for both test sites, and excellent agreement is achieved between the critical SMC threshold for hydrophobicity determined in the laboratory and under field measurement conditions. Based on the indicated water and ethanol sorptivity, the average indices of hydrophobicity (R index) and their course in relation to SMC, are indicated. The average water sorptivity for S1 is 0.266 cm min−0.5, for S2 is 0.383 cm min−0.5. The average R index values are 31.91 and 3.97, respectively. These findings suggest that SWR may be a key soil property for identifying the occurrence of risk connected with the drying out of soil, especially in relation to a warming climate."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172531","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6576d2384097071b8efb6079","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"208","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"38372a5e-03a9-4727-84c8-cd8f208d7bdc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-9, [nr art.] 105780","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S034181622100638X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6576d2384097071b8efb607f","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Sas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e70012cd-752e-495f-ac00-f8a0ef9cfab5"},{"objectId":"6576d2384097071b8efb607e","name":"Marian","lastName":"Korc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc43ee75-15c7-4ca3-8a65-6a629aa603bd"},{"objectId":"6576d2384097071b8efb607d","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Hewelke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6182ed47-8b24-4e2d-90ee-eb397b17e804"},{"objectId":"6576d2384097071b8efb607c","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Gozdowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06baa088-e761-4345-b09b-f4fb07167926"},{"objectId":"6576d2384097071b8efb607b","name":"Ewa Beata","lastName":"Górska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44917149-cff2-4548-878f-2ba7bd88a483"},{"objectId":"6576d2384097071b8efb607a","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Małuszyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"434a73d3-48eb-43ef-b72c-1786095452af"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0fde","name":"Lilla","lastName":"Mielnik","uuid":"F9251A3F41C28945BC72B727188CE318B154CC26AA3A3D2A8F2852F0D8FC8D72EDEC051D2265277CEDA88CA09A724B671801B44204E95455505D22CD52746386","orcidId":"0000-0002-6570-3087","documentHash":"21cd34f1-0014-4042-86cb-b91c649c37d9"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.catena.2021.105780"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e087","uid":"bb1eAT2BMBTGkk695wKT43A","uuid":"7c53f923-c0ac-4e2d-82db-2c93b9fd6578","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Rolniczo-Ekonomiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930a878c28a0473a1a55"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparing the emergence of Echinochloa crus-galli populations in different locations.

paper presents the theoretical and experimental research conducted to date regarding the possibility of obtaining round bars from AZ31 magnesium alloy with a bimodal structure rolled in the radial shear rolling process (RSR) technology. There is no analysis of the impact of the deformation path (distribution of deformation in individual passes) on the mechanical properties and the obtained bar structure. The feedstock, namely, AZ31 magnesium alloy round bars with a diameter of 30 mm, were rolled in RSR to the final diameter of 15 mm with different levels of deformation in successive passes, at a temperature of 400 °C. The bars obtained as a result of the RSR rolling process have different hardness on the cross-section as well as a characteristic gradient grain size distribution. Based on the conducted research, it can be concluded that the use of a larger number of passes with a smaller cross-section reduction will result in an improved formation of a bimodal structure consisting of a highly fragmented near-surface structure and in the half of the radius of the structure of fragmented grains at the boundaries of larger grains."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172549","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.15","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/3/954/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70946a878c28a0473bc97a","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"WACHOWSKI","uuid":"18E9A988D49F5A43F0E00C2BA5940AAB11E428969FCB24720945050780007E4746B07BA8815F1468D3558D33F7B2A62F2F5F8438350C3ED4407B043BD783CD66","orcidId":"0000-0002-6732-5972","documentHash":"a5652c2f-27ee-4299-990a-ec3d11a43e35"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e85d","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Mróz","uuid":"3A0D932446FA01EE390FF4D56430E8B551F7BABEB02199FF38A2C4DFD38092264017B55FF804CF2FE955EED4AF5197511EB0851727618BF9661D49C4079CA884","orcidId":"0000-0002-0479-2303","documentHash":"cd6d3876-f498-47b0-a13a-e808aaca1ff6"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e82f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Szota","uuid":"87FBA8F0B72C893AA34C8CF2124B042E0929352F6DD0ECC67C428452B802A5D6E69574D3C6F5495181462F4348DA37C930B1FA92C8705CA3FD598F57DEECA01C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2604-6771","documentHash":"013a2c60-f749-416e-9e8d-3a77daf19573"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e803","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Stefanik","uuid":"9A2E66873923470B4337B32462A215309A3D26EB1DF97E8BB2B6B1005342A3C2C52A2238B3AFD7AE117C9BA31CCAC8E1A309508D27894C13FD523EC2BF69B547","orcidId":"0000-0003-3568-4863","documentHash":"627d1c98-1e06-470f-8deb-b25a32f3293c"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15030954"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","parentUuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","rootUuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

A new, nonlinear, adaptive, robust, and practically applicable motion controller for a motor-driven servo is proposed. The developed controller guarantees that the transient of the motion is practically finished in a predefined time, and after this moment, the desired motion trajectory is tracked with specified accuracy, inviolable, time-variable constraints imposed on the position and the velocity are preserved, and all these features are robust against disturbances and violations of the system’s parameters. This approach, distinguished by the fact that the settling time and the quasi-steady-state tracking accuracy are explicitly available design parameters, has never been described before. The controller is based on a special type of time-varying barrier Lyapunov function (BLF), responsible for the finite-time tracking and for meeting the constraints. The derivation of the controller is based on Lyapunov stability theory. A mixture of robust adaptive, nonlinear control techniques is applied to prove the system’s stability. Numerous simulations and experiments with a real permanent-magnet motor- driven servo prove the practical applicability and usefulness of the presented approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172555","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6eab52467f030e8c433a6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f6ef340-c61f-44fb-8d93-a045bc59a21f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"934","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/934","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739532f","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Mosiołek","uuid":"79D121B3E5EF1C9187A7F7BFF11639EA14B38F9B1BBE38313B8353D782E9207D41A9758DA3439BED464FDCE1716E555A5E47E8F7AD32062FC66613F6E9E4F52E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9592-7196","documentHash":"dfe0a3cc-e132-45f3-bc40-8dd7c7f72735"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a0473952fa","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Jastrzębski","uuid":"C49CA79620D40BA9B1556C64FF5E5B64E5DD26CCA1EDAEED65987F483382D9B06A701FB23F54042855F5134991DB95F3D3B51AF124E09022CE9674C9FBF0CE1B","orcidId":"0000-0003-2130-1251","documentHash":"51b9129c-7f21-4624-8424-9b1c953bfc0f"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a0473952f4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kabziński","uuid":"87F062CD6303C96269BD64D5BA3F148C0AF88E68CBF97B53946D930942524C9850593C93D037BB5EC682EE1D873933C422F5CC914A263CF47AC671508A7DB473","orcidId":"0000-0003-3948-2900","documentHash":"ec09579b-6a15-475f-bccd-7d34ef8519a7"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15030934"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["colossal magnetoresistance","low-field magnetoresistance","manganite films","nanostruc- tured thin films","MOCVD technology","magnetic field sensors"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092bc878c28a04739baa7","5e7092bc878c28a04739bacc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Enhancement of Room-Temperature Low-Field Magnetoresistance in Nanostructured Lanthanum Manganite Films for Magnetic Sensor Applications","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"Sensors","doi":null,"issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-3210","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"80ff8bca-a845-44fd-adcb-a436c0342b72"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e82e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6299a7734097072c2b78e830","6299a7734097072c2b78e831","6299a7734097072c2b78e832","6299a7734097072c2b78e833","6299a7734097072c2b78e834","6299a7734097072c2b78e835","6299a7734097072c2b78e836","6299a7734097072c2b78e837","6299a7734097072c2b78e838","5e7092bc878c28a04739baa7","5e7092bc878c28a04739bacc"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The results of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) properties of La1-xSrxMnyO3 (LSMO) films grown by the pulsed injection MOCVD technique onto an Al2O3 substrate are presented. The grown films with different Sr (0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.3) and Mn excess (y > 1) concentrations were nanostructured with vertically aligned column-shaped crystallites spread perpendicular to the film plane. It was found that microstructure, resistivity, and magnetoresistive properties of the films strongly depend on the strontium and manganese concentration. All films (including low Sr content) exhibit a metal–insulator transition typical for manganites at a certain temperature, Tm. The Tm vs. Sr content dependence for films with a constant Mn amount has maxima that shift to lower Sr values with the increase in Mn excess in the films. Moreover, the higher the Mn excess concentration in the films, the higher the Tm value obtained. The highest Tm values (270 K) were observed for nanostructured LSMO films with x = 0.17–0.18 and y = 1.15, while the highest low-field magnetoresistance (0.8% at 50 mT) at room temperature (290 K) was achieved for x = 0.3 and y = 1.15. The obtained low-field MR values were relatively high in comparison to those published in the literature results for lanthanum manganite films prepared without additional insulating oxide phases. It can be caused by high Curie temperature (383 K), high saturation magnetization at room temperature (870 emu/cm3), and relatively thin grain boundaries. The obtained results allow to fabricate CMR sensors for low magnetic field measurement at room temperature."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172559","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6291f5d040970753a33a6872","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"3223bc09-05ff-4139-9934-0f6d0b8d5221"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"4004-1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4004/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e838","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Koliada","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32f50b4c-82b5-4a3d-9c8a-600b9c4a890f"},{"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e837","name":"Martynas","lastName":"Skapas","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6152-4612","documentHash":"9f6ccd34-c6f8-40bb-aa17-5041ae37840a"},{"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e836","name":"Remigijus","lastName":"Vasiliauskas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0cd2d7c2-87b1-450f-ba3d-32bf3e4be2cf"},{"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e835","name":"Jorunas","lastName":"Dobilas","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8864-100X","documentHash":"619c14d0-9062-4a56-8022-9190b36c2a67"},{"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e834","name":"Valentina","lastName":"Plausinaitiene","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8dd6d226-e989-4048-a468-7cf2a22f5b38"},{"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e833","name":"Milita","lastName":"Vagner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dda41c72-7f8b-4b9f-91db-86267204f5dc"},{"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e832","name":"Skirmantas","lastName":"Kersulis","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1815-357X","documentHash":"150ab063-0f86-4949-b3b9-2670e53c0ffa"},{"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e831","name":"Voitech","lastName":"Stankevic","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6552-0862","documentHash":"e5628e4c-d126-451e-8753-3019fa4a6c74"},{"objectId":"6299a7734097072c2b78e830","name":"Nerija","lastName":"Zurauskiene","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0912-4563","documentHash":"f32cef84-56d0-4f8f-8f05-a91743b9f5c8"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bacc","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wiśniewski","uuid":"ED58CD29B6C021B9A8937CF6C5F6DD65C4259962B2CAE80D79B9C44AEEBC357F2171F2474F4E0BC42816F8B36F3CA52C692318A9CDCC23B4A18761427688B383","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"009c4e99-4c32-45c3-a43b-f08896a3eea3"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739baa7","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Piętosa","uuid":"EEE7B36AFF673F0E9A0375CD6F7EF3134CD38FF62000401D2CFB6B08409774D2BB3BC8790E890B157B47E65A054FD14B4BE2456ABB4B41E4A19E888ED4684B5F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0824-5120","documentHash":"1d8ff047-dd6e-4e32-b5e5-48134659dde4"}],"doi":"10.3390/s22114004"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["data association","visual surveillance","crowd analysis","algebraic model."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A data association model for analysis of crowd structure","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478175","mniswId":"8624","title":"International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science","doi":null,"issn":"1641-876X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"dfc095e3-860a-4798-924f-bd64ed62bed8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629c5e2f4097070cd347e4c5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094be878c28a0473c2f2b","63d271c64097071d34bd62d3"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper discusses a non-deterministic model for data association tasks in visual surveillance of crowds. Using detectionand tracking of crowd components (i.e., individuals and groups) as baseline tools, we propose a simple algebraic frameworkfor maintaining data association (continuity of labels assigned to crowd components) between subsequent video-frames inspite of possible disruptions and inaccuracies in tracking/detection algorithms.  Formally, two alternative schemes (which,in practice, can be jointly used) are introduced,  depending on whether individuals or groups can be prospectively bettertracked in the current scenario. In the first scheme, only individuals are tracked, and the continuity of group labels is inferredwithout explicitly tracking the groups.  In the second scheme,only group tracking is performed, and associations betweenindividuals are inferred from group tracking.  The associations are built upon non-deterministic estimates of memberships(individuals in groups) and estimates obtained directly from the baseline detection and tracking algorithms.

In this study, container on-site wastewater treatment plant with low-loaded activated sludge has been examined. The aim of the study was: (i) to assess the efficiency of the plant; and (ii) to evaluate the relationship between the condition of activated sludge and selected parameters of effluent quality. Effluent quality has been characterized by the reliability factor (RF) and technological purity index (TPI). Sludge quality assessment covered measurements of volume (Vo), dry matter (DM), sludge index (SI), and the unit oxygen consumption rate (UOCR). Microscopic analysis has been performed to assess the morphological (flocks) and biotic quality (sludge biotic index, SBI) of activated sludge. The research has been completed by an on-site measurement of dissolved oxygen concentration in an activated sludge chamber with 30 sec. intervals. Results confirmed a significant (p < 0.05) correlation (CC = −0.9277) between biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and SBI for the oxygen level in the aeration chamber between 1–2 mg/L. Negative significant correlation (p < 0.05) has also been found between SBI and electrical conductivity (EC) (CC = −0.7478).

This study aimed to analyze the associations between food neophobia, familiarity with French cuisine, body mass, and French restaurant menu food choices in a sample of 203 young Polish women. The Computer-Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) method was used in the study. The food choice questionnaire used for assessment was based on a model French restaurant menu, with dishes planned using a 2 × 2 factorial design for the components of neophobic potential (unfamiliar to Polish consumers) and animal-based components. Food neophobia, familiarity with French cuisine, and body mass were considered independent variables. The food neophobia scale (FNS) developed by Pliner and Hobden was used to assess food neophobia among respondents. The results showed an association between food neophobia and familiarity with French cuisine and French restaurant menu food choices (p ≤ 0.05), but no association with body mass was observed (p &gt; 0.05). The respondents with a high level of food neophobia chose dishes with neophobic components (for soups and desserts) less often compared to those with a low neophobia level, and in the absence of such an association, they chose dishes with animal-based components (for starters and main courses) less often (p ≤ 0.05). The respondents who declared that they were familiar with French cuisine chose dishes with animal-based components (for starters and desserts) more often than those with no familiarity, but a reverse association was observed for soups (p ≤ 0.05). Based on the findings of the study, it may be concluded that food neophobia and familiarity with French cuisine may be important determinants of food choice within a French restaurant menu. The study did not show any association between body mass and the choice of dishes from the model French restaurant menu. The findings suggest that the presence of unfamiliar and animal-based ingredients may reduce the frequency of choosing specific dishes within a French restaurant menu, which may reduce the diversity of individuals’ diets.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172572","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/nutrients/nutrients-14-01502/article_deploy/nutrients-14-01502.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392252","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Głąbska","uuid":"90985B97451547BE5F6DE3184BF3FFA38C6AE3B5BA09627F3E52328E0C80377834F6EAD744ACEE1B56787032951C09DBD4A097C62547DD460377019573D00863","orcidId":"0000-0001-8588-7357","documentHash":"0bba92e7-d7fc-491c-99ed-6128385a4f2c"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392247","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Guzek","uuid":"87CB53E61341DF5757913A88C52138A9F105A9CA251AA5B4E9F209F11BFAB2C2E27F0AD3C926DAB7EA9BA731CD0A55211C7AE9F2F95D650FEC1585BB0CE8ECAD","orcidId":"0000-0002-0784-3604","documentHash":"84abbaeb-7add-4aac-a1c7-2cb2e5bbdee5"}],"doi":"10.3390/nu14071502"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Navier-Stokes equations","stream function","vorticity","numerical methods","parallel algorithm"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"6162ce742467f002615e03b1","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"al-Farabi Kazakh National University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629651174097072fefbe39f3","629651174097072fefbe39f6","629651174097072fefbe39f4"]},{"id":"61b8aec42467f00dcbc2faa7","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Abai Kazakh National Pedagogical University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629651174097072fefbe39f5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Development of parallel implementation for the Navier-Stokes equation in doubly connected areas using the fictitious domain method","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629651174097072fefbe39f0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629651174097072fefbe39f3","629651174097072fefbe39f4","629651174097072fefbe39f5","629651174097072fefbe39f6"]},"issue":"4 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a numerical realization of the Navier-Stokes equations in irregular domains using the fictitious domain method with a continuation along with the lowest coefficient. To solve numerous connected issues in irregular regions, the fictitious domain method is broadly used. The advantage of the fictitious domain method is that the problem is solved not in the original complex domain, but in a few other, easier domains. Using the method, computation is done easily for a sufficiently wide class of problems with arbitrary computational domains.\n\nThe problem is solved using two methods. The primary method is based on the development of a distinct issue in variables of the stream function and the vortex velocity using the pressure uniqueness condition. The second method is to understand the expressed issue by the fictitious domain method with a continuation by lower coefficients.\n\nUsing the fictitious domain method, a computational algorithm is constructed based on the explicit finite difference schemes. The finite difference scheme is stable and has high computational accuracy and it gives the possibility to parallelize. Temperature distributions and stream functions are presented as numerical results.\n\nA parallel algorithm has been developed using Open Multi-Processing (hereinafter OpenMP) and Message Passing Interface (hereinafter MPI) technologies. Within the parallel approach, we used OpenMP technology for parallel calculation of vorticity and stream work, and for calculating temperature we applied MPI technology. The performance analysis on our parallel code shows favorable strong and weak scalability. The test results show that the code running in the parallel approach gives the expected results by comparing our results with those obtained while running the same simulation on the central processing unit (CPU)"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172574","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62964f434097072fefbe1a21","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"4 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"d2dd5a43-0263-4969-a70a-5bf4d22c10eb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"38-46","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254261/252749","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629651174097072fefbe39f6","name":"Syrym","lastName":"Kasenov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0097-1873","documentHash":"56423d61-ab01-4a95-a73c-4a9433a67ee8"},{"objectId":"629651174097072fefbe39f5","name":"Laura","lastName":"Temirbekovа","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2456-9974","documentHash":"95a2b687-6880-4c02-9b56-a1078c50e92f"},{"objectId":"629651174097072fefbe39f4","name":"Arshyn","lastName":"Altybay","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4939-8876","documentHash":"734adbb1-b6a6-4b48-b12d-3d21e5784e58"},{"objectId":"629651174097072fefbe39f3","name":"Almas","lastName":"Temirbekov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4157-2799","documentHash":"75f813ce-b8e6-43ac-924e-a2fe12aa9f58"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254261"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"629d01b24097070cd34d6f17","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-98392-5","title":"Biopolymers","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-030-98392-5","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-98392-5#about-book-content","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"fb08899a-0f3d-4be5-8f4c-15fe69c8f9a7","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Biopolymers from Agriculture Waste and By-Products","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d01b74097070cd34d7c70","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a0473921f2","629d01b74097070cd34d7c72"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The scale of agricultural waste is large, including crop residues (the plant waste left in the field after harvest), which retained in the field are responsible for agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

The massive amounts of agricultural waste such as stems, leaves, seeds, pods, and more, which never make it off the farm, are a subject of research to use them as bio-based packaging materials. As concerns about waste and by-products grow, researchers around the world are working to turn those materials into useful products and find new ways of using agricultural waste or other unappreciated materials as a valuable biopolymer. The most remarkable works are focusing on the production of bio-based packaging, which can be an alternative to petroleum-based plastics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172577","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"111-128","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-98392-5_6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629d01b74097070cd34d7c72","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Mikus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13cafc2b-6098-4f22-ad5e-ef8649b148b2"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921f2","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Galus","uuid":"195DC44E663BA8BD600477E005D766944EA4A5FD99838CD6E3F1EB54A847418EFB923AA66DB4CB9515BA3DD2FABF7D19D73E68C4480DD77C384B498E911E2F0E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2352-5307","documentHash":"9fc2f2b7-48ac-4455-a301-96c8a8ff5ca8"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-98392-5_6"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Kuchnie naszych sąsiadów – kuchnia ukraińska","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e71264246e0fb0001c18324","mniswId":null,"title":"Przegląd Gastronomiczny","doi":null,"issn":"0033-2119","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"d14c19ce-f54a-4998-9586-112325f7f320"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d02604097070cd34d7cce","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392280"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058172578","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"20-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://przeglad-gastronomiczny.pl/przeglad-gastronomiczny-01-02-2022/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392280","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Czarniecka-Skubina","uuid":"D5BB036490313F298C5E6451555C8EDC3D3713055861F93C8013A2B93C9ABC46F2D385D7F5C542E13B384DE9FCCD5A1FEA4CE186A3F80619B41A3399AB548BD4","orcidId":"0000-0001-6557-5436","documentHash":"303e9dd1-7b51-4507-a178-16cec6c13f66"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Field assessment of organic amendments and spring barley to phytomanage a Cu/PAH-contaminated soil","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aff","mniswId":"5815","title":"Environmental Geochemistry and Health","doi":null,"issn":"0269-4042","eissn":"1573-2983","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cf13959f-f099-4c9d-8b54-46cc666a053e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cde954097070cd348b6ab","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709257878c28a047394148","5e709259878c28a0473941d7","629cde954097070cd348b6ae","629cde954097070cd348b6af","629cde954097070cd348b6b0","629cde954097070cd348b6b1","629cde954097070cd348b6b2","629cde954097070cd348b6b3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The  INTENSE  project,  supported  by  the  EU  Era-Net  Facce  Surplus,  aimed  at  increasing  crop  production  on  marginal  land,  including  those  with  contaminated  soils.

Relationships between organisms and physical parameters describing the habitat remain strongly nonlinear and vary depending on several factors. The most common comparisons concern analyses between natural and regulated rivers, where the degree of river channel alterations is undefined and usually refers to all forms of hydromorphological degradation. Additionally, spatial scale and computational range of such a research mostly focus on longer river reaches and statistical analysis of HPC transferability, without detailed estimation of environmental flows values. The main aim of our research was assessment and comparison of environmental flows’ values for macroinvertebrates at two reaches of one river with different degrees of hydromorphological alteration. Two research hypotheses were verified: 1) morphological conditions impact on values of environmental flows and weighted usable area; 2) the mean value of environmental flows at the regulated river reach is higher compared to the natural reach. In order to put the obtained values of environmental flows into a broader context, the analyses of hydrological data and calculation of hydrology-based environmental flows were performed. Additionally, before determination of environmental flows, the transferability of habitat suitability criteria between reaches was verified. The obtained results confirmed research hypotheses, revealing strong dependence of environmental flows values to morphological conditions. Additionally, for both studied sections the lower limits of environmental flows were greater than hydrology-based values.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172585","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.866526/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60405cc69543c711bc6ea4f7","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Szałkiewicz","uuid":"6361CB3E2420122FD755B14D4ACB76B1A31E84A3EA35942326CC215A4A73AAF6009FFDC1A823D31B3FDECBEAEC5D8BE451CB2F0066162C1BB5E6F47C74916ED5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1fb259cf-7398-4f3b-99e1-8029c90e82d0"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa95e","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Grygoruk","uuid":"8751B145C14FECFDEA4E96296CB94068CD8AABC316DB79EF6FBABBE7204F0C116E8F2B45D98761EE85677F007E4B96D21DCBAE9BCA0472A723497DA326F2464D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6465-9697","documentHash":"9a0f61d0-ad4b-4d4d-a451-a14f4e2ecbde"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d2","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kałuża","uuid":"4A0D3A0D39E1E57E48CBD173E26AC208D8CF301661ACD7DD9FFBD837E58C1B3F1FFE792E1C099EF5BB036653F474CA2F29795B385C2FE510F5DAB5762889ED3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5829-502X","documentHash":"57a13477-c7a4-4a9c-9c62-99fd120acf0f"}],"doi":"10.3389/fenvs.2022.866526"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Anaerobic Digestate from Biogas Plants—Nuisance Waste or Valuable Product?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cf8ef4097070cd34d6094","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709259878c28a0473941d4","5e709259878c28a0473941d6","629cf8ef4097070cd34d6099","629cf8ef4097070cd34d609a"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biogas production in waste-to-energy plants will support the decarbonization of the energy sector and enhance the EU’s energy transformation efforts. Digestates (DG) formed during the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes contain large amounts of nutrients. Their use for plant fertilization allows for diversifying and increasing the economic efficiency of farming activities. However, to avoid regional production surpluses, processing technologies allowing the acquisition of products that can be transported over long distances are required. This study therefore aimed at determining the effect of applied methods of DG treatment on the chemical composition of the resulting products and their effect on the yields and chemical composition of plants. The following digestate-based products (DGBPs) were tested: two different digestates (DGs), their liquid (LF) and solid fractions (SF) and pellets from DGs (PDG), and pellets form SFs (PSF). Results from the experiment show that during SF/LF separation of DGs, &gt;80% of nitrogen and 87% of potassium flows to LFs, whereas &gt;60% of phosphorus and 70% of magnesium flows to SFs. The highest yields were obtained using untreated DGs and LFs. The application of DGs and LFs was not associated with a leaching of nutrients to the environment (apparent nutrients recovery from these products exceeded 100%). Pelletized DG and SF forms can be used as slow-release fertilizer, although their production leads to significant nitrogen losses (&gt;95%) by ammonia volatilization."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172588","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cf8ef4097070cd34d609a","name":"Amit Kumar","lastName":"Srivastava","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4094e186-5d6f-4065-97f5-d439b1e7dfbf"},{"objectId":"629cf8ef4097070cd34d6099","name":"Hella Ellen","lastName":"Ahrends","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f285249-b6bd-4530-9aea-74b522e7ce6f"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941d6","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sosulski","uuid":"9465FBFD98BFCB846538FC2620B83DD2303F7F8DEE8E698A153B4FAE6D5298EF9EA32AF91AAF19889234F8AE869CD67B468345B8EC9CEFEEAD8976CEC6C50C24","orcidId":"0000-0001-6364-571X","documentHash":"2285179f-8f70-430e-9303-0203c56ba17b"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941d4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"0092B6F8F5514EE94AA181194C20DB223AA5A47D2678403DDF1E6E4DAC8A8C88B1AA3320AE089395C1E65E1C97C81ECD042E78A4345FDC0990DE817759B79C3A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1302-6950","documentHash":"12492de1-585a-4c2e-852e-8b5504954f8b"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12084052"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938e878c28a0473acba9","5e70935e878c28a0473a8224","5e7092a5878c28a047399ce7","5e7092a5878c28a047399ca2"]},{"id":"5fd92fcf2467f05edd1bd412","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Department of Electrical Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210-1210, USA","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a5878c28a047399ce7"]},{"id":"5fd74bce2467f058ee4f5369","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Vigo System SA, 129/133 Poznańska Str., 05-850 Ożarów Mazowiecki, Poland","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935e878c28a0473a8224"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Study of HgCdTe (100) and HgCdTe (111)B Heterostructures Grown by MOCVD and Their Potential Application to APDs Operating in the IR Range up to 8 µm","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"Sensors","doi":null,"issn":"1424-8220","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"c204b222-3796-4cc1-9a64-7f322cb087e8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fa25cd2467f013ba90b0df","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938e878c28a0473acba9","5e7092a5878c28a047399ce7","5e7092a5878c28a047399ca2","5e70935e878c28a0473a8224"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The trend related to reach the high operating temperature condition (HOT, temperature, T > 190 K) achieved by thermoelectric (TE) coolers has been observed in infrared (IR) technology recently. That is directly related to the attempts to reduce the IR detector size, weight, and power dissipation (SWaP) conditions. The room temperature avalanche photodiodes technology is well developed in short IR range (SWIR) while devices operating in mid-wavelength (MWIR) and long-wavelength (LWIR) require cooling to suppress dark current due to the low energy bandgap. The paper presents research on the potential application of the HgCdTe (100) oriented and HgCdTe (111)B heterostructures grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on GaAs substrates for the design of avalanche photodiodes (APDs) operating in the IR range up to 8 µm and under 2-stage TE cooling (T = 230 K). While HgCdTe band structure with molar composition xCd < 0.5 provides a very favorable hole-to-electron ionization coefficient ratio under avalanche conditions, resulting in increased gain without generating excess noise, the low level of background doping concentration and a low number of defects in the active layer is also required. HgCdTe (100) oriented layers exhibit better crystalline quality than HgCdTe (111)B grown on GaAs substrates, low dislocation density, and reduction of residual defects which contribute to a background doping within the range ~1014 cm–3. The fitting to the experimentally measured dark currents (at T = 230 K) of the N+-ν-p-P+ photodiodes commonly used as an APDs structure allowed to determine the material parameters. Experimentally extracted the mid-bandgap trap concentrations at the level of 2.5 × 1014 cm−3 and 1 × 1015 cm−3 for HgCdTe (100) and HgCdTe (111)B photodiode are reported respectively. HgCdTe (100) is better to provide high resistance, and consequently sufficient strength and uniform electric field distribution, as well as to avoid the tunneling current contribution at higher bias, which is a key issue in the proper operation of avalanche photodiodes. It was presented that HgCdTe (100) based N+-ν-p-P+ gain, M > 100 could be reached for reverse voltage > 5 V and excess noise factor F(M) assumes: 2.25 (active layer, xCd = 0.22, k = 0.04, M = 10) for λcut-off = 8 μm and T = 230 K. In addition the 4-TE cooled, 8 μm APDs performance was compared to the state-of-the-art for SWIR and MWIR APDs based mainly on III-V and HgCdTe materials (T = 77–300 K)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172594","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa25cd2467f013ba90b0e5","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"1933210e-ae4a-4ce9-b33f-0a963fee1409"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"924","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/3/924/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938e878c28a0473acba9","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kopytko","uuid":"6F0097E6CDA564E7213792F9C6801A2047E65B0ECFAE015FF292533C9FBAF53A82D9536E9177CFDAD8E2DA74BE6ACA0CBC7C73FE627E358C4A3CEB1AEFBAD415","orcidId":"0000-0002-5838-3310","documentHash":"6b40cc78-6d91-48be-abae-c3660968d718"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a8224","name":"Jan","lastName":"Sobieski","uuid":"721D4A67FFA351EBCE5182FED61AAB340B161EBF167BD7476C4421D2EC6D23AB067FFA7F0175E80DB602667E444197635D695F60E81E3E27DEFE63A827F91E51","orcidId":"0000-0002-7175-4585","documentHash":"c4630644-e642-4ba8-b973-21d0a4666103"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ce7","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Martyniuk","uuid":"C4C5F958BB315E28EF8EA2CAE2FE6823830ABE7AC66811AAE751CC959D1C7523A8C717046AB6A154F9AA88CA9003D79A07202DE0346040CAD45E3B822C78E4DD","orcidId":"0000-0003-1963-3521","documentHash":"49e742ee-9b1a-48cd-bfdc-857a72447030"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ca2","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Gawron","uuid":"10D2B50B50E717E34C84EF3B48AE91225E434CDA764E001427EBF4FF4054323B76EB9A4EED8AF3F5ABCAF2EA525D97FCAC3AC4BC6EBE5A586E4D579EEE967152","orcidId":"0000-0003-0032-522X","documentHash":"57b7c78b-2a24-4cc8-a9f4-509ae14c5e98"}],"doi":"10.3390/s22030924"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9781032006529","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"Agile

the present paper the effectiveness of biochar-aided phytostabilization of metal/metalloid-contaminated soil under freezing–thawing conditions and using the metal tolerating test plant Lolium perenne L. is comprehensively studied. The vegetative experiment consisted of plants cultivated for over 52 days with no exposure to freezing–thawing in a glass greenhouse, followed by 64 days under freezing-–thawing in a temperature-controlled apparatus and was carried out in initial soil derived from a post-industrial urban area, characterized by the higher total content of Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, As and Hg than the limit values included in the classification provided by the Regulation of the Polish Ministry of Environment. According to the substance priority list published by the Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Agency, As, Pb, and Hg are also indicated as being among the top three most hazardous substances. The initial soil was modified by biochar obtained from willow chips. The freeze–thaw effect on the total content of metals/metalloids (metal(-loid)s) in plant materials (roots and above-ground parts) and in phytostabilized soils (non- and biochar-amended) as well as on metal(-loid) concentration distribution/redistribution between four BCR (community bureau of reference) fractions extracted from phytostabilized soils was determined. Based on metal(-loid)s redistribution in phytostabilized soils, their stability was evaluated using the reduced partition index (Ir). Special attention was paid to investigating soil microbial composition. In both cases, before and after freezing–thawing, biochar increased plant biomass, soil pH value, and metal(-loid)s accumulation in roots, and decreased metal(-loid)s accumulation in stems and total content in the soil, respectively, as compared to the corresponding non-amended series (before and after freezing–thawing, respectively). In particular, in the phytostabilized biochar-amended series after freezing–thawing, the recorded total content of Zn, Cu, Pb, and As in roots substantially increased as well as the Hg, Cu, Cr, and Zn in the soil was significantly reduced as compared to the corresponding non-amended series after freezing–thawing. Moreover, exposure to freezing–thawing itself caused redistribution of examined metal(-loid)s from mobile and/or potentially mobile into the most stable fraction, but this transformation was favored by biochar presence, especially for Cu, Pb, Cr, and Hg. While freezing–thawing greatly affected soil microbiome composition, biochar reduced the freeze–thaw adverse effect on bacterial diversity and helped preserve bacterial groups important for efficient soil nutrient conversion. In biochar-amended soil exposed to freezing–thawing, psychrotolerant and trace element-resistant genera such as Rhodococcus sp. or Williamsia sp. were most abundant.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172609","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6295b3cc4097072fefb74088","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"b066bfae-fcff-47c9-8466-ac1c5e38c744"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/11/3801","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629c8c3c4097070cd347e99f","name":"Martin","lastName":"Brtnicky","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0a22ee3-bd3d-4839-9950-1ca2c9c77030"},{"objectId":"629c8c3c4097070cd347e99e","name":"Antonin","lastName":"Kintl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8945b5ce-0b22-4a37-afbf-10eb78fa7b2d"},{"objectId":"629c8c3c4097070cd347e99d","name":"Vinod","lastName":"Kumar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4caa0124-25d3-42b7-9b4d-b06cd6361682"},{"objectId":"629c8c3c4097070cd347e99c","name":"Aurelia","lastName":"Błażejczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"320c961b-902b-4cd1-b79c-e09a689baf0e"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a53fe","name":"Maja","lastName":"Radziemska","uuid":"F16909B2F0C594C5EA5AB2C145BE90CFEEA14A48CA90D9D4824051912FC2B3FC4FC9E7D2A3266C8A1BD64306A603FDBCAFD3EA7B0AD12A270B5018F1BD77B2DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3526-5944","documentHash":"c1e899af-a37d-4ddc-8151-8234dcce63ce"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900c5","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Gusiatin","uuid":"A5D7983CFFA6442491FFFF014670E5CAB2069BDC7462EEDE714EC420A3433ACB33ACB15EE87AFC04999465920F53035BDD453EFA7DE15A99372C8CC7A29B7087","orcidId":"0000-0002-5402-6893","documentHash":"eca3a444-da53-4a69-af51-c90491e88bd4"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900c3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Cydzik-Kwiatkowska","uuid":"08ED4966C59E8C406CFD45896036933B3489A7FAAF4FB7724EC7D1B9D89604F441B7A194423D10D7654053FB10833CA2C79C1B4A925B18871CD801468480DE16","orcidId":"0000-0002-8710-8297","documentHash":"ee311874-2b54-4e1c-9d81-eb2381b568b2"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15113801"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["natural fertilizers","organic fertilizers","antibacterial substances","environmental pollution","soil","bacterial resistance"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947a878c28a0473be056","61d510b87523401fc110f98b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nawozy naturalne i organiczne jako źródło zanieczyszczenia środowiska substancjami przeciwbakteryjnymi","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2c","mniswId":"14214","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna-Veterinary Medicine-Science and Practice","doi":null,"issn":"0025-8628","eissn":"0025-8628","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5f7ed625-bfbb-4d31-8464-ad34e7a26384"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6299ab304097072c2b79093d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61d510b87523401fc110f98b","5e70947a878c28a0473be056"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Veterinary antibiotics (VAs) are widely used worldwide to treat and prevent infectious diseases, as well as to promote growth and improve the feeding efficiency of food-producing animals in livestock activities.

The activity of probiotic strains is likely reduced by their loss of viability during gastrointestinal transit. To overcome this drawback, researchers have proposed the process of microencapsulation, which increases the resistance of bacterial cells to external conditions. Various types of coatings have been used for microencapsulation, but the most popular ones are carbohydrate and protein microcapsules. Microencapsulating probiotics with vegetable proteins is an innovative approach that can increase the health value of the final product. This review describes the different types of envelope materials that have been used so far for encapsulating bacterial biomass and improving the survival of bacterial cells.

This paper aims to extend the ejuvenation of standard polymer-modified bitumen (PMB) by incorporating nanomaterials into traditional rejuvenators. In particular, the objective of the study is to evaluate the efficiency of nanoSiO2 and nanoTiO2 to improve common rejuvenators - soft bitumen V12000 and aromatic oil - by restoring the chemical and rheological properties of aged PMB. The experimental program was composed of three steps, namely, (1) determination of the optimal dosage of rejuvenator, (2) evaluation of the effects of\nnanomaterials and rejuvenators on the properties of long-term aged PMB and finally (3) investigation of the increase in rejuvenated bitumen resistance to long-term ageing. In addition to standard tests of physical properties (penetration and softening point), the functional composition of bitumen was evaluated by performing the\ntests with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) attenuated total reflection (ATR) spectrometer, and the rheological properties were determined with a dynamic shear rheometer (DSR). The traditional rejuvenators changed asphaltene-matlene ratio of the aged base PMB resulting changes in bitumen rheology but chemical composition\nwas not restored. The most promising results were obtained after rejuvenating aged PMB with an improved soft bitumen with 6% nanoTiO2. This approach allowed us to assess the durability of rheological properties during long-term ageing; however, it abilities to restore or protect styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS) from ageing and\nfurther degradation was not validated."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172626","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629602024097072fefbab92f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"341","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"3261690e-87bf-46bb-afa9-497726302634"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"341","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0950061822011515?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6296019d4097072fefbab61a","name":"Audrius","lastName":"Vaitkus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24a41c18-00f0-49d4-b0b7-c5a590e03df6"},{"objectId":"6296019d4097072fefbab618","name":"Miglė","lastName":"Panasenkienė","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e474f22-54b6-445a-bcf7-8d7f6a79f04f"},{"objectId":"6296019d4097072fefbab617","name":"Rita","lastName":"Kleizienė","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f870138-9f89-46c6-8260-8b637dc05206"},{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b43ac","name":"Adam","lastName":"Zofka","uuid":"6E0DD150A28546299AE0C87EB8CB362494D3142435E5675BA5B0FFCD846DD75422209FB18923795061141EECBC001C309E65874540C0A7B6C4F35D23167BE6E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-6541-5966","documentHash":"685f9755-ddd7-4336-a210-d17bc5a91773"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.127474"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","uid":"bX41kHc85ivocrWE0ISfROw","uuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","parentUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","rootUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","name":"Politechnika Wrocławska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ca878c28a0473b0d3c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Battery powder as a source of novel graphene nanocarbons","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479259","mniswId":"16069","title":"Physica Status Solidi (B): Basic Research","doi":null,"issn":"0370-1972","eissn":"1521-3951","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7dee34af-ae33-419c-9694-cf235858c47e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62988846409707571438bdbb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["653787f740970713964951e8","5e7093ca878c28a0473b0d3c","653787f740970713964951e9","653787f740970713964951ea"]},"issue":"nr 7, art. 2100588","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058172627","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"vol. 259","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"653787f740970713964951ea","name":"Osial","lastName":"Magdalena","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5fc5d252-e9c9-4661-a0a4-0f439655e82f"},{"objectId":"653787f740970713964951e9","name":"Warczak","lastName":"Magdalena","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b2de89f-bb01-4549-84ff-b35e4fec9677"},{"objectId":"653787f740970713964951e8","name":"Dąbrowska","lastName":"Agnieszka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd5f56ec-b2f6-42d2-88f2-8dcbbc8d7201"},{"objectId":"5e7093ca878c28a0473b0d3c","name":"WERONIKA","lastName":"URBAŃSKA","uuid":"7FC94966650520D9A0062657568767559AF7064FBC30326583DC36DD1B2948459CB394B9838B3151FAAC873C3731C2F82B40D23BF68AD607109068D42B298BCB","orcidId":"0000-0002-6523-7629","documentHash":"b74a4252-e807-49ba-8902-4c6039928710"}],"doi":"10.1002/pssb.202100588"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CAE","goat","lentivirus"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

All SRLVs detected from Polish sheep and goats so far have belonged to subtypes B1, B2, A1, A5, A12, A13, A16, A17, A18, A23 and A24. However, all characterized strains originated from asymptomatic animals. This is the first study that characterizes the molecular properties of SRLVs isolated from different organs of six arthritic goats. Segments from three genomic regions (gag, LTR and env) were analyzed. In addition, we quantified the SRLV proviral load in the blood and different organs and examined its association with different degrees of histopathological lesions. All sequences obtained from the goats involved in this study were homogeneous, showing an average degree of variability of 4.8%, 3.7% and 8.8% for gag, LTR and env, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences from the analyzed goats were clustered within SRLVs group A and formed a new subtype within this group, tentatively named A27. The histopathological examination of the lung, mammary gland, synovial membranes of joints and brain of the analyzed goats revealed evidence of inflammatory processes associated with SRLV infection, which was confirmed by positive immunohistochemistry assays. No significant correlation was observed between histological features and alterations in the sequences from different tissues. No tissue-specific signature pattern was identified. It was shown that animals with a higher proviral load showed more lesion severity in various SRLV-affected tissues, indicating a positive association between these two parameters. Our results also revealed differences in the SRLV load between animals even though the sequences derived from all of the goats were closely related, suggesting that host factors may restrict and control viral replication.

Such a large scale excludes field measurements as the primary research method. Instead,\r\nmethods that require less resources and are based on relatively simple process representations are required. The\r\nstream power (SP) concept, combining the effect of channel gradient and discharge, has been widely used for\r\nquantitative measurements in geomorphic works at different spatial scales, but not at the national level so far.\r\nThe primary objective of this study was to estimate total and specific stream power, and detect erosion and\r\ndeposition patterns along the river network in Poland. Given the dominant role of stream slope in SP spatial\r\nvariations, the specific objective was to assess the vertical accuracy of high-resolution DEM representing water\r\nsurface elevations along the river course, and to propose a method for extraction of elevation points along river\r\nreaches that increase the accuracy of DEM-derived stream slopes. We demonstrated that DEM generally overestimates\r\nthe elevation by more than 0.5 m, significantly affecting the DEM-derived stream slope estimation. By\r\nextracting minimum water surface elevation from DEM within a 15 m radius from the target cell (river segment\r\nendpoint), a substantial improvement was achieved. The difference between the actual and DEM-derived water\r\nsurface elevation dropped to 0.16 m. The results indicated that the distribution of dominating processes in Polish\r\nrivers is strongly governed by the character and origin of the terrain relief and lithological diversity. For regions\r\nwith flat relief, most channels are generally in the state of equilibrium, whereas in upland and mountainous\r\nregions, erosion processes are dominant.

In this work, we integrated databases of long-term vegetation records from tree research periods and archival forest inventory datasets to examine the changes in forest herb layer communities over time intervals of up to five decades across the major mountain forest habitat in the Polish Eastern Carpathians (managed semi-natural fertile mountain beech forests). Over the past half – century, these forests have been gradually aging. In this work, based on long-term datasets, we found clear differences in herb layer composition and diversity between beech forest developmental stages. Herb layer characteristics were compared between three forest stages, classified as broadly defined Growing (G), Optimum (O), and Terminal (T) stage. Stands in the Growing stage had the largest stocking, as well as the smallest volume, tree DBH and high, and age. Stands in the Optimum stage had the largest volume and tree height. Stands in the Terminal stage had the smallest stocking and the largest tree DBH and age. Although in the Optimum stage, the lowest beta diversity was recorded, this stage provided the best habitat conditions for species important from a beech forest’s conservation status point of view (e.g. diagnostic for beech forests, ancient forest species). Moreover, in this stage the highest alpha diversity was recorded. We found that in gradually aging Carpathian forests the changes in the structure of stands play a significant role in controlling herb vegetation composition and diversity. The cause was the dominance of single developmental stages during temporally synchronous forest development in the studied region of the Carpathians over the past half – century (i.e. G in the 1970s, O in the 2000s and T in 2010s). Our results have important implications for forest management and biodiversity conservation. In particular, forest managers should ensure the creation and maintenance of forest landscapes with a more even share of development stages (mosaic of different age-classes). Additionally, this age differentiation of stands should be planned not on a local scale but on a regional scale."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172640","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62985fc94097075714372cfc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"518","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"4ed31898-155c-44e5-925f-cc5b10c18d62"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"518","pagesFromTo":"120233","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378112722002274?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62985fc94097075714372cf9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bugno-Pogoda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e91ec596-7ad4-494a-be55-0ab7e5c0fff5"},{"objectId":"5e709216878c28a04738fb46","name":"Roma","lastName":"Durak","uuid":"00C0430DC02D64F906B3671AFBB39D24901A07504492E09921AB668C2551C66574E47F2AB3FC7127ADF22D0F20F23A4290FC6FC8E87B8D5E2952B98670216CDE","orcidId":"0000-0001-9100-766X","documentHash":"3dc3863a-b4ee-44e1-b9d3-5207afb7d881"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fb24","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Durak","uuid":"F7C4CF554DFA9B7FF61A46C3574AAAF62132BF967E11AF147E0C42FB2AD68623F5ACFC622B42A56056EB78C61B9390C7D5DF45ADE2E6112D68E05FE3C07248B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4053-3699","documentHash":"6062a532-402f-4c5b-adf4-d8d677193795"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120233"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["cenzura w PRL","„Nowiny Literackie”","Teodor Parnicki","Jarosław Marek Rymkiewicz","Marek Nowakowski","Tadeusz Różewicz","Czesław Miłosz"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-8220-800-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"Cenzorskie lekcje literatury.

of biochar and composts prepared from organic wastes as soil amendments has been recognized as a beneficial strategy to enhance soil fertility and crop production. However, the modification of manures with applied organic amendments such as biochar has not been well explained. Therefore, the preliminary study was designed to evaluate the impact of two doses of biochar (low 0.4 kg + 10 kg of manure and high 4 kg + 10 kg of manure) on the modification of resulting co-composted manure properties, and subsequently to evaluate the effect of matured manure amendment on the soil chemical and biological properties and plant yield in the pot experiment with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The following variants were tested: control, manure (M), manure + low biochar dose (M + LB), manure + high biochar dose (M + HB). Results revealed that, the M + HB significantly improved the co-composted manure properties as compared to control and M + LB, respectively. The most pronounced effects of M + HB treatment were observed on pH, NH4-N and humic acid to fulvic acid ratio (used as an index for manure maturity) relative to other treatments. Similarly, significant variations were observed between AOB (ammonium oxidizing bacteria) and nirs genes under M + HB which lowered the AOB and increased the nirs abundance as compared to other treatments. Moreover, when applied to soil, M + HB increased the observed soil chemical parameters with the exception of TN contents as compared to M and M + LB treatments. Similarly, plant biomass was significantly enhanced under the applied M + HB treatment. However, statistically insignificant differences were observed regarding soil enzyme activities and soil respiration values under the applied amendments.

An archival digital elevation model (DEM) from 1970 (generated from aerial images by the Norwegian Polar Institute) in combination with recent ArcticDEM were used to compare the surface elevation changes of eleven glaciers. This approach was complemented by a retreat rate estimation based on the analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. In total, four of the 11 tidewater glaciers became land-based due to the retreat of their termini. The remaining tidewater glaciers retreated at an average annual retreat rate of 48 m year<sup>−1</sup>, and with range between 10–150 m year<sup>−1</sup>. All the glaciers studied experienced thinning in their frontal zones with maximum surface elevation loss exceeding 100 m in the ablation areas of three glaciers. In contrast to the massive retreat and thinning of the frontal zones, a minor increase in ice thickness was recorded in some accumulation areas of the glaciers, exceeding 10 m on three glaciers. The change in glacier geometry suggests an important shift in glacier dynamics over the last 50 years, which very likely reflects the overall trend of increasing air temperatures. Such changes in glacier geometry are common at surging glaciers in their quiescent phase. Surging was detected on two glaciers studied, and was documented by the glacier front readvance and massive surface thinning in high elevated areas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172658","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs14020354","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63c546524097076d26f8ebdc","name":"Mihail","lastName":"Demidionov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1781336a-5731-49cc-9090-279bd4e4d8dd"},{"objectId":"63c546524097076d26f8ebdb","name":"Guy D.","lastName":"Tallentire","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70f87e4e-7281-4d8e-8b12-fc3d7ed4b0f4"},{"objectId":"616a392975234017e0545a7d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kavan","uuid":"F0B8DAEFCB2D4BD2111013103702F1F463352364B8562036D1FBE6A69AC63CBB7AF52A40EB582B2D5D38FCA3EBF488ECBC54B58720EC7F6E592D19D8BE370FDB","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34e2d7aa-a179-4a3e-b265-a96f6a54c0c5"},{"objectId":"5e70946f878c28a0473bceed","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":"FBE80A58247716718E9DC422645D8C7F1B8C5BA26D8AE03F80164E009163690EFBD67AB6549B451281F3B312709687B59E5EDB45AD69DD5D8F9DFD6595B62763","orcidId":"0000-0001-6233-5381","documentHash":"7750d60d-8983-4e25-88af-7d2cd8440182"},{"objectId":"5e709414878c28a0473b5e59","name":"MATEUSZ","lastName":"STRZELECKI","uuid":"CF83BF1265514AD3F0DCABE5074A2456E686DAEA028DAF55B91F4AF9B337A688FB57BE20B28116D5EB8265DCDD62CD76DA02083E0B3A5A752976937B995C1F64","orcidId":"0000-0003-0479-3565","documentHash":"1feee111-5b2a-48c4-b278-c76b7ef56669"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs14020354"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9780367862251","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"The Routledge International Handbook of the Place of Religion in Early Childhood Education and Care","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":564,"publicationPlace":"London","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629ded214097073d586bb8a9","editors":[{"objectId":"65c74d8e40970762632b5abf","name":"Arniika","lastName":"Kuusisto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f6c9ce7-ff9b-4d8b-b66f-abd4b3032361"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["65c74d8e40970762632b5abf"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Understanding the place of religion in Early Childhood Education and Care is of critical importance for the development of cultural literacy and plays a key role in societal coherence and inclusion.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2018 amongst 638 students of food and nutrition-related majors. Based on the frequency of consumption of 24 food groups, the &amp;ldquo;Pro-Healthy Diet Index&amp;rdquo; (pHDI) and &amp;ldquo;Non-Healthy Diet Index&amp;rdquo; (nHDI) were calculated. To assess the nutrition knowledge, the &amp;ldquo;GAROTA&amp;rdquo; test was used. The k-means clustering method was used to identify clusters-attitudes towards food and nutrition. The relationships between pHDI and nHDI indices, dieting, nutrition knowledge (NK), and attitudes towards food and nutrition were verified, using multiple linear regression analysis. The results confirmed some relationships between the variables. Higher nHDI characterized males (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and people with more unfavorable attitudes towards food and nutrition (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), and those not using a diet (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Higher nutrition knowledge (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and higher BMI (p = 0.0370) were correlated with lower nHDI. Higher pHDI characterized people with more favorable attitudes (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) and those using a diet (p = 0.0002). Nutrition knowledge showed an adverse association with nHDI (r = &amp;minus;0.172, p &amp;lt; 0.05) and no association with pHDI. Thus, declarative nutrition knowledge does not seem to be a good indicator of healthy dietary behavior. Nutrition education programs that concentrate only on knowledge of facts, and neglect the development of favorable attitudes towards food and nutrition, may not be efficient enough to develop adequate dietary behavior of students."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172667","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/11/6533","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629e37034097070cd3575f06","name":"Marta","lastName":"Plichta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5b61e57-76af-44ae-9d25-9a1d49de21d6"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739228d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Jeżewska-Zychowicz","uuid":"26CFD30BCAA87FD175BF5D5538AB98922F4985BE270917BBC36F6C7128017416FB60A2DE55CB2CF6CF115929AE1121364CCFEFEA59911ACF4EB5B15913ECB28F","orcidId":"0000-0002-4140-4824","documentHash":"7429f313-72d6-4e8e-a051-b564a30bfe35"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19116533"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec8","uid":"bFhJlSgNLVQOBOA0xxvzVfg","uuid":"e37107d0-a2ea-47b0-abe0-847a23a43089","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec8","parentUuid":"e37107d0-a2ea-47b0-abe0-847a23a43089","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec8","rootUuid":"e37107d0-a2ea-47b0-abe0-847a23a43089","name":"Instytut Genetyki Człowieka Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473aca88","5e7092d3878c28a04739d749"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Loss of function mutations of BCOR in classical Hodgkin lymphoma","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cdb","mniswId":"13605","title":"Leukemia and Lymphoma","doi":null,"issn":"1042-8194","eissn":"1029-2403","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"94caf5cd-ce98-4ca5-b7b0-b9f1ae234259"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62987217409707571437e0ad","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d749","5e70938d878c28a0473aca88"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BCOR is a component of a variant Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1.1). PRC1 and PRC2 complexes together constitute a major gene regulatory system critical for appropriate cellular differentiation.

We report BCOR inactivating alterations in 4/7 classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) cell lines, subclonal somatic mutations in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of 4/10 cHL cases, and deletions in HRS cells of 7/17 primary cHL cases. In mice, conditional loss of Bcor driven by AID-Cre in GC B cells resulted in gene expression changes of 46 genes (>2-fold) including upregulated Lef1 that encodes a transcription factor responsible for establishing T-cell identity and Il9r (interleukin-9 receptor), an important member of the cytokine network in cHL. Our findings suggest a role for BCOR loss in cHL pathogenesis and GC-B cell homeostasis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172671","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"63","pagesFromTo":"1080-1090","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957890/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473aca88","name":"Adam","lastName":"Ustaszewski","uuid":"9B45E7CC1243984DDD40D337305B54C535E71DECEE11F0B37C7558625E5B747075E0BC1CFB86C56D33C312A8AF20B4E1641F70BF99274A7D4C155C97D3ADF405","orcidId":"0000-0002-9542-0029","documentHash":"ad5916c8-2672-4512-af46-bdfd7b8305a5"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d749","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Giefing","uuid":"FA9349EC26FDAE8B171C9E0A1B1B4C2B25E0F821BD7F139A60BCB57CC230BFBAE21E459C10873CF565C0E40129FE07B62C890A7B6D947753BDFFF9A36DDBA81C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4760-8246","documentHash":"485d14ae-4325-4285-bfd1-79aff72f6ed7"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rehabilitation","reclamation & renovation","renewable energy","waste management & disposal"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sustainable environmental geotechnics practices for a green economy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c04a","mniswId":"5816","title":"Environmental Geotechnics","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2051-803X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d8db9973-01d5-4752-b3cf-71fe80cf0a34"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629c92c24097070cd347ee88","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709463878c28a0473bc019","5e709307878c28a0473a1779","629c92c24097070cd347ee8b","629c92c24097070cd347ee8c","629c92c24097070cd347ee8d","629c92c24097070cd347ee8e","629c92c24097070cd347ee8f","629c92c24097070cd347ee90","629c92c24097070cd347ee91","629c92c24097070cd347ee92","629c92c24097070cd347ee93","629c92c24097070cd347ee94","629c92c24097070cd347ee95","629c92c24097070cd347ee96","629c92c24097070cd347ee97","629c92c24097070cd347ee98","629c92c24097070cd347ee99","629c92c24097070cd347ee9a","629c92c24097070cd347ee9b","629c92c24097070cd347ee9c","629c92c24097070cd347ee9d","629c92c24097070cd347ee9e","629c92c24097070cd347ee9f","629c92c24097070cd347eea0","629c92c24097070cd347eea1","629c92c24097070cd347eea2"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p> The revitalisation of the global economy after the Covid-19 era presents environmental geotechnics with the opportunity to reinforce the need for a change in paradigm towards a green, circular economy and to promote aggressively the use and development of sustainable technologies and management practices. This paper aims to assist in this effort by concentrating on several thematic areas where sustainability solutions and future improvements are sought. These include the re-entry of construction and demolition of wastes, excavated materials, industrial wastes and marine sediments into the production cycle and the reuse of existing foundations. Despite the recent trend in advanced countries towards recycling and waste-to-energy thermal treatment, landfills still constitute the most common municipal solid waste management practice, especially in low-and-middle-income countries, and technological solutions to improve their environmental footprint are hereby presented. At the same time, remediation solutions are required to address the multitude of contaminated sites worldwide. Advanced developments that incorporate environmental, economic and social dimensions are expounded by the authors, together with sustainable ground improvement solutions for infrastructure projects conducted in soft and weak soils. The topic of thermo-active geostructures concludes this paper, where, apart from their infrastructure utility, these structures have the potential to contribute to the renewable energy source.

is the only European country where the Osprey population is declining due to the mortality of adult birds from poaching, which impacts not only single breeding attempts but also the Lifetime Reproductive Success (LRS) of specimens. However, what if there came an extra mortality factor in the moment of the lowest numbers of Osprey, already vulnerable in the country? In the years 2018–2020, we installed 22 trail cameras and five digital cameras (live online video feeds) on the nests. The total failure level observed in cameras (18.5%) was high. We observed, using these cameras, the extra mortality of chicks (10.7% of potentially fledged chicks) and even adult birds by unexpected predation by Northern Goshawk and White-tailed Eagle. This phenomenon is also common in the national population, as we found a total of ten cases of total losses by predators (eight or nine of them were birds of prey), including nests not covered by camera monitoring. The extra adult-predation by Goshawks means an extra drop in LRS. Those adult and chick predations are an example of exceptional catastrophic phenomena, which have been described as the direct cause of the extinction of animal populations throughout history. Only active conservation and stop poaching of the Polish population could stop the decline and save the Polish Ospreys."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172675","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-6","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/1/69","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cd5c94097070cd3483419","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Anderwald","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"72d3cd8c-dcec-4302-a2fe-96bf96598a6c"},{"objectId":"629cd5c94097070cd3483418","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"716d2527-b7b2-4573-bfa2-6a9c2ab98b76"},{"objectId":"629cd5c94097070cd3483417","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Porębski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df4f69fe-e499-4649-901b-d4a66d49de08"},{"objectId":"629cd5c94097070cd3483416","name":"Michał","lastName":"Zygmunt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b5802ab-6282-45b9-aa23-91d835f3479a"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86ad","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"EA78C4EDF6518780C9EC1A8C81C7848B5D12F8986933B9AEBBE65C809FCD06415C115F50AA37F78B8579D1535AD07E29B6F74DD917C8BC41C13BEDF778D18E2E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6308-1296","documentHash":"b4e285b0-b186-40f5-bffd-171a2d93b5d3"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani12010069"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Detection of old house borer larvae in wooden structures by acoustic emission method – Influence of larval size and sensor location","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477389","mniswId":"2528","title":"BioResources","doi":null,"issn":"1930-2126","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"54919a2a-ec55-4bfd-9440-2e5e3fd6819b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cccb24097070cd3481bbf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392400","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1f","5e70923d878c28a0473923ee"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>The detection of old house borer larvae (Hylotrupes bajulus L.) in Scots pine wood (Pinus sylvestris L.) was performed using the acoustic emission (AE) method.

Production of boarsmay impair meat quality due to boar taint and reduced tenderness compared to meat from surgically cas-trated male pigs, while immunocastration reduces boar taint and may improve meat quality but seems tobe less accepted by the pig chain. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the consumer’s sensory appreciationof meat from barrows (BAs), immunocastrates (ICs) and boars (BOs) in six European countries, taking intoaccount the selection of tainted carcass and consumers’ appreciation of boar taint. Loin chops of 30 BAs,30 ICs and 30 BOs were evaluated by 752 consumers in six countries: Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland,Portugal, Romania and Spain. Consumers rated odour, flavour, tenderness, juiciness, overall liking andwillingness to buy and sensitivity to and liking of androstenone (AND) and liking of skatole (SKA) wasalso tested. In each of the six countries, consumers liked the odour of the BO samples less than that ofBA, and IC intermediate. For flavour, tenderness, juiciness, overall liking and willingness to buy, likingscores given by the Czech, Polish and Portuguese consumers significantly differed between the BA, BOand IC. Willingness to buy was highest for BA by Czech and Polish consumers and for BA and IC byPortuguese consumers. The frequency of the negative check all terms that apply terms also differed, witha higher frequency of disgusting for BO compared to BA and IC and of off-flavour, irritating, manure,sweat, disappointing compared to BA, and intermediate for IC. 31% of the consumers disliked the odourof AND (NEGAND), and 36% of them were not sensitive; in contrast, 77% of the consumers disliked SKA(NEGSKA). The decrease in flavour liking score for BO compared to BA and IC was more outspoken bythe NEGANDconsumer, while NEGSKAconsumers gave an overall lower liking score independent of thetype of male pig. The results of this study indicate that IC can be a valid alternative for surgical castration.Ó2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of The Animal Consortium.

variations in vegetation coverage (defined as the area with Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) > 0.2) and atmospheric patterns occurring during various vegetation seasons in the Kabul River Basin (KRB) in Afghanistan during 2001–2019 were analyzed. The analysis was done based on the NDVI, land surface temperature (LST), precipitation images from the remote sensing data, and geopotential height and temperature at 500 hPa from the retrospective datasets. The results revealed that the vegetation dynamics in KRB are impacted by both precipitation and LST. In the winter season, the LST has a more substantial role in shaping the vegetation dynamics than precipitation, while it is on contrary during the summer season. Cluster analysis showed that the four atmospheric patterns (e.g., Sub-Tropical High Pressure (STHP), Western European ridge-the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea trough, Caspian Sea ridge (CSR), and the Mediterranean Sea trough-Central to Eastern Iran trough) can be identified and connected with the periods with the highest and the lowest vegetation coverage (VC) anomalies in the study area. The CSR and the Mediterranean Sea trough-the Central to Eastern Iran trough are the patterns responsible for the most positive VC anomalies. At the same time, the STHP and Western Europe ridge-the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea trough are responsible for the most negative VC anomalies. As the atmospheric patterns have a significant role in shaping the vegetation status, a quick alert system to prevent agricultural areas from water or temperature stresses can be developed based on observations of them."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172689","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"179","pagesFromTo":"3075","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00024-022-03044-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"636a35e6409707785234105a","name":"Jaromir","lastName":"Krzyszczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d985e0f5-62a6-4016-bbb8-197388faea51"},{"objectId":"636a35e64097077852341059","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Baranowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a329bcb-9713-4d79-9389-badbf539599c"},{"objectId":"636a35e64097077852341058","name":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52889a2e-4da5-47f5-9a1a-045b830b96a3"},{"objectId":"636a35e64097077852341057","name":"Haraldur","lastName":"Olafsson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e15fa068-4e38-4ae1-88c5-6ccfcad59a92"},{"objectId":"636a35e64097077852341056","name":"Md","lastName":"Moniruzzaman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e480f524-4909-49c3-847f-543434233a0d"},{"objectId":"636a35e64097077852341055","name":"Iman","lastName":"Rousta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59454540-3afc-4e1a-8d4c-5016653b3d2a"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390ab0","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kępkowicz","uuid":"5FD7030F8C039A3FF963085654E9B3B384CBC99359985A7C3E69789DFEF1FEA0BCCA9C766AF1DDBD42E0DB54765502F0EF7B3E9D3C7DD7AB42844E0770C8C8E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2972-2309","documentHash":"dadab61c-96a6-4f62-8f24-e8550b4c6ef2"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a24","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Tkaczyk","uuid":"82D7000CDF60D5461050258754AF40D05AF80C88D91F22F6565C451A74DC2C6EC589379456F113FDC5832231EFBD28AA2A86C0A1FFF04CC5AB813F9EB698D6B2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7734-1872","documentHash":"ef124472-7b43-4623-902a-e2768b682b32"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a04739097b","name":"Halina","lastName":"Lipińska","uuid":"45B49422804B3FBB5441F27C644BF92DA4BE7DF4C6718514A423C1D6D5C0A254ED52B59BD634669E3BA1F58C074E34D2B8B88BDD5424DBAD9A3AF412AFB5451E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0135-5121","documentHash":"895c4953-4db2-407e-a98a-b3eca7421a05"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00024-022-03044-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["napoje roślinne","napój fasolowy","substytuty mleka","homogenizacja wysokociśnieniowa","właściwości fizyczne żywności","tekstura"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["plant-based beverages","bean-based beverages","milk substitutes","high-pressure homogenization","physical properties of food","texture"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The effect of high-pressure homogenization on the texture of fermented bean -based beverages ®","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac03ad204581b62ebb26","mniswId":"201201","title":"Postępy Techniki Przetwórstwa Spożywczego","doi":null,"issn":"0867-793X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"5716a3f9-ec67-4b3e-9c97-85452fd31d51"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d00bc4097070cd34d6bcf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a0473921f5","629d00bc4097070cd34d6bd2","629d00bc4097070cd34d6bd3"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Różnego rodzaju zabiegi technologiczne, w tym homogenizacja\r\nwysokociśnieniowa (HPH), mogą być wykorzystane do\r\nprodukcji jogurtów roślinnych.

The experiments were performed in a stationary fi  eld trial by the Institute of Agriculture of Western Polissya of the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences of Ukraine on crop rotation of winter wheat, corn, barley and winter rape. The object of the research was Albic Retisol (Arenic, Aric) (WRB, 2014) in a stationary trial. Before starting the research, soil pHKCl was 4.3 and hydrolytic acidity (Hh) 2.80–2.97 cmol(+)·kg–1. Liming fertilizer doses were determined on the basis of soil hydrolitic acidity (Hh) for dolomite fl our: 0.5 Hh – Dd0.5 2.230 t∙ha–1; 1 Hh – Dd1.0 4,740 t∙ha–1; 1.5  Hh  –  Dd1,5 6,700  t∙ha–1  and  lime  fl  our:  1  Hh  –  Dl1.0 4,940  t∙ha–1.  Application  of  dolomite  fl our at a dose of Dd1.5 6,700 t∙ha–1 proved to be the most effective. It neutralised the acidity of the soil to the highest level pHKCl (6.64) and maintained in this case pHKCl 6.04 until the end of the 8-year of crop ro-tation. 3D modeling showed that the effectiveness of soil deacidifi  cation by dolomite fl our increases with  moderate  simultaneous  climate  warming  and  humidifi  cation.  Meanwhile,  the  simultaneous  stronger increase of temperature and humidity weaken the neutralising effect of this liming ferti-lizer. The usage of dolomite and lime causes a gradual increase in Ca2+ soil content from 1.68 to 2.57 cmol(+)·kg–1 of soil similar to the dynamics of Mg2+ concentration (from 0.28 to 0.84 cmol(+)·kg–1 of soil). The usage of lime causes a maximum reduction content of soil Mg2+ (0.23 cmol(+)·kg–1 of soil) against the highest Ca2+ content. Doses of dolomite and lime had a signifi cant effect on the Al3+ soil content. The concentration of Al3+ was highest in non-limed and fertilized areas in the fi nal year of the crop rotation. The usage of dolomite rapidly reduced the content of exchangeable Al3+ from 2.48 and 2.67 cmol(+)·kg–1 of soil to 1.31 cmol(+)·kg–1 a 1.5 Hh dose. The average long-term crop-rotation productivity  (in  grain  units)  depended  on  the  mineral  fertilization  and  the  type  and  doses  of  the  liming  fertilizers  applied.  Mineral  fertilizers  within  the  normal  range  N112Р82К105  without  liming  have contributed to the collection of 3.06 t∙ha–1 grain units. The maximum crop yield was set on the option of applying 1.5 Hh dose of dolomite fl our on the background of the average annual mineral fertilizer  norms  of  N112P82K105  –  5.33  t∙ha–1  grain  units.  Lime  fl  our  proved  to  be  less  effective  as  it  reduced the Mg2+ soil content, which is an important element for plants, and with a smaller impact on crop yield."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172697","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"73","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0fd","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Korinec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a31bd86f-ad7a-41a1-b3a5-ddb25c806065"},{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0fc","name":"Halyna","lastName":"Kosylovych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd654033-7b56-42c8-af24-4591f2111ca1"},{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0fb","name":"Mariya","lastName":"Avhustynovych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad830151-d001-43be-b1c8-3c62667ead56"},{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0fa","name":"Liudmyla","lastName":"Lukashchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"80bf13eb-75a7-4526-8395-25adac86289d"},{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0f9","name":"Halyna","lastName":"Ivanyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8be33d49-290d-4df3-8f1b-f18f4878d7ca"},{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0f8","name":"Nadya","lastName":"Yuvchik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"219c5a61-affa-4fce-9af8-32c7414b0404"},{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0f7","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Lahush","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6daa30f1-8e86-40f9-80b5-b9d5bd0f6140"},{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0f6","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Lykhochvor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55352a4f-02e1-480b-add8-06b0742abfb6"},{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0f5","name":"Petro","lastName":"Hnativ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc1124bd-50ad-40a0-95e5-69d014a83934"},{"objectId":"629ce8934097070cd34be0f4","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Polovyy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbb7ffbb-9d1d-4480-a3fa-d48928874b16"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941af","name":"Józef","lastName":"Chojnicki","uuid":"368C7260FDA3CCE2FA25AAD8C15147A15E7D5FB732A1D708AB21DD9872422B80CEFC3EA5617BF704DB4D13A7BBD7B12CBC5699C4BF633E974316AEC6C0851A0E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7719-4331","documentHash":"cd0af76e-89fd-425f-a8eb-9bb83d687207"}],"doi":"10.37501/soilsa/146856"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9783030856250","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6581424c4097076c14b57693","6581424c4097076c14b57694","6581424c4097076c14b57697","6581424c4097076c14b57698","6581424c4097076c14b57695","6581424c4097076c14b57696"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Intelligent and Fuzzy Techniques for Emerging Conditions and Digital Transformation : Proceedings of the INFUS 2021 Conference, held August 24-26, 2021.

The dependence of the harmonic composition of the output voltage of the inverter on the number of levels and the switching frequency of the keys of each level is analyzed. By modeling, the dependences of the transistor junction temperature on the number of voltage levels, switching frequency and load power are determined. The power switching system of an inverter with phase-shifted pulse-width modulation in high-frequency mode is analyzed, the dependence of switching losses on inductance is investigated. The ways of solving or improving the control systems of the conductivity losses of the converter flowing through the primary winding of a high-frequency transformer during the free-running period are formulated. The importance of this direction for the technological development of the economy, where efficiency improvements can lower individual utility bills, create jobs, and help stabilize electricity prices and volatility is shown. The most important stage of inverter design is called structural synthesis stage – the choice of topology and modulation algorithm that will ensure the greatest efficiency of the device. In addition, since the efficiency and reliability of inverters depend on the efficiency and reliability of secondary electricity consumers, the task of optimizing inverter circuits is a cornerstone for the effective development of technology and economy.

Although beverage containers, such as bottles and cans, belong to the most common threats in this context, their effect on animals has been poorly studied. The aim of this study was to assess the diversity and mortality level of the animal taxa entering discarded containers and to investigate which container features influence the number and functional composition of the trapped animals. The study was conducted in 10 urban woodlands in the city of Wrocław, Poland. In total, 939 open containers were collected. In 56% of them, a total number of 10,162 dead individuals (10,139 invertebrates and 23 vertebrates) was found. The most common amongst them were insects (orders: Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera), malacostracans (Isopoda), arachnids (Opiliones, Sarcoptiformes) and gastropods (Stylommatophora). The number of dead animals was affected positively by the container capacity and was significantly higher in glass and plastic bottles when compared to aluminium cans. At the same time, the presence of a neck negatively affected the number of dead animals. Container capacity was also positively correlated with the abundance of the most common functional groups: predators, phytophages and saprophages. Moreover, colourless and green, but not brown, containers were a significant predictor for the abundance of the latter two groups. Our study revealed that discarded containers constitute an ecological trap for many groups of animals. There is an urgent need to reduce the amount of rubbish in the environment by, for example, the implementation of regional and international regulations addressing the problem of littering, or

of the state of knowledge showed a gap in the description of tool–stone feedback. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate tool–stone interactions. Spherical-like silicate stones were hit by stiff and flexible tines with a duckfoot or a coulter. The tools worked with various parameters in the depth range of 0.05–0.10 m and a speed of 0.83–2.22 m·s–1. The characteristics of stone movement were specific to the type of tool and were described by the Numerical Stone Movement Scale developed for the purpose of the research. After the impact with the stiff tine, the stones were thrown the greatest distance of 0.26–1.08 m, and these distances were strongly dependent on the working speed and slightly dependent on the working depth. Large vibrations of the flexible tine and the location of the contact point of the tine in relation to the centre of the stone thickness contributed to the random behaviour of stones that were slightly moved, rotated or displaced. The specific work required to remove the stone reflected the distance travelled by the stone as well as the specific force which largely contributed to increasing the differences in this work between both tines."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172717","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/4/1568","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629c98724097070cd3480127","name":"Martin","lastName":"Roberge","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9598b0eb-564a-4fd6-bb33-97b9d244f0e0"},{"objectId":"629c98724097070cd3480126","name":"Samuel","lastName":"Ferre","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2101f42d-3d1f-4909-b5c4-0d37f2af6cab"},{"objectId":"629c98724097070cd3480125","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Parys","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8def134f-f4c2-4c59-9de6-43ebbf0b2874"},{"objectId":"629c98724097070cd3480124","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Tryskuć","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46a610ce-3af9-4705-9f6c-418ea99b2227"},{"objectId":"629c98724097070cd3480123","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Chlebowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32d0b58b-db4e-4990-b9e8-43e5519c1e5f"},{"objectId":"629c98724097070cd3480122","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Nowakowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bef6ccec-f289-4cb6-adea-1c8bac881979"},{"objectId":"629c98724097070cd3480121","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Klonowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af34de93-3b8f-486b-927b-a52c2116fabf"},{"objectId":"629c98724097070cd3480120","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a68788ab-2ff9-43c6-87b4-523e816f15b9"},{"objectId":"629c98724097070cd348011f","name":"Adam","lastName":"Świętochowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a26795d5-402f-4171-993d-12595a2f9446"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392468","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Lisowski","uuid":"E349AEC59F57FAD14473BB6C717C7DFAC5671A64965E74F27ADDA15D870D5536B66AA35F6A15B95825DCC8381E44CFD9C689477BB1860C7C304CA9A62CCF7F14","orcidId":"0000-0001-8394-0396","documentHash":"155d1384-b5b3-418d-b7be-75a12c383d2e"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15041568"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["raj","zmartwychwstanie","interpretacja","hermeneutyka","kontekst"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Paradoks obietnicy raju.

Cows suffering from ketosis experience elevated ketone body levels in blood and milk, including β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB), acetone (ACE) and acetoacetic acid. Ketosis causes serious financial losses to dairy cattle breeders and milk producers due to the costs of diagnosis and management as well as animal welfare reasons. Recent years have seen a growing interest in the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in various fields of science. ANNs offer a modeling method that enables the mapping of highly complex functional relationships. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between milk composition and blood BHB levels associated with subclinical ketosis in dairy cows, using feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks. The results were verified based on the estimated sensitivity and specificity of selected network models, an optimum cut-off point was identified for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The study demonstrated that BHB, ACE and lactose (LAC) levels, as well as the fat-to-protein ratio in milk, were important input variables in the network training process.

paper presents a new method for determining the change in the brightness of a comet during an outburst in which particles are ejected into the coma at a uniform rate, i.e. via a long-lived jet. In the proposed approach, the mass flow rate by a jet and the time it takes to increase the brightness of the comet play key roles. Absolute values adopted for H2O ice and CO2 ice were taken from measurements by Rosetta of the jets observed on 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. These two parameters significantly affect the amplitude of the change in the brightness of a comet during its outburst. The performed numerical calculations concern a hypothetical comet from the Jupiter family for which it was assumed that its sublimation activity was controlled by the sublimation of water ice and carbon dioxide. Based on numerical simulations, it was shown that the difference between the change in brightness for H2O ice and CO2 ice is about −3.4 magnitude for the same fraction of the area that is active and the same mass flow rate. This value corresponds to the rise time of the amplitude of the brightness change t = 3 h. In addition, it should be emphasized that this difference is a consequence of thermodynamic parameters, such as the speed of sublimating gas molecules, the sublimation rate of given ice, which determine the numerical values of the individual scattering cross-sections C(t1) and C(t2)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172730","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fab5e72467f013ba968ca3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"375","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e70430ac-14ef-45e6-a745-be17614eafb0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"375","pagesFromTo":"ID number 114847","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0019103521004887?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709435878c28a0473b82b4","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Wesołowski","uuid":"19619E78B9619897229189A43ACE3DDCC40323748C4A763351D5BD85649318F6F075721C1FA996D727DAACDE2A97DF243F1228F67F7C59185D58B4B6EFD41B15","orcidId":"0000-0002-5049-4323","documentHash":"ec6530e4-c9d9-4999-93e4-ac007e6bf4c9"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.icarus.2021.114847"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["graphic composition","educational board","educational trails","educational infrastructure","graphics","text"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Graphic design of educational boards in forest – key to effective informal forest education","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798ad","mniswId":"19199","title":"Sylwan","doi":null,"issn":"0039-7660","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"d9fa1a04-145f-47de-af55-07be89bdd96c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629ccace4097070cd34818cc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f3878c28a04738d9ea","629ccace4097070cd34818ce"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The development of tourism, recreation and forest education is inextricably linked to the creation\r\nof specific infrastructure on forest lands. However, this infrastructure, especially concerning\r\neducation, is not always fully functional. Growing expectations of the public in relation to the\r\nsocial functions of forests, make it necessary to monitor and also verify the content presented\r\non educational boards, which are the basic equipment of educational trails. There is little literature\r\non what criteria a model educational board should meet. Also, few works refer to the evaluation\r\nof ergonomics and usability of educational trails and elements of their equipment. The aim of\r\nthis study is to evaluate the educational boards, taking into account recommendations concerning\r\nthe functionality of the boards, referring mainly to the graphic design. A total of 89 educational\r\nboards were analyzed in the Regional Directorate of State Forests in Lublin in six forest districts.\r\nThe first stage of the study was a field inspection of the current technical condition of educational\r\nboards on selected trails, together with photographic documentation of each piece of trail’s\r\nequipment. Then, in an indoor setting, a grid was applied to each photo of the educational board\r\nusing the Canva graphics program, so that the image was divided into 9 rectangles of equal size.\r\nEach rectangle was assigned number from 1 to 9 in order to analyze in which part of the board\r\ntextual and graphic content is most often placed, and in which textual and graphic information\r\nis mixed. The results obtained were summarized in criterion tables, taking into account the per−\r\ncentage of each analyzed criterion on educational boards. Most of the boards were dominated\r\nby content in graphic form (48.32%), varied in size (58.43%) and presented with appropriate\r\ngaps (called light) (82.02%). Most educational boards also had a white background (52.81%). \r\nIn the case of the application of the principle of tripartition, less than 39.33% of the educational\r\nboards complied with the requirement to present information in the central part of the board in\r\ngraphic form. All analyzed boards respected the requirements of the so−called law of proximity.\r\nThe principle of tri−division is one of the key elements allowing to maintain and keep the attention\r\nof people visiting forest trails. The consequence of not applying this rule may be a lower interest\r\nof forest users in the content presented on boards, which nullifies the effort put in spreading\r\nforest education."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172731","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"166","pagesFromTo":"141-151","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.26202/sylwan.2022013","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629ccace4097070cd34818ce","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Korcz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b704505b-2e28-4b18-9616-003c65261c8d"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d9ea","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Janeczko","uuid":"8995D16680321C24E0DB187145847260D9E7C4735E36480500090C5E3FF28460595272326874C55942A8E0D8D2AB09B4CCFFAA49F6F6277BA9841F685852FEE7","orcidId":"0000-0002-8493-2475","documentHash":"10e7de72-2e07-4044-96ca-e9f53b63e33b"}],"doi":"10.26202/sylwan.2022013"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["visual inspection","object detector","optical recognition","camera systems","deep learning","machine vision","defect detection"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Approach to Automated Visual Inspection of Objects Based on Artificial Intelligence","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629c986d4097070cd34800f3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b7878c28a0473afad4","629c986d4097070cd34800f5","629c986d4097070cd34800f6","629c986d4097070cd34800f7","629c986d4097070cd34800f8","629c986d4097070cd34800f9","629c986d4097070cd34800fa"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article discusses the possibility of object detector usage in field of automated visual inspection for objects with specific parameters, specifically various types of defects occurring on the surface of a car tire. Due to the insufficient amount of input data, as well as the need to speed up the development process, the Transfer Learning principle was applied in a designed system. In this approach, the already pre-trained convolutional neural network AlexNet was used, subsequently modified in its last three layers, and again trained on a smaller sample of our own data. The detector used in the designed camera inspection system with the above architecture allowed us to achieve the accuracy and versatility needed to detect elements (defects) whose shape, dimensions and location change with each occurrence. The design of a test facility with the application of a 12-megapixel monochrome camera over the rotational table is briefly described, whose task is to ensure optimal conditions during the scanning process. The evaluation of the proposed control system with the quantification of the recognition capabilities in the individual defects is described at the end of the study. The implementation and verification of such an approach together with the proposed methodology of the visual inspection process of car tires to obtain better classification results for six different defect classes can be considered as the main novel feature of the presented research. Subsequent testing of the designed system on a selected batch of sample images (containing all six types of possible defect) proved the functionality of the entire system while the highest values of successful defect detection certainty were achieved from 85.15% to

The aim of this study was to assess the impacts of a dietary intervention on the nutritional status, clinical outcomes and selected nutrient and salicylate intakes among older adults living in a long-term care nursing home. To achieve the research goal, a prospective, non-randomized, baseline-controlled intervention study was conducted. The study was conducted within the framework of the “Senior’s Plate Project”, a project established in 2018 by the Polish Society of Dietetics. Methods: A 3 month dietary intervention, which included one serving of supplementary food, served as a second breakfast (Nestle Sinlac). Energy, nutrients and salicylates intakes were estimated on the basis of the menus. Food and beverage intakes among residents were verified by health care personnel. Anthropometric measurements and clinical examinations were conducted according to standard procedures at baseline and after intervention. Results: Of the 38 residents qualified for the study, 29 completed the program. Residents’ body mass index (BMI) values ranged from 13.3 kg/m2 to 34 kg/m2. A BMI &lt;22 kg/m2, indicating underweight, was found in 19 subjects. The dietary intervention resulted in increased body weight (57.8 ± 12.3 vs. 59.4 ± 12.6 kg), BMI (22.4 ± 4.0 vs. 23.0 ± 4.1 kg/m2) and body fat (19.2 ± 8.7 vs. 20.6 ± 8.9 kg). Significant changes in the levels of biochemical parameters, including serum calcium (8.7 vs. 9.5 mg/dL), potassium (4.1 ± 0.6 vs. 4.5 ± 0.5 mmol/L) and zinc (74.1 ± 10.9 vs. 109.0 ± 20.4 µg/dL), were observed. Energy, protein, fat and carbohydrate intakes were significantly higher in the third month of the intervention as compared to the baseline. The estimated medial daily intake of salicylates was low and ranged from 0.34 mg to 0.39 mg. Conclusions: The dietary intervention resulted in beneficial and significant changes in the nutritional status, biochemical parameters and nutrition of residents of the long-term care home. These results suggest that practical and individualized approaches are required to improve the nutritional status and clinical outcomes of nursing homes

in the natural environment require an organism to make constant adaptations enabling efficient use of environmental resources and ensuring its success in competition with other organisms. Such adaptations are expressed through various life strategies, largely determined by the rate of consumption and use of available resources, affecting the life-history traits and the related trade-offs. Allocation of available resources must take into consideration the costs of cell maintenance as well as reproduction. Given that carbon metabolism plays a crucial role in resource allocation, yeast living in different ecological niches show various life-history traits. There are a lot of data about life-history strategies in yeast living in various ecological niches; however, the question is whether different life strategies will be noted for yeast strains growing under strictly controlled conditions. Our studies based on three laboratory yeast strains representing different genetic backgrounds show that each of these strains has specified life strategies which are mainly determined by the glucose uptake rate and its intracellular usage. These results suggest that specific life strategies and related differences in the physiological and metabolic parameters of the cell are the key aspects that may explain various features of cells from different yeast strains, either industrial or laboratory."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172752","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62fcada94097074498b13116","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"126","number":"8","doi":"","documentHash":"ca31f614-a3ef-4aa2-942c-ab29f51d46f7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"126","pagesFromTo":"498-510","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S187861462200037X?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a2878c28a0473ae234","name":"Roman","lastName":"Maślanka","uuid":"377B0612218650F248D52621E2AAD8C5865B79F1C885BA4A1ED18083BC6BF31B3AF3D8521A055199BEE421290B087BAE21AFCF97427354452D9EBDFF357432B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-1917-4222","documentHash":"30e01bce-5513-4c71-aa1a-e8a1221fd846"},{"objectId":"5e709216878c28a04738fb6e","name":"Renata","lastName":"Zadrąg-Tęcza","uuid":"E68B632776C4176E773C1F9CEEE97742393A3F86AA11317B23EADAD6AC250BA2845DE0741C759441957F056E941A7B6DA8973C952B0A15209ABAD35AE9FFEE5A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5073-9274","documentHash":"417eb289-5603-43d8-a485-d99008babbc4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.funbio.2022.04.004"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["celuloza bakteryjna","zastosowanie","aplikacyjność","przemysł","gospodarka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bacterial cellulose","application","applicability","industry","economy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Celuloza bakteryjna – zastosowanie","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5ec00b69ad49b31ccedd99ab","mniswId":null,"title":"Biuletyn Informacyjny Ośrodka Badawczo-Rozwojowego Przemysłu Płyt Drewnopochodnych w Czarnej Wodzie","doi":null,"issn":"0209-2190","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"d77fe0cd-5d44-4c60-a9b9-bbacbfd01b66"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cb5594097070cd3481264","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091ff878c28a04738e43a","5e70923d878c28a0473923d2","629cb5594097070cd3481267"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W pracy przedstawiono możliwości zastosowania celulozy bakteryjnej w licznych \r\ndziedzinach przemysłu.

Although this infection is comparatively rare, it is often associated with a significant mortality rate of 20–30% worldwide. Therefore, this microorganism has an important impact on food safety. L. monocytogenes can adapt, survive and even grow over a wide range of food production environmental stress conditions such as temperatures, low and high pH, high salt concentration, ultraviolet lights, presence of biocides and heavy metals. Furthermore, this bacterium is also able to form biofilm structures on a variety of surfaces in food production environments which makes it difficult to remove and allows it to persist for a long time. This increases the risk of contamination of food production facilities and finally foods. The present review focuses on the key issues related to the molecular mechanisms of the pathogen survival and adaptation to adverse environmental conditions. Knowledge and understanding of the L. monocytogenes adaptation approaches to environmental stress factors will have a significant influence on the development of new, efficient, and cost-effective methods of the pathogen control in the food industry, which is critical to ensure food production safety."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172768","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"866462","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.866462/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"608a55de9543c73526c48c68","name":"Beata","lastName":"Lachtara","uuid":"282991714039C961E3319F2426A2863D93470CCBE543F8EC7CE3808AE7F95DEC9E25A5232A45D0AAB8B01CF326F9497B266A34643AE9A696A6239B39FF83989E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6cf7b97-c844-48db-a522-0850505ee499"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["protein","meat analog","texture","insect protein","algae protein"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Novel protein sources for applications in meat-alternative products—Insight and challenges","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0f59a8f0-a1f9-45c0-ba10-cec780ad3d19"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d0f3b4097070cd34d8f49","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709386878c28a0473abe68","5e709386878c28a0473abeb5","629d0f3b4097070cd34d8f4e","629d0f3b4097070cd34d8f4f","629d0f3b4097070cd34d8f50","629d0f3b4097070cd34d8f51"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Many people are increasingly interested in a vegetarian or vegan diet.

High-strain compression was conducted using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB). The details of the deformation mechanism were evaluated based on the analysis of the deformation hardening curves using the strain hardening exponent concept developed for titanium alloys in tension conditions. The used approach allowed us to identify the stages of plastic deformation observed and the controlling phase in deformation of two-phase alloy through the assessment of the strengthening index, n. It has been found that three deformation stages can be identified in quasi-static conditions. However, when the alloy is compressed at a high strain rate, the third deformation stage does not develop due to the high process rate. Further analysis of deformation curves reveals the leading role of the β-phase under the quasi-static conditions and the essential contribution of the second, α-phase, at a high compression rate. The findings on the deformation mechanism based on the analysis of hardening curves were supported by a detailed structural study."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172776","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6299e13e4097072c2b7aff32","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"fca7ba23-114a-48a5-855a-ca5f4922c562"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"645-1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4352/12/5/645/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6299e13e4097072c2b7aff2f","name":"Sergey V.","lastName":"Prikhodko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3dd7f008-b9d9-4f92-8f46-bce89750f2d1"},{"objectId":"6299e13e4097072c2b7aff2e","name":"Matthew","lastName":"Mecklenburg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"665df970-b2da-4289-9d12-efae8052ad42"},{"objectId":"6299e13e4097072c2b7aff26","name":"Olexander","lastName":"Dekhtyar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"601bc124-8feb-490b-a5d9-363e79a48bf9"},{"objectId":"6299e13e4097072c2b7aff25","name":"Pavlo E.","lastName":"Markovsky","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18e5709b-4ab6-4059-ba5b-a3e106bb8525"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c77","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Janiszewski","uuid":"8FD740D533C583F36AC424EC3868CC5426EA97B245CCAB60F43B78334CE9A3E91F55D8C0961ADF0190BC35919FE0CD2ACC078A9E688623B2097C2FB068BD70B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3783-8774","documentHash":"5a2c5974-d598-4fd5-9cdb-f81e45fbca9f"}],"doi":"10.3390/cryst12050645"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6299f3234097072c2b7c17e1","doi":null,"title":"Prawo cywilne.

Low temperature and active particles during CP processing play a significant role in limiting nutrient loss in food and modifying biomacromolecules. So far, numerous works have been carried out on the use of CP in food processing. However, the effectiveness of the CP pre-extraction treatment on the structural morphology and rheological properties of pectin fractions extracted from okra pods is not described yet. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of CP on the changes in structural morphology and rheological properties of water-soluble pectin (WSP), chelator-soluble pectin (CSP), and diluted alkali-soluble pectin (DASP) fractions extracted from okra pods. The yield of extraction depended on the type of solvent and the duration of CP treatment. The short CP treatment (5 s) caused the suspension of extraction, while longer treatments (15 and 30 s) contributed to the formation of microcracks on the surface of okra that favored efficient extraction yields. Pectins extracted from okra belonged to the group of the low methylated ones. The degree of methylation was <50%, and it depended on the solvent type but not on the treatment. WSP fraction was characterized by the highest viscosity, and it was followed by the viscosities of DASP and CSP. CP treatment caused a slight change in the nature of fluid from dilatant towards Newtonian (CSP and DASP) or pseudoplastic behavior (WSP). The acquired knowledge may be useful for better understanding and optimization of technologies based on the CP treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172791","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629725ed40970702be50111d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"18de0d1e-7588-4bf9-9e7f-749ae70d881b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1168-1181","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11947-022-02798-0.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629725ec40970702be50111a","name":"Hong-Wei","lastName":"Xiao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff09eeae-0efc-48a8-a957-dba52c2fe855"},{"objectId":"629725ec40970702be501119","name":"Zhongli","lastName":"Pan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64bdd31f-43a2-4ff4-ba8a-1fc20686202d"},{"objectId":"629725ec40970702be501118","name":"Zi-Liang","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"552b37fa-0c6f-4e14-a9ac-5b2875eb6328"},{"objectId":"629725ec40970702be501114","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pieczywek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41fb58d1-9d82-4fdc-8c38-b7a1834b7c1c"},{"objectId":"629725ec40970702be501112","name":"Sara","lastName":"Zielinska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"677b14f2-4dfd-4616-af28-a8ea3004cd92"},{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b733b","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Staniszewska","uuid":"713025B7D5AA734E016E29ADE0EF5C4B2859C591F9C9341DD1E7418FE016E0BB640C498D77152A4ED16F659F1F8C4B1812B2C1287AF3DEE4BA18F5767411057C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7868-3794","documentHash":"8fcbd3f4-5c20-4a67-a41e-57b6f66d6225"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4239","name":"Artur","lastName":"Zdunek","uuid":"8A390218FDC6DEFCED763C9DA2909C4BE0BCA53DCEF103AD738A8E9BCC2FE5E26E2CE0660EC1D20063043207FBC4CFB8552FB5E17D5080A325C6E2310E88A97E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9395-1486","documentHash":"95d0547b-dd21-439a-be25-1616f7d1c9ec"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a66ae","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Cybulska","uuid":"7AC1CC65DB27BF80DFBBB188220BAC5413329A7D19ABE1D8B16BC81769D592170CD381D291E423C82D077833DE95280A42FC448F999AE82C18A83A4F98D7B494","orcidId":"0000-0003-3323-4535","documentHash":"0e90ea03-6325-45b4-9199-db4f54f21b09"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ada1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kurzyna - Szklarek","uuid":"CDBC16A578944DB354B9D5F2AE71B327C03EF72286653CD564F1C7165DE723C4E7106DC69C8CF7205977EA10ED1123117D9E12EC041AA3FADBF9FDB626C7E0D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6258-6153","documentHash":"9c3d3999-5381-455b-8400-5cff35dce831"},{"objectId":"5e709219878c28a04738ff02","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":"40E622DB699DA4C62339D9899C3FB3727D26766576006C93222CC1C8E9DCB74A8D2CB09A76FD5DC1DE214822203FDD1C4C0EC77BFAC7B250816A0052ED372947","orcidId":"0000-0001-7127-4891","documentHash":"298bed58-043a-4912-aa64-69207ee72a5c"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11947-022-02798-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-3-030-98392-5","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Biopolymers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d01b24097070cd34d6f17","editors":[{"objectId":"629d01b24097070cd34d6f19","name":"Sharma","lastName":"Swati","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"debe25ba-3f11-41ca-9d61-eadfa32fcf34"},{"objectId":"629d01b24097070cd34d6f18","name":"Kumar","lastName":"Ashok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db1f5ded-b93d-4657-9e22-090a4c45e76c"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["629d01b24097070cd34d6f18","629d01b24097070cd34d6f19"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book emphasizes various challenges and opportunities in biopolymers and identifying their potential applications in various fields including food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and electronics.

This pertains to water management on a national scale, river basins and drainage systems. The outflow of water can be extensively regulated after various forms of retention in the catchment. The water level regulators presented herein enable the damming of water in drainage networks and the adjacent ground. Their advantages include their simple structure and operation principles and also the ability to adapt to currently existing devices in sub-irrigation systems. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine the hydraulic characteristics and operating conditions of three innovative regulator solutions. They focused on changing water damming heights by the closure of successively placed beams in order to obtain the required water level in the given hydrometeorological conditions. The structures of the regulators were made of plastics and rectilinear fillings for securing S-type excavations and elements of sheet piling with a developed shape in the plan of U and Z types, offering advantages compared to traditional materials (with respect to installation, operation and durability). All tested regulators were characterized by the effective flow Qe, caused by water leaks due to the lack of tightness of the regulator elements. The regulator with rectilinear beams of S-type closures offered the highest effective flow, which was 4 ÷ 5 times higher than in other regulators. U- and Z-type regulators were better at facilitating the regulation of the water table and the flow than the S rectilinear regulator. This led to both: the greater tightness of connections and the use of an overflow with a developed crest in the plan. The U and Z controllers had the highest hydraulic efficiency, expressed as the flow increase coefficient, at overflow layer heights of up to 5.0 cm. For tested fillings larger than 5.0 cm, U-type beams with a cylindrical corner shape had a lower flow increase coefficient (kq = 1.25) than Z-type beams with an angular corner shape, for which kq ∈ &lt;1.35 ÷ 1.38&gt;.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172815","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/8/1259","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6406284b4097077035594e8e","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Popek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"45d71d27-90cf-444c-b560-a974539fc5fd"},{"objectId":"6406284b4097077035594e8d","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84523648-0baf-4b80-bfd0-1aebb69a1551"},{"objectId":"6406284b4097077035594e8c","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Urbański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5698a84d-b561-41eb-a92d-8e49d90c2a0c"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a047394581","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Brandyk","uuid":"F4E7426C1E2D187739BA88DB4B27CAB5A719455FD0AD2A5C95414B9665D859F8375E3DB2546F93851BCC1AFD1918078AE9270D1650416F3AFC5951B7892944C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6021-5340","documentHash":"a1c632f7-0165-48ee-b747-cd87707cd126"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a047394166","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Siwicki","uuid":"7E57FFD9F3BB45E3031264A82C44C8D1678CED28EB6F97DB3F91692FF8884ACA5A4F77216DB4E23FDD64EB1041662DD41DDBF91F11AFE555829097775AEFB3FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3097-8662","documentHash":"597f8780-80cc-4314-bdfd-90d76869b14c"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a047394150","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Bajkowski","uuid":"DFE1CF1A4A6D8D7E83EF08F017B80198927AA649FDA2BCD372E16D979D586DF596884F549D857D4E1C986A181A062C4B5319C8D7751DC9076E406A9A7AAAAC75","orcidId":"0000-0002-7010-0600","documentHash":"490e15ae-81a2-44bd-895c-8dff6a5f0426"}],"doi":"10.3390/w14081259"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["financial system","time series prediction","PFO","Poisson logarithmic","mathematical model"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61b08e712467f07864026940","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Mustansiriyah University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629650a04097072fefbe3785"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Impact of time series prediction to the online booking system (internet) on the libraries employing Poisson logarithmic linear model","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629650a04097072fefbe3783","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629650a04097072fefbe3785"]},"issue":"4 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, the effect on the series prediction of the financial system of the central library has been investigated and analyzed accordingly.

are commonly known for their unique features, e.g., antibacterial or anticancer properties. Although many synthetic heterocycles, such as 4-thiazolidinone (4-TZD), have been synthesized, their potential applications have not yet been fully investigated. However, many researchers have reported relevant results that can be a basis for the search for new potential drugs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic, cytostatic, and antibacterial effects of certain 4-thiazolidinone-based derivatives, Les-3166, Les-5935, Les-6009, and Les-6166, on human fibroblasts (BJ), neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), epithelial lung carcinoma (A549), and colorectal adenocarcinoma (CACO-2) cell lines in vitro. All tested compounds applied in a concentration range from 10 to 100 µM were able to decrease metabolic activity in the BJ, A549, and SH-SY5Y cell lines. However, the action of Les-3166 was mainly based on the ROS-independent pathway, similarly to Les-6009. In turn, Les-5935 and Les-6166 were able to promote ROS production in BJ, A549, and SH-SY5Y cells, compared to the control. Les-3166, Les-6009, and Les-6166 significantly increased the caspase-3 activity, especially at the concentrations of 50 µM and 100 µM. However, Les-5935 did not induce apoptosis. Only Les-5935 showed a minor cytostatic effect on SH-SY5Y cells. Additionally, the antibacterial properties of the tested compounds against P. aeruginosa bacterial biofilm can be ranked as follows: Les-3166 > Les-5935 > Les-6009.

Depending on which fire detectors are selected to protect the relevant premises and where they are installed, the time of operation of all elements of automatic control systems in case of a fire will depend. The review of literary data revealed that at present there is no comprehensive approach to choosing the optimal placement in warehouses. In addition, the optimal placement of fire detectors within the room, taking into consideration the type of fire load, has not been sufficiently studied. Therefore, the purpose of the current study is to establish the dependence of the time of operation of different types of fire detectors on the type of combustible material, namely its mass burnout rate, distance, and height of placement of detectors from a potential fire site. This paper reports a procedure for conducting an experimental study to identify the appropriate dependence for warehouses. The results of the experiments showed that the most effective in warehouses are targeted fire smoke detectors and aspiration systems. Based on the results of a complete factor experiment, nonlinear empirical dependences to determine the time of operation of smoke fire detectors on the above factors were built. The resulting empirical dependences make it possible to choose fire detectors and optimally place them within a room. The average error in these dependences when compared with the experimental data is 6.9 %. The use of the derived dependences makes it possible to reduce the time of operation of fire detectors by 14 s in comparison with their placement in accordance with building codes"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172849","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62978fc640970702be54f7b9","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"10 (113)","doi":"","documentHash":"1061206a-c124-4553-a9d2-6891be9fc48a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"66-73","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254620/252955","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629794af40970702be552641","name":"Artur","lastName":"Renkas","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5518-3508","documentHash":"cccf1286-aa1b-44e5-87d6-433666b4146f"},{"objectId":"629794af40970702be552640","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Pasnak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8405-4625","documentHash":"ccdaf120-9109-4386-88b9-1d00cc566a09"},{"objectId":"629794af40970702be55263f","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Sharyy","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8746-2184","documentHash":"dfd9bf6d-1626-4cec-94b7-86b47c2b4d21"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254620"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-88-99108-26-7","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Wood in sport equipment - heritage, present, perspective","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":190,"publicationPlace":"Turyn","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cc99a4097070cd3481776","editors":[{"objectId":"629cc99a4097070cd3481777","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Negro","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1b97dda-a90e-42f3-97de-9804f7fc6ab7"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["629cc99a4097070cd3481777"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058172860","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"629cc99a4097070cd3481778","mniswId":null,"name":"DISAFA, University of Torino","documentHash":"1bb9f99f-3ec1-4744-8702-ecc42c4d84d0"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.22382/book-2022-01","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.22382/book-2022-01"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Relaunch cropping on marginal soils by incorporating amendments and beneficial trace elements in an interdisciplinary approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cde9b4097070cd348b741","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709257878c28a047394148","5e709259878c28a0473941d7","629cde9b4097070cd348b744","629cde9b4097070cd348b745","629cde9b4097070cd348b746","629cde9b4097070cd348b747","629cde9b4097070cd348b748","629cde9b4097070cd348b749","629cde9b4097070cd348b74a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the EU and world-wide, agriculture is in transition.

According to the supervisory body, the city council overstepped its statutory powers, which constitutes a significant breach of the law. According to the voivod, an act of local law cannot constitute grounds for imposing a fine or withdrawing a licence to perform national road carriage of passengers by taxi. The court held that, in the supervisory decision, the voivod did not sufficiently consider the issue, as he did not justify how the law was materially breached.

The disease was introduced to Poland in 2014 and is now present in the wild boar population. Appropriate ASF prevention requires further research for answers to fundamental questions about the importance of vectors in virus transmission, the impact of environmental factors on the presence of ASFV in wild boar habitats, and the role of survivors as potential virus carriers and their part in the potential endemicity of ASF. In order to analyze the changes in the molecular and serological prevalence of ASFV in wild boar population in Poland, real-time PCR and ELISA/IPT tests were conducted. In the analyzed period (2014–2020), most of the ASF-positive wild boars were molecular/virus-positive, however, over the years the percentage and the number of seropositive animals has increased. At the beginning of the epidemic, the disease was limited to a small area of the country. Since then, it has spread to new provinces of Poland. From the beginning and until today, most notifications of ASF-positive wild boars were for carcasses (passive surveillance), however, the number of serologically positive animals is still increasing. Despite the fact that notifications of ASF outbreaks are still being received near the eastern border of Poland, the old ASF area seems to be limited mainly to ASF serologically positive animals, which may indicate the beginning of ASF endemicity in Poland."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172879","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1170","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/9/1170","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6299cf024097072c2b7a052d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gal-Cisoń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a7c02b0-0d58-4ee5-8bbb-31b6c5c592c2"},{"objectId":"609b48fd9543c73526c48db5","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ziętek-Barszcz","uuid":"C79B25D061C888B608C52BFC9A99067A950574F010AB0F594E3D1611FFC7E6275D032D19C640A081625F3DA7A7A3B012BEA88B6BE8C9A63ED46316F6CFA6FFDF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e517232b-3a40-449b-8d55-4574aea8321c"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bocian","uuid":"4239FC4F1A6A56B4C449D55C845F70D206FD0316490BE74E000F9F96750190FD162A48D60125604A3F67FE1FC3BA677DB5B766BCA6E3D70F855ED39F57117E92","orcidId":"0000-0002-8204-5856","documentHash":"c3f73129-bb4a-4ed7-aaf9-f0ea97957b91"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczotka-Bochniarz","uuid":"5A50EFE8836EA63AA5BA231195E3DDEB25840BF56F1B77D19D94CD5E6748C7E4E32CFF39CFC6D8497A6D9A3C605C8A92492E03B7B9C14044428FA1775ABD8590","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc1ff5e7-22b6-4115-a0ab-d029278b2b6f"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Niemczuk","uuid":"82AA2E7CCF0C6F87FC9C29C9C294AC35E29D444F944ED9F1FA82BB7FF88B5C2DF9A8411764C95A57F695D0609991E5125471404AD969DADA833F258105E54B44","orcidId":"0000-0003-1611-9770","documentHash":"a1f14ea1-835c-4507-ba6c-be8782ab8fbd"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dieta

Présentation préliminaire\nÀ la fin de l’automne 2020, un groupe d’archéologues de la ville de Kalisz, en Pologne, a entrepris des recherches dans le village de Słuszków (woj. Wielkopolskie/PL). C’est là qu’avait été découvert en 1935 l’un des plus grands trésors datant du début du 12e siècle (»Słuszków 1«). Le but de l’expédition était seulement d’établir la position de cette trouvaille, mais au cours d’un sondage avec détecteur de métaux, quelque chose d’inattendu s’est produit: la découverte d’un autre trésor (»Słuszków 2«). Le premier trésor, qui avait été réparti entre les habitants du village, était initialement important, il aurait pu contenir jusqu’à 20 000 pièces de monnaie et probablement plus d’ornements en argent que le nombre qui a survécu à cette découverte. On estime que le dépôt initial pesait 15 kg et qu’il s’agirait donc du plus grand trésor connu de Pologne datant du tournant du 12e siècle. Le second dépôt de Słuszków comprend 6500 objets, pour la plupart des pièces de monnaie, principalement des deniers à croix, saxons et polonais, et plusieurs dizaines de pièces européennes différentes, ainsi que des lingots d’argent plats, des morceaux de plomb et quatre anneaux de doigts en or. Ces derniers objets sont une première dans les trésors polonais de l’époque viking. Un anneau porte une inscription en cyrillique indiquant qu’il provenait de la principauté de Kiev. Les trois autres anneaux furent probablement fabriqués en Allemagne, à l’époque ottonienne ou salienne, selon les traditions byzantine et carolingienne. Deux grands groupes de deniers à croix trouvés dans ce dépôt étaient auparavant connus presque exclusivement par le trésor de Słuszków 1. Ils ont été produits au tournant du 12e siècle, probablement dans l’atelier monétaire de Kalisz ou de ses environs. Leur émission est hypothétiquement attribuée au souverain polonais Zbigniew († 1111?). Il convient également de noter le fragment d’une pièce officielle du duc Władysław Herman († 1102), portant son nom et son image, frappée à Cracovie après 1080. D’autres pièces ont été découvertes, notamment des exemples de grands deniers très rares émis par le palatin Sieciech († vers 1110). Ces pièces sont les premières émissions privées de monnaies de thésaurisation en Pologne par un magnat connu et considéré. Parmi les quelques dizaines de pièces étrangères, il semble que la plus récente soit un denier du roi Ladislas Ier, saint patron de la Hongrie († 1095), frappé au plus tôt dans les années 1080. Dans le cas des deux trésors de Słuszków, la cache d’une telle quantité d’objets en métal précieux peut probablement être associée à un événement violent, comme la guerre entre deux frères royaux, Zbigniew et Bolesław. Cet article est une présentation préliminaire de ce nouveau trésor et de son contenu."},{"languageCode":"deu","content":"Ein neuer spätwikingerzeitlicher Hort aus Polen: Münzen und Goldschmuck als Quellen für die Geschichte Mitteleuropas. Eine vorläufige Präsentation\nIm Spätherbst 2020 unternahm eine Gruppe von Archäologen aus der Stadt Kalisz in Polen Untersuchungen im Dorf Słuszków (woj. wielkopolskie/PL). In dieser Ortschaft ist 1935 einer der größten, an den Anfang des 12. Jahrhunderts datierenden Horte entdeckt worden (»Słuszków 1«). Das Ziel der Expedition war nur, den Fundort dieses Horts zu bestimmen, aber im Laufe einer Metalldetektoruntersuchung geschah etwas Unerwartetes – ein neuer Hort (»Słuszków 2«) wurde gefunden. Der erste Hort, der unter der Dorfbevölkerung aufgeteilt worden war, war ursprünglich umfangreich. Er könnte bis zu 20 000 Münzen enthalten haben und wahrscheinlich mehr Silberschmuck, als von diesem Fund erhalten geblieben ist. Es wird geschätzt, dass der ursprüngliche Fund 15 kg wog und somit der größte bekannte Hort von der Wende des 11. zum 12. Jahrhundert in Polen wäre. Der zweite Hort aus Słuszków enthält 6500 Objekte, die meisten davon Münzen, hauptsächlich sog. sächsische und polnische Kreuzdenare und mehrere Dutzend verschiedene europäische Münzen, sowie flache Silberbarren, Bleistücke und vier goldene Fingerringe. Letztere sind die ersten Funde dieser Art in polnischen Horten aus der Wikingerzeit. Einer dieser Ringe ist mit einer kyrillischen Inschrift verziert, was seine Herkunft aus dem Fürstentum Kiew nahelegt. Die drei anderen Ringe wurden möglicherweise nach byzantinisch-karolingischer Tradition in Deutschland in der Ottonen- oder Salierzeit hergestellt. Zwei große Gruppen von »Kreuzdenaren«, die in dem Hort entdeckt wurden, waren bisher fast ausschließlich aus dem Hort Słuszków 1 bekannt. Sie wurden um die Wende vom 11. zum 12. Jahrhundert geprägt, wahrscheinlich in der Münzstätte in Kalisz oder in der Umgebung dieser Stadt. Ihre Emission kann hypothetisch dem polnischen Herrscher Zbigniew († 1111?) zugeschrieben werden. Bemerkenswert ist auch ein Fragment einer offiziellen Münze des Herzogs Władysław Herman († 1102), die seinen Namen und sein Bild zeigt und in Krakau nach 1080 geprägt wurde. Andere bedeutende Funde sind Exemplare von sehr seltenen großen Denaren, die vom Pfalzgraf Sieciech († um 1110) ausgegeben wurden. Diese Münzen sind die ersten Privatemissionen von Anlagemünzen in Polen von einem bekannten und anerkannten Magnaten. Unter den mehreren Dutzend ausländischer Münzen scheint ein Denar des ungarischen Königs Ladislaus I. dem Heiligen († 1095) am jüngsten zu sein. Diese Münze wurde frühestens in den 1080er Jahren geprägt. Was die zwei Horte aus Słuszków betrifft, kann das Verbergen einer so großen Anzahl von Edelmetallgegenständen wahrscheinlich mit einem gewalttätigen Ereignis, wie etwa dem Krieg zwischen zwei Brüdern aus der Herrscherfamilie, Zbigniew und Bolesław, in Verbindung gebracht werden. Dieser Aufsatz bietet eine vorläufige Präsentation dieses neuen Horts und seines Inhalts."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the late autumn of 2020, a group of archaeologists from the city of Kalisz, Poland, undertook some research in the village of Słuszków (woj. wielkopolskie/PL). It was here in 1935 that one of the greatest hoards dating back to the beginning of the 12th century (»Słuszków 1«) had been discovered. The aim of the expedition was only to establish the position of this find, but in the course of a metal detector survey, something unexpected happened – the discovery of another hoard (»Słuszków 2«). The first hoard, which had been divided among people in the village, was initially large. It could have contained up to 20,000 coins and probably more silver ornaments than the number that have survived from this find. It is estimated that the original deposit weighed 15 kg, so it would be the largest known hoard from the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries from Poland. The second deposit from Słuszków consists of 6,500 items, most of them coins, mainly Saxon and Polish cross deniers, and several dozen different European coins, as well as flat silver ingots, pieces of lead and four gold finger-rings. The latter items are the first finds of this type in Viking-age Polish hoards. On one finger-ring there is a Cyrillic inscription suggesting the origin of the ring from the Kiev Principality. The three other rings were possibly produced according to Byzantine-Carolingian tradition in Germany in the Ottonian or Salian Periods. Two large groups of cross deniers found in this deposit were previously known almost exclusively from the Słuszków 1 hoard. They were minted at the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, probably in the mint in Kalisz or in its vicinity. Their issue is hypothetically attributed to the Polish ruler Zbigniew († 1111?). Also noteworthy is a fragment of an official coin of Duke Władysław Herman († 1102), showing his name and image, minted in Cracow after 1080. Other notable finds are examples of very rare large deniers issued by Palatine Sieciech († ca. 1110). These coins are the first private issues of bullion coins in Poland by a known and recognized magnate. Among the several dozen foreign coins, it seems that the most recent one is a denier of King Ladislaus I the Saint of Hungary († 1095), minted at the earliest in the 1080s. In the case of the two hoards from Słuszków, the concealment of such a large amount of precious metal items can probably be associated with some violent event, such as the war between two royal brothers, Zbigniew and Bolesław. The paper is a preliminary presentation of this new hoard and its contents."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172884","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6295f0114097072fefb9acc8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"52","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"b27e19f6-3263-4c46-b286-55fea0088d4c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"52","pagesFromTo":"145-156","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://web.rgzm.de/publikationen/verlagsprogramm/zeitschriften/archaeologisches-korrespondenzblatt/pm/article/a-new-late-viking-age-hoard-from-poland-coins-and-gold-jewellery-as-evidence-for-the-history-of-cen/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf8fe","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wyczółkowski","uuid":"E5BA608ACFF930B10A80D3C60B22273CE5D2FEFE3E65C76931FA4D1458BDFF67C186CD11615D1D272D0E0772F72838AC6F0BB6DFA19383E2DA2D66C65EBAD352","orcidId":"0000-0003-4856-684X","documentHash":"2e3082a0-89dc-4866-a1d1-9feadbe33ac2"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b54e7","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kollinger","uuid":"A9ADE1630E03323C38BC8A7C2199B86E83B85D98DA4F98A6675F94D7362B4F07D7BF5C9C844D794FD130924E17F7243AD6736B383F17B480D11886F28DC00269","orcidId":"0000-0002-4362-8338","documentHash":"a093acef-1f95-430e-b753-b4bff6e8c11e"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af3bc","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kędzierski","uuid":"9308BCBEB04C5A94161FEC7E8692CAE76DC5C891EA25DCE872DCE420CABF7BC4EE061B082C0C681814E7ED45FDA9403C58CCA6DF63A74225B2259F69DF98CF8A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8762-2608","documentHash":"a626a895-d80b-43c0-a639-e95957d09880"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ae05","name":"Władysław","lastName":"Duczko","uuid":"0C2C01A0B36C08E07371AFEF6DB30A221DFA8E369B3C465D45A81B5A21399C51F8C4BFC3AF2BCC3682EE89D82E05B7EA701FCE04602C4546A97D20A7E0280439","orcidId":"0000-0001-9037-8944","documentHash":"38175e2a-1564-4805-90fa-41a27c121860"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["protective means","textile material","combustion","weight loss","fabric surface treatment","swelling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5ecfaac2ad49b329d31fbb70","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"V.

Neglecting modern coatings leads to the ignition of fabric structures under the action of flame. Devising reliable methods for studying the conditions of fabric fire protection leads to the design of new types of fireproof materials. Therefore, there is a need to determine the conditions that form a barrier to high fabric temperature and to establish a mechanism for inhibiting heat transfer to the material. In this regard, the thermal conductivity process was simulated on the fabric surface using an intumescent coating, which makes it possible to estimate the coefficient of thermal conductivity at high temperatures. Based on the experimental data and theoretical dependences, the thermal conductivity coefficient of the fire-retardant layer of coked foam was calculated, which is 8.9×10-6 m2/s, due to the formation of a heat-insulating layer. The study results proved that the process of thermal insulation of textile material involves not only the decomposition of flame retardants with the formation of inert gases that interact with the flame on the sample surface but also the inhibition of heat transfer to the material treated with an intumescent coating that forms a thermally-insulating layer of coked foam on the fabric surface. The maximum possible penetration of temperature was estimated, namely generating a temperature on the sample's surface that significantly exceeds the ignition temperature of the fabric, and does not exceed 215 °C on the unheated surface. Thus, there is reason to argue about the possibility of targeted adjustment of the processes of fabric fire protection by applying coatings capable of forming a protective layer on the surface of the material, which inhibits the rate of heat transfer"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172891","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62978fc640970702be54f7b9","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"10 (113)","doi":"","documentHash":"1061206a-c124-4553-a9d2-6891be9fc48a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"74-80","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254546/252956","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6297958c40970702be552bfa","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Sarapin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3114-5934","documentHash":"288c1ab4-c23b-4f64-a1f8-7a7cf937063b"},{"objectId":"6297958c40970702be552bf9","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Matviichuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4051-2484","documentHash":"49728377-814d-43f1-9b83-04fa63fc058e"},{"objectId":"6297958c40970702be552bf8","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Mazurchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6008-9591","documentHash":"4946441a-4663-4cef-8abc-165d53b83608"},{"objectId":"6297958c40970702be552bf7","name":"Oleksandra","lastName":"Horbachova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7533-5628","documentHash":"aaaeb621-a820-4dd8-b19c-e9268983cfe9"},{"objectId":"6297958c40970702be552bf6","name":"Nataliia","lastName":"Buiskykh","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3229-7235","documentHash":"b39ab6f1-61e5-4bf6-a840-c2491a0160dd"},{"objectId":"6297958c40970702be552bf5","name":"Аleksii","lastName":"Tsapko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2298-068X","documentHash":"59b6447f-d0c5-4709-81d6-9ad06832c49c"},{"objectId":"6297958c40970702be552bf4","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Tsapko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0625-0783","documentHash":"f0113bfa-625e-4755-9347-7c465009df0f"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254546"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["innovation","consumer behavior","fruit market"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709239878c28a047391e55"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Innovation as a Factor Increasing Fruit Consumption: The Case of Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","doi":null,"issn":"2072-6643","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"249ff7e0-f443-46aa-b5c4-21f8cf400d2e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cd7614097070cd34859a5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64fb11f240970739aaa2c12d","64fb11f240970739aaa2c12e","5e709239878c28a047391e55","64fb11f240970739aaa2c12f","64fb11f240970739aaa2c130"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to the low level of fruit consumption in relation to dietary recommendations in many European countries, including Poland, multidirectional actions should be taken to increase the consumption of these products.

The results obtained indicate that consumers with a higher propensity to purchase innovative products consumed fruit and fruit preserves more. In addition, statistically significant differences were found between innovators and non-innovators in terms of income, expenditures on fruit purchases, places where fruit and fruit preserves were purchased and product characteristics that determined the purchase decision. The logistic regression results indicate that a higher frequency of supermarket/hypermarket and online shopping, a higher weekly spending on fruit and a greater importance attributed to the biodegradability of the packaging increased the favorability of innovation relatively to fruit products (by 23.8%, 31.4%, 32.7% and 21.6%, respectively). The relationships found may have important implications for both private and public stakeholders in the fruit and vegetable sector."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172893","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/6/1246","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64fb11f240970739aaa2c130","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Latocha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3d58209-0999-4339-adc0-b2f17e803ebc"},{"objectId":"64fb11f240970739aaa2c12f","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Olewnicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d9d7771-d6d7-4629-8952-de19af4ecbc4"},{"objectId":"64fb11f240970739aaa2c12e","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3fe661bd-fdca-4535-bbfe-bc0d14e614dd"},{"objectId":"64fb11f240970739aaa2c12d","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Stangierska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11c87f4a-ee5b-42f5-b101-1c0252f379fe"},{"objectId":"5e709239878c28a047391e55","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"WIDERA","uuid":"132E5186A61D2C3442D88F321031105385E50B418B63E9EC9C7E645559A4621C55B59920DD543F8EF488C56F7C71E05F522D06CC52A0F76C0BC3D381E46D8C17","orcidId":"0000-0003-0651-8049","documentHash":"891857e0-edf6-451e-b338-49ff05d99f39"}],"doi":"10.3390/nu14061246"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Okra pods","Polysaccharides","Phytochemicals Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)","Principle component analysis (PCA)","Cold plasma treatment"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","parentUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","rootUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of water-soluble pectin (WSP), chelator-soluble pectin (CSP), and diluted alkali-soluble pectin (DASP) fractions isolated from okra pods subjected to different CP treatment times were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and the results highlighted significant differences among different pectin fractions. The CP treatment caused a decrease in the contents of lycopene and chlorophyll alpha. However, the CP treatment with 30 s (CP30) resulted in a slight increase (4%) in the content of chlorophyll beta and led to the smallest color change of okra pods. The CP5, CP15, and CP30 slightly decreased the total phenolics (TP) content of okra pods by 5, 13, and 20%, respectively. The total flavonoids (TF) content of okra pods was not significantly affected by the CP. The short CP treatment, i.e. CP5, was found to be beneficial to the antioxidant potential of okra pods determined by the FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS assays. The antioxidant potentials of CP-treated okra pods determined by the FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS assays were positively correlated with TP contents (r = 0.53, r = 0.97, and r = 0.82, respectively) and TF contents (r = 0.92, r = 0.76, and r = 0.87, respectively). The results of this study provide a deep understanding and insight into non-thermal CP treatment and its influence on the properties of agro-food products and are useful for designing and optimizing non-thermal unit operations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172897","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6298806f409707571438593e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"131","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"2ea470aa-6e60-4326-9477-f0d47f19b5c0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"131","pagesFromTo":"107763","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0268005X22002831?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6298806f409707571438593b","name":"Hong-Wei","lastName":"Xiao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7aa1144-7347-40b4-ac6c-f5d85882d13d"},{"objectId":"6298806f409707571438593a","name":"Zhongli","lastName":"Pan","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0914-4006","documentHash":"d7305229-0cbe-4ae0-bfe3-25a9ccd6240f"},{"objectId":"6298806f4097075714385939","name":"Zi-Liang","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"33bca311-2a61-42b4-917a-0f895f47982e"},{"objectId":"6298806f4097075714385933","name":"Sara","lastName":"Zielinska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c90259a-ace1-4106-b3ff-aaf7c6b336c2"},{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b733b","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Staniszewska","uuid":"713025B7D5AA734E016E29ADE0EF5C4B2859C591F9C9341DD1E7418FE016E0BB640C498D77152A4ED16F659F1F8C4B1812B2C1287AF3DEE4BA18F5767411057C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7868-3794","documentHash":"8fcbd3f4-5c20-4a67-a41e-57b6f66d6225"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4239","name":"Artur","lastName":"Zdunek","uuid":"8A390218FDC6DEFCED763C9DA2909C4BE0BCA53DCEF103AD738A8E9BCC2FE5E26E2CE0660EC1D20063043207FBC4CFB8552FB5E17D5080A325C6E2310E88A97E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9395-1486","documentHash":"95d0547b-dd21-439a-be25-1616f7d1c9ec"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af805","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szymańska-Chargot","uuid":"3767E6B270B62998D74CF8165EB6B35945E838FEF95FB1DAA52C84587C6A0437EA7341F4C36D9A5ACC95AEAE36C5E70647300CF89CF2000E6A80A59EF2D7F7DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-2251-4307","documentHash":"25dc2aec-5594-4a0d-bcb6-9d9557689e02"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a66ae","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Cybulska","uuid":"7AC1CC65DB27BF80DFBBB188220BAC5413329A7D19ABE1D8B16BC81769D592170CD381D291E423C82D077833DE95280A42FC448F999AE82C18A83A4F98D7B494","orcidId":"0000-0003-3323-4535","documentHash":"0e90ea03-6325-45b4-9199-db4f54f21b09"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390f50","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":"6AFAC63CF2521476F402FFDE8FFC31E7A9D4DC6E8E7F0888226502852BC564B4BBF7B32B84EE557B39C23FE4AD63FE2AB93A789B94584F13CFA311ACB809AA7F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7202-4018","documentHash":"54ffdac4-4c5b-4f6e-ae1a-a0448be2a676"},{"objectId":"5e709219878c28a04738ff02","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":"40E622DB699DA4C62339D9899C3FB3727D26766576006C93222CC1C8E9DCB74A8D2CB09A76FD5DC1DE214822203FDD1C4C0EC77BFAC7B250816A0052ED372947","orcidId":"0000-0001-7127-4891","documentHash":"298bed58-043a-4912-aa64-69207ee72a5c"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.107763"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODE3Mjg5Nw=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
