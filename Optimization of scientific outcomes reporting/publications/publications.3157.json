Topography, in its overall performance, includes form, waviness, and roughness. Methods of measurement of surface roughness can be roughly divided into tactile and contactless techniques. The latter ones are much faster but sensitive to external disturbances from the environment. One type of external source error, while the measurement of surface topography occurs, is a high-frequency noise. This noise originates from the vibration of the measuring system. In this study, the methods for reducing high-frequency errors from the results of contactless roughness measurements of turned surfaces were supported by machine learning methods. This research delves into optimizing filtration methods for surface topography measurements through the application of machine learning models, focusing on enhancing the accuracy of surface roughness assessments. By examining turned surfaces under specific machining conditions and employing a variety of digital filters, the study identifies the Gaussian regression filter and spline filter as the most effective methods at a 22.5 µm cut-off. Utilizing neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees, the research demonstrates the superior performance of SVMs, achieving remarkable accuracy and sensitivity in predicting optimal filtration methods."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943941","journalIssue":{"objectId":"660524c64097076263326f17","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"0620dc44-68f3-402f-9a58-22a8bab6dd2d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/7/1456","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b894fdbe833174260d19","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kulisz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4985a74-4b27-4549-82d1-a80da57508a8"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae182","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Podulka","uuid":"D91C653017CC2DD9A53B763900F2D752C1930B793C083D34700F36DD57C4D53DB8DD7F72955235F525E54D975B7A998A9FD49F0011BF1D49C5E5B0E928BA4FF2","orcidId":"0000-0002-1699-3137","documentHash":"f2f1029a-6544-4584-b3dd-0226d9fb6387"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d612","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Antosz","uuid":"9227B894B819EC4FDA2000BA79F84317ABB82DB4451CE7BB5D6C607B3A89F9108D5AB04E8550B5275998C42D6B3E39C9BD4C243E6305197D3E17B6F65BF30493","orcidId":"0000-0001-6048-5220","documentHash":"169c335d-2e8d-4a05-8762-4ffd1a8b65e3"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17071456"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["balancing numbers","quaternions","split quaternions"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Rivets were considered as rigid inclusions to which unknown forces were applied. These forces were determined from the condition of compatibility of plate and rod deformations. The singular integral equations' method was used to determine stresses and strains in the plate. Integral equations were solved numerically and reduced to a system of algebraic equations. To obtain the forces and moments acting on the rivets, the equations of equilibrium of the rivets and the conditions that ensure the same displacements between the rivets in the plate and in the rods are added to these equations. Examples of calculating stresses near circular and elliptical rivets, magnitudes of forces acting on rivets depending on the rigidity of the rods are given. The reduction of the stress concentration near the elliptical hole, which is placed between two rods, was studied."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943948","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65fd783a4097076653d65adf","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"122","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b7387ac0-c0c4-455f-85d3-8cedd5809ebd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"221-237","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sjsutst.polsl.pl/archives/2024/vol122/221_SJSUTST122_2024_Maksymovych_Dutkievicz_Maksymovych.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b8b3fdbe833174260e09","name":"Maczej","lastName":"Dutkievich","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e3409e6b-aa24-4cfb-a0e1-0688ae3f08d5"},{"objectId":"6839b8b3fdbe833174260e08","name":"Marta","lastName":"Maksymovych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9aba94e-a046-4580-8c04-9dc5294f6618"},{"objectId":"614d38299543c7051ff01d44","name":"Olesia","lastName":"Maksymovych","uuid":"8237418178D92B399647321733880F01F1DD3AB07547DF592F9619A210A1A68034F7CF5D2CED7A4198F8767756B47D3BDF23062A11FFAA71BB2A323E7BD26FC8","orcidId":"0000-0002-2892-7735","documentHash":"9c8df34a-7d7c-4ec6-b4cf-0a0d611c7005"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["turbine blade","anatomical model","helical gear","reverse engineering","accuracy","CAD modeling"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Expertise in measurement technology, data processing, and CAD modeling is required to ensure accurate reconstruction of an object’s geometry. However, errors are generated at every stage of geometric reconstruction, affecting the dimensional and geometric accuracy of the final 3D-CAD model. In this article, the geometry of reconstructed models was measured using contact and optical methods. The measurement data representing 2D profiles, 3D point clouds, and 2D images acquired in the reconstruction process were saved to a stereolithography (STL) model. The reconstructed models were then subjected to a CAD modeling process, and the accuracy of the parametric modeling was evaluated by comparing the 3D-CAD model to the 3D-STL model. Based on the results, the model used for clamping and positioning parts to perform the machining process and the connecting rod provided the most accurate mapping errors. These models represented deviations within ±0.02 mm and ±0.05 mm. The accuracy of CAD modeling for the turbine blade model and the pelvis part was comparable, presenting deviations within ±0.1 mm.

The aim is to analyze the effects of varying the tool rotational speed (rpm) and blind hole diameter on the wear and friction behavior of the produced composite. A pin-on disk test is conducted under dry conditions and room temperature to assess the tribological properties against steel. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) is employed to examine the worn and wear surfaces of the produced composites post test. The results indicate that increasing the applied load results in a decrease in the coefficient of friction (COF), with values ranging from 0.775 to 0.852 for 10 N and 0.607 to 0.652 for 20 N. Moreover, the wear rate diminishes with higher Al2O3 content and optimal FSP tool rotation (1280 rpm). Hardness analysis reveals variations between 33–42 HV and 35–39 HV, influenced by nanoparticle distribution. The composite demonstrates superior wear resistance compared to raw AA5754 aluminum due to its reinforced nature. However, high FSP tool rotation rates lead to abrasive wear and surface cracks. These findings offer insights into optimizing FSP parameters to enhance the tribological performance of nano-reinforced aluminum alloys."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943953","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839ba50fdbe83317426199c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"8","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"9fab1e26-ad05-447b-9835-256759521e97"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2504-477X/8/6/216","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba50fdbe8331742619a0","name":"M.

A geochemical anomaly of military origin was identified with an excess of the maximum permissible levels for the following chemical elements: Hg (57.1) > Сr (20.6) > Ni (9.6) > Cu (9.2) > Zn (5.3) > Pb (1.5)."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943957","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b7b2fdbe833174260692","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"25","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"580d0fcf-8267-48a5-8429-23e12e0959c5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"165-177","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.ecoeet.com/Geochemical-Anomalies-of-the-Heavy-Metals-in-the-Industrial-and-Urban-Agglomeration,177838,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b7b2fdbe833174260697","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Salamon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13d4f7dc-9c7a-4e27-85e5-b303df739b74"},{"objectId":"6839b7b2fdbe833174260696","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Mats","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2070fa5-b46a-4357-8aaf-fe22bbf10d62"},{"objectId":"6839b7b2fdbe833174260695","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Smyrnova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eefd5c63-0b38-447d-ba8f-dc29103d36a0"},{"objectId":"6839b7b2fdbe833174260694","name":"Olena","lastName":" Mitryasova ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"231a10bb-375f-48ff-8a99-0ab0d15a2642"},{"objectId":"6839b7b2fdbe833174260693","name":"Victor","lastName":"Smyrnov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e91c3396-5b77-4fb2-80a0-62dba1fcbb70"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a0473940f1","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Koszelnik","uuid":"CA1FC32B5302A69D9981415A96D718CD0C792153795772558F5C5F6EBE39C457DB33BE9B6A63FE9C9590E72D92E3151C9B0CB6B99DADDF8A8B92A0ED8CA135DD","orcidId":"0000-0001-6866-7432","documentHash":"8417df51-3887-4abf-bbb0-a4c12fd1ef13"}],"doi":"10.12912/27197050/177838"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bihyperbolic number","hyperbolic number","recurrence relation","Mersenne number"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This is a difficult task to accomplish. Therefore, procedures are being sought to combine these aspects in the process of product improvement. Therefore, the objective of the investigation was to develop a procedure that supports the integration of quality-level indicators and life-cycle assessment (LCA) to determine the direction of product improvement. The procedure involves determining the quality indicators based on the expectations of the customer, which are subsequently processed using the formalised scoring method (PS). A life-cycle assessment index is determined for the main environmental impact criterion. According to the proposed mathematical model, these indicators are aggregated, and this process takes into account their importance in terms of product usefulness and environmental friendliness. Interpretations of the results and the direction of product improvement are from the results obtained from the modified IPA model (importance–performance analysis). The procedure is used in the verification of product prototypes, wherein the proposed approach, and its test, was carried out for a self-cooling beverage can (and its alternatives) with a “chill-on-demand” system, which is a technology supporting rapid cooling on demand. The life-cycle assessment was carried out to assess the carbon footprint, which is crucial for activities to reduce greenhouse gases. The direction of improvement of this product was shown to concern the selection of transport means, the reduction of energy use in the production phase, or the change of the method of opening the can. What is original is the proposal of a procedure for integrating the quality indicator and the life-cycle assessment indicator, taking into account the key environmental burden. The procedure can be used in manufacturing companies when designing and improving products in terms of their sustainable development."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943960","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b927fdbe833174261192","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"12","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"fcd1d121-6325-4439-8a03-b209fbcf5e35"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/12/4/811","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.3390/pr12040811"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ammonium nitrogen","drinking water purification","nitrification","biofiltration"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Unconventional flow turned out to be more beneficial because it allows for optimal use of the entire bed surface, natural regulation of the biofilm thickness, and maintaining constant microbiological activity of the biofilm. The automatic regulation of the biofilm thickness during water flow prevented excessive growth of dead organic matter and limited the development of heterotrophic bacteria. Biofiltration with counter-gravity flow also resulted in reduced oxygen consumption. Regardless of the flow direction used, water after the single-stage biofiltration process was characterized by an increased content of nitrite nitrogen.

A special tribometer was designed and manufactured in order to simulate the friction phenomenon occurring in the blankholder area in deep drawing operations. Lubricant was supplied to the contact zone under pressure. The value of the coefficient of friction was determined under various contact pressures and lubrication conditions. Multi-layer artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict the value of the coefficient of friction. The input parameters considered were the kinematic viscosity of lubricants, contact pressure, lubricant pressure, selected mechanical properties and basic surface roughness parameters of sheet metals. The value of the coefficient of friction of 1.0312 steel sheets was predicted based on the results of friction tests on 1.0347 and 1.0338 steel sheets. Many ANN models were built to find a neural network that will provide the best prediction performance. It was found that to ensure a high performance of ANN prediction, it is necessary to simultaneously take into account all the considered roughness parameters (Sa, Ssk and Sku). The predictive performance of the ‘best’ network was greater than R2 = 0.98. The lubricant pressure had the greatest impact on the coefficient of friction. Increasing the value of this parameter reduces the value of the coefficient of friction. However, the greater the contact pressure, the smaller the beneficial effect of pressure-assisted lubrication. The third parameter of the friction process, the kinematic viscosity of the oil, exhibited the smallest impact on the coefficient of friction."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943964","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b7e7fdbe833174260829","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"12","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"d6c1b879-7b67-4d0e-a349-a0040a9e6054"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4442/12/2/50","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f8517f3085dcb410a25ed0c","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szewczyk","uuid":"061018F0B6B70D10386DF789993A8C9F85F31E1C6DC911651D81FEF167F6616F8FA2ECCB0824CA95C978F00D21407A46356B8C5EB18866928F35BC94F08681D3","orcidId":"0000-0002-3622-6613","documentHash":"aee1f202-2b71-49b9-ae8d-4b0b145c1e63"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szwajka","uuid":"BE3DBEF640820E864475437AEC4DB8978AE4FC0B4B3B99093CD4857E27DEEA7E923758AFBB9E791E11BF13C3EA626287D3C4FCE7C77FBDA928B5DCDAAE66EFFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1038-1148","documentHash":"60c70249-8eb8-40a1-ae88-4991b4235bad"}],"doi":"10.3390/lubricants12020050"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["reinforcement ratio","flexural concrete members","fracture parameters of concrete","scale effect","crack resistance","concrete structures"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

It is particularly important in the case of foundations working in changing subsoil conditions. Unfavorable phenomena occurring in the subsoil (e.g., ground subsidence, landslips, non-uniform settlement) can lead to unexpected cracking. Therefore, it is necessary to check the effectiveness of the low reinforcement provided. As there are limited studies on lightly reinforced concrete structures, we performed our own experimental investigation and numerical calculations. In the beams analyzed, the reinforcement ratio varied from 0.05% to 0.20%. It was found that crack resistance in concrete members depends on the reinforcement ratio and steel bar distribution. A comprehensive method was proposed for estimating the crack resistance of lightly reinforced concrete members in which both the reinforcement ratio and the reinforcement dispersion ratio were taken into account. Furthermore, the method considered the size effect and the fracture properties of concrete. The proposed method provides the basis for extrapolation of the test results obtained for small elements and conclusions for members with large cross-sections, such as foundations, which frequently use lightly reinforced concrete."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943966","journalIssue":{"objectId":"663c92f24097071b75834cf5","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"8c44bacb-ab3c-49cb-8b7e-f64e085668c3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/10/2197","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9abfdbe833174261528","name":"Maria","lastName":"Sulewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f0bb3fce-5061-490c-9678-ecad2cef5ee7"},{"objectId":"6839b9abfdbe833174261527","name":"Marta","lastName":"Słowik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b02b227-6c73-4833-a761-9230193ad276"},{"objectId":"6839b9abfdbe833174261526","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Błazik-Borowa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4edd5f94-dd73-4184-aa8a-0e7c44c597a0"},{"objectId":"5e7094ab878c28a0473c14fe","name":"Wanda","lastName":"Kokoszka","uuid":"83BDEEF808597CDFBDF26547D6D2F5B239093046D3AF0A0E65B666100B8F0DDAE658EAC93FE56310F457C0E67C0AEB7B8E6B5AF51CE54014E5E4DC34D1B68818","orcidId":"0000-0003-0486-9881","documentHash":"a0957fbb-b193-495d-a899-16921800873c"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395167","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Skrzypczak","uuid":"F5189F4E96A8D8A129324979637E54193BEB7D84E4B5DCE614EE6F5C584BD60754E848696A45D5264E0B46B19A4C0070FE22665984C9F669EB941AE878EC6145","orcidId":"0000-0003-0978-3040","documentHash":"62914bfa-210c-477f-bf6d-d5392dc0840f"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17102197"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["molecular sieves","phase-change composite","carbon recylate","heat storage","autonomous buildings"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The results proved an improvement in the heat storage efficiency of the heat accumulators due to the addition of carbon recyclate by 28%, while increasing the heat storage time by 134 min, and a reduction in PCM leakage due to the use of molecular silica sieves. In addition to its cognitive scientific value, another research objective of the work achieved was to obtain response functions in the form of approximating polynomials. They provide a useful, validated and verified tool to predict the physical and chemical characteristics of heat accumulators with different contents of individual components. As part of the ongoing research, technical problems related to leak-proofing assurance and matrix selection for organic phase-change materials were also solved.

End-users of these algorithms are interested in high values of the metrics as well as the proposed algorithm’s understandability and transparency. In this paper, a simple evolving vector quantization (SEVQ) algorithm is proposed, which is a novel supervised incremental learning classifier. Algorithms from the family of adaptive resonance theory and learning vector quantization inspired this method. Classifier performance was tested on 36 data sets and compared with 10 traditional and 15 incremental algorithms. SEVQ scored very well, especially among incremental algorithms, and it was found to be the best incremental classifier if the quality criterion is the AUC. The Scott–Knott analysis showed that SEVQ is comparable in performance to traditional algorithms and the leading group of incremental algorithms. The Wilcoxon rank test confirmed the reliability of the obtained results. This article shows that it is possible to obtain outstanding classification quality metrics while keeping the conceptual and computational simplicity of the classification algorithm."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943969","journalIssue":{"objectId":"660d2eda409707034655adba","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"34","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"12d30da1-b041-4e58-9b6a-edea875d51bf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"149-165","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.amcs.uz.zgora.pl/?action=paper&paper=1743","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b88cfdbe833174260cf2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Czmil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2f8b678-127c-400a-a711-a4d373c6bd4b"},{"objectId":"6839b88cfdbe833174260cf1","name":"Sylwester","lastName":"Czmil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17e67ca6-1840-4d88-b051-c092f1d4e6ed"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dc47","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kluska","uuid":"ED97B07FD04A3C0E5D0F4BCA74D5FB579CC48362914931BF81320603520F64D4CECB7ED782862D1A36F464F2607A4BA6CF1CC6C4E0DB937D6BEC77EF50F5C5B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7317-7734","documentHash":"9fb5ea9d-2533-4e88-8d0a-f111964a470e"}],"doi":"10.61822/amcs-2024-0011"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["stability loss","finite element method","torsion","critical load","thin-walled structures"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The method used was diagnostic survey, comparative analysis, and within the framework of data collection, the techniques of content analysis and desk research, which were integrally combined in the research procedure. The implementation of the analysis indicated that surveillance using sustainable development indicators is associated with difficulties (for example, gaps in the availability of standardized data and difficult access to adequate data) and generalizations and subjectivity. This analysis showed that the countries are successively striving to meet the provisions that are related to Goal 12. Estimates of the degree of achievement of the goal are adequate for the duration of the goal. Priority activities of the countries should focus on increasing the level of development of ecological agriculture, striving to increase the efficiency of use of available resources, changing the approach to available resources (moving away from linear development), and changing consumption patterns (increased development of a closed-loop economy). Future research areas will focus on analyzing the level of implications of the goals of Agenda 2030 in Poland and Slovakia and developing developmental forecasts for both countries."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943973","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6592b44b40970731baa3612e","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"eb8acf9f-be6d-4518-b4ec-aebf762e45b7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/1/195","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b724fdbe83317426028b","name":"Lucia","lastName":"Bednárová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"105649cf-40b4-4fa6-808a-a6e7b7bc5df4"},{"objectId":"6839b724fdbe83317426028a","name":"Rastislav","lastName":"Petrovský","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ca2bc12-fa9d-4546-a065-f06093fd0166"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b199b","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Czerwińska","uuid":"64CDB60500769BC1EF7D66A65C268878DC166F4ED13BCAAA0CC929A4C83EACBA5CD9A71C0B05643EE54D9B3C838E1D0E40373205A3815DF7DD7052EB763E1E8C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2150-0963","documentHash":"ee3ced10-96cf-4de4-9a16-0f1d6dc68ed6"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16010195"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

However, the extraction and processing of these resources can have severe ecological repercussions. Previous literature mainly evaluates the long-run ecological impacts of natural resources (NTR) and studies delving into the long-run ecological impacts of mineral resources in the context of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 12 & 13 are scant. Thus, this study assessed the environmental challenges associated with MNR and NTR by incorporating the measure of government stability (GNST) across ten emerging nations situated in the Global South, spanning the years from 1989 to 2020. The comprehensive load capacity factor (LCF) is employed as a proxy of ecological quality. After using the empirical methods robust to cross-sectional dependence (CSD), endogeneity, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity, this study unfolded the following long-run outcomes. Mineral resources lessen the LCF and thus, decrease the ecological quality. Likewise, natural resources diminish the LCF figures and exert detrimental impacts on the quality of the environment. Surprisingly, government stability intensifies ecological degradation. Furthermore, the study found the load capacity curve (LCC) in the member nations showing that higher development can uplift the LCF. Finally, a policy framework based on the SDGs is proposed to ensure the sustainability of MNR and NTR."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943975","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a25bee4097071218b34249","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"88","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e316e67a-792b-4ad9-80e3-e9ae579ee93b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301420723012187","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b731fdbe8331742602d7","name":"Yanlan","lastName":"Yong","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"add8e263-491a-446d-95a8-bad6faaaa89a"},{"objectId":"6839b731fdbe8331742602d6","name":"Zahoor","lastName":"Ahmed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a24670a-598d-436d-92f9-4177218f99fb"},{"objectId":"6839b731fdbe8331742602d5","name":"Shaohui","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f28db95-c6f4-4f70-a248-2bf23c4cc0b3"},{"objectId":"6839b731fdbe8331742602d4","name":"Husam","lastName":"Rjoub","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6899362b-aaf8-44c7-8cac-f5ec57732767"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a018","name":"YURIY","lastName":"BILAN","uuid":"AEA595284BF2D10689C55DA1D532510D84B833C50A8D36C4E476ED44E908E98ABC42FAD57C43A323B3AF2E1ACA676BAF519A01E6ADD37EDC5E46BF93B79B1E3E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0268-009X","documentHash":"304f8a94-c91f-4bca-a33b-1d413ef4a687"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2023.104507"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fracture toughness","Pyrowear 53 steel","Low pressure carburization","Small punch test"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Firstly, Pyrowear 53 steel was quenched and tempered using different processing parameters to obtain core materials with varied microstructures and fracture toughness. The results obtained for the core material in standard fracture toughness tests were then compared with the SPT results, which allowed the determination of a formula correlating the fracture energy integral, JSPT, from the SPT with JQ integrals obtained from standardized compact tension specimens. In the next stage, Pyrowear 53 steel was carburized at 925 °C and divided into the following zones: (1) a carburized layer (up to 0.5 mm from the surface), (2) a transition layer (from 0.5 to 1.5 mm), and (3) a core zone (more than 1.5 mm). Each zone was characterized in terms of its microstructure and tensile properties using miniaturized test specimens. Finally, the fracture toughness values of the core zone (JSPT = 78–102 kJ/m2), the transition layer (JSPT = 71–80 kJ/m2), and the carburized layer (JSPT = 8.1–9.1 kJ/m2) were determined based on the obtained SPT results. It was shown that the use of such a relatively simple SPT method with the proposed energy-based approach seems to be a promising way of determining the fracture toughness of thin layers or local changes in the fracture behavior of surface-treated materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943976","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6662d4404097075bc10e1f60","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"73288568-08bf-47ce-ba7d-8c0fd0d53b32"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43452-024-00992-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba6afdbe833174261a69","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Pakieła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a042403-db82-4f5b-a5fa-6257464e451d"},{"objectId":"6839ba6afdbe833174261a68","name":"Anna","lastName":"Dobkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"60c705a2-bb45-461d-bcb5-c50721e47d48"},{"objectId":"6839ba6afdbe833174261a67","name":"Monika","lastName":"Wieczorek-Czarnocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58c5802b-c44a-4a6a-833e-343ee02dfda0"},{"objectId":"6839ba6afdbe833174261a66","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Majchrowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"312afc95-76e6-4989-9642-adb84c2c4790"},{"objectId":"6839ba6afdbe833174261a65","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Raga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b876dc1c-0ebe-4b11-8e9b-fe7d3b02dc88"},{"objectId":"6839ba6afdbe833174261a64","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Romelczyk-Baishya","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f161a5a2-9825-4353-9ace-348d252f5542"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951e8","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Filip","uuid":"84D4C30DA1AD8B2C822CE7113057DB9EECC5A33B38551937228815873F1669EE6480D4D94F1153AEBC01841D50D381FD064D70BADC86F5C8A6C5C4CD7EB373D9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3863-8504","documentHash":"73bbaf63-9ea6-47d9-9da3-bdb48b9cddc9"}],"doi":"10.1007/s43452-024-00992-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["X153CrMoV12","X-ray research","X165CrV12","Plasma Nitriding","tool steel"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The processes were carried out under industrial conditions using an Ionit system (Oerlikon Metaplas) with variable process times of 2, 4 and 6 hours.

This research is part of the contemporary trend of research aimed at reducing the impact of aviation on the natural environment. The analyzed propulsion system consists of turbine engines and electric motors cooperating with them. In this work, on the basis of data from flight tests, the energy requirement for the aircraft to perform the intended mission was determined. On this basis, fuel consumption and the corresponding pollutant emissions were determined for an aircraft with a traditional power unit. For comparison, an aircraft with a hybrid propulsion system with the same mass as an aircraft with a traditional propulsion system was used. Then, energy consumption, fuel consumption and emission of CO2, CO, NOx, VOC, PM10 and PM2.5 were obtained for both aircraft variants. The most important results of the conducted research include a reduction in CO2 emissions by 23% and NOx emissions by 46% in the case of the hybrid propulsion. This indicates potential benefits of using hybrid propulsion in aviation."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943980","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a8e4cb4097071977e122fc","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"18","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"a1b6653c-c562-4e06-aacf-759b764a8abe"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"155-166","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Performance-and-Emission-of-the-Aircraft-with-Hybrid-Propulsion-During-Take-Off-Operation,177254,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b7bdfdbe833174260703","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Pawlak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"476adf50-ad53-45e2-be3c-6cbbe6a56cb5"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c42b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kuźniar","uuid":"6E5C9B273BBBE3DFE38A2E8AC64D78E000FCE8332BF38D0C6ED5DF3D1FC25DB9866F39EEA3FE8DFDE7EF269F06F4D28BC72BECB7265F6EAB8376143B335747C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-8401-8846","documentHash":"3f5b1f08-0fb9-47bc-9fb0-51413a4e35b1"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/177254"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["powder coating properties","polyacrylate resin","low-temperature coatings"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

For this purpose, a wide range of monomers were selected—2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), methyl methacrylate (MMA), n-butyl acrylate (nBA), tert-butyl acrylate (tBA), dodecyl acrylate (DA), ethyl acrylate (EA) and benzyl acrylate (BAZ)—for the synthesis of the polyacrylate resin. The average molecular mass and molecular mass distribution of the synthesized resins were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The glass transition temperature (Tg) and viscosity of polyacrylate resins were determined by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and a Brookfield viscometer. These parameters were necessary to obtain information about storage stability and behavior during the application of powder clear coatings. Additionally, DSC was also used to checked the course of the low-temperature curing reaction between the hydroxyl group contained in the polyacrylate resin and the blocked polyisocyanate group derived from a commercial agent such as Vestanat B 1358/100. The properties of the cured powder clear coatings were tested, such as: roughness, gloss, adhesion to the steel surface, hardness, cupping, scratch resistance, impact resistance and water contact angle. The best powder clear coating based on the polyacrylate resin L_HEMA/6MMA/0.5nBA/0.5DA was characterized as having good scratch resistance (550 g) and adhesion to the steel surface, a high water contact angle (93.53 deg.) and excellent cupping (13.38 mm). Moreover, its crosslinking density (CD) and its thermal stability was checked by using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943982","journalIssue":{"objectId":"660524c64097076263326f17","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"0620dc44-68f3-402f-9a58-22a8bab6dd2d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/7/1655","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f85558f085dcb410a25ed7f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pojnar","uuid":"68C4C90B6C82F1CA01A9CCC5747A019398BE9459FF634D1281FE126D4643B237CE912A4141644CA8919C9C77D9C2FB2A4381EA01CE27067E1748AFBC3028F23B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d675dda1-d706-49ce-96e9-ad5ebe350435"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5c7","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Pilch-Pitera","uuid":"76CFF847B5081CA0D4FD7E98D43018CFE47E196F0A3ECEB67CF328187460307F010360F6F0DE0ECA6259565F7C0DB624A8894F7C261EE3B2A8CBF08A6FB5B0E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2412-2219","documentHash":"1e584fb2-c2be-451a-a749-274c1dd1a339"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17071655"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["UHF","capacitive sensors","active identifier","capacity measurement","RFID","semi-passive identifier","textronics","textronic RFID identifier","textronic sensors"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The decline in Russia's importance enabled the U.S. to achieve world supremacy for two decades, but since the beginning of the 21st century there has also been a very rapid rise in China's power. The purpose of the article is to explain the reasons for the country's growth in recent decades, based on analyses of its geopolitical position, as determined by synthetic measures of power, particularly by the Mirosław Sułek model, as well as available rankings. China's position calculated on the basis of synthetic measures indicated that China, in all categories of power in the 21st century, ranked first or second in the world. No other country has achieved such a position in the 21st century except the US and China. It is worth noting that in terms of economic/general power, Beijing has already surpassed Washington in 2017. In the other models presented for the 2019-23 power categories, China also ranked very high. In contrast, the selected rankings present an overall low position of the Middle Kingdom."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943987","journalIssue":{"objectId":"660401d04097072a77fc92a4","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"47","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"4e81ef8a-6ba5-4ab6-b45b-edcd4fbf8125"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"63-79","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://przeglad.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/XLVII-04-Surowiec.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709416878c28a0473b5fd1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Surowiec","uuid":"AEDBD0E29624A04EA5A1F26B6517FCB3D8CCD166199BA1ECFE56F287B8D19105620C5605C188F6D5CF076909360293A84C69FB98556A7773F9F72A13E8E282A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-6298-2260","documentHash":"374a87f2-220f-4525-b1fd-4f236bdb1f7b"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The authors invented a method and built a special tribometer for pressure-assisted lubrication. This approach reduces friction in sheet metal forming processes compared to conventional lubrication. Moreover, the artificial neural network approach combined with a force-directed Fruchterman-Reingold graph algorithm and Spearman’s correlation was used for the first time to analyse the relationships between the friction process parameters and the output parameters (the coefficient of friction and the resulting surface roughness of the sheet metal). The experimental tests were conducted utilising strip drawing on four grades of steel sheets known to be outstanding for deep-drawing quality. Different oils, oil pressures and contact pressures were used. Artificial neural network models were used for the first time to determine these relationships in a strip drawing test where every parameter is represented by one node, and all nodes are connected by edges with each other. R Software version 4.2.3 was used to construct the network using the ‘qgraph’ and ‘networktools’ packages. It was found that friction conditions had a highly significant negative correlation with coefficient of friction (COF) and a moderately significant negative correlation with the final surface roughness. However, the initial surface roughness of the as-received sheets had a negative correlation with the COF and a positive one with the resulting surface roughness of the sheet metal. The parameters most related to the COF are the strength coefficient, the ultimate tensile strength and the friction conditions (dry friction or pressurised lubrication). Spearman’s correlation coefficients showed a strong correlation between the kinematic viscosity and the friction conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943991","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b920fdbe83317426115a","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"132","number":"7-8","doi":null,"documentHash":"7183e01c-7e2f-4c9e-a587-6bdfdc4f4bba"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"3757-3769","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-024-13565-0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b920fdbe83317426115c","name":"Sherwan Mohammed","lastName":"Najm","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1c645c8-bb49-4035-afd6-88513a319ba8"},{"objectId":"6839b920fdbe83317426115b","name":"Omar Maghawry","lastName":"Ibrahim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1c3955ce-0c55-4f26-8dc6-455f54fe04af"},{"objectId":"5f8517f3085dcb410a25ed0c","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szewczyk","uuid":"061018F0B6B70D10386DF789993A8C9F85F31E1C6DC911651D81FEF167F6616F8FA2ECCB0824CA95C978F00D21407A46356B8C5EB18866928F35BC94F08681D3","orcidId":"0000-0002-3622-6613","documentHash":"aee1f202-2b71-49b9-ae8d-4b0b145c1e63"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szwajka","uuid":"BE3DBEF640820E864475437AEC4DB8978AE4FC0B4B3B99093CD4857E27DEEA7E923758AFBB9E791E11BF13C3EA626287D3C4FCE7C77FBDA928B5DCDAAE66EFFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1038-1148","documentHash":"60c70249-8eb8-40a1-ae88-4991b4235bad"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00170-024-13565-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["renewable energy","fossil fuels","energy efficiency","Energy policy","modern technologies"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Model tests and numerical analyses were used to simulate the loading of hybrid piles in sand. The results of pile-soil interaction were investigated to confirm the changes in soil stiffness around the hybrid monopile head. The mechanism and factors affecting the change in lateral stiffness of the hybrid foundation were explained by analysing p–y curves for M+H loading conditions in sand. Based on this research, a new shape of p–y curves for hybrid monopiles was established and a method for determining key parameters was proposed. The effectiveness of new p–y curves was verified by comparing back-calculated results with those from numerical simulations. The conducted tests confirmed that the hybrid monopile displacement is 30–50% smaller when compared to a standard monopile with similar dimensions. The gained experiences can be useful for designers and researchers to enhance the design of foundations for offshore wind turbines."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943994","journalIssue":{"objectId":"660baca540970773c9acaeef","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"70","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"105e42d5-0296-4502-a20e-ca88967ca917"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"5-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/148897/edition/130757/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395162","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Trojnar","uuid":"CA43EFA6DD3D6BA13977B7ED2210C562E9DD0984CFAEFA6A24D9263F544E4A0D1E7880CAC8E076C40EE32D69A87EC1FF8B8B4C5357CCDFFF024596AD19256B5B","orcidId":"0000-0002-4550-4670","documentHash":"12f03f17-53bd-4a24-b879-b50719af11e0"}],"doi":"10.24425/ace.2024.148897"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["epoxy resin","cross-linking","epoxy composite","liquid crystal","hardener","nanofiller","liquid crystal epoxy resin"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The presented method of manufacturing process analysis integrates a number of tools (SMART method, brainstorming, BOST analysis, 3 × 3 metrics) that enable the implementation of statistical analysis. The model developed makes it possible to apply known mathematical methods in areas new to them (adaptation in the manufacturing area), which makes it possible to use scientific information in a new way. The versatility of the method allows it to be used in manufacturing companies to identify critical factors in manufacturing processes. A test of the developed method was carried out in one of the foundry enterprises, which allowed us to build a series of importance factors affecting effective production management. The methodology is addressed to the management of manufacturing enterprises as a method to assist in analyzing data and building (on the basis of improved manufacturing processes) a competitive strategy."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646943998","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b9024d4097073f66061b89","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"f936a2d5-df73-4b7b-bcbf-82888d3f3a32"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/12/2/401","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b199b","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Czerwińska","uuid":"64CDB60500769BC1EF7D66A65C268878DC166F4ED13BCAAA0CC929A4C83EACBA5CD9A71C0B05643EE54D9B3C838E1D0E40373205A3815DF7DD7052EB763E1E8C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2150-0963","documentHash":"ee3ced10-96cf-4de4-9a16-0f1d6dc68ed6"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.3390/pr12020401"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bifacial modules","solar module","photovoltaic","high-latitude photovoltaics","silicon modules","solar cell"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Badania nad modelami przestrzennej struktury miasta mają kluczowe znaczenie dla skuteczności i efektywności decyzji urbanistycznych i polityki przestrzennej. W ramach badań przeprowadzono analizę urbanistyczną Lublina, aby określić kluczowe elementy i relacje tworzące jego miejski układ. Celem naukowym pracy jest modelowa interpretacja struktury przestrzenno-funkcjonalnej Lublina, nazwanej za Zuziakem konstrukcją urbanistyczną, jako propozycja potencjalnego narzędzia ułatwiającego sterowanie rozwojem miasta.

Remediation methods include repair, renovation, and replacement (renewal). The restoration of a sewer network itself can be performed using either excavation or trenchless technologies. While these technologies offer various advantages, they also present disadvantages. The choice of a restoration technology depends on numerous parameters, including economic factors and local conditions (such as the construction of the existing sewage network, available working space, traffic load, and environmental safety restrictions). In addition to the parameters influencing the choice of restoration technology, recent considerations have been given to constraints related to greenhouse gas emissions and the corresponding carbon footprint. Carbon footprint serves as an indicator of the restoration activity’s dependence on fossil fuels, both during implementation and operation. In the 21st century, concerns regarding carbon footprints have rapidly escalated. The reduction in carbon footprints is a crucial objective from both an economic and an ecological point of view. This article specifically addresses the prospects of monitoring the carbon footprint concerning the partial restoration of a sewer network within the historical core of the city of Brno, located in the Czech Republic. This aspect constitutes the unique and innovative contribution of the paper. The intensity of the energy demand of excavation and trenchless technologies is utilized as a direct measure of the carbon footprint of each technology. The comparative assessment demonstrates that the trenchless technology used achieves a reduction of 59.2% in CO2 emissions compared to the excavation technology. The carbon footprint of Variant 1 (trenchless technology) is 9.91 t CO2 eq., while the carbon footprint of Variant 2 (excavation technology) is 24.29 t CO2 eq. The restoration of open pipelines produces more emissions due to the higher energy consumption, making it more expensive in terms of fuel costs, waste disposal costs, and the corresponding environmental hazards."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944007","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b769fdbe833174260466","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"4532f781-a439-42be-ac75-cc790395cc84"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/13/1/12","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b769fdbe83317426046b","name":"Sarka","lastName":"Keprdova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ab2a636-bb85-4e17-8047-c3996861b1db"},{"objectId":"6839b769fdbe83317426046a","name":"Tomáš","lastName":"Chorazy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cdfcfd64-b1e5-4c47-b95b-5c182b8d4eee"},{"objectId":"6839b769fdbe833174260469","name":"Petr","lastName":"Hlavínek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"daf29d66-1d1a-4fc0-9991-b5bfaecc3ba0"},{"objectId":"6839b769fdbe833174260468","name":"Zdenek","lastName":"Dufek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a71e13b1-09c3-4023-bae4-86f078bb00f5"},{"objectId":"6839b769fdbe833174260467","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Raček","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48e140ce-0c38-4c28-9a28-3a32aacfc0a8"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d544","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pietrucha-Urbanik","uuid":"DFC9DAC77D8097EBE201B0B34C091D77E9A5D6EA793E18C56806CF09F352AE474828F0A81BEEFA6E4734FC68088215E52A35255D68502DD41E008719B555B6A3","orcidId":"0000-0003-1160-9009","documentHash":"de30c622-ee97-4ddf-9061-4093b2d60239"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395180","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Tchórzewska-Cieślak","uuid":"31517EB08996F702EB5F7823934403759EA9C6E0C2CD590ED2C7B177BB9FBFA169EEBBF7035ED231BEB2618AAC7BDB1B14F68EAB365CB808B5FD7547ABD94DF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7622-6749","documentHash":"d69d4236-1fb6-4956-aa38-762a24cde6c3"}],"doi":"10.3390/resources13010012"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["USA","GDP","Renewable Energy Consumption","water productivity","food production index","total land resources"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Existing research focuses on emerging and developing countries, primarily centering on the initial objectives of sustainable development. To bridge this literature gap, our research delves into the nexus of WPROD, FPI, and total land resources (TLRS). Additionally, the study explores the persuasive roles of income (GDP) and renewable energy consumption (REC). Employing time series methodologies, we utilize the DF-GLS unit root assessment to assess the variable static method and the Bayer-Hanck test to scrutinize long-term equilibrium. The primary analysis employs the least squares approach with breakpoints, supplemented by the Robust least squares method for validation. For causal relationships between variables, we deployed the Granger causality approach. Our outcomes disclose that variables are static at the first difference, indicating long-run equilibrium among all variables. Empirical outcomes suggest a resource curse associated with TLRS, as it negatively influences both WPROD and FPI, regardless of breaks. The increase in coefficients of land resources by 1% causes decrease in water productivity and food production by −0.35% and −0.185%. In contrast, GDP and renewable energy positively impact water productivity and food production index, even in the presence of structural breaks.

The dynamics of tool wear were determined based on changes in the components of the total cutting force, microscopic observation of wear on the flank surface, and observation of wear based on SEM images. The condition of the technological surface layer was also determined in the form of changes in the microstructure morphology and hardening of the surface layer. The research was compared to a reference tool with the same geometry with an AlTiN coating. It was shown, among other things, that TiBW coatings can be used successfully for cutting tools for machining nickel alloys, and that the wear dynamic is similar to those of tools with the AlTiN coating. The analyses confirmed the significant thermomechanical impact of the cutter during machining, manifested by chipping and a tendency to strengthen the processed material. Based on observations of the microstructure of the surface layer after processing, it was shown that the thermal conductivity of the TiBW coating may be lower than that of the AlTiN coating, which is reflected in the different depths of the thermomechanical interaction zones."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944019","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ced47bfdbe83617c4adfc2","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"123","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"3462dac9-6595-4ef1-a0b7-7922260a6475"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"23-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.prz.edu.pl/tiam/article/view/1659","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9a6fdbe833174261501","name":"Anna","lastName":"Skroban","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71eccf55-ae8a-4fbd-93db-681bf5053e6a"},{"objectId":"6839b9a6fdbe833174261500","name":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Karkalos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9acf8795-3f27-499d-b247-a79f846f20c6"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c4e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Tymczyszyn","uuid":"BF9B0FB4D607D17BE8FE312F109C3960A0516AF53535E2D5FB2E8A8B7B9324D3185636BC120E20250A5A157A1893F60429672C3A30545E9572F6A35583ABF861","orcidId":"0000-0003-2972-5112","documentHash":"15b09549-db8a-4125-9428-3d3824337323"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395218","name":"Witold","lastName":"Habrat","uuid":"6660E4057D716A6050E2A6B3C181E85240000839CE4B0840F631E6A96AB8CBD99B7080C3ABF6858875D2BB9455CA9D89E6A6C0C0FBB86A4AF5F2485F136F0216","orcidId":"0000-0002-9010-8175","documentHash":"ba4623b9-6e2d-4fb8-b4d4-ba52acce3f31"}],"doi":"10.7862/tiam.2024.1.4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Renewable Energy Consumption","Newly industrialized countries","COP27","Gold prices","Fossil fuel costs"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This study establishes a novel theoretical framework to analyze the role of energy prices, energy consumption, gold prices and economic growth on environmental degradation in newly industrialized economies. To realize sustainable development goals and foster environmental defence, this study utilizes CS-ARDL as the main econometric approach to investigate the asymmetric association between environmental degradation and relevant factors. We also use AMG, CS-DL, Driscoll-Kray and FGLS to enhance the robustness of our findings. Our econometric approach reveals that energy resource prices and renewable energy consumption reduce environmental degradation, while gold prices and fossil energy consumption elevate environmental pollutants.

The numerical modeling of pressure-assisted warm forming of Ti-6Al-4V sheets with combined oil-heating and friction stir rotation-assisted heating of the workpiece is presented in this article. The thermo-mechanical FE-based numerical model took into account the characteristics of the mechanical properties of the sheet along with the temperature. The experimental conditions were replicated in FEM simulations conducted in Abaqus/Explicit, which incorporated boundary conditions and evaluated various mesh sizes for enhanced accuracy and efficiency. The simulation outcomes were compared with actual experimental results to validate the FE-based model’s predictive capacity. The maximum temperature of the tool measured using infrared camera was approximately 326 °C. Different mesh sizes were considered. The results of FEM modeling were experimentally validated based on axial forming force and thickness distribution measured using the ARGUS optical measuring system for non-contact acquisition of deformations. The greatest agreement between FEM results and the experimental result of the axial component of forming force was obtained for finite elements with a size of 1 mm. The maximum values of the axial component of forming force determined experimentally and numerically differ by approximately 8%. The variations of the forming force components and thickness distribution predicted by FEM are in good agreement with experimental measurements. The numerical model overestimated the wall thickness with an error of approximately 5%. By focusing on the heating techniques applied to Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy sheet, this comparative analysis underlines the adaptability and precision of numerical analysis applied in modeling advanced manufacturing processes."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944023","journalIssue":{"objectId":"667aaa6f409707681dcb0f09","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"060834f6-56ec-4320-a0c2-b715aadfa209"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/6/619","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f8533ce085dcb410a25ed43","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Szpunar","uuid":"3E602485A1F30818A608E2A7988D7490E22F1C7CDBDE8861F5FB965A141B1C79ED1044B2A51E2E29D4DCF07A39999BBDB6614C730DBDA86B99EFD22C942E8432","orcidId":"0000-0003-1580-5357","documentHash":"bef1dca6-175c-4e08-9453-cd809fb8a5f1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d58f","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":"390306FF93E6180C7BEA404074409E570FEEB33FEAD83C3547B020829AE9AAE9566A478C7EF36B10374546DA8F84D5F99C47FCAAD722BFABAB730B2AB0881EC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-1702-0767","documentHash":"33a66e49-4a34-416d-89cc-a4f873374871"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f0","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Ziaja","uuid":"F09EAB27C318EA1D537A8CD10AC15527AC4C3048617AE05303861DEC57760247B3216674720F60CB27B827103E10B3317CE5889F78403195856A9B1240A9C675","orcidId":"0000-0003-4591-4108","documentHash":"98e136a5-104b-440e-a98f-caafc8fec367"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951eb","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Motyka","uuid":"4169CB0AFD8FF622A18F0D8879B0346552EF5FB8F39FB3AA064BDCED2D1D8BE902E26AC0C793BC26E0F4ADF3C1377159D8AA6EDDC5C3498AA91D0F5D97A5F20A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9127-2487","documentHash":"618b740a-5fac-45e2-b4e0-428fc9fba79e"}],"doi":"10.3390/met14060619"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ultrasound resistance spot welding","Low-cycle fatigue","metal-plastic composites","High-cycle fatigue","Steel-polymer-steel"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The separation and decomposition of the polymer core was also illustrated, with no observed diffusion between the Litecor covers and the polypropylene core. Fatigue tests were the main goal of this work, therefore a fatigue curve was determined and the mechanisms of fatigue failure at various levels of fatigue load were analyzed. The tests were carried out at a frequency of 30 Hz, the cycle asymmetry coefficient was R = 0.1 and the limit number of cycles was 2 × 106. Fatigue failure mechanisms specific to particular levels of fatigue load were demonstrated, which were: 2.2, 1.9, 1.5, 1.2, and 1 kN. For joints subjected to fatigue shear has been demonstrated that the boundary between low-cycle and high-cycle fatigue is located at a cyclic shear stress level of approximately 132 MPa. However, with the assumed limit number of fatigue cycles, the fatigue shear strength was 70.576 MPa. Macro- and microscopic fractographic analysis was carried out for joints after fatigue tests in order to demonstrate the mechanisms of failure at individual levels of cyclic load."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944025","journalIssue":{"objectId":"667d3c60fdbe8301716fef06","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"201","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"9ffbfe06-3db1-4cd6-a2f7-d82283a63562"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026382312400435X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba10fdbe83317426180c","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Korzeniowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2060fdfb-e05a-4e5c-a400-37d189353e94"},{"objectId":"6839ba10fdbe83317426180b","name":"Hamed Aghajani","lastName":"Derazkola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f84121c8-b01a-45eb-8fd2-c7cf904ed646"},{"objectId":"6839ba10fdbe83317426180a","name":"Koen","lastName":"Faes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"87e57c4f-abb2-41bd-8312-c6f54ee6d54d"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.tws.2024.111992"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The engine is integrated into a circuit with the highest and unregulated flow of internal circuit coolant (ICC). All heat exchangers are placed in circulation circuits with relatively reduced and adjustable ICC flow rates. While the circuits are usually interconnected, they can also be designed to operate independently. This CS scheme enables the achievement of the minimum possible value of the sum of masses of exchanger cores, denoted as MΣ. The reduction in MΣ is achieved through the regulation of ICC flow in a closed circulation loop involving two heat exchangers. The variations in MΣ based on the circuit parameters have been thoroughly investigated. The reduction in MΣ can also be applicable to more intricate systems. A decrease in MΣ, under identical initial CS parameters, may occur in different magnitudes, depending on the specific features of the CS scheme and the operating conditions of the heat exchangers within it. Cooling systems, constructed with the same initial parameters and comprising multiple circulation circuits that meet all criteria for rational design, may exhibit diverse configurations.

The motivation for this research stems from the increasing concern about environmental pollution caused by organic pollutants, such as Brilliant Cresyl Blue (BCB), and the necessity for sustainable solutions to mitigate this issue. Through comprehensive characterization techniques including Ultraviolet–Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), zeta potential measurements, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis, we demonstrate a significant modification to the electronic structure, enhancing the photocatalytic activity of Cu2O/AA. BET analysis revealed a mesoporous structure with a specific surface area of 2.7247 m2/g for Cu2O/AA, further emphasizing its potential for enhanced catalytic performance. The photocatalytic degradation studies showcased remarkable efficiency improvements, with degradation coefficients of 30.8% and 73.12% for Cu2O NPs and Cu2O/AA NC, respectively, within a 120 min timeframe. Additionally, recyclability experiments indicated sustained efficiency over five consecutive cycles, with both catalysts retaining crystalline integrity. These findings underscore the promising potential of Cu2O/AA nanoparticles as highly efficient and recyclable photocatalysts for the degradation of organic pollutants, offering superior performance compared to pure Cu2O NPs and addressing the pressing need for sustainable water treatment solutions."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944032","journalIssue":{"objectId":"663c92f24097071b75834cf5","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"8c44bacb-ab3c-49cb-8b7e-f64e085668c3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/10/2358","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9bffdbe8331742615c7","name":"Abderrhmane","lastName":"Bouafia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc17001c-1469-46d9-a6cb-d3a1130270de"},{"objectId":"6839b9bffdbe8331742615c6","name":"Salah Eddine","lastName":"Laouini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70164c05-bbb5-44f0-a4a9-5185238c8019"},{"objectId":"6839b9bffdbe8331742615c5","name":"Saad","lastName":"Zeghdi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84060298-bee9-4f06-987e-e1878d56da79"},{"objectId":"6839b9bffdbe8331742615c4","name":"Mahmood M.

Design/methodology/approach: The starting point was to analyse the literature using the method of systematic review described in the first part of a series of articles. It identified proposed analysis methods and techniques for determining organisation context. The next step in the research procedure led to a comprehensive model for organisation context analysis using these methods. Findings: The analysis of the organisation's context in the strategic management perspective focuses mainly on methods such as SWOT analysis and PEST analysis (sometimes extended by extracting additional factors for PESTEL analysis). The quality management perspective focuses on identifying customer requirements and substantiating stakeholders' needs. In contrast, the integrated perspective involves combining strategic and qualitative management methods for a comprehensive analysis of the organisation's context. Originality/value: The research provides knowledge on designing the process of organisation context analysis for the requirements of ISO 9001:2015. It contributes to the development of a proprietary model for organisation context analysis using the methods identified in the course of the systematic literature review process. Not only will the use of the model help meet the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 at a minimum level, but it will also enable organisations to properly prepare for market operations and improve skills to respond to changes in the environment."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944034","journalIssue":{"objectId":"665eb98c4097073a823cbea5","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"196","doi":null,"documentHash":"a8787836-0127-4720-a22b-f15c5de892f2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"139-149","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/196-Dziedzic-Warmi%C5%84ska-Wyrwa.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d67d","name":"Agata","lastName":"Warmińska","uuid":"9959C124E5C66DE5866517310EEFA07E1C771066B58B0F01E5F96FB7764FFB3CE888ECED8C0D63846DA26CE4A24F0EA2A93C5BA8B3973D8AE42E0ADF1571D617","orcidId":"0000-0002-3283-4881","documentHash":"2889c6a1-1b6b-4b49-aa7b-0013dc427e69"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d626","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Dziedzic","uuid":"5E53B070F2340C8A95810710298CD6266B69F351D4601316C9D3CF08CE75A1429556E87155446CD24686126A2CB363537B4C9FEA7925DD9998A63DC835985B40","orcidId":"0000-0002-3852-5609","documentHash":"f4db5a50-0014-4489-bc44-570ce65a437c"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395260","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wyrwa","uuid":"81E176BD0FDE361563F193CBFFCD1C146BA8608B082082653F3D8F85B857B1A34CB7766E1EF5970FFCA350178039E1D632811A77FAC24448AEEBA6F9087BFEE2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1327-795X","documentHash":"05490b69-2bd2-46f4-ad1b-749fa02f443f"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.196.9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lightning","Lightning location systems","Neural networks","Machine learning","Lightning electric field registration"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Effective neural network learning verified for a small lightning event dataset but with whole 2-seconds particular record length is an important feature of fast and efficient procedures implemented into lightning location systems among which discrimination between cloud-to-ground and intra-cloud lightning is one of the most important task. Measurement data obtained at the Lightning Observatory in Rzeszow were used for the analysis. About 100 extremely low/medium frequency bandwidth electric field of cloud-to ground lightning registrations and the same number of intra-cloud lightning events were taken into account. During the study 81% of those registrations were dedicated for learning of neural networks while the remaining 19% were put into the testing set. All data were preselected manually with consideration of the electric field variation and information from the lightning location system database. Lightning events were selected uniformly with the well-pronounced presence of their basic components and reported distance to the registration station which ensured a wide variation of expected lightning electric field signatures. The multilayer perceptron neural network, the radial basis function neural network and the convolutional neural network were tested and compared in different configurations while distinguishing lightning. The results were compared with other conventional classification approaches, such as traditional machine learning methods as well as one a little more contemporary architecture, the long short-term memory neural network. The multilayer perceptron neural network achieved the best detection accuracy overall. Presented research is an extension of lightning identification studies available so far mainly based on the convolutional neural network by the results achieved using the multilayer perceptron neural network, the radial basis function neural network, the long short-term memory neural network and several machine learning-based classification methods."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944036","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b964fdbe83317426134a","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"159","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d8a4d187-bdff-4764-94ef-14108d3ec23f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494624004174","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d563","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Karnas","uuid":"B250F65B8F054C4DFAC47BD9F5B5C0793F758A33104371BEE638EE8ABE329DA14C8969F4C287C109EB6A4F22E04CC5F45A0E5F3161B0C3464CF39DBC92653F45","orcidId":"0000-0002-2255-5926","documentHash":"b234729a-06f4-4674-9ec8-394f4b0c03b6"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951d5","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Masłowski","uuid":"590E14BB3CD02582700EC444795B868566262CE559289B7F7FE31F518B8AD279346FDBA0319D36B52D807610894B0AB636D9EB2714A0E1A16762EB36C2A4F785","orcidId":"0000-0003-0028-1319","documentHash":"ad6c4c0f-0f2c-4c42-9312-f4ae4107b0a6"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047392f34","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Drałus","uuid":"6F81AD42DC594F5A6A8F3370A9063A79ED27DFB3E3ED87EBB529D19D102296DC418D58CF31CCE1074B91B44418CE658334CE67676A81B8779B487C1B6E590A18","orcidId":"0000-0001-7963-8602","documentHash":"0a288a2c-4647-4e32-905c-539288293da4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2024.111643"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["kinetyka azotowania","azotowanie plazmowe","stal narzędziowa","obróbka cieplna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Plasma Nitriding","heat treatment","kinetic of nitriding","tool steel"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Cold-work tool steels (60WCrV8, 90MnCrV8, 145Cr6), hot-work tool steel (X37CrMoV5-1) and high-speed tool steel (HS6-5-2) were selected as substrate material. The processes were carried out under industrial conditions using an Ionit device from Oerlikon Metaplas with variable process times of 2, 4 and 6 hours. According to literature data, a nitriding mixture consisting of 5% nitrogen and 95% hydrogen was chosen, which allowed the expected diffusion layer to be obtained without a white layer (composed of iron nitrides). Analysis of elemental mapping indicates that the presence and content of nitride-forming elements influences the formation of alloy additive nitrides in the microstructure of the diffusion layer. It was also found that an increase in the duration of plasma nitriding, results in an increase in the depth of the nitrided layers formed on the substrate of high-alloy steels: X37CrMoV5-1 and HS6-5-2. Nitrides of alloying additives, present in the diffusion layer, are formed in the high-alloyed the hot-work steel X37CrMoV5-1, indicating that these steels are the most suitable for plasma nitriding of the entire tool steels analysed."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944038","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b766fdbe833174260453","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"41","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"bb475064-47f7-47ca-93e6-6ebb53480245"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"5-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.prz.edu.pl/amme/article/view/977","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b766fdbe833174260455","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Mokrzycka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a71f2c80-f1ad-4610-b174-8d54684a40c5"},{"objectId":"6839b766fdbe833174260454","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Jopek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0e582a1-217a-4a97-93fe-99d60cd463ff"},{"objectId":"5f857e56085dcb410a25edc4","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Przybyło","uuid":"8E175D3135CFD06BD5AB798016AC22FA2EC9D05ADE10060FCED94EC858C1983DDF839985EE57CCD24B19A47B447692AF9630187DF9E57C501D88C8DA64C8748D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"50128ef3-9721-45c2-b1ec-9de95252f81f"},{"objectId":"5e70938f878c28a0473acd50","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Gancarczyk","uuid":"74F3DD5021B3E9BEA6C6156C54765460E2599FB3E06126F2AE12B2E539278CDE22A6E5A9C0E02F653EF38465A750962D7C56E0AA7A4465A62C29D9D3AB067314","orcidId":"0000-0002-5938-6636","documentHash":"58e5899e-72a7-4d99-af35-eb40743bd747"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aaea1","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Kościelniak","uuid":"AAC6921496E0398B7909DBB31667CE3B594B3C02ADA211502C46E6C99F9D8C13AC286E334D7F8C423382525DD6DC6BCF7A827031A96D3447FD89CE2D0F6C7359","orcidId":"0000-0002-1683-0354","documentHash":"3259c9f7-fe47-4c25-a2eb-caa9cce15f4c"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa09d","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Dychtoń","uuid":"05DA2A713684574CADEFF022E8F1C2DBDBE24D20F5C456699E9A01D3B7316BB0FA3CD41AF22EBA950975B32445576DBF7A52E56708125148297E3E5CA7006D70","orcidId":"0000-0002-3003-8603","documentHash":"41cf273a-f8fe-429a-9e76-1b450513a0eb"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d66d","name":"Marek","lastName":"Poręba","uuid":"D60E6821BF4CE7FC3EEB428A10C235DE5411BBC3261BFF64F1D79F24C243B01057788C66FC9ECCD3A8B0E7C1E47BA680C67B27F5A6A97CDFD80B47A3B92B35D3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c517530-60ae-43ce-a41f-0f0975dd9072"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d58b","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Pytel","uuid":"B5224393F9EEFA59DEB07D8E0AD2998264702664C1C4E766A4029507182A45146EFF9F5612BF92B4CD84C5653B960B9145F8F46831ABC88B4F03DBC5F57BED0F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1551-5173","documentHash":"292932ef-2a1a-43ae-9625-db23f26fdcd7"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c453","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Kubaszek","uuid":"68ECF3EAD289201DC971F3D7E0EAE30189437E9D84FD003B4923940FD772E6A4979CDA440F0005CC1EB2C8D85C2437B2E556026969FF4EBC3984EFA2AC01272D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7006-4857","documentHash":"3ec2457f-6fb4-444a-bb87-43001a1a6438"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b746","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Gradzik","uuid":"972224633B2907FFF730B28311D920D620936DD788EE9D9470E27A7882E70172D2BBC743EA5F2E3E0BAB03936121EC4926F1AE16628BF69FEE8F8BA5562DBD19","orcidId":"0000-0003-0491-8890","documentHash":"d765d9f6-5a4e-46a7-8919-34b6958f4ace"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395281","name":"Marek","lastName":"Góral","uuid":"9C32119FC9DC5555DA1DFA67B0C66A0785FD82C0F804A82B057A93440F8A2E8DCEBDA9A2B3DF93EE1A54F629366AA991452B2FE6491B1D672879077E0F1647D2","orcidId":"0000-0002-7058-510X","documentHash":"d05bd54a-67fa-4dae-bb59-42af60e6b025"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739527f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Drajewicz","uuid":"512C674C9A8ACF3998E773B8AF28A7E53274695C561D79DE39947A31D840A6AEE0C5EBE9BE3B353970686DEE05D05D46F67E9F1B120AAB5E87E56D29F7054E8B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9600-6938","documentHash":"415b7f80-adc5-45ef-9c40-997732dc461c"}],"doi":"10.7862/rm.2024.1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quality control","CAx systems","coordinate optical measurements","coordinate measurements method","3D printing"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The identification of hardening parameters is a difficult and time-consuming problem. The procedure of the parameters identification using the experimental hysteresis curve obtained in a cyclic loading test under strain control is presented in details here for a S235JR construction steel. The last stabilized cycle extracted from the hysteresis curve is required for the identification of hardening parameters. The model with three backstresses is tested here. The optimization algorithm is also used for the improvement of the agreement between experimental and numerical data. In order to include some uncertainty of experiment and the identification procedure, the authorial algorithm written on the basis of the fuzzy logic soft-computing method is applied here. The results obtained show that the identification procedure presented in this paper ensures the good agreement between the experimental tests and numerical calculations. The correct selection of parameters associated with the hardening is essential for the right description of material behaviour subject to loading in different engineering problems, including in metal forming processes."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944045","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a8e4cb4097071977e122fc","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"18","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"a1b6653c-c562-4e06-aacf-759b764a8abe"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"61-75","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Computational-Methods-of-the-Identification-of-Chaboche-Isotropic-Kinematic-Hardening,175930,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b786fdbe833174260544","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Winiarski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"758c5ad2-3dc0-4ac5-8a2b-a674320246bf"},{"objectId":"6839b786fdbe833174260543","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Gontarz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71af78ad-6db3-46ae-b05d-8b24de9c8468"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6bb","name":"Marta","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"1EE75F5E73D85097334355D2D7991D8A8479D25A413A98A56F76ECA3CA8AEDBB3F48B0DBEAF4D2EE9B16023D1195ABE5DD975888E33AC3D16A4A4779B74EFBAF","orcidId":"0000-0003-3764-1058","documentHash":"54a50444-a263-4bf4-8ff6-29f99fc88726"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951e3","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skrzat","uuid":"58F283326C0BB3BF804FA64F2014EE7E3A6F4AA897A8C28EFA456604E63B5C12D014ABF071FE205338BEBE9C31891D2ABC62F5AA315A12714068A5E07DF8E15A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5072-3886","documentHash":"040549ef-3e68-4ea2-8552-89e8aefe62c5"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/175930"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wearable devices","RFID transponder","RFIDtex tag","textile antennas","smart fabrics","wearables","smart textiles","e-textiles"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The configuration of the inductively coupled antenna module and the microelectronic module housing the chip can be varied in several ways. This article explores various geometries of coupling circuits and assesses the effects of altering their dimensions on mutual inductance, chip voltage, and the transponder’s read range. The investigation comprised an analytical description of inductive coupling, calculations of mutual inductance and chip voltage based on simulation models of transponders, and laboratory measurements of the read range for selected configurations. The results obtained from this study demonstrate that various designs of textile transponders are capable of achieving satisfactory read ranges, with some configurations extending beyond 10 m. This significant range provides clothing designers with the flexibility to select transponder designs that best meet their specific aesthetic and functional requirements."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944047","journalIssue":{"objectId":"662b496540970762633e8efc","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"2d7201c6-4b66-4007-8876-62b3fec0079e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/9/1759","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"633e3da97523402e340f9c93","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ziobro","uuid":"6E52608B42AEEAC70D5E5EF79570B0B2FA5C8A70728ADA79D893BF5B20CFFEFC4B472A66308F5F1D2E770D6FB26F387DA63B573A5D89CA262B4780ACB1199979","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"031f1a8b-dcf8-41b9-88a6-9ac592adaaa9"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2a9a","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Pyt","uuid":"5060CF71ED2946EC1F64306A9571C9108AF5E1E072646187D2F7213A01EC7CD42816DBCE8F4CBECAA6B5A4D9704376D8A0C6FA567DAC8091A7BC1D0483F8949E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9128-3744","documentHash":"8620a114-e2da-4265-a498-586f9636b0c8"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5d1","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Węglarski","uuid":"C3FAE5F2DC8628C24B31E1E7C6C02B27C1C4E249CB118B851568E175534E2705C7F2EA7A37305CEA6EFA2CE84C7B402250271E71CC56332956D9FB348D47CBDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7733-8259","documentHash":"c91f8a15-71db-4fe8-80fb-d1683c8fa33d"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951d9","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jankowski-Mihułowicz","uuid":"D88B5ADE4BD712A7B74E9BA85531387D183F63BBF42CF7E41D20A1267117874938D01D933AB485E9799599FDC3B838288A05B9CD539F90B593CF598E870E8431","orcidId":"0000-0001-7396-807X","documentHash":"ee8c0c33-030a-4831-8fdb-768fb8b58ecf"}],"doi":"10.3390/electronics13091759"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Exhaust measurement","vehicle emission","CO2","Machine learning","air pollution","Portable emission measurement system"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Increasing the feed rate or the cutting speed in materials characterized by a higher machinability index is necessary. Smart drilling, that is, the real-time adjustment of the cutting parameters, requires the evolution of cutting process variables. In addition, it is necessary to control and adjust the processing parameters in real time. Machinability is one of the most important technological properties in the machining process, enabling the determination of the material’s susceptibility to machining. One of the machinability indicators is the unit cutting resistance. This article proposes a method of material identification using the short-time Fourier transform in order to automatically adjust cutting parameters during drilling based on force signals, cutting torque and acceleration signals. In the tests, four types of wood-based materials were used as the processed material: medium-density fiberboard, chipboard, plywood board and high-pressure laminate. Holes with a diameter of 10 mm were drilled in the test materials, with variable feed rate, cutting speed and thickness of cutting layer. An innovative method for determining the value of unit cutting resistance was proposed. The results obtained were used to determine the machinability index. Based on the test results, it was shown that both the selected signal measures in the time and frequency domains and the unit cutting resistance are constant for a given material of a workpiece and do not depend on the drilling process parameters. In this article, the methodology is proposed, which can be used as an intelligent technique to support the drilling process to detect the material being machined using data from sensors installed on the machine tool. The work proposes the fundamentals for material identification based on the analysis of force signals and the magnitude of force derivatives. The proposed methodology shows effectiveness, which proves that it can be used in intelligent drilling processes. Hybrid wood-based material structures consisting of different materials are becoming more and more common in building structures for strength, economic and environmental reasons. Due to the difference in the machinability of interconnected materials, cutting parameters must be optimized in real time during machining. Currently, with the rapid development of Industry 4.0, the on-line identification of parameters is becoming necessary to improve the process flow in industrial reality. The proposed methodology can be used as an intelligent technique to support the drilling process in order to detect the material being processed using data from sensors installed on the machine tool."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944051","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6628b47e40970762632fef73","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"84142126-a013-48f5-94a5-abf9aa9c1573"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/9/2033","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bbb","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zielińska-Szwajka","uuid":"49AD64364D21A828314C0596FD75085DA570E9446C8DB6631BBC544A1FCA28170DE898DB3DAEF447357C9276D0DC7A91DE17660699291FC8E8ED11D39DEBF0D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-6212-2666","documentHash":"9b674641-c845-42e0-9500-b0b5233cddde"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szwajka","uuid":"BE3DBEF640820E864475437AEC4DB8978AE4FC0B4B3B99093CD4857E27DEEA7E923758AFBB9E791E11BF13C3EA626287D3C4FCE7C77FBDA928B5DCDAAE66EFFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1038-1148","documentHash":"60c70249-8eb8-40a1-ae88-4991b4235bad"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17092033"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Internet of Everything","additive manufacturing","Industry 4.0","Industry 5.0","Supply Chain Management"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Due to the smallest wetting angle for polar and nonpolar liquids and the total UV/VIS radiation transmittance (425 nm) of sisal fiber, the best processing and mechanical properties were obtained for laminates reinforced with this fiber (tensile strength 257 MPa, flexural modulus 20.5 GPa)."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944668","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bba1fdbe8331742623ac","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"69","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"8c6bc485-0d7b-4972-8ae3-8346003e55fd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"372-377","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ichp.vot.pl/index.php/p/article/view/2415","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e0524923","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Krasowska","uuid":"4C8DCD63D3CA767FE916115555A5F62EC50612F3F681752DE3FE2E5E6B3F586CFDA164EAFE58D460351346141CA8745C4B69CC4A12D5F3D95CC0AC7094241DBD","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c85edf6-b07d-41b7-aceb-91c2bebdd55a"},{"objectId":"5e7094ec878c28a0473c6e1b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Galek","uuid":"1EAC4B3705DB07F4D3A6FF132A9FC228B61C2E5D927390341F4B6AAB0E14F8E694FCA0288C47898BFE2F12337E3914B7086221AF6ABC4DDCA686A18AD489009B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7775-0908","documentHash":"80e57dda-9a8a-47ae-9406-834fadef0520"},{"objectId":"5e709472878c28a0473bd3fc","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Oliwa","uuid":"5EAA39AC6C12DCFA14B64DA8CE279C26558B4AEC97EE254260780D906BBA3FE976AB7CC77CBCDCFDDEAC8BE1F6CE6AB42FDF1219541423E56E99F70D088F6E60","orcidId":"0000-0003-1319-6199","documentHash":"b05162a2-b112-4006-94a5-2e8beea201eb"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951a7","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Oleksy","uuid":"1A8DFB5918D37E884EBC24E6381232F2F6BC8F31E2060D26528D493CC8A5B312ACFEF19E9B3C86DF358294746B704337AFCE533EA1DCEB3144779BE3035D4AB5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5515-8575","documentHash":"75bc4e24-7b06-4c42-8327-71583c04e8f2"}],"doi":"10.14314/polimery.2024.6.5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ecology","heavy metals","petroleum products","soil pollution","multicomponent contamination","municipal solid waste","iteration","landfill"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The dependences of the mercury, copper and zinc concentrations in the soil on the distance to the landfill of municipal solid waste were determined, similar dependence was specified for petroleum products for a distance of up to 500 m. The research employed the regression analysis technique for investigating single-factor experiments and other paired patterns. The selection of a suitable function was based on commonly utilized options, determined by the criterion of achieving the maximum correlation coefficient value. Regression analyses were conducted by employing linearizing transformations, facilitating the conversion of non-linear regularities into linear forms.

For this purpose, two research testing stands with a POX controller and OVS (Open vSwitch) switches were used. In the first testing stand, the research based on the ICMP traffic was done while in the second one, MQTT traffic was analysed. The capabilities of these systems were examined in terms of responding to detected incidents and traffic anomalies. In particular, their appropriate responses to anomalies were tested, as well as the possibility of continuous monitoring of packet transfer between separate network components. The aim of the paper is to investigate the effectiveness of SDN in enhancing the security and adaptability of critical infrastructure systems. For isolation and optimised resource management, some components, such as POX or the MQTT broker, were run in Docker containers. The test environment used both hardware cases and prepared software, enabling comprehensive design and testing of networks based on the OpenFlow protocol used in SDN architecture, enabling the separation of control from traffic in computer networks. The results of this research make it possible to implement anomaly detection solutions in critical infrastructure systems that will adapt on the fly to changing conditions that arise, for example, in the case of an attack on such infrastructure or physical damage to it at a selected node."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944674","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f287c0fdbe8327371d78f9","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"18","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"08282bc4-20f0-4cfb-bb45-6e1743e20e69"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"176-191","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Detection-of-incidents-and-anomalies-in-SDN-based-implementations-of-critical-infrastructure,192641,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bbb7fdbe833174262463","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Vanivska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1820bab6-1ed7-4a04-b7c3-e1024046f902"},{"objectId":"633b9aaa7523402e340ef592","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Organiściak","uuid":"E4A1789302696CDEAFA93427B7B0D0E29E18D959414D2BC17A4B860A6BC3007A6B95AD64F4D451713660884B12D87FA52E675A61641A08381D5AD8991C19A785","orcidId":"0000-0002-5277-4038","documentHash":"6c96641e-781d-475c-9a5c-4fe9fadfa725"},{"objectId":"621d93387523402df08b0230","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ćmil","uuid":"8039A04F68CA102104746C8E761E09F77DB8F88F51EC84BE3B2501895C359A751CBDCA8EE47DD354E3891EF6BFF744A8E3D92CBCD87C3A87895160CB9AC16835","orcidId":"0000-0002-5941-4385","documentHash":"99223f32-d1ec-42e4-b79c-f8e94ddd5727"},{"objectId":"603dd4539543c711bc6e9e95","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kuraś","uuid":"8370DCDAE3C43EE1EBFC33FE43E9D0F310B529A914208E02309F06B498D6EDFBB52435D5F453014303DA28C5BC101F52E051A2B370A88109653DE2C6EE5A88F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-8658-0821","documentHash":"4130f367-245a-498c-9429-3c5e7e4229c1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5e1","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Paszkiewicz","uuid":"C242E143465BCD880B647DD9D4D035A19090913C6683FC38AAEB21BF430B1051864F15B73531FBB5B91FA7F15DA8F0CE9EEA9E4B991A37699918E56ECCA2D317","orcidId":"0000-0001-7573-3856","documentHash":"e507f4fc-94c9-4b3c-b6c5-2ac7aca5a9cb"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5cd","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bolanowski","uuid":"D8E202ECFD9AAF6D9BCBD52C5BC890F7CF939CC63F7561C2E5E29F8D9FC8C4C8F2805F51335AB38F4887E500F811C6058246D66DBDA35D11E2FE0B347C275095","orcidId":"0000-0003-4645-967X","documentHash":"57abda5b-87f7-4e60-8d69-c3b194ae426f"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6fb","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Kowal","uuid":"589D84256CDE0861A79EC93B5E28EC820AAC2910CF0DC2FCD5ECF14A6575E9AC9998E503E33E051AC8B79527E672144903F35A17D9E5A5B69BD09DBBF163D4B2","orcidId":"0000-0002-7909-6484","documentHash":"546af200-7a08-4b2e-b891-0bd7a5f3add1"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951d2","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Strzałka","uuid":"3F312F0A337089C2CF0FA5E901DBA55929BFA86882E4B9C6E2E297EAD16AAD0CC1E32983D8883894E80738A749142B7A71DDAD1040F55DD68BF2571967291113","orcidId":"0000-0002-8887-4321","documentHash":"6d8a2ac3-290b-4d36-aab1-a504ebb119f9"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951d1","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Mazurek","uuid":"D5F141F32CB21883BE91DD933E08FC9263177A7C10825F5D6005B6D66B2F81E9F3352FA79E5BE4F337CEA2BAC1DE848FF01A9839C36786715BE8F809B52EDE81","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-1701","documentHash":"a52b9436-ae2f-4da5-a04a-16bb3ee0d746"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951d0","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Dymora","uuid":"0C7C6B68CB93EA5C40D203D95D57DA61DE74A6A9719F1F67746FA2F582094F8CBCC4046E4DD7E71698633D007081625C49670FBEB4D79472DBAAB1E597B0747B","orcidId":"0000-0002-4473-823X","documentHash":"151821fc-b9e3-48f2-ab79-c65d99e5c806"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/192641"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["brazing filler metal","microstructure","vacuum brazing","Ni-based superalloy","SEM/EDS analysis"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The modern aerospace industry demands continuous improvement of production processes to enhance the engine performance, while ensuring its reliability. Therefore, a better understanding of the processes that shape the properties of engine assemblies joints is crucial. This paper presents an analysis of the influence of key brazing process parameters – brazing time and gap width – on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Inconel 718 superalloy joints obtained with the Palnicro 36M filler alloy. The analysis was conducted basing on results from SEM/EDS analysis and peel, shear and spreadability tests."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944676","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67076c52fdbe831eab0bbe50","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"69","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"008afcae-506a-433b-9c3f-2ec84081786c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"761-773","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.imim.pl/files/archiwum/Vol2_2024/56.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba66fdbe833174261a3a","name":"I.","lastName":"Dul","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"439e8f98-cd89-4ad1-8d1f-0440828aa385"},{"objectId":"6839ba66fdbe833174261a39","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Krystek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6cf29a36-9ed8-4670-adfb-90d83b34bb7c"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d662","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wierzbińska","uuid":"B3571BCF2064B03205B517A50D57C465048BFA58C9CEA0FEAE213A15E2C4A016B3E0506D07074E36C61CEEB1A394C2962248270F73C1F7740346D4D3363ACFDE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3fea9076-07ab-472f-9793-3346cde21b1e"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951eb","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Motyka","uuid":"4169CB0AFD8FF622A18F0D8879B0346552EF5FB8F39FB3AA064BDCED2D1D8BE902E26AC0C793BC26E0F4ADF3C1377159D8AA6EDDC5C3498AA91D0F5D97A5F20A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9127-2487","documentHash":"618b740a-5fac-45e2-b4e0-428fc9fba79e"}],"doi":"10.24425/amm.2024.149808"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["genetic algorithm","quality management","quality control","enterprise management","NPGA","multi-criteria process optimization"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The presented method assumes the use of the NPGA genetic algorithm to simultaneously manage costs and the level of detecting non-conformities. The main assumption of the presented approach is to treat individual quality control procedures as vectors, whose elements are probability generating functions of defect detection. Each of these procedures generates certain operational costs and covers specific types of defects within its scope. The task of the presented algorithm is to indicate which procedure and to what extent should operate to ensure an appropriate level of non-conformity detection while minimizing costs. The article presents the theoretical foundations of the developed algorithm and the results of its implementation. The software has been developed in C++ with a particular focus on performance aspects. Its essence lies in the implementation of data structures introduced in the theoretical part, as well as methods for their rapid processing. Thanks to this approach, the entire program is scalable and can be used to solve multidimensional optimization problems. The presented approach may also find application in other areas of enterprise management. This will be possible primarily in cases where the effectiveness of procedures or devices is primarily evaluated based on probability. Therefore, the presented methods can provide effective optimization of other areas related to enterprise management."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944677","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f287c0fdbe8327371d78f9","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"18","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"08282bc4-20f0-4cfb-bb45-6e1743e20e69"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"264-276","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Optimization-of-Quality-Control-Processes-Using-the-NPGA-Genetic-Algorithm,193195,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"603dd4539543c711bc6e9e95","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kuraś","uuid":"8370DCDAE3C43EE1EBFC33FE43E9D0F310B529A914208E02309F06B498D6EDFBB52435D5F453014303DA28C5BC101F52E051A2B370A88109653DE2C6EE5A88F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-8658-0821","documentHash":"4130f367-245a-498c-9429-3c5e7e4229c1"},{"objectId":"5f78278c085dcb410a25e92f","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Klich","uuid":"4FED24F40013600F048CC4D283840E59FE1278E272BE5168F7F18D7D51798BDE4D72D2DC3C9C36646910BFAD88B9A9908A84DDE51A17A275483A15D172B41157","orcidId":"0000-0001-6099-2417","documentHash":"6e5605a6-9cff-4063-ad04-025b13921436"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8c50","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Sikorska-Czupryna","uuid":"F5F5B8EE411A68E42BAFE254FD8883B1CE59A0A123C2486F0F475231EBAA3D3A4E6AEB7AD88FFCCA18AD217C5695B3E00AE2FDA5CAEB94BE7611E815BD24451B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0063-085X","documentHash":"518306a3-3c23-4008-b798-91d6cc417641"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2ca3","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Chmielowiec","uuid":"E2C5BDCD9C90019077560C8BCF76A19EB0E3D5C0268EDA945E2EC03C936F45A3F4F3AA97DEB29A9E14E9BFA09BA40FC848429CCF55ADC95E624260F49B1FD39B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6629-0029","documentHash":"9e4f8dca-4ead-4b45-ace8-a15c10f7e7ef"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b771","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Woś","uuid":"6BEFED573B73603E20773F45CB423FB85AA5460622F61A7E9DF6B243688D5235142E5BF50CD3896107F3FEA4DC167A2E773F0917B42C5023F69961B01C42F770","orcidId":"0000-0003-4709-4369","documentHash":"75786439-7b68-4a77-98dc-14e99f360a48"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/193195"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["emission","modeling","NOx","vehicles","pollution","PEMS","THC","artificial intelligence","start–stop"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This paper presents an analysis of the processes in four anaerobic digesters (AD) - A, B, C and D. The study analyzed the amount of biogas produced in each digester tank and compared them with each other. Using data sets consisting of parameters relating to the pre-sludge and surplus sludge diverted to each tank, the effect of the proportion of these parameters on biogas production efficiency was studied. Based on this data, several models using different machine learning techniques were built and compared, which can be used to support the biogas production optimization process. A free convenient web tool written in Python language - AD2Biogas Predictor Tool - was also given away for sewage treatment plants to conveniently estimate the predicted amount of biogas produced on a given day using the implemented models. The main objective of the study is to understand how the studied parameters affect the efficiency of the process and identify potential optimization strategies, as well as to propose a model for biogas yield prediction based on sludge characteristics. The result of the study is to contribute to increasing the efficiency of sludge management in wastewater treatment plants and increasing biogas production, both in the form of developed models and a software tool."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944683","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6763dc73fdbe837ab135d81d","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"18","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"a17fe703-0c04-4653-901a-fc4a7da65f0f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Machine-Learning-Based-Prediction-of-Biogas-Production-from-Sludge-Characteristics,192936,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bbbafdbe833174262479","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Vanivska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"10ed5341-2756-42af-9bcb-4390d6f7c842"},{"objectId":"6839bbbafdbe833174262478","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Wadiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b07ac6b9-bbea-4ae2-aa79-94cb70329e1b"},{"objectId":"633b9aaa7523402e340ef592","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Organiściak","uuid":"E4A1789302696CDEAFA93427B7B0D0E29E18D959414D2BC17A4B860A6BC3007A6B95AD64F4D451713660884B12D87FA52E675A61641A08381D5AD8991C19A785","orcidId":"0000-0002-5277-4038","documentHash":"6c96641e-781d-475c-9a5c-4fe9fadfa725"},{"objectId":"603dd4539543c711bc6e9e95","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kuraś","uuid":"8370DCDAE3C43EE1EBFC33FE43E9D0F310B529A914208E02309F06B498D6EDFBB52435D5F453014303DA28C5BC101F52E051A2B370A88109653DE2C6EE5A88F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-8658-0821","documentHash":"4130f367-245a-498c-9429-3c5e7e4229c1"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8c50","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Sikorska-Czupryna","uuid":"F5F5B8EE411A68E42BAFE254FD8883B1CE59A0A123C2486F0F475231EBAA3D3A4E6AEB7AD88FFCCA18AD217C5695B3E00AE2FDA5CAEB94BE7611E815BD24451B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0063-085X","documentHash":"518306a3-3c23-4008-b798-91d6cc417641"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d53f","name":"Adam","lastName":"Masłoń","uuid":"06FF9840E341EBD8B3650382D903BE49BF7507D04995A9B7059C6E21E49B8FA5037F623E70B2AF30F8DB15194593537A2B493DE14C99CA8722B4345B462252E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-3676-0031","documentHash":"17701faf-256e-4063-b842-031d03db71c7"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6fb","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Kowal","uuid":"589D84256CDE0861A79EC93B5E28EC820AAC2910CF0DC2FCD5ECF14A6575E9AC9998E503E33E051AC8B79527E672144903F35A17D9E5A5B69BD09DBBF163D4B2","orcidId":"0000-0002-7909-6484","documentHash":"546af200-7a08-4b2e-b891-0bd7a5f3add1"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/192936"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["activities","cyber police","service in the Police","The Central Cybercrime Bureau","operational and reconnaissance","cybersecurity"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Należy również dobrać odpowiednie źródło zasilania spawania i interfejs do komunikacji z robotem lub automatem. Spawanie automatyczne kratownic wymaga programowania trajektorii ruchu robota, zwłaszcza głowicy spawającej, oraz bardzo dokładnego doboru parametrów procesu. Najistotniejszą kwestią automatyzacji procesu jest spawanie węzłów ramy silnika samolotu, które ze względu na ograniczony dostęp wymagają spawania ręcznego. Zatem przyszłość spawania kratowych konstrukcji lotniczych wymaga hybrydowego podejścia do procesu – czyli częściowo proces łączenia węzłów można będzie prosto zautomatyzować, a częściowo trzeba będzie pozostać przy klasycznych metodach wytwarzania.

To apply automatic welding of trusses, the authors designed and assembled the welding station adapted to the dimensions and truss shape. You should also choose the appropriate welding power source and an interface for communication with a robot or automaton. Automatic welding of trusses also requires programming of the robot’s movement trajectory, especially the welding head, and a particularly accurate selection of welding process parameters. The most important issue of automation of the welding process is the nodes of the aircraft engine frame, whose limited access requires manual welding. Therefore, the future of welding lattice aircraft structures requires a hybrid approach to the process, i.e. some of the node connections can be easily automated, and some will remain in classical manufacturing methods.

Two considered objective functions are defined to determine the investigated structure’s dynamic properties and material costs; the optimization involves genetic algorithms, neural surrogate model and multi-fidelity finiteelement models. The results of multi-objective optimization were presented as Pareto fronts. A new strategy for preliminary result verification is proposed, significantly reducing the need for a computationally intensive complete verification that requires complex models or experimental investigations. Two different indicators are applied to assess the quality of the obtained Pareto fronts; one is a new one proposed in the paper. Moreover, a multi-fidelity approach is discussed, and three finite element models with different mesh densities are employed, together with a pseudo-experimental model constructed using high-fidelity results and incorporating a nonlinear transformation. However, challenges arise due to the arbitrarily constrained number of pseudoexperiments, limiting future experiments is crucial. The study highlights the need for further analysis of Pareto front indicators and statistical analysis of applied tools like deep neural networks and genetic algorithms. Future research directions include exploring ensemble learning in surrogate models for potential optimization benefits."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944690","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bb33fdbe83317426208d","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"197","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"20723841-bedf-4e41-bae1-dc6a19c0ac60"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965997824001479?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395176","name":"Leonard","lastName":"Ziemiański","uuid":"8A09F100D53303379B8179F57FD4EF8A13851A57D1A9DAEE07F5FD7B2013D7750BE223F4A4CA5735E67C5418A3A86ABE78A8E3BD7488ED10096394C77281C384","orcidId":"0000-0002-4012-0002","documentHash":"a4ce6d03-664e-4b42-a33f-fa78eedbb03a"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395174","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Miller","uuid":"7407197D45C3C7B7AC1AC8ED99BD6AC862B291F8240E0A6A1102932E7B72DC765322CEF79BB11506671EE5F791D04B814527733931813A93DF313497C2A070F1","orcidId":"0000-0003-3318-4339","documentHash":"3f847e10-ba7b-49a7-a123-0eacf3ac4d94"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.advengsoft.2024.103740"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["innovation","triple helix","academia","blended learning","Industry 4.0","Erasmus+","industry","policy"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The research material included 60 gilts with a body weight over 125 kg. The concentration of oestradiol and the levels of selected haematological and biochemical parameters were examined in the blood samples obtained during slaughter. Next, basic slaughter characteristics and meat quality parameters were measured. It was observed that the carcasses of the gilts with a higher concentration of oestradiol were characterized by a significantly higher temperature, pH45 and pH24 of the ham, and a lower degree of postslaughter bleeding of the muscles. The obtained results and the results of previous own research suggest that the increased concentration of the analysed hormones causes a range of physiological, metabolic and behavioural changes, typical of the oestrus phase and its external manifestation.

Therefore, it is reasonable to pay attention to the emissions performance of these vehicles under dynamic conditions. In this regard, the tests were carried out on a chassis dynamometer with the engine fueled by gasoline and natural gas. Due to the area of operation of natural gas vehicles being usually limited to urban areas, the urban phases of the NEDC (New European Driving Cycle) and WLTC (Worldwide harmonized Light-duty vehicles Test Cycle) were adapted. While CO2 emissions are lower when fueled by natural gas, CH4 emissions can be high, which is related to momentary changes in the composition of the combustible mixture. Although CH4 emissions are higher when the engine runs on natural gas, the CO2eq value is, depending on the driving cycle, about 15–25% lower than when running on petrol. Additionally, studies have shown that in engines adapted to run on CNG (compressed natural gas), it is advisable to consider the use of catalytic converters optimized to run on natural gas, as is the case with vehicles which are factory–adapted to run on CNG."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944696","journalIssue":{"objectId":"662b490340970762633e8ef3","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"240aee71-7f05-4a5f-9600-fe8282633a37"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/9/2095","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b994fdbe833174261488","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Jaremcio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e54c49f-3d74-4edc-9682-e14d8b463d6c"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d602","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Balawender","uuid":"0C2F2EA4A49ECC8D5994615D3BBCE2AA9E40D3D4C488B43435FF6B1A1E65DA3C1764F28A4B6C8A14A35D296565ED04106A0DF97DCD7CEA520879D4B7F645BA1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1219-8611","documentHash":"968fb669-fca8-48fa-88dc-63aa373374e4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d58a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Lew","uuid":"125C3ACF82B24AD1524EC7F3B447E76430781BB57DDE28A3D3ABE2F3AE13062ED510261710A9A0DFC3CE39C1486FCCCBE058B81F189C9A06FE7679E483164C6A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0019-1428","documentHash":"a002ab4d-e8f7-49c2-982a-ff8d06fff764"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f9","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Woś","uuid":"0C936B93580B831338DC610A6F51E8AEECA67D863358D9D61BFF2AA60AEC03973F5A7C55D174A8C9D012D7086B7BE56E2664C7D4F9E3634DB5D24BA2F3ADD6E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2730-3258","documentHash":"72c6bfaa-b977-4c69-bb88-fc493beb9ba0"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f5","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Kuszewski","uuid":"A3CFA9B27EEBF2E25AF3C583B815D3352C5BEBBE7F8605A83C8CCDD8A383555D4F2B8B775117DA7EC6776C487076B8F8DA0876884B1FE746F12FFC857E7F2FC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2294-6249","documentHash":"32e187ed-7a14-4078-a1e1-f06a9aa0e3e3"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f4","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":"B5F54FAEC8ECB017F321D7A14523413B4F3CBD823FE98272A7CF3933D76D98E2586886EA9C074169E3973945B90EAF44BEE89FE46161474CA8E52FE4FCADBD33","orcidId":"0000-0002-1599-1711","documentHash":"4a6b8539-e59a-43ef-b5cc-53a7b75bf0b2"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17092095"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["funkcja autokorelacji","przedłużona fonacja samogłoski","mowa dźwięczna w chorobie Parkinsona","HNR"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Reducing thermal power for heating purposes is crucial to achieve climate neutrality. The main purpose of this article is to identify the places in the building where it is possible to significantly improve energy efficiency through the use of appropriate construction and material solutions. This article contains a multi-aspect approach to the heat balance of a building. Solutions that have a direct impact on building energy consumption were analysed, taking into account architectural, technological, and material aspects. Particular attention was paid to energy-efficient design and material solutions for non-transparent and transparent external walls and thermal storage walls (Trombe walls). An analysis of heat transfer through building elements was carried out, along with the optimisation of energy-efficient solutions for non-transparent and transparent barriers. Two methods for determining the equivalent heat transfer coefficient Ue for solar active partitions are presented. The analysis presented in the work using the original method of the balanced heat transfer coefficient Ue is a testing ground for identifying unfavourable features of the building structure, as well as the most energy-efficient solutions that can be used in establishing standards for the construction and modernisation of buildings. The value of the Ue coefficient illustrates the actual heat transfer through the partition. Having Ue values for various structural solutions of building envelopes, the designer can easily select the most effective ones. The use of the presented methodology will allow for the optimisation of technical solutions for building elements to improve its energy efficiency."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944701","journalIssue":{"objectId":"665046ec4097072d86567935","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"04521305-940e-4808-a908-af95274230e5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/11/2702","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d62f","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Krasoń","uuid":"D97ADDD7A14C1E453B9E1B581DE3AE3D93CC9E9DAECA7E07E1057AE4AA5396197E0BAA8B8097C6B620FC041226DFA06CF3E1D6D9EDAC7F6307A77FE8E85DE295","orcidId":"0000-0003-3556-6592","documentHash":"7101eeae-09bf-4ba3-9416-e6d1239e8dee"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5b3","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Miąsik","uuid":"A3FFC77BDF2DD62B4B8FA6DE46FA750BBD797BD47E95FF5F51EFD0EDEA74D5D525D701887F7477F04EB78E23D9E074CA8832B00F4B1B0FC5268E289275D7637B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7203-3803","documentHash":"327a5774-de12-4886-81e3-be4dfcdb2c90"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395163","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Babiarz","uuid":"FF0A7F5191013051F9F276A78B0754526245F92B2496A07F8AF2822708B6BFB5C23094953C3379CA15C8FA5BF6C9C2FC7BF20A4928C2DE038406CB725CAF284F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7153-5975","documentHash":"0cb7010e-ec39-4442-8ca3-78033fecf357"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739515c","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Starakiewicz","uuid":"564FC3692498DC26CE4960DD4BE80C1DFA7DCC962AF9195E70A21AF1E078C22296562793A0734C82640F0DC5079A80AF56E351555C5C5C17913614F9BEBA97FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8340-8401","documentHash":"11dfee86-d17c-4197-9164-dce7f6967daf"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17112702"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["turbofan with heat exchanger","modified turbofan engine","turbofan engine"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

It discusses the development trend for aero engines, with a primary focus on the modification of the turbofan engine cycle by the addition of the heat exchanger. This paper presents the current state of research on heat exchangers and their application in aero engines. The paper focuses on the thermodynamic model of the GTF engine, with particular emphasis on its modification to study the impact of heat exchangers on engine performance. The assumptions and limitations of the model are also discussed. The study examines the effects of various locations of the heat exchanger in the GTF engine, as well as its efficiency and pressure drop, on the engine overall performance, as measured by thrust and specific fuel consumption (SFC). The study demonstrates that the use of HE has a positive effect on engine thrust, but it also leads to an increase in SFC. According to the results, the HE should be positioned in the core engine of the GTF to achieve maximum thrust. This is achieved when the HE core flow inlet is located at approximately half the pressure ratio of the high-pressure compressor (HPC). It was found that the cold side pressure losses of the HE have a significant impact on engine performance for high bypass ratio turbofan engines. The additional conclusion can be drawn that, when designing a heat exchanger, it is of the utmost importance to take care to minimize its impact on pressure losses in the external channel of the engine."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944703","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6671722c4097074fa15941a0","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"18","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"f219003f-b1d8-4fe4-bab7-33931f1fb85b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"355-368","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Study-of-the-Effects-of-Heat-Exchanger-Location-on-Turbofan-Engine-Performance,189464,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba73fdbe833174261a9d","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rogalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"719b21c4-73da-4f44-afa9-ec2141a05d5f"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c458","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Bednarz","uuid":"79A7573D42DC5D654D2035C59C24ADD91017F1F617282731CBABE8A73AC0A46C8DFF21EDB180F25DEF642D8F0BD66D7885B2E4B61A82783BB95ABAF3FD28728D","orcidId":"0000-0002-3611-7513","documentHash":"d1c39aec-583d-4954-b9f0-011fbc435683"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395212","name":"Robert","lastName":"Jakubowski","uuid":"08C9FA5793F38F8DD1A72593C4AF08A6D0F6002A0B4018636794AB6FF9DF22899E127F81825FA837FED6B93C9393D479780F05E8C63334E2012E67F83C3BC329","orcidId":"0000-0002-1886-2966","documentHash":"414101b7-c747-4414-baa2-cdc4ac4bb09b"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/189464"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["nadajnik 433/868 MHz","śledzenie radiowe","lokalizacja obiektów","miniaturowy nadajnik radiowy"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Examination of the stir zone indicates a slightly larger area in n-FSW, highlighting the influence of nanoparticle reinforcement. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of the n-FSW sample improved to 27 MPa, which is 34% higher than the 21 MPa of the FSW sample. Additionally, the formation of microscale voids in the stir zone of n-FSW was reduced by 60% compared to the FSW sample. The impact energy of the n-FSW sample was 4 J/cm2 more than that of the FSW sample. Fracture surface analysis reveals nanoparticle contributions to fracture mechanics, while impact properties suggest potential air bubble entrapment."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944706","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d972b1fdbe832d5eb69c3b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"ef64cc48-a5c7-4ab3-aedf-62bd73d084b7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43452-024-01039-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc32fdbe833174262831","name":"Hamed Aghajani","lastName":"Derazkola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a760eaf6-43cd-4b53-b97e-d8adee477ca2"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"}],"doi":"10.1007/s43452-024-01039-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The process was performed in polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions of low ionic strength, at which av was the most prone to precipitate. To design the process, a mathematical model was formulated, which consisted of steady-state mass balance equations and underlying thermodynamic dependencies. The model was solved for different combinations of the process variables, including the protein concentration in the feed material and the PEG concentration in subsequent precipitation stages. The model solution was projected onto two-dimensional planes, where the performance indicators, such as the separation yield and the av reduction level, were correlated with the process variables. CnMP overperformed crosscurrent multistage precipitation (CsMP) and ion exchange chromatography (IEX) used in previous studies; in the comparison with CsMP, the 3-stage CnMP process allowed up to 28% increase in yield and up to 25% increase in the av reduction level, and in the comparison with IEX, up to 37% increase in yield and up 12.5% increase in the av reduction level. The yield benefit of CnMP depended on the composition of the feed material and the demand for the av reduction. The concept was experimentally verified; the 2- and 3-stage CnMP processes were performed using the input process variables provided by the model solution.

Design/methodology/approach: The analysed results included a research sample of 379 companies in the electromechanical industry (machinery processing industry). The sample was obtained between March and September 2023 by means of a guided survey. Analyses of the results of quantitative research were carried out to verify the approaches of SMEs from V4 countries to pro-quality product, including comparative analyzes of the results obtained. Analyses were performed using the ANOVA test (repeated measure designs). The Mann Whitney U test was used to identify statistically significant differences in entrepreneurs' responses. The significance level adopted was α = 0.05. Findings: It has been shown that SMEs from V4 countries have different approaches to improving product quality. Additionally, it was shown that both in the case of pro-quality activities of SMEs from the V4 countries, the lowest consistency of assessments occurs in the following countries: Poland and Slovakia, Poland and Hungary, Slovakia and Hungary. Practical implications: Research results may contribute to more effective and coherent development activities of SMEs in the V4 countries as part of their sustainable development. Social implications: Based on the research conducted, it is possible to provide SMEs in V4 countries with a more adequate approach to undertake consistent and effective quality activities as part of the improvement of the product. Originality/value: Determining the current pro-quality approach to product improvement in SMEs in the V4 countries. The novelty is also the identification of the importance (level of importance) of these approaches in each V4 country, as well as the determination of the similarities and differences between these approaches in SMEs from countries in the Visegrad Group."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944711","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638a12d4097076e57a67c0b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"194","doi":null,"documentHash":"54e9fe1f-d605-48d5-882f-6ed29d5fdc7d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"449-459","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/194-Siwiec-Pacana-Simkova-Metszosy-Badnarova.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b98cfdbe833174261452","name":"Lucia","lastName":"Bednárová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f4adc30-d423-4c72-8149-5d9701410488"},{"objectId":"6839b98cfdbe833174261451","name":"Gabriella","lastName":"Metszősy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"165c2436-5820-4d58-9282-64cba586d990"},{"objectId":"6839b98cfdbe833174261450","name":"Zuzana","lastName":"Simková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38a67c97-d2f5-44ca-a594-b2550e31f65e"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.194.26"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","ESG","Corporate Social Responsibility","public relations","The European Green Deal"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Design/Methodology/Approach: In order to thoroughly analyze the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and management taking into account Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors on building the competitive advantage of enterprises, a comprehensive research approach was applied. The first step was to conduct a review of the scientific literature. Secondary data was then collected from various sources. The analysis also included case studies from various sectors that report the effects of using CSR and ESG. Findings: The analyzes conducted indicate that investments in CSR and ESG bring benefits both in the short and long term, increasing value for owners, contributing to improve the image of enterprises and reduce operational and financial risk. The importance of these activities is further emphasized by the introduction of international regulations and initiatives, such as the European Green Deal, which impose new requirements on companies regarding sustainable development and its reporting. Practical implications: The paper identifies challenges and barriers in the implementation of CSR and ESG practices, while emphasizing their key role for the future of business in the face of global environmental and social problems. Additionally, the paper draws attention to the growing role of non-financial reporting as a tool that enables the assessment and comparison of companies' activities in the field of social responsibility and sustainable development.

This study exploreshow sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) takes the changing role to affectthese three dimensions. Since organizations vary in size, we post and test relation-ships regarding how firm size can impact the implementation of SSCM practices as amoderator. We posit an empirical research model and test this using structural equa-tion modeling with survey data from 392 managers across various Jordanianmanufacturing firms. This study assessed the link between five categories of SSCMpractices and TBL performance. We found that firm size is critical and moderates thepositive SSCM relationship with economic and social performances. Results shednew light on SSCM and its impacts on environmental, economic, and social perfor-mance. According to the study findings, environmental management practices andsupply chain integration influenced all sustainability dimensions, whereas sociallyinclusive community practices influenced none.

Połączenia te są nominalnie nieznacznie dokręcane i prześwit pomiędzy trzpieniem śruby a otworem na śrubę powoduje natychmiastowy poślizg łączonych elementów pod wpływem obciążenia, co wpływa na sztywność całej konstrukcji. Obecnie najczęściej stosuje się połączenia kategorii A ze śrubami klasy 8.8, które są dokręcane stosunkowo mocno, lecz nie o wartości nominalnej siły sprężenia. Takie „mocne” dokręcenie wywołuje siłę tarcia, proporcjonalną do wartości momentu dokręcenia, a tym samym wpływa na zdolność połączenia do poślizgu i na jego charakterystykę siła-wydłużenie. W artykule przedstawiono odpowiedź stalowej wieży kratowej, w której występują połączenia śrubowe kategorii A, ze śrubami M16 i M20 klasy 8.8, które częściowo sprężono (do poziomu 60% Fp,c).

To date, no study has been published that systematically integrates the satisfaction and dissatisfaction effect of requirements without the need to specify categories of requirements. The proposed approach is based on defining the satisfaction potential (SP) and dissatisfaction potential (DP) of each requirement. Curve shapes for all valid categories in the 5 × 5 Kano evaluation sheet were used to determine SP and DP. At the same time, a new Kano evaluation sheet was designed containing predefined SP and DP values, which allow easier classification of requirements. A case study of requirements on restaurant services was used to validate the new approach.

The altermagnetic ground state of LTO is protected by the crystal symmetry and specifically ordered \uD835\uDC51 orbitals of Ti ions with the orbital momentum \uD835\uDC59=2. The altermagnetism occurs when sites of Ti pairs in the unit cell are occupied by single electrons with \uD835\uDC5A=−1,\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC67=+1/2 and \uD835\uDC5A=+1,\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC67=−1/2 per site, with \uD835\uDC5A and \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC67− being the \uD835\uDC67−component of the orbital momentum and spin, respectively.

The experimental setup consisted of minicrystallizers in which the crystallization cocktail was stirred using a magnetic stirrer, mechanical agitator, shaker, or rotating mixer at different rotational frequencies. The hydrodynamics of the setups was determined with respect to local and average values of flow velocity, turbulent dissipation rate (ε), turbulent kinetic energy (k), and shear rate (γ̇). The calculations were performed by using the ANSYS Fluent software, in which the k-ε RNG turbulence model was implemented. The model was used to determine the probability density functions (PDFs) of the hydrodynamic parameters, which were correlated with the morphology of the protein crystalline phase obtained in the crystallization experiments. Lysozyme was used as a model protein, which was crystallized from sodium chloride solutions. For the shaker and rotating mixer, the dependence of the crystal size distribution on the k-PDF or γ̇-PDF distributions followed a similar pattern. For the mechanical agitator, a minor discrepancy was observed from that pattern at higher rotational frequencies. The correlation could not be validated for the magnetic stirrer, in which no crystalline phase was obtained under the crystallization conditions used. This was attributed to the pulverization of the solid phase caused by the magnetic bar."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944725","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bbcefdbe833174262500","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"63","number":"37","doi":null,"documentHash":"1c30e6cc-d334-4f1f-a036-03285c25990a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"16208-16219","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.iecr.4c01816","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebeca7d752340226956f825","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Filip","uuid":"4D27106A3DA3A7E9DC2F21208511C95B54FF67F22D914B5E0D23F527345B479D9978DCF65E706D7089131F368C148486C2F7A8A235D69EF7F1CED4A0960BDF70","orcidId":"0000-0002-9040-1347","documentHash":"3dbf0467-2a4c-42e6-a539-35aa9d8597f2"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b5aa","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kołodziej","uuid":"C513AC56767DEE9C9C29CF043D717574D5B8378510FFF0BB294B1636E6E140B524F57DD7DA33E087DBD5BCB3E460D509DB0EFA159FE681C2317BD2BEE3E9458F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1742-3133","documentHash":"e427e8a9-6204-4ba6-9008-7ddf4e9f8b51"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395196","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Chutkowski","uuid":"E4DE2C3E854FF20BA87EEFE506C826B3F4051BD503AFCE70D5FFB1B7EC2AD4E8B0CBDCD1895EF95C4CD98D43905AF0395FB683863C1D0C2FF2E04065544611B8","orcidId":"0000-0001-8234-4963","documentHash":"dbfc35f7-0f5f-45f5-a52c-8be25d35c459"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395195","name":"Roman","lastName":"Bochenek","uuid":"EBA2B4A6324B4DA42B14781E50AD0F87CC2298A1BC7B3AB1115A925413ABA7871377EC5C6F0F16F0C335AAEDD247684CADF9E70FF35AD4C73764CDC4C0EC23AD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3909-8394","documentHash":"4cd0a3e9-3b94-4539-ba77-3e809be22222"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395194","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Antos","uuid":"41F1949A79E9F2CCA5DA05E449BE58DD6991FEEC6689608B2AAA8E2A55BEECF5CF3C795F80FDC9D5F157BF99A1C8D5AACDF2D18D9034FBD0CC75BDFF48345723","orcidId":"0000-0001-8246-5052","documentHash":"6cfc2713-1b76-4663-ae9a-85f8d16c0b1d"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.iecr.4c01816"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["finite element method","strain measurement","mortar base plate"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Computer programs usually use a single-parameter subsoil model (Winkler-Zimmermann) for calculations, which requires providing the subgrade susceptibility coefficient. The subgrade compliance coefficient is intended to determine the mutual reaction of the subgrade and the structure due to the pressure exerted on the soil by the retaining slab, which settles. When designing slabs in computer programs, it is assumed that the substrate compliance coefficient is constant. Determining the impact of the soil on the retaining slab is important when analyzing its deformations. The subject of the work was the analysis of the influence of ground support on the results obtained during modeling of the retaining slab. In order to obtain data for FEM analysis and validation, the actual strains occurring on the thrust plate were measured using strain gauge rosettes. The plate deformations were measured during field shooting tests. In order to vary the influence of supporting the slab on the ground and obtain reliable stress values on the slab surface, a method of successive iterations was proposed. Calculations are performed using this method until the error is smaller than the assumed one."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944727","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b766fdbe833174260453","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"41","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"bb475064-47f7-47ca-93e6-6ebb53480245"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"103-111","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.prz.edu.pl/amme/article/view/1712","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d604","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Tupaj","uuid":"574DA751D2B91B43405FCDF7268AEAB60EEF22C2A0703DF8DC7A8E1371635BB40D77EBC4EF8EB8C60FE5AD3C6AF7F8902BF296E56D3CE54B38055DA2A862CAA6","orcidId":"0000-0003-3723-1219","documentHash":"bbc8a203-a9b4-4096-b084-a2ebac059e31"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c460","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bieniek","uuid":"8C823755C255CEEED8CA7A0646768EEC1FEB7294CA6ECEFE893C0D0802090131231BB06B416C32AF5D24E57BCCEAA9BB84DB5C2D6541BDE4A833998F0C90461C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a58e6b3d-e878-4e13-a4bb-2b7d5b128047"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szwajka","uuid":"BE3DBEF640820E864475437AEC4DB8978AE4FC0B4B3B99093CD4857E27DEEA7E923758AFBB9E791E11BF13C3EA626287D3C4FCE7C77FBDA928B5DCDAAE66EFFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1038-1148","documentHash":"60c70249-8eb8-40a1-ae88-4991b4235bad"}],"doi":"10.7862/rm.2024.10"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["thermal rating","HTLS","ampacity","CIGRE 601","ACCC","ACSR"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The need to manage water losses in WSS is highlighted in the new Directive (EU) 2020/2184 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2020 on the Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption. It was indicated that the main cause of water losses is underinvestment in the maintenance and renovation of network infrastructure. The new legal provisions require a risk assessment to be carried out in the water supply system, taking into account the risk of leaks. The paper presents the concept of estimating the risk of water losses in the water supply network using the three-parameter risk assessment method and risk maps. The framework of the water balance proposed by International Water Association (IWA) were also presented, including the Infrastructure Leakage Index (ILI) for assessment of the water supply system Leakage Performance Category (LPC). The analysis was carried out for a water supply system used by 200,000 inhabitants. The LPC of the system was determined based on the ILI index. Then the water supply network pipes that could potentially be a source of leaks were identified. The analysis of the risk of water losses for the examined pipes allowed to determine which pipes should be first chosen to reduce the risk of water losses, i.e. active search for leaks."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944732","journalIssue":{"objectId":"663dde7940970729b3fefc71","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"359","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ecd54778-e062-4493-9c1c-272f6ccc411b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301479724009514?dgcid=author","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66fcb029ece39865c2f7f64f","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Rożnowski","uuid":"3DB28DFF5769E30C11E56E0B01755F5FB083CA96A4793319B8BA299385A56318924560D45F0C6941D8354568963B1516D1606B3449AF5E0B187E83CA1258FD79","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd9af986-6688-4e0e-b4ef-fd2c90ba1b7f"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c3a","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Żywiec","uuid":"BA235196FE7B6DE15CFBF912DFA2A312DF450A2779BFA8054A3352D767F479FB10CEFDAE048F3E5DE0DE74CEBC222988617380563A5BB398A0AADA54A7638D4D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0823-4229","documentHash":"bea38a4d-9ebb-4e88-8e52-c9519ef02c2c"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6b3","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Szpak","uuid":"F900EC9EE0562CD20705AEB49594DA65538B05F0EB2CB930B236E81AC8B58DBF866993446C1C2130BD55961CFFF2937D413A3495C185A7FAFA555A30FBEDCEE2","orcidId":"0000-0001-9654-2477","documentHash":"e91ca98c-9db1-4f18-98e3-9ba3e3bc1dc7"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395180","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Tchórzewska-Cieślak","uuid":"31517EB08996F702EB5F7823934403759EA9C6E0C2CD590ED2C7B177BB9FBFA169EEBBF7035ED231BEB2618AAC7BDB1B14F68EAB365CB808B5FD7547ABD94DF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7622-6749","documentHash":"d69d4236-1fb6-4956-aa38-762a24cde6c3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120965"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["adsorption","vanadium oxide","methylene blue removal","photocatalysis","sol-gel"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Furthermore, the structural changes of the resulting V2O5 material induced by solvents show strong impacts on its photocatalytic properties, making it a promising photocatalyst."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944734","journalIssue":{"objectId":"663c92f24097071b75834cf5","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"8c44bacb-ab3c-49cb-8b7e-f64e085668c3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/10/2359","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9c2fdbe8331742615dc","name":"Marta","lastName":"Prześniak-Welenc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3aac6b3-fe1d-4c9b-a5c0-7fed3a755928"},{"objectId":"6839b9c2fdbe8331742615db","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Sadowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9010efcc-5dba-4e9a-b37f-03351ee4ea5d"},{"objectId":"6839b9c2fdbe8331742615da","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Prusik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a4d72223-873f-438c-a322-869d8c87272b"},{"objectId":"6839b9c2fdbe8331742615d9","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b0dcd95-7697-4cd6-90c6-cf724043a5f8"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b97a0","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Gumieniak","uuid":"83A3426BA529A07B0860C8739E245D18A432AA48670BF86BCFFD619FB53D47CAF0DDF0E2D507DF5D684D46328B1F9A93C73A566C735837F25C23B039346B8F23","orcidId":"0000-0002-5873-8791","documentHash":"cd7658e6-f127-402e-95ec-bf27e4a0ecf6"},{"objectId":"5e709277878c28a047396312","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kramek","uuid":"F047D9337E9CD73DE6F7E3CEFC4E58E1D0DC8E0626817653778F030C815622DBD7F900B55CEB5A0580CBFA440429552A7D66FC7F2AA3F0ADE6BCEF55F81E033C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5463-6771","documentHash":"07adff04-6cd3-4fb6-ae69-469d4cb11107"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17102359"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0ODY0Njk0NDczNA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
