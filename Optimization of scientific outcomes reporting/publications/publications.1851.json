Insulin via the protein kinase G type Iα (PKGIα) signaling pathway regulates the balance between\r\ncontractility and relaxation (permeability) of the podocyte barrier by regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. This\r\nmechanism was shown to be disrupted in diabetes. Rho family guanosine-5′\r\n-triphosphates (GTPases) are dynamic modulators of the actin cytoskeleton and expressed in cells that form the glomerular filtration barrier.\r\nThus, changes in Rho GTPase activity may affect glomerular permeability to albumin. The present study showed\r\nthat Rho family GTPases control podocyte migration and permeability. Moreover these processes are regulated\r\nby insulin in PKGIα-dependent manner.

A total of 69 couples underwent IVF treatment (averaged women age: 36.5, SD 4.9) and produced a total of 314 embryos. A single blastomere was biopsied from each embryo at the cleavage stage (day-3 post-fertilization) subjected to low-pass next generation sequencing (NGS), for the purpose of detecting aneuploidy. For each sample, the number of mtDNA reads obtained after analysis using NGS was divided by the number of reads attributable to the nuclear genome. The mtDNA copy number amount was found to be higher in aneuploid embryos than in those that were euploid (mean mtDNA ratio ± SD: 6.3 ± 7.5 versus 7.1 ± 5.8, p &lt; 0.004; U Mann–Whitney test), whereas no statistically significant differences in mtDNA content were seen in relation to embryo morphology (6.6 ± 4.8 vs. 8.5 ± 13.6, p 0.09), sex (6.6 ± 4.1 vs. 6.2 ± 6.8, p 0.16), maternal age (6.9 ± 7.8 vs. 6.7 ± 4.5, p 0.14) or its ability to implant (7.4 ± 6.6 vs. 5.1 ± 4.6, p 0.18). The mtDNA content cannot serve as a useful biomarker at this point in development. However, further studies investigating both quantitative and qualitative aspects of mtDNA are still required to fully evaluate the relationship between mitochondrial DNA and human reproduction."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233410","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"44","pagesFromTo":"273-287","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d311cfdbe831a382e3d36","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Łukaszuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff57c445-556b-4273-bb34-19ba92006558"},{"objectId":"677d311cfdbe831a382e3d35","name":"Grzegorz

disease results from the immune response against self-antigens, while cancer develops when the immune system does not respond to malignant cells. Thus, for years, autoimmunity and cancer have been considered as two separate fields of research that do not have a lot in common. However, the discovery of immune checkpoints and the development of anti-cancer drugs targeting PD-1 (programmed cell death receptor 1) and CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) pathways proved that studying autoimmune diseases can be extremely helpful in the development of novel anti-cancer drugs. Therefore, autoimmunity and cancer seem to be just two sides of the same coin. In the current review, we broadly discuss how various regulatory cell populations, effector molecules, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors contribute to the loss of self-tolerance in autoimmunity or tolerance induction to cancer.

The paper presents wear tests of two different rotors: I (pump type) and II (propeller type). The operation of both rotors in industrial conditions was compared and their service life was examined. It was found that rotor I is more durable than the tested rotor II, and at the same time it provides a good level of hydrogen removal throughout the operation period, i.e., 1112 refining cycles. Rotor wear after refining was calculated by 3D scanning. The study also investigated the impact of rotor geometry on the efficiency of the refining process. The degassing efficiency was determined during refining in a foundry using the Dichte Index (DI). The alloy density and the volume of hydrogen removed were also tested for five stages of rotor wear: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. Both new rotors performed worse in removing hydrogen from the liquid alloy than the worn rotors due to their humidity which cannot be eliminated in the initial stage of their operation. A Dross Test was also performed to determine non-metallic impurities and compare size and number of cavities for rotor I and II. The best results of removing non-metallic inclusions by flotation were obtained for rotor I at the end of its operation.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233423","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67695e49fdbe831a381d88aa","name":"Martin","lastName":"Gráf","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e3f2213c-031c-4a53-8104-8e44a9ed5c2e"},{"objectId":"67695e49fdbe831a381d88a9","name":"Jana","lastName":"Svizelová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d626af7e-0c05-475c-8969-deeb15fda88d"},{"objectId":"67695e49fdbe831a381d88a8","name":"Karel","lastName":"Gryc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9aec63a0-3b28-42d1-9f12-36839000515d"},{"objectId":"67695e49fdbe831a381d88a7","name":"Ladislav","lastName":"Socha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"315eee74-7267-48a5-990d-c0f731433d80"},{"objectId":"67695e49fdbe831a381d88a6","name":"Tomáš","lastName":"Prášil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c3caeb3-260d-4560-a82b-0a55c9744b25"},{"objectId":"5e709233878c28a047391961","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Pieprzyca","uuid":"0CE8EB5B1957788FA31CF32535D49AE96F8973AEFA92125D5447A849EB972B3C75BA91F658931C9D51FDC059D9F191B0D5A1FD3A809154617DF2454CC4822D75","orcidId":"0000-0002-7615-6082","documentHash":"379eaa5e-3d51-40a6-b824-9820cfc47337"},{"objectId":"5e70921f878c28a047390323","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Merder","uuid":"DE478D87D5AC5AC7A4F87C4AFDAAC651635B8D023CA5D34DF9D9B42EC462F4D14318501C36326BC06ADE3302AC23C9860DF5737315E7F515B5A3B53817578A2B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3766-6784","documentHash":"b2d41199-4af9-41e1-94ad-1537d85cd7a7"},{"objectId":"5e70921f878c28a047390315","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Saternus","uuid":"159F5E175DC17E7CACBFD25E4EE8268C747F8F9E65000CAC4146604EA8AC5540DBE1DD26868DE849E7F7A46A8359646851C70A743F2C68E1E8381B8E49D727B2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8996-1980","documentHash":"7e695272-0565-4db2-875c-336d3db6f543"}],"doi":"10.3390/met12111803"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["rozpylanie plazmy powietrznej","powłoka bariery termicznej","korozja na gorąco","cyrkoniany metali ziem rzadkich","degradacja"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["thermal barrier coating","rare earth zirconates","degradation","air plasma spray","hot corrosion"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b2878c28a0473c1c11","5f1272d77523405869ccc2e1","676a75bcfdbe831a382615ed","5e709224878c28a047390889","5e709245878c28a047392d1d","676a75bcfdbe831a382615ee"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hot corrosion behavior of single-layered Gd2Zr2O7, Sm2Zr2O7, and Nd2Zr2O7 thermal barrier coatings exposed to Na2SO4 + MgSO4 environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bd6e","mniswId":"3957","title":"Coatings","doi":null,"issn":"2079-6412","eissn":"2079-6412","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4e0160b7-f155-4bb5-939e-e216d63ebd2d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65bb63914097076263f5a99e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709245878c28a047392d1d","5e7094b2878c28a0473c1c11","5e709224878c28a047390889","5f1272d77523405869ccc2e1","676a75bcfdbe831a382615ed","676a75bcfdbe831a382615ee"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Zirconates of rare earth elements have emerged as promising candidates for thermal barrier coatings (TBC).

This combination of salts creates a highly corrosive environment. This short test was carried out due to the necessity of the initial stages of the destruction process characterization. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) techniques were utilized to identify and analyse the reaction products. At 1000 °C, no chemical reaction products were observed between MgSO4 and Gd2Zr2O7, Sm2Zr2O7, and Nd2Zr2O7. However, in the presence of the MgSO4 + Na2SO4 mixture, the zirconate coatings reacted, resulting in the formation of reaction products such as Gd(SO4)3, Gd2O2SO4, Gd2O3, Sm2O2SO4, Sm2(SO4)3, Sm2O3, MgO, Nd2(SO4)3, Na2O, and m-ZrO2. These compounds are formed due to the interaction of rare earth oxides with a low-temperature-melting eutectic Na2SO4+ (3MgSO4 × Na2SO4) melted at 666 °C. Despite the aggressive nature of the corrosive environment, the decomposition of rare earth zirconates was relatively limited, indicating satisfactory resistance to hot corrosion. Among the zirconate systems studied, Gd2Zr2O7 exhibited the lowest resistance to the MgSO4 + Na2SO4-based corrosive environment, while Sm2Zr2O7 and Nd2Zr2O7 demonstrated better corrosion resistance"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233425","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/13/8/1311","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"676a75bcfdbe831a382615ee","name":"Amjad","lastName":"Iqbal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2989a4fa-1a7b-45b1-a96b-e2f7943087f7"},{"objectId":"676a75bcfdbe831a382615ed","name":"Muhammad Jahangir","lastName":"Khan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce2d5fe9-0937-43b6-b4a8-8de59b6d030e"},{"objectId":"5f1272d77523405869ccc2e1","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Olesik","uuid":"33EE29F8A9B9EB277D646A5C0E78741F2861DAEFB1DC48E50E807B2EE8D877BF32F6BE4A06F703D46B3DE612E1131A35083112259506F017595F7603357EC1F2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"86501a53-21ec-4c80-9b8b-a1a2be357911"},{"objectId":"5e7094b2878c28a0473c1c11","name":"Marta","lastName":"Mikuśkiewicz","uuid":"7542EF4999940CB47A901D6DDE77201B0CDD040CE27D4FEB680966BFBB695288A488167BB34DD356873D3B15B2C732767927B05A319C9D2CB528CF130BABB47B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1808-069X","documentHash":"1a1c0420-f81f-4669-adb8-181c87941b12"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Moskal","uuid":"78C02F7E257C44906FFD96A25B79CE805A883E092168DBB1C916E8C0421591B7D21DBAE421486318FE761EBD6790F1978B94EB690598741EF5087FF8B957C5EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7396-6568","documentHash":"30f43abd-3ddb-475b-bab8-a2f62e94c049"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390889","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Pawlik","uuid":"BBBBD91D500EAA61E7DB443D33DE971CA84C81B0D1E61286AA14A848B8F98E3CB0EBD787AE0981F6F281C4D1FD2B23AC69B09D1504190DEDCB331D972F756CBC","orcidId":"0000-0002-0623-6319","documentHash":"cb2157a1-4dab-4d89-bf8e-5001be8eeda0"}],"doi":"10.3390/coatings13081311"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ad78"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Investigation of peptides for molecular recognition of C-reactive protein–theoretical and experimental studies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477015","mniswId":"1091","title":"Analytical Chemistry","doi":null,"issn":"0003-2700","eissn":"1520-6882","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a71b180b-5e9d-4a5e-b9c6-4044a6c35c21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6500245f4097077bb446ac94","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ad78","677d3056fdbe831a382e2456","677d3056fdbe831a382e2457","677d3056fdbe831a382e2458","677d3056fdbe831a382e2459","677d3056fdbe831a382e245a","677d3056fdbe831a382e245b","677d3056fdbe831a382e245c","677d3056fdbe831a382e245d"]},"issue":"38","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate the interactions between C-reactive protein (CRP) and new CRP-binding peptide materials using experimental (biological and physicochemical) methods with the support of theoretical simulations (computational modeling analysis). Three specific CRP-binding peptides (P2, P3, and P9) derived from an M13 bacteriophage have been identified using phage-display technology. The binding efficiency of the peptides exposed on phages toward the CRP protein was demonstrated via biological methods. Fibers of the selected phages/peptides interact differently due to different compositions of amino acid sequences on the exposed peptides, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Numerical and experimental studies consistently showed that the P3 peptide is the best CRP binder. A combination of theoretical and experimental methods demonstrates that identifying the best binder can be performed simply, cheaply, and fast. Such an approach has not been reported previously for peptide screening and demonstrates a new trend in science where calculations can replace or support laborious experimental techniques. Finally, the best CRP binder─the P3 peptide─was used for CRP recognition on silicate-modified indium tin oxide-coated glass electrodes. The obtained electrodes exhibit a wide range of operation (1.0–100 μg mL–1) with a detection limit (LOD = 3σ/S) of 0.34 μg mL–1. Moreover, the dissociation constant Kd of 4.2 ± 0.144 μg mL–1 (35 ± 1.2 nM) was evaluated from the change in the current. The selectivity of the obtained electrode was demonstrated in the presence of three interfering proteins. These results prove that the presented P3 peptide is a potential candidate as a receptor for CRP, which can replace specific antibodies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233427","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"95","pagesFromTo":"14475-14483","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3056fdbe831a382e245d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Niedziółka-Jönsson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b5f730c-ab7d-4a28-90c5-610ed8ac7390"},{"objectId":"677d3056fdbe831a382e245c","name":"Andreas","lastName":"Ebner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1188fe83-3396-4bdd-880c-cb158f66342a"},{"objectId":"677d3056fdbe831a382e245b","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Filipek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"483cad5a-7fc5-416f-ae70-cfa1b9867ff7"},{"objectId":"677d3056fdbe831a382e245a","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Pałys","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75710dba-336e-4f36-a703-41fc63f4db13"},{"objectId":"677d3056fdbe831a382e2459","name":"Martin","lastName":"Jönsson-Niedziółka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caec2d21-5ac1-4a41-bff5-b0b420ba5419"},{"objectId":"677d3056fdbe831a382e2458","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Orzeł","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8cd7c43b-d313-473a-a540-981f1f17f91a"},{"objectId":"677d3056fdbe831a382e2457","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Kudła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"064b739a-b299-45dd-8ef3-561f2a3853f6"},{"objectId":"677d3056fdbe831a382e2456","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szot-Karpińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7474f55d-9760-4079-bd78-33d6865c30da"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ad78","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Narajczyk","uuid":"07D6D9B09A7456585BF29267E23B005E2438A4A075BA3CF503D86B46CE27CEE75BF1FBA48FFD2B54EB2E44B0633FE81DCB14A823A68696267E737460F8419942","orcidId":"0000-0001-9806-8844","documentHash":"948d98e8-bcbb-443b-9ec7-c20653f96c75"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.3c03127"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-63487-63-8","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397862","5e70928b878c28a047397868"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Rodzina w cyklu życia -

The coatings were made on a nickel superalloy of IN 625 type with a NiCrAlY base bond coat. The technique of atmospheric plasma spray was used for coatings depositions. Three types of composite coatings, made of a mixture of base powders with the proportion of components 25–75, 50–50 and 75–25, were evaluated. The thickness of the ceramic layers was approximately 300 μm. The TBC systems were then subjected to high temperature oxidation at 1100 °C for up to 2000 h in air. Changes in phase composition were evaluated by the XRD method after 48, 175, 500, 1000 and 2000 h of exposure. Detailed microstructural studies with the use of scanning microscopy methods were performed after 2000 h. The GZO + 8YSZ composite coatings were found to be characterized by high susceptibility to changes in phase composition, which is related to the formation of new zirconate phases with a lower content of gadolinium oxide (in the case of zirconates) and phases based on zirconium oxide with a higher content of gadolinium oxide. The observed changes are diffusive and take place predominantly within the GZO phase. Additional structural effects observed during SEM studies are the phenomena of the formation of a network of numerous small voids in the GZO phase, which suggests the course of nonequilibrium diffusion processes. Furthermore, a high concentration of nickel oxide and a slightly lower concentration of chromium oxide were found in the ceramic layer."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233459","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"462","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surfcoat.2023.129471","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"676a75bafdbe831a382615d7","name":"Albano","lastName":"Cavalerio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"79daddd3-4566-4601-9949-d97be12e06bb"},{"objectId":"676a75bafdbe831a382615d6","name":"Amjad","lastName":"Iqbal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b503035a-486b-4106-9754-9dbf6d47c457"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aaea2","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Myalska-Głowacka","uuid":"A1F079B7A15C33BCDD8E9BDAFDBAE8827E5774C48D3F8CC67BA6F3E53968964115B3F9EC7126353D89A606A2291D5C547D784D638DD695600447EEAC8088C12D","orcidId":"0000-0003-0725-7792","documentHash":"fbc2d127-ae1f-4bb0-9a96-7dbd52c6e9b2"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Moskal","uuid":"78C02F7E257C44906FFD96A25B79CE805A883E092168DBB1C916E8C0421591B7D21DBAE421486318FE761EBD6790F1978B94EB690598741EF5087FF8B957C5EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7396-6568","documentHash":"30f43abd-3ddb-475b-bab8-a2f62e94c049"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390889","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Pawlik","uuid":"BBBBD91D500EAA61E7DB443D33DE971CA84C81B0D1E61286AA14A848B8F98E3CB0EBD787AE0981F6F281C4D1FD2B23AC69B09D1504190DEDCB331D972F756CBC","orcidId":"0000-0002-0623-6319","documentHash":"cb2157a1-4dab-4d89-bf8e-5001be8eeda0"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.surfcoat.2023.129471"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["2-butyno-1","4-diol","2-metylo-2-pentenal","2-metylo-3-butyn-2-ol","uwodornienie

this study, the manufacturing of Co-Al-W alloys by smelting in a vacuum induction furnace was discussed taking into account the optimizing of the feedstock material morphology. Herein, the influence of various feedstock conditions and the order of introducing the alloying elements into a liquid alloy were analyzed and described. The investigation revealed that it was possible to obtain the desired chemical composition of Co-Al-W alloys using fragmented tungsten pellets introduced from a vacuum feeder into the liquid Co-Al alloy heated above the liquidus temperature to maximum of 40-50?C. This technical variant required accurate temperature control of the molten alloy, which did not ensure complete reproducibility. The disadvantage of this process was a relatively high slag formation. The optimal technical solution involved obtaining the liquid Co-W solution and introducing Al at the end of the smelting process; in this variant, the slagging effect was relatively low. Additionally, melting of the alloy in an argon atmosphere reduced the loss of aluminum due to evaporation, as compared to melting in a vacuum. The smelting process could be carried out either in Al2O3 solid crucibles or in compacted crucibles made of MgO-based refractory mass.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233467","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"58","pagesFromTo":"179-189","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"676a7635fdbe831a38261761","name":"Damian","lastName":"Migas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b6e4c1c6-c11c-4a30-94ab-5f6b2001cad1"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba407","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Witala","uuid":"80DC8DE5A28F1B7FA59181A27A48D75A4DE91E3B218AB4269B3DDF369C76DC0F0A29DF9743456376A8D8E62DC9C9B06A7D071AF581EF15602A126BC4E4C657ED","orcidId":"0000-0003-0460-6555","documentHash":"4c46e0b5-8edb-4fcd-a313-6223357f580d"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Moskal","uuid":"78C02F7E257C44906FFD96A25B79CE805A883E092168DBB1C916E8C0421591B7D21DBAE421486318FE761EBD6790F1978B94EB690598741EF5087FF8B957C5EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7396-6568","documentHash":"30f43abd-3ddb-475b-bab8-a2f62e94c049"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921c7","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Mikuszewski","uuid":"E9EF83DC04A89EC32EF07AE34E2E1B7A169FE2139B5617DE345C5246C08CD3E5B76524BC014F04134DE014522EB0F9A80894ACD61105E1CE68F7CFB857079FAF","orcidId":"0000-0002-4825-0960","documentHash":"1da1c10c-2eef-4513-afb4-32994d64fa7d"},{"objectId":"5e709222878c28a047390647","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tomaszewska","uuid":"A049731799714A7730F31FFB1F95770DE07ACB33B845EFE540B7E4E625DF8DEC6BB4A137884EE626A690E627FC504EC7F96FC0898770AC88CC54FA02FC39E86F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3962-000X","documentHash":"df7ae5e4-cf3f-4dfe-8a0e-e3bb57f73408"}],"doi":"10.2298/jmmb211107002m"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["SBEM","potencjał błony mitochondrialnej","rozszczepienie","fuzja","Hirudinidae"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fusion","SBEM","fission","mitochondrial membrane potential","Hirudinidae"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929c878c28a0473991ad"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The three-dimensional conformation and activity of mitochondria in syncytial male germ line-cysts of medicinal leeches","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477574","mniswId":"3358","title":"Cell and Tissue Research","doi":null,"issn":"0302-766X","eissn":"1432-0878","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f38251ec-0b86-4ace-bfad-1e9ccfe6f929"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"650be8bc409707102d685e57","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929c878c28a0473991ad","677d0ae2fdbe831a382d2d34","677d0ae2fdbe831a382d2d35","677d0ae2fdbe831a382d2d36"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We studied the spatial conformation and activity of mitochondria in the developing syncytial male germline cysts during spermatogenesis of the medicinal leeches using light, fluorescent, transmission electron microscopy, and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy.

Here, we investigated the effects of this phage cocktail on the hematological parameters and selected biochemical markers in chickens infected with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, in comparison to those caused by enrofloxacin or colistin. We found that treatment with antibiotics (especially with enrofloxacin) caused nonbeneficial effects on red blood cell parameters, including hematocrit, MCV, MCH, and MCHC. However, Salmonella-induced changes in the aforementioned parameters were normalized by the use of the phage cocktail. Importantly, hepatotoxicity was suggested to be induced by both antibiotics on the basis of increased alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, in contrast to the phage cocktail, which did not influence these enzymes. We conclude that phage therapy with the cocktail of vB_SenM-2 and vB_Sen-TO17 in Salmonella-infected chickens is not only as effective as antibiotics but also significantly safer for the birds than enrofloxacin and colistin."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233494","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fde19543c723365437ad","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Grabowski","uuid":"4E4229890907E26206BC718587B887C2975594BAD4C75F7759B0CFDE9CFCCB5CCCDC19189D2424E18782DC2E345891604C6A157B1EC5FF43F90284DC8BC2AC70","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"635bc4e9-e5b5-4f47-bb9d-6b8a3db56524"},{"objectId":"5e70945c878c28a0473bb601","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Podlacha","uuid":"4F73ED0F1AC816F3B30E405380FD6F444F88A9E55205C349760853EE67A6796C542DF813917AEAAF69FD30EC09D147D6C727F38438B8127351ED041D7B7BA9B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7709-5955","documentHash":"f82f8a13-8fd5-4a2a-9091-2251a39622b3"},{"objectId":"5e7093be878c28a0473b010b","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Węgrzyn","uuid":"DF23C5A89302278DC5E04AE4E0F609BB151B10A7153101AF79ABE72ECD4A4A699784E8523188DD7661716CF0315BC2713D3567CC94725AC9306A5CD94756A45E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3073-2814","documentHash":"b4182077-118c-4ce6-bc90-4cfd022e605d"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931c8","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Węgrzyn","uuid":"A469E34D344425E81483D591AD304ECA0BD06E82101A57C8F81C3F7F51F06AEE4CF9BA3B9C888B51971D42B797F240E6C3C6DBCC9579819D19B981C0CAECF418","orcidId":"0000-0003-4042-7466","documentHash":"3b1ccf83-c10d-421d-bcfa-c3cb7d3daa3b"}],"doi":"10.3390/antibiotics11121787"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Neolithic","Brześć Kujawski culture","T-shaped antler axes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63c546e94097074bb0bdd82f","doi":null,"title":"Walking among ancient trees : studies in honour of Ryszard Grygiel and Peter Bogucki on the 45th anniversary of their research collaboration","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-948140-9-0","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://omega.umk.pl/info/book/UMKed82567f3a9b4b01bf992ac4d487771a/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"7f906724-6fd2-4d12-a2b2-44d665c56b29","publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e701d","mniswId":"84600","name":"Wydawnictwo Fundacji Badań Archeologicznych Imienia Profesora Konrada Jażdżewskiego","documentHash":"716384bb-551c-4109-b49f-f19a939088c3"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396db3"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"T-shaped antler axes and their role in building exchange networks in the southwestern Baltic zone in the 5th millennium cal BC","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6572cfd14097071b8e6dbc74","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709281878c28a047396db3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"According to the most popular view, T-shaped deer-antler axes (T-axes) belong to the patterns characterizing hunting cultures and their use by agricultural communities of the Neolithic era is an example of the transfer of products and technologies from the world of hunters.

The history of T-axe use covers some 2,500 years, as the search for the historical roots of the Danube farmers required a trip all the way back to the Çatalhöyük and deer taboo among first farmers. The most important period in the history of T-axes began in the early 5th millennium cal BC with the standardization and mutual exchange between hunters with farmers that resulted in the elimination of other patterns. These tools acted a part in the creation of an extensive network of exchanges that for a thousand of years linked communities of Danubian farmers and hunters representing, at least, four different traditions: the British Isles, the southern shores of the North Sea, the SW coast of the Baltic Sea and the SE coast of the Baltic Sea. Direct relationships with farmers may have provided the impetus for the mass production of T-axes due to which they gained the status of valuable exchange

article presents III-V InAs/InAsSb type-II superlattice (T2SL) mid-wave infrared (MWIR, 100 % cut-off wavelength, λcut-off ∼ 7.5 μm at 333 K) interband cascade photodetector (ICIP) developed to operate at temperatures > 300 K. That device solves the low quantum efficiency (QE) problem of the typical “thick absorber” photodetectors designed for high operating temperature (HOT, > 300 K) conditions. The 5-stage epilayer was grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on the lattice-mismatched GaAs substrates where absorbers are connected by the highly doped standard n+/p+ tunnel junctions. The developed and analyzed high-speed MWIR devices should be implemented in the emerging fields such as frequency comb spectroscopy (FCS), free space optical communication (FSO) and light detection and ranging (LIDAR). The majority of the MWIR ICIPs’ research have been focused on the QE increase and dark current suppressing to improve the detectivity (D*) while the high- frequency operation (HFO) is still not completely investigated.

During sporulation, the cell undergoes morphological changes including asymmetric division and chromosome translocation into the forespore. However, the fate of translational machinery during sporulation has not been described. Here, using microscopy and mass spectrometry, we show the localisation of ribosomes during sporulation in wild type and mutant Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that ribosomes are associated with the asymmetric septum, a functionally important organelle in the cell’s developmental control, and that SpoIIDMP-driven peptidoglycan rearrangement is crucial for ribosomes packing into the forespore. We also show that the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ ‘feeding-tube’ channel is not required for ribosome translocation. Our results demonstrate that translation and translational machinery are temporally and spatially organised in B. subtilis during sporulation and that the forespore ‘inherits’ ribosomes from the mother cell. We propose that the movement of ribosomes in the cell may be mediated by the bacterial homologs of cytoskeletal proteins and that the cues for asymmetric division localisation may be translation-dependent. We anticipate our findings to elicit more sophisticated structural and mechanistic studies of ribosome organisation during bacterial cell development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233515","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677a76fafdbe83484a6add03","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"21b88401-24c1-47f0-ac43-4d2696696c87"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"354

simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is a well-studied herpesvirus that causes various human diseases. Like other herpesviruses, HSV-1 produces the transmembrane glycoprotein N (gN/UL49.5 protein), which has been extensively studied, but its function in HSV-1 remains largely unknown. The amino-acid sequences and lengths of UL49.5 proteins differ between herpesvirus species. It is, therefore, crucial to determine whether and to what extent the spatial structure of UL49.5 orthologs that are transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) inhibitors (i.e., of bovine herpesvirus 1; BoHV-1) differ from that of non-TAP inhibitors (i.e., of HSV-1). Our study aimed to examine the 3D structure of the HSV-1-encoded UL49.5 protein in an advanced model of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane using circular dichroism, 2D nuclear magnetic resonance, and multiple-microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in an ER membrane mimetic environment. According to our findings, the N-terminus of the HSV-1-encoded UL49.5 adopts a highly flexible, unordered structure in the extracellular part due to the presence of a large number of proline and glycine residues. In contrast to the BoHV-1-encoded homolog, the transmembrane region of the HSV-1-encoded UL49.5 is formed by a single long transmembrane α-helix, rather than two helices oriented perpendicularly, while the cytoplasmic part of the protein (C-terminus) has a short unordered structure. Our findings provide valuable experimental structural information on the HSV-1-encoded UL49.5 protein and offer, based on the obtained structure, insight into its lack of biological activity in inhibiting the TAP-dependent antigen presentation pathway."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233522","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1865","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cdb16fdbe831a3828552a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba4fe342-932e-4c41-bf43-81ba02f5e88e"},{"objectId":"677cdb16fdbe831a38285529","name":"Igor","lastName":"Zhukov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38ef43ff-b456-4f88-8eff-39433fa98f71"},{"objectId":"5e70945b878c28a0473bb457","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Karska","uuid":"11850476324F3EEF5ED0D7A54EB5D0C4A6CB20A6B4644D1DEEFE5FC5AC025C08F4A79A817B99793036DC3EE0ED1B4138CA127F80B93EC8CFCE03881F297B8AA5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c40c5e96-4512-4e07-a4ca-1eee5f16e175"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f4","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Rodziewicz-Motowidło","uuid":"DC1BA0FAC2CC1F07647DBDB64AFFC519F282E6ED5F74ED61933F2E6778A3E1B8AB4202511635282C89E36B6BD60DCC69643787FC203C73C6D7105C93FA51968A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4471-5951","documentHash":"78ad2a69-6641-4a64-9507-2d01299f8e34"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473930ea","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Lipińska","uuid":"839A455CE6F53DD4D63A4E809E67CF2922096B3445DC52C30F941F623AAA2345C1C9C798F5665F49F33D6D7F6A822CE179BFCF9893608071E52C65533B996A2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-8115-9499","documentHash":"504927d8-d976-4ca0-9130-115435de469c"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.bbamem.2023.184200"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63daa7ba409707687b0b7761","doi":"10.53271/2022.099","title":"Porada

Due to their operating conditions and martensitic structure, components made from P91 steel are often subject to damage related to the presence of hydrogen. This article compares the results of the mechanical properties evaluation for P91 steel in an aggressive solution charged under load and without load. Based on the research, it was found that the hydrogen environment significantly affects the mechanical properties of P91 steel, reducing strength and yield strength, and decreasing ductility. It was revealed that in samples tested after 72 h without preloading, the tensile strength decreased by 1.5%, and the elongation decreased by about 29% for the sample, compared to the delivered condition sample. Under loaded conditions, the difference in tensile strength increased by approximately 8%, while elongation increased by nearly

(There is a tendency that?) vaccination regimens demonstrate lower levels of immunity against the currently predominant Omicron variant, which results in the need for subsequent booster doses. Thus, bivalent formulations have been recently developed to additionally target the Omicron variant. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to assess whether bivalent vaccines would increase interest in vaccination among Poles. For this purpose, an original questionnaire distributed via the Internet and targeting Poles over the age of 18 was used. Results: The survey included 594 respondents, the vast majority of whom were women (79.3%), residents of large cities (44.7%) and those with a university education (86.3%). The average age was 36.6 &amp;plusmn; 9.67 years. Only 48.7% of respondents had heard of bivalent vaccination against COVID-19. 408 (72.3%) respondents confirmed that if they had the choice, they would opt for the bivalent preparation. People who have already taken at least 1 booster dose are by far the most common group. Among the unvaccinated, the percentage is only 8.9%. For 190 (33.7%) of respondents, the availability of bivalent preparations will help accelerate their decision to vaccinate against COVID-19. Conclusions: Bivalent vaccination is an important part of the fight against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is forecasted that its implementation will not contribute significantly to the increase in vaccination-related interest rate among those previously unvaccinated or only after the basic regimen. Therefore further observations in this direction are necessary."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233534","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"art.1658 [9 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/10/1658","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ecc874d7523406a2b8ea600","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Babicki","uuid":"180DC600DA6CDE98C10C0F59E0E9DFEAF3B7544C471A5C1DBED6E4752649A530F0718807061729C090227CDD0396080AA5E33F35FB35370D4447C536EEF823F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7719-6959","documentHash":"897aa32f-7f95-4b73-88f0-06b2af9f0ffb"}],"doi":"10.3390/vaccines10101658"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crying","mother-child relations","father-child relations","temperament","emotionality"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397862","5e709375878c28a0473aa17d","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4841","5e7092cb878c28a04739cc83","5e7093d8878c28a0473b1dbd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Parental negative emotionality and emotional reactions to child’s crying: the mediating role of child’s temperament","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547ab83","mniswId":"5242","title":"Early Child Development and Care","doi":null,"issn":"0300-4430","eissn":"1476-8275","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7977f50b-11ab-4d12-8a46-cacdd38e044a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"5fde764f2467f02e42d122aa","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709375878c28a0473aa17d","5e7093d8878c28a0473b1dbd","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4841","5e70928b878c28a047397862","5e7092cb878c28a04739cc83"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Child’s crying is the stimuli serving the development of a child–parent relationship through evoking child-oriented and parent-oriented parental reactions.

The test samples were examined under the conditions of slide mating, where the main destructive process was surface microcutting via loose corundum grains. The mass loss of the examined samples was measured as a parameter characteristic of the wear. The volume loss values thus obtained were plotted as a function of initial hardness.

The purpose of this study is to look into the long-term potentiodynamic polarization measurements and dry tribometric behavior of plasma-sprayed amorphous coatings on AISI 1035 mild steel. To investigate the impact of unique active polarization potentials on the electrochemical studies of the iron-based amorphous layer, which compares favorably to AISI 1035 mild steel, the active potential polarization curve and friction coefficient tests were performed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) analyses were used to investigate the coating’s corrosion behavior. Their mechanical (Tribometric tests at higher sliding speeds) and chemical properties (electrochemical potentiodynamic polarization investigations) have also been thoroughly investigated. There is enough validation that these protective coatings can be used in hostile environments. The effects of long-term corrosion for 24 and 48 h were thoroughly examined. Tribometric examinations revealed that amorphous layers are highly resistant under dry conditions, as they offered a very low and stable friction coefficient less than 4 μ with micro Vickers hardness 1140 ± 22.14 HV, which is more than twice as compared to mild steel AISI 1035.

Contrary to the so-far-studied topics related to the CT imaging of burnt bones and their virtual exploration, we concentrated on the analysis of the structures formed by the soil fauna activity in the fills of urns and additional vessels, and reconstruction of the dynamics of the ecosystem variability within the cemetery area based on thereof. We also demonstrated the impact of macrofaunal activity on stratigraphy and bone fragmentation. From the total of 222 excavated burials in 18 urns and one additional vessel, the remains of macrofauna or its bioturbation activity were identified. Out of 19 vessels subjected to CT examinations, traces of macrofaunal activity were demonstrated in 13: in five vessels animal bioturbative activity was not observed and in one, observations was impossible (due to significant metal-related artifacts). In two vessels both macrofaunal remains and traces of activity were identified. Discovered bioturbations were associated with specific species or genera. Nests or their parts of the genus Geotrupes sp. beetles were the most frequently observed traces of macrofaunal activity. Tunnels and aestivation chambers of earthworms and chambers of the genus Harpalus sp. beetles filled with Setaria sp. caryopses were discovered. The chitinous parts of other insects and the humerus bones of the vole of the genus Microtus sp. were also identified. It was shown, especially due to the non-destructive method, that rodents activity had the most destructive effect on the bone stratigraphy as well as on the movement and fragmentation of the burnt bones. The chances of visualizing bioturbations decreased with time since their creation. The process of disappearance of traces of macrofaunal activity concerned both traces of rodent activity and nests set up by Geotrupes sp. and other species."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233573","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"art.e0274068 [30 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274068","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d37e4fdbe831a382eda1e","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Gmyrek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a791182-0d84-4bcd-a46f-f16c97bd9efc"},{"objectId":"677d37e4fdbe831a382eda1d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kadej","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b638ab1-bf98-493c-a2bb-2a9bac59ea46"},{"objectId":"677d37e4fdbe831a382eda1c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Hałuszko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14c98d89-a41d-4919-8107-8bebd02d45f4"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12f3","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Guziński","uuid":"7CF74BEEB4CC6FC10169FE39D0612C1495B6202F59EABC8AA6B95F7B1E0D4D19C8CAF1FA6F1FF5FC323B8DA4C8B8A0D7DE6F15C8720061A703E772DECB3B1AC6","orcidId":"0000-0002-9781-2114","documentHash":"9a9066c6-0649-4332-a7ae-6006b7dee90d"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0274068"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["multi-proxy analysis","Late Weichselian","denudation processes","paleoclimate","central European river"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d2878c28a0473b15cc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Changes in habitat conditions in a Late Glacial fluviogenic lake in response to climatic fluctuations (Warta River valley, central Poland)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e0b","mniswId":"7116","title":"Geological Quarterly","doi":null,"issn":"1641-7291","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a336509f-1e06-46e8-967c-7ec42654f243"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6426d8874097071b41deef1d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d2878c28a0473b15cc","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e100d","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e100e","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e100f","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e1010","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e1011","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e1012","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e1013","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e1014","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e1015","677d2fc1fdbe831a382e1016"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Warta River valley was greatly influenced by the ice sheet of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

After the Poznań Phase (LGM), Ługi functioned as an oxbow lake that was cut off from the active river channel as a result of fluvial erosion. Since that time, the Warta River has flowed only along the section now occupied by the Jeziorsko Reservoir. Sedimentation of lacustrine deposits started at the beginning of the Late Glacial. Summer temperature reconstructions indicate cool Oldest and Younger Dryas, but no clear cooling in the Older Dryas.

Podocytes are an important component of the glomerular filter, and their role in maintaining the structural integrity of this structure was established. These cells rely on a constant energy supply and reservoir. The utilization of alternative energy substrates to preserve energetic homeostasis is a subject of extensive research, and lactate appears to be one such candidate. Therefore, we investigated the role of lactate as an energy substrate and characterize the lactate transport system in cultured rat podocytes during sufficient and insufficient glucose supplies. The present study, for the first time, demonstrated the presence of lactate transporters in podocytes. Moreover, we observed modified the amount of these transporters in response to limited glucose availability and after l-lactate supplementation. Simultaneously, exposure to l-lactate preserved cell survival during insufficient glucose supply. Interestingly, during glucose deprivation, lactate exposure allowed the steady flow of glycolysis and prevented glycogen reserves depletion. Summarizing, podocytes utilize lactate as an energy substrate and possess a developed system that controls lactate homeostasis, suggesting that it plays an essential role in podocyte metabolism, especially during fluctuations of energy availability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233592","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"102","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2023.151298","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3058fdbe831a382e247c","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Rachubik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2701af2b-9493-488f-b70f-6032cb1b1f30"},{"objectId":"677d3058fdbe831a382e247b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pikul","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c5e0484-8760-4c7c-8876-dcb61c64da99"},{"objectId":"677d3058fdbe831a382e247a","name":"Maria","lastName":"Szrejder","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4921b19-03db-409e-b32d-d7f25dfcb89a"},{"objectId":"5e709478878c28a0473bddbb","name":"Irena","lastName":"Audzeyenka","uuid":"80BFF386940888E20E37F9FAB72AF07B12D83D095F6A9BF8B2B7C47A3C4C9FAADB2E6AD70BF876920E207E027611052629623C020CA029D48D5EAE8080652FDD","orcidId":"0000-0002-1322-4332","documentHash":"9526dea5-0b60-450c-9316-5c8f8bfbadac"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b556b","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Typiak","uuid":"F5AEE19067E827C0DC480C34CE45E468C6F67640DF5D97319D7F3152A124506A305FC4495F6C776C7C8545485417C6C49733A5886C502385F1EB927137F3BA93","orcidId":"0000-0002-9687-1016","documentHash":"0d1ffa57-fa21-4df0-b69c-491cde190863"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ad78","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Narajczyk","uuid":"07D6D9B09A7456585BF29267E23B005E2438A4A075BA3CF503D86B46CE27CEE75BF1FBA48FFD2B54EB2E44B0633FE81DCB14A823A68696267E737460F8419942","orcidId":"0000-0001-9806-8844","documentHash":"948d98e8-bcbb-443b-9ec7-c20653f96c75"},{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a04739748c","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Rogacka","uuid":"8CB665FFD829ECDDDB9687C72162F72163D23575F221B56752D99D666B9CDFB0B14568BA387499B72BE4BAF520FA69F8AAD25F019881CD89968BDE2D702218FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-6242-0324","documentHash":"0be27805-a67c-4522-b648-611a5f0dd550"},{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a047397485","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Piwkowska","uuid":"0752CAC8B1544173E21F873E779F1D05B70CEE7F3CA612B01C80EE606A6D68B0B0ACD7D3D3D98D558D50C612E9A564BF7E320B9F58A7E7F81CDBED0FE64C4C32","orcidId":"0000-0002-0086-7777","documentHash":"ca66dcca-9455-4514-96c1-1e49746f5982"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ejcb.2023.151298"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mandible","Orthodontic anchorage procedures","Orthodontics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Mandibular buccal shelf miniscrews, used for distalization, play a particularly important role in treatment of Class III malocclusion. Unfortunately, stability of the miniscrews placed in the mandible is still considered at higher risk of failure compared to other intraoral locations. The aim of our study was to determine the influence of the miniscrew size on their long-term stability, occurrence of oral mucosa inflammation and pain lasting over 48 h after implantation. Methods 184 Absoanchor® miniscrews (Dentos, South Korea) in two sizes: SH2018-10 (length 10 mm, ø 1.8–2.0 mm) and SH1514-08 (length 8 mm, ø 1.4–1.5 mm) were inserted in the mandibular buccal shelf in 92 Caucasians aged 20–50 years, diagnosed with Class III malocclusion that required en-masse distalization of the mandibular dentition. Data was statistically analyzed with the level of significance set at p = .05. Results 91.3% of the SH2018-10 and 75% of the SH1514-08 miniscrews were stable, and this difference was statistically significant (p < .05). Inflammation of the oral mucosa was noticed around both types of miniscrews and affected 50% of the SH2018-10 and 26.09% of the SH1514-08 group (p < .05). Pain lasting longer than 48 h after implantation was related to 60.87% and 20.65% of the SH2018-10 and the SH1514-08 miniscrews (p < .05), respectively. Inflammation associated with larger SH2018-10 miniscrews did not affect their stability (p > .05), contrary to the SH1514-08 ones (p < .05). When inflammation was present, the overall success rate declined to 64.29%, from 94.74% noted for TADs without inflammation. According to the log-rank test, smaller TADs failed significantly sooner than the larger ones (p = .002). Conclusion Larger SH2018-10 miniscrews are the anchorage of choice for the mandibular buccal shelf, despite triggering inflammation and long-lasting pain significantly more often than the smaller ones. Therefore, this issue should be discussed with every patient prior to miniscrew use. Trial registration ID: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05280678 Date of Registration: 15/03/2022.

study investigates short cationic antimicrobial lipopeptides composed of 2–4 amino acid residues and C12-C18 fatty acids attached to the N-terminal part of the peptides. The findings were discussed in the context of the relationship among biological activity, self-assembly, stability, and membrane interactions. All the lipopeptides showed the ability to self-assemble in PBS solution. In most cases, the critical aggregation concentration (CAC) much surpassed the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, suggesting that monomers are the main active form of lipopeptides. The introduction of β-alanine into the peptide sequence resulted in a compound with a high propensity to fibrillate, which increased the peptide stability and activity against S. epidermidis and C. albicans and reduced the cytotoxicity against human keratinocytes. The results of our study indicated that the target of action of lipopeptides is the bacterial membrane. Interestingly, the type of peptide counterion may affect the degree of penetration of the lipid bilayer. In addition, the binding of the lipopeptide to the membrane of Gram-negative bacteria may lead to the release of calcium ions necessary for stabilization of the lipopolysaccharide layer."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233610","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3134fdbe831a382e405e","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kamysz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1fb78422-4bde-4b9b-a51a-9e5e8f8ba65f"},{"objectId":"677d3134fdbe831a382e405d","name":"Karol","lastName":"Sikora","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59a623bf-db50-4de5-9139-59ff0a3bdfd6"},{"objectId":"677d3134fdbe831a382e405c","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Bartoszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5223bf37-83bd-4cfe-9138-485d7c93909d"},{"objectId":"677d3134fdbe831a382e405b","name":"Marta","lastName":"Bauer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9d222f8e-b410-416d-b242-41fdf67d3412"},{"objectId":"677d3134fdbe831a382e405a","name":"Damian","lastName":"Neubauer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44c82a88-365c-4048-927a-b17fd819db88"},{"objectId":"677d3134fdbe831a382e4059","name":"Oktawian","lastName":"Stachurski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1714611a-8cbc-4aee-8a28-1804aa829567"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac14e","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Iłowska","uuid":"8F31734A78F78E5D9E2FB2FC2FF963D5C614C38CEAACCCF3C7D71D99B4A44E7CE76AABA239F0091BD49B33E8FDB0ECBA097A942471664C297A650DE2C45DFC11","orcidId":"0000-0002-5774-3644","documentHash":"75c0f158-c930-4995-ba38-3add10e3b01e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aef9","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Walewska","uuid":"593E483C4D3C2896BA76CF0BA3642D69FC2CAEF535F2FC005BD4417824297DC4415C752A2A077C1B0427C2A04AFCC30E2F43344F48DEFEEF6DAA72A540C6D06B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6153-4880","documentHash":"ede6fa83-b49c-4283-b3ce-acc0135eb95f"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aee6","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Sikorska","uuid":"14145B355DCACEB3489F7A81C3272934DF5357131DD3A971D361FBACA62EA9A9158972ADFE65EECE6EA9C5FF9F8D8C1273A73A8632C48AAAE9A6FF01F309C464","orcidId":"0000-0001-7851-6371","documentHash":"27a0e684-6fc9-450b-bf55-23301ff3a6ef"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ad85","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Hać","uuid":"6282499D993D385F8EAA9F777DA254998389C0B18DB5438CFB0F29DB79EA4289A47683CA92C6D413A65D2EA07D166D0185DAAB021D4B3CCAAB8147849409D60B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0478-3263","documentHash":"0badc709-cd0f-4c23-8075-263b70324cac"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394bc4","name":"Adam","lastName":"Prahl","uuid":"A62727AA090C1F208538180A69B82DDAFAAAD30E836BA27308046E53F89B93C65DC0613FA9FE2E6E99E5DE84747A6ED7C8D765978CEDF65D2989389A94CEAF61","orcidId":"0000-0001-7663-6548","documentHash":"228d3286-af85-4450-9b93-71ed1491b175"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931fb","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wyrzykowski","uuid":"3B956F9C0B7686ED59275CFF3B8648BA8F9C3CB89F93EE35AB167E88A6838A0B159273F225F93E005C235A3E473106580C59CB88CEC569E4F34A6BC83DBE7B2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-3286","documentHash":"f1e4ddf0-1ffe-4622-a596-7c9ab1503df1"}],"doi":"10.3390/antibiotics11111491"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika

The intercritical annealing (IA) approach at different temperatures in a range of 640 °C to 800 °C is proposed in the study for a 5Mn hot-rolled medium-Mn sheet steel. The experiments were performed in terms of dilatometry. The analysis of the cooling curves allowed development of a new method for calculating the high-temperature phase equilibrium. The calculations were validated by modeling with JMatPro and experimentally verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The microstructure evolution was characterized using light optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), including electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). The quantitative determination of the fraction, morphology, chemical composition, and stability of the RA was done. Mechanical properties were determined by hardness measurements. The research showed a substantial influence of the IA temperature on the RA fraction and chemical stability and properties of medium-Mn Al-alloyed steel. At temperatures of 680 °C and 700 °C, the largest fraction of over 35 pct of stable RA was obtained, which does not transform to martensite during cooling."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233614","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"53","pagesFromTo":"3012-3021","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-022-06721-2","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cdbb0fdbe831a3828a66b","name":"Roumen H.","lastName":"Petrov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64b6dac8-148e-4355-bd45-59493faefac5"},{"objectId":"677cdbb0fdbe831a3828a66a","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Janik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7324c73-3169-435b-9a7a-65d707654d02"},{"objectId":"5f1a58f37523405869ccc3a9","name":"Adam","lastName":"Skowronek","uuid":"E58B92D8C57FAFB258FA8E3F67BFC3D5E00441186B532A04DF316C0180681259B48F041008BC5DF411C5597FD121D7087E5FAAB087252F8E7C7B2D7C5E6AB7D2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8342-8640","documentHash":"6b0a115f-acb7-4fb8-b5af-61fa52f25197"},{"objectId":"5e709385878c28a0473abc93","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Morawiec","uuid":"5F8EE0491873A974C383474B45B58E6BE140512D2FFA28A3BB91C17695C031D817C38ACCD04D081985328C492BB2B9E9A6BAA5F5F87CEC2370029A0A6089DA56","orcidId":"0000-0003-1500-1228","documentHash":"fdee64a1-389f-4355-ba12-c4ec71ac0cfc"},{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abb44","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kozłowska","uuid":"CD8E9B0B579158B7ED72BE7F6BFBA3246ED3258CD352157F51484D5745F1B69B0773AE482C89CCD9F279FD2E7451E6B5F26D650AD409B0BA779D6D0CF80DD5A9","orcidId":"0000-0001-9426-3052","documentHash":"e50cc3cb-54d6-43e5-b57f-5a9c2cbbbde2"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739327b","name":"Adam","lastName":"Grajcar","uuid":"C4CE33F5AD96128A9D60FBA5D3084B6BBCD5703E0472E8108C8E36C2DE5C41C7AE8D4B3133D277738D7349745603E43B59B439F0634F212DE36DDE620E5522F6","orcidId":"0000-0002-5520-9683","documentHash":"52beb49b-dfa7-4930-bceb-9686e4535ca7"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11661-022-06721-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66984-31-8","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Szpital XXI wieku.

CI is also a frequent, burdensome symptom among renal transplant recipients (RTR); however, its pathophysiology is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to assess the differences in concentration of IL-31 among itchy RTR. The study was performed on a group of selected 129 RTRs (54 itchy and 75 non-itchy patients). Itch severity was assessed with the use of the numeral rating scale (NRS) and the 4-item itch questionnaire (4IIQ). Every subject had his blood drawn to measure the concentration of IL-31. The results were subsequently compared and correlated. The mean concentration differed significantly between RTR suffering from itch (602.44 ± 534.5 pg/mL), non-itchy RTR (161.49 ± 106.61 pg/mL), and HC (110.33 ± 51.81 pg/mL) (p &lt; 0.001). Post-hoc analysis revealed a statistically significantly increased IL-31 serum concentration in itchy RTR in comparison to the non-itchy RTR group (p &lt; 0.001) and HC (p &lt; 0.001). No significant difference was observed in IL-31 serum levels between non-itchy RTRs and HC. No correlation between IL-31 and itch intensity was found.

It forms an extra-ovular female gametophyte, which surpasses the entire micropylar canal and extends beyond the limit of the integument and invades the placenta tissues. Due to the atypical behavior of the female gametophyte, it is interesting to determine the interaction between the gametophyte and sporophytic tissue. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the placenta, the ovular tissues, the hypertrophied central cell and the integument in guiding the pollen tube in Utricularia nelumbifolia Gardner by studying the distribution of homogalacturonans and hemicelluloses. It was also determined whether the distribution of the homogalacturonans (HG) and hemicelluloses in Utricularia are dependent on pollination. The antibodies directed against the wall components (anti-pectin: JIM5, JIM7, LM19, LM20 and the anti-hemicelluloses: LM25, LM11, LM15, LM20, LM21) were used. Because both low- and high-esterified HG and xyloglucan were observed in the placenta, ovule (integument, chalaza) and female gametophyte of both pollinated and unpollinated flowers, the occurrence of these cell-wall components was not dependent on pollination. After fertilization, low methyl-esterified HGs were still observed in the cell walls of somatic cells and female gametophyte. However, in the case of high-esterified HG, the signal was weak and occurred only in the cell walls of the somatic cells. Because xyloglucans were observed in the cell walls of the synergids and egg cells, this suggests that they play a role in sexual reproduction. Utricularia nelumbifolia with an extra ovule-female gametophyte is presented as an attractive model for studying the male-female dialogue in plants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233630","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11030475","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3119fdbe831a382e3cbd","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bogucka-Kocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56df06c9-c203-4cc0-bcf5-62c7d9eede7a"},{"objectId":"677d3119fdbe831a382e3cbc","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Stolarczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f5ca8a6-77c1-4176-a3d8-d636ed8d57d7"},{"objectId":"677d3119fdbe831a382e3cbb","name":"Bartosz J.","lastName":"Płachno","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad945e7b-5e73-430e-b8d8-33f5073cf59b"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ad86","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kapusta","uuid":"A18C313E9B6E4F881DDDBD06982E0930A78B3148C261212FF0C3181BE232E5A14D37C9B4E98952D6B1C7D063378017AB9FF4DF7AFF6DA0417D9A120125BD2EE3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4103-594X","documentHash":"4f6acf30-e770-442c-a308-596139dd3da9"}],"doi":"10.3390/cells11030475"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["alginian","kości","rusztowania","chrząstki","inżynieria tkankowa","biodruk 3D"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alginate","tissue engineering","scaffolds","cartilage","3D bioprinting","bone"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6040c3c49543c711bc6ea851"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Alginate based hydrogel inks for 3D bioprinting of engineered orthopedic tissues","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547753f","mniswId":"3243","title":"Carbohydrate Polymers","doi":null,"issn":"0144-8617","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c286039e-3a04-4eba-ac21-f6a7e1962904"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63ac101640970769fc780338","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6040c3c49543c711bc6ea851","677d0b4dfdbe831a382d500e","677d0b4dfdbe831a382d500f","677d0b4dfdbe831a382d5010","677d0b4dfdbe831a382d5011","677d0b4dfdbe831a382d5012","677d0b4dfdbe831a382d5013","677d0b4dfdbe831a382d5014"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"3D printed hydrogels have emerged as a novel tissue engineering and regeneration platform due to their ability to provide a suitable environment for cell growth. To obtain a well-defined scaffold with good post-printing shape fidelity, a proper hydrogel ink formulation plays a crucial role. In this regard, alginate has received booming interest owing to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, easy functionalization, and fast gelling behavior. Hence, this review highlights the significance of alginate-based hydrogel inks for fabricating 3D printed scaffolds for bone and cartilage regeneration.

The intensity and universality of this influence is an important element of the process of Westernization, especially in traditional cultures such as that of Poland. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the differences between Polish gay and heterosexual men in terms of the role played by self-esteem and the level of internalization of sociocultural standards of body appearance as predictors of the development of their body images. The research study was conducted by reference to 19- to 29-year-old Polish heterosexual (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 287) and gay (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 97) men. The variables were measured using Polish versions of the Sociocultural Attitudes towards Appearance Scale-3, the Self-Esteem Scale, and the Multidimensional Body–Self Relations Questionnaire. Statistical analyses identified several variables as the main predictors of body image in both heterosexual and gay young men: self-esteem, information-seeking, perceived pressure and the internalization of sociocultural standards regarding an athletic body image drawn from mass media. The only significant difference between the two groups was the fact that self-esteem, perceived pressure and the internalization of sociocultural standards from mass media did not play a predictive role with respect to Appearance Orientation among the group of gay men."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233634","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0272907","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cf1a9fdbe831a382b805d","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Wojtas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b75b9d5-6e61-460f-9450-08be01e99060"},{"objectId":"677cf1a9fdbe831a382b805c","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Lipowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7c309a5-9f33-4924-acf6-de030cb15b7e"},{"objectId":"677cf1a9fdbe831a382b805b","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Lizińczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03f1393d-4dc8-4fed-bf7b-de37724a0cdc"},{"objectId":"677cf1a9fdbe831a382b805a","name":"Bernadetta","lastName":"Izydorczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7f25c6a2-0553-45e8-8b79-716d5239b11a"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473924fd","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Lipowska","uuid":"044D3C17320342716FE512C351DF8A7011D20597BA893001ABC5B69AC948975A1BCC35E3653A822F3CD251A4E3D78FE4EFD00DAAAE98D6818C05B93FDECE6125","orcidId":"0000-0002-7422-159X","documentHash":"ee433aa4-a1df-4941-a265-d30113136d6c"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0272907"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64a7e3df4097074cfbc858f3","doi":"10.53271/2023.085","title":"Ból u dziecka.

Aim: Our study aimed to evaluate the use of the COVID-GRAM score in patients with COVID-19 based on the data from the COronavirus in the LOwer Silesia (COLOS) registry. Material and methods: The study group (834 patients of Caucasian patients) was retrospectively divided into three arms according to the risk achieved on the COVID-GRAM score calculated at the time of hospital admission (between February 2020 and July 2021): low, medium, and high risk. The Omnibus chi-square test, Fisher test, and Welch ANOVA were used in the statistical analysis. Post-hoc analysis for continuous variables was performed using Tukey’s correction with the Games–Howell test. Additionally, the ROC analysis was performed over time using inverse probability of censorship (IPCW) estimation. The GRAM-COVID score was estimated from the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). Results: Most patients (65%) had a low risk of complications on the COVID-GRAM scale. There were 113 patients in the high-risk group (13%). In the medium- and high-risk groups, comorbidities occurred statistically significantly more often, e.g., hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation and flutter, heart failure, valvular disease, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), compared to low-risk tier subjects. These individuals were also patients with a higher incidence of neurological and cardiac complications in the past. Low saturation of oxygen values on admission, changes in C-reactive protein, leukocytosis, hyperglycemia, and procalcitonin level were associated with an increased risk of death during hospitalization. The troponin level was an independent mortality factor. A change from low to medium category reduced the overall survival probability by more than 8 times and from low to high by 25 times. The factor with the strongest impact on survival was the absence of other diseases. The medium-risk patient group was more likely to require dialysis during hospitalization. The need for antibiotics was more significant in the high-risk group on the GRAM score. Conclusion: The COVID-GRAM score corresponds well with total mortality. The factor with the strongest impact on survival was the absence of other diseases. The worst prognosis was for patients who were unconscious during admission. Patients with higher COVID-GRAM score were significantly less likely to return to full health during follow-up.

of many gram-negative bacteria relies upon delivery of type three effectors into host cells. To pass through the conduit of secretion machinery the effectors need to acquire an extended conformation, and in many bacterial species specific chaperones assist in this process. In plant pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, secretion of only few effectors requires the function of chaperones. This raises a question how chaperone-independent effectors achieve an appropriate conformation for the secretion. One such mechanism was previously described for AvrPto. It contains a pH-sensitive switch, which is involved in unfolding of the effector at the mildly acidic pH corresponding to the pH value of the bacterial cytosol, and refolding at the neutral pH. Therefore, it was proposed that the switch facilitates first translocation of AvrPto and then its maturation once the effector reaches the cytoplasm of host cell. Here we show that an atypical motif of HopQ1, another effector of P. syringae, reversibly binds calcium in pH-dependent manner, regulating the effector thermal stability. Therefore, we propose a model that HopQ1 traversing through the type three secretion system encounters conditions that maintain its extended conformation, while upon delivery into host cell the effector undergoes refolding."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233651","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"31796

Psychological effects of discrimination are known to have enduring impact on self-esteem, level of depression and severely influence body image satisfaction. The aim of that study was to examine relationship between level of empathy and level of anti-fat biases among young people in their early adulthood.The study was conducted  with undergraduate  students of pedagogy of the  Faculty of  Social Sciences of the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn. The study group consisted of 240 people (Mage= 21.07, SDage= 1.28, range from 19 to 25 years). The  applied  research tool was the Anti-Fat Attitudes Scale and the Empathic Sensitiveness Scale.The three empathy dimensions were significantly negatively correlated with anti-fat attitudes, i.e. empathic concern (r= −0.823, p< .001), personal distress (r= −0.833, p < .001), and perspective taking (r= −0.839, p < .001). There were significant effects of level of anti-fat attitudes on empathy scores, i.e. empathy concern F(2,237) = 212.732, p< 0.001, personal distress F(2,237) = 220.535, p< 0.001, and perspective taking F(2,237) = 204.646, p< 0.001.Level of  empathy proved to be  significantly negatively correlated with anti-fat attitudes.

The crucial features of such modified structures are the well-functioning linkages of the square units at their pivot points. This ensures the stable functioning of such structures in tension or compression. The presented geometrical analysis of these auxetic structures may facilitate their adequate construction and allow one to determine the expected values of their expansion as well as the desired porosity. The results are confirmed based on the behaviour of physical models produced by the assembly of square units. The change in the dimensions of the physical models when moving from a closed to an open position is consistent with the predictions of the geometric models. By modifying the well-known ‘rotating squares’ model, physical structures with auxetic properties are obtained that can be utilised in industrial conditions, where a simultaneous change of linear dimensions is needed—either in compression or in tension. The assembly method may prove efficient in building such structures, given the abilities of assembly robots to regularly arrange the unit cells in lines and rows and to connect them with rings at the designated positions (evenly spaced perforations). The presented auxetic structures might find their potential application in, e.g., expansion joints or structures in which the porosity is mechanically changed, such as mesoscale structures.

In comparison to other addictions, fairly little is known about the role of specific personality traits in compulsive shopping. In addition, few studies have investigated the unique contribution of shopping addiction in terms of explaining different facets of well-being above and beyond personality characteristics previously shown to\nbe related to psychosocial functioning. The present study shows validation of the Bergen Shopping Addiction Scale (BSAS) and a tentative integrated model of potential shopping addiction personality risk factors. BSAS was administered to 1156 Polish students. In addition, demographic variables, and personality traits (Big Five), self-esteem, self-efficacy, perceived narcissism, loneliness, social anxiety, and well-being indicators were measured. BSAS had acceptable fit with the data and demonstrated good reliability. The investigated model showed that shopping addiction was related to higher extraversion, perceived narcissism, and social anxiety, and lower agreeableness and general self-efficacy. Woman and older participants scored higher on BSAS. Shopping addiction was further related to all facets of impaired well-being and explained worse general health, and decreased sleep quality above and beyond other variables in the model. The results support the notion that shopping addiction may have specific personality risk factors with low agreeableness as an outstanding characteristic. This has implications for the development of early prevention and intervention programs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233669","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"3794-3810","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12144-021-01712-9.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cf169fdbe831a382b771a","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Czerwiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be54f69e-52e8-4d51-9eef-968f734b8602"},{"objectId":"677cf169fdbe831a382b7719","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Uzarska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea5e6c16-04c3-4841-8444-95b2ca03a00d"},{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e65c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Atroszko","uuid":"CFE6648365741C6DB0DE487F070D4E21AF30E197FE6E59AB7596E400A7189C9EC4B303B25A58B6F3B6D33D6A8A0BC64FCAD757B07EE72194CCE1313DDDB8DF5C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5707-3882","documentHash":"9c5497d3-2711-4685-a83b-05ede4e47079"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12144-021-01712-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["siblings","peers","media","role models","Materialism","parents"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397868","5e70928b878c28a047397876","677cf1dafdbe831a382b86e1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Environmental correlates of adolescent' materialism: interpersonal role models, media exposure, and family socio-economic status","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478550","mniswId":"10454","title":"Journal of Child and Family Studies","doi":null,"issn":"1062-1024","eissn":"1573-2843","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0fd161cc-0972-42fe-906e-1463e2a790ca"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61af3adb2467f044f4d94799","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928b878c28a047397876","5e70928b878c28a047397868","677cf1dafdbe831a382b86e0","677cf1dafdbe831a382b86e1","677cf1dafdbe831a382b86e2"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present study examined how adolescents' materialism relates to interpersonal materialism role models (i.e., mothers', fathers', siblings', and peers'), media exposure, and family socio-economic status (SES).

Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a pressing issue in women’s reproductive health, often accompanied by post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The traumatic experiences arising from repeated reproductive losses not only exhaust a woman’s mental health but also impact endocrine and immunological regulation, which can complicate pregnancy or make it impossible to sustain.\nObjective of the study: to identify risk factors for RPL in women with PTSD, specifically in endocrine, immunological, and psycho-emotional dysfunctions that may trigger RPL.\nMaterials and methods. The study spanned three years (2021–2024) and involved 150 women with RPL, PTSD, or a combination of both. The study was conducted using the parallel group method: the main group (STD and PTSD) with two subgroups consisted of 100 women, the comparison group (STD without PTSD) included 30 women, and the control group (PTSD with a previous successful pregnancy) included 20 women. A thorough clinical examination, laboratory diagnosis of endocrine and immunological parameters was investigated, the psycho-emotional state was determined according to the PCL-C scale and Beck’s questionnaire. For statistical analysis was used the Student’s t-test, calculation of relative measures, mean values, and standard error of the mean.\nResults. It was demonstrated elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone and antiphospholipid antibodies in women with combined PTSD and RPL, as well as significantly higher depression and PTSD scores. An increase in NK cells (CD3-CD16/CD56+) indicated the presence of immunological imbalance.\nConclusions. Taking into account the obtained data, the algorithm for RPL prevention in women with PTSD should include the interdisciplinary approach, which contains not only gynecological screening, but also a comprehensive examination of the genetic, endocrine, immunological and mental state of patients with such diagnosis, as well as the provision of specialized psychological assistance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233678","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677aa77bfdbe83484a6b94b0","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"74","doi":null,"documentHash":"e3eef031-e5ae-4264-94c7-38ef54951e44"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"48-54","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://reproduct-endo.com/article/download/318824/309163","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677aaba0fdbe83484a6b9eed","name":"I.L.","lastName":"Kharun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f29303c9-e9af-4abd-b495-8064a5c80d45"}],"doi":"10.18370/2309-4117.2024.74.48-54"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sibling separation","divorce","diagnostic play","parental conflict","siblings’ relationships"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397868"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sibling separation due to parental divorce: diagnostic aspects","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657208214097071b8e675c3a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928b878c28a047397853","5e70928b878c28a047397868"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Separation of siblings is one of the most difficult diagnostic problems faced by psychologists. Such situations are happening more often in the face of the increasing number of divorces and breakdown of relationships. Therefore, a diagnostic task becomes an in-depth assessment of intra-family relationships, ties connecting family members, the preferences of individual people and predicting the long-term consequences of the proposed solutions. The article is dedicated to this problem, and the issue is addressed through the theoretical perspective and the analysis of two cases, i.e., the situation of separated siblings. In the study of children, we present a relatively new method, based on the authors’ clinical experience, which could be used to diagnose the family situation of children. The first goal was to analyze the reasons for the separation of siblings whose parents were in conflict during the separation (first case study) and after the separation (second case study), as well as to assess the functioning of the children resulting from the family breakdown, and the decision to separate them from siblings. The analysis allowed identifying the areas of sibling functioning, which should become the subject of diagnosis when working on expert opinions in divorce cases, or cases establishing contact between parents and children. The second aim of the report was to assess the effectiveness of using play as a diagnostic method in a situation that is a source of stress for the child (family breakdown) and causes tension (the diagnostic process in which this topic is discussed)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233680","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397868","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"LEWANDOWSKA-WALTER","uuid":"BCD68285EF715AF0AA71571A056F54BD52D8082E24A18BFA40919C037E9D91FECBE2AA4533AC6D17E630DB94EC607D3C477B2B64783FA4F8DD135A9B5C868425","orcidId":"0000-0001-9806-6339","documentHash":"93c09c89-c90a-4c11-8679-0943d6608257"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397853","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Błażek","uuid":"9A3CF79C41E87ACC6639BAB5EBFB7BABC8F0F9028173E76E2BFB8BBBE0A8A3F586A429A63DAECD2C29AA8CFB617D46182B1A0BC46C3FDDE88BFC3A04B6EBF991","orcidId":"0000-0003-3675-1474","documentHash":"bc3b5495-6e09-4ded-9f72-d4e74fc76573"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19106232"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","uid":"bvlnj9UhLKspSOqPkqrvdYA","uuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Uniwersytet w Białymstoku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709232878c28a047391869"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Elementary Number Theory Problems.

display a wide variety of social structures, in which local food availability and defensibility, sexual size dimorphism and interbirth intervals ultimately influence the role of kin within social units. Earlier studies of the social ecology of Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus) off Pico Island, the Azores, revealed a sexually stratified social structure, with long-term stable, strongly associated male clusters and temporally weakly associated female clusters. Here we test the predictions that inclusive fitness plays a role in social cohesion and structure and that both sexes are philopatric in this population. We found no correlation between association and relatedness for either males or females. Our results therefore do not support inclusive fitness as an explanation for the stable clusters of males, who instead associate with partners of a similar age, less likely to be kin due to a long inter-birth interval. Genetic data did not reveal clear sex-biased dispersal. We propose that unlike the pattern seen in some other dolphin species, the socio-genetic structure found in Risso’s dolphins is not associated with inclusive fitness but linked instead to the open oceanic habitat and the species’ life history traits."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060236804","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"77","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d2fd1fdbe831a382e11fb","name":"A.

Species related to the rural landscape have been facing a great challenge\nof adaptation to quickly changing conditions. Therefore, recognizing and characterizing highly suitable areas for\nwhite storks is very important to plan conservation measures in the era of changes in agriculture and land use.\nHere, combining nest survey data (811 occupied nest), GIS-data on habitat availability and modelling approach,\nwe characterize the current foraging conditions of the white stork Ciconia ciconia, an indicator of the agricultural\nhabitat biodiversity and an umbrella species for organisms associated with agriculture landscape. The studied\npopulation breeds in the Warminska ´ Refuge Natura 2000 site (N Poland), one of the key breeding areas of this\nspecies in Europe. Breeding pair presence was predicted by the area of pasture, meadows, field ponds, and linear\nwater within a 1 km buffer around the nest. The main hotspots of habitat suitability were located in the central\nand western parts of the study area, characterized by a more traditional model of agriculture. The distance to\nimportant foraging habitats does not influence white stork fecundity indicating that landscape composition is\nimportant when choosing the breeding site. The pairs with higher number of young were located further from\nother neighbouring pairs and at the areas with lower density of pairs in general. This is probably linked to the\nlower competition for food between more distant breeding pairs. Our results show that the traditional agricultural use in mosaics of pastures, meadows and aquatic habitats promotes white storks nesting."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060236809","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"151","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d302dfdbe831a382e1f80","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Menderski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"711cfacb-201e-4e4c-9648-31214d6608ff"},{"objectId":"677d302dfdbe831a382e1f7f","name":"Adam","lastName":"Zbyryt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4e12c22-7333-4a7b-92c8-658450b77387"},{"objectId":"677d302dfdbe831a382e1f7e","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Pestka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e2c38c03-c21f-4690-b47c-4cab7affc763"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931a1","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Jakubas","uuid":"8CB5C68968CB72D2141B8A05EDF54D9FC4C06E68AA50E9F882796C88AB7FF694485E3222D3A93D69355BB8F233C2BA3803BD5C11C8012170BBCE9E129FC3EBA1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1879-4342","documentHash":"fb64d2c2-6642-47df-a865-9e64f7c77b1a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110278"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["elektrofil","reakcje\nizocyjanków","izocyjanki","izocyjaniany","izonitryle","nukleofil"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["isocyanides","reactions\nof isocyanides","isocyanates","electrophile nucleophile","isonitriles"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398ca2","677d2d57fdbe831a382de414","677d2d57fdbe831a382de413","5e70924b878c28a0473931e6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Właściwości fizykochemiczne, biologiczne i aplikacyjne izocyjanków - część I: Pochodzenie, otrzymywanie i reakcje chemiczne","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac20ad204581b62ebb9a","mniswId":"201380","title":"Wiadomości Chemiczne","doi":null,"issn":"0043-5104","eissn":"2300-0295","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"c2d76b01-aea2-4086-b682-5da0b4f0e8cd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-04-03","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65797cd24097076c149b732d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929a878c28a047398ca2","5e70924b878c28a0473931e6","677d2d57fdbe831a382de413","677d2d57fdbe831a382de414"]},"issue":"3-4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Isocyanides are the most unusual and unique group in organic chemistry.

Surrogacy is one of the options in reproductive medicine that raises a lot of ethical, legal and psychological controversy. Surveying attitudes toward surrogacy plays an important role in building awareness of this phenomenon in the society, which may help eliminate its stigma. In this study authors aimed to develop and validate\na scale to assess the attitudes towards surrogacy.\nMethods In this study cross-sectional design was implemented. Development process of the Attitude towards\nSurrogacy Scale (ATSS) included items development based on literature reviews, other existing questionnaires,\nconfrmatory factor analysis (CFA), and reliability analysis using internal consistence coefcients. A pilot study using\nadult members of the public was conducted after consultation with the Expert Advisory Panel Board. The fnal survey,\nwhich was used in this study, consisted of 24 items, which were organized into the four subscales: general opinion on\nsurrogacy and its social context (7 items), fnancing and legalizing surrogacy (8 items), the acceptance of surrogacy\n(4 items), and attitudes towards the intended parents and children born through surrogacy (5 items). 442 individuals\nparticipated in this study.\nResults The fnal version of Attitude towards Surrogacy Scale (ATSS) consists of 15 items, grouped in three subscales.\nFinal version of the ATSS showed that the three-factor model indicated an acceptable model ft: Chi-square=320.46,\np<0.01, df=87, CFI=0.94, TLI=0.92, RMSEA=0.078 (90% C.I.: 0.070–0.086), SRMR=0.040 Reliability was assessed by\ncalculating the McDonald’s omega that ranged from 0.74 for the Surrogacy ethical context subscale to 0.94 for the\noverall ATSS score.\nConclusion ATSS was developed to measure general attitude toward surrogacy with satisfying psychometric properties. The analysis of socio-demographic variables with ATSS showed that the most signifcant predictor of the general\nattitude towards surrogacy, and three aspects of surrogacy was being a religious person (profess a Catholic religion or\nprofess another religion)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060236814","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae5eb","name":"Łucja","lastName":"Bieleninik","uuid":"A36C47BDB9D797786F76AA242C6388CD191C51DCC90CF86B64FBED0829D7C5B3D51C905D85A9196FBABB2AC46BF2EA557B5272032848AA6D4CC4C53E754D9DFB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9685-2934","documentHash":"b40cdfd6-15be-45f7-a956-03e730ff32fa"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa0b9","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Lutkiewicz","uuid":"2D2D4D0C159EA3755DED5BCC239E9E15DC773A6A5F7CE9A664A342BEA073A7F6946BB24DFA4F400A90CEC318AB1C21044B114F71B2314F9A1AEB585860E62C1B","orcidId":"0000-0001-9697-2303","documentHash":"35cb3d5c-2b10-42f7-b6d0-43e0cffb8609"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397860","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Jurek","uuid":"31A068A4A08359C7C7A6435D8C1C69CB3FA1D69DC68DA523EA6A40A4A5307DA1FCC254116D6265D766F8EA37E33E7A8F8502FF524A6BCD532AAF187C45FF9813","orcidId":"0000-0002-9958-3941","documentHash":"9a457230-ccfb-452b-ab63-93438c3a9176"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397851","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Bidzan","uuid":"1869BD33761551788A683EC850679AC84D90127BF13E7E5D3C9AFC6EB33D7ABEE0C4308AD5631DBE19E33076F2E915553E075780DAF2500954C32965EF5B8CF8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0224-1994","documentHash":"8707fb87-5f58-4c8f-9fc5-6e109660a67d"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12884-023-05751-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["soft rot Pectobacteriaceae","biodiversity","virulence","Pectobacterium parmentieri SCC3193","O-antigen chemical structure","pseudaminic acid","lipopolysaccharide"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924b878c28a047393203","5e70929c878c28a047399118","677cdb7dfdbe831a38288ba9","5e70941c878c28a0473b667c","5e70945c878c28a0473bb60b","5e709249878c28a0473930ef","5e70929c878c28a04739910a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Heterogenicity within the LPS structure in relation to the chosen genomic and physiological features of the plant pathogen Pectobacterium parmentieri","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65760d034097071b8ef37d92","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929c878c28a04739910a","5e70945c878c28a0473bb60b","5e70941c878c28a0473b667c","5e709249878c28a0473930ef","5e70929c878c28a047399118","5e70924b878c28a047393203","677cdb7dfdbe831a38288ba9"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pectobacterium parmentieri is a pectinolytic plant pathogenic bacterium causing high economic losses of cultivated plants. The highly devastating potential of this phytopathogen results from the efficient production of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, i.e., pectinases, cellulases and proteases, in addition to the impact of accessory virulence factors such as motility, siderophores, biofilm and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS belongs to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and plays an important role in plant colonization and interaction with the defense systems of the host. Therefore, we decided to investigate the heterogeneity of O-polysaccharides (OPS) of LPS of different strains of P. parmentieri, in search of an association between the selected genomic and phenotypic features of the strains that share an identical structure of the OPS molecule. In the current study, OPS were isolated from the LPS of two P. parmentieri strains obtained either in Finland in the 1980s (SCC3193) or in Poland in 2013 (IFB5432). The purified polysaccharides were analyzed by utilizing 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy (1H, DQF-COSY, TOCSY, ROESY, HSQC, HSQC-TOCSY and HMBC) in addition to chemical methods. Sugar and methylation analyses of native polysaccharides, absolute configuration assignment of constituent monosaccharides and NMR spectroscopy data revealed that these two P. parmentieri strains isolated in different countries possess the same structure of OPS with a very rare residue of 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-non-2-ulosonic acid (pseudaminic acid) substituted in the position C-8: →3)-β-d-Galf-(1→3)-α-d-Galp-(1→8)-β-Pse4Ac5Ac7Ac-(2→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→6)-β-d-Glcp-(1→. The previous study indicated that three other P. parmentieri strains, namely IFB5427, IFB5408 and IFB5443, exhibit a different OPS molecule than SCC3193 and IFB5432. The conducted biodiversity-oriented assays revealed that the P. parmentieri IFB5427 and IFB5408 strains possessing the same OPS structure yielded the highest genome-wide similarity, according to average nucleotide identity analyses, in addition to the greatest ability to macerate chicory tissue among the studied P. parmentieri strains. The current research demonstrated a novel OPS structure, characteristic of at least two P. parmentieri strains (SCC3193 and IFB5432), and discussed the observed heterogenicity in the OPS of P. parmentieri in a broad genomic and phenotype-related context."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060236819","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23042077","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cdb7dfdbe831a38288ba9","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Ossowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47629137-632e-48a2-81d0-a1e1b9b2a94b"},{"objectId":"5e70945c878c28a0473bb60b","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Kaczyńska","uuid":"FF4B012313823560B928BF594F97D2DE8FC5E4A166053C2C6AB655589ACA0BBCC68A75BFB579463A2AF9F60CF3AB4ADEFEEF3301BAABF0973BC96F2D08F2BCD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-3859-6121","documentHash":"50c5d691-13e2-42d9-b99b-0c24294ce933"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b667c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"C8B45CE46A55A6074E711F65776834711842380E02EDDC9E4BF6982FF26BE32255C27EAAD6520770C17F870D650281BAB45AE81C14F7ADACDF2ECC8514E1DD23","orcidId":"0000-0002-5890-9618","documentHash":"3ff41dbd-834b-4af0-a30e-650ddb7e43f2"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399118","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Łojkowska","uuid":"270E2A55691CEB1099AD107694D6A74AC523CD3B0F5842223709D3A30F962DBF87A32D1DFF65FCA67BEEA5F6D4023BDFA9514C535502051C6220686649FACE70","orcidId":"0000-0001-8640-2307","documentHash":"3ca1cd33-2697-4842-b7ed-90a7b3edb7e1"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a04739910a","name":"Agata","lastName":"Motyka-Pomagruk","uuid":"97C7E918FA66D2492B8D05B029BB1063C643CAF32D2BAA7278558FF90D30B96C87B5BE1817F7B0853C832AC2E72204A91D6AC246085BE7C0280D958831EA3EF2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7717-8251","documentHash":"ac5971ed-c76c-4218-a625-cb05bdf9a894"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a047393203","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Kaczyński","uuid":"FDEE56D750FBFC8663AFA1DC7A60EEB378BDEE6AF355877D50929F4350AA0A499EFBABC90140D7E89500BA82387F41C59408DDB3549BEA44D310681F84E9C5AE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4590-4690","documentHash":"5d36d1d3-bfc7-4f23-beb2-b718d11e6e79"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473930ef","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Śledź","uuid":"AD6242760D44BDCFFBBA96F7B253F16CD80AD636321B930E11DC0EDBB23F0EBEC544CFD191220F3657F3EAEFFB90567F1DD10EEA5C134ADCCEB99B567106CCCC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4188-4490","documentHash":"1d7726d6-79c2-4cd2-846a-f9b1dd94c6a7"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23042077"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70945d878c28a0473bb76e","5e709249878c28a0473931c9","5e70949c878c28a0473c05d5","5e709249878c28a0473931a1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mine or my neighbours' offspring: an experimental study on parental discrimination of offspring in a colonial seabird, the little auk Alle alle","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"658403614097076c14bff2b7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70945d878c28a0473bb76e","5e709249878c28a0473931c9","5e709249878c28a0473931a1","5e70949c878c28a0473c05d5","677d2ffafdbe831a382e1939"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Individual recognition (IR) abilities may result from various ecological and naturally selected features of a species. Complex IR mechanisms should develop when the risk of misidentification of a chick is high. For colonial seabirds, the ability to identify their own brood is crucial to ensure parental fitness. Vocalizations seem to be a key component of most parent–offspring interactions, although few studies have assessed the interindividual differences in seabird chick calls and their potential usage in IR. The little auk (Alle alle), which breeds in dense colonies, constitutes a perfect model for testing IR. In this study, we (1) examined chick calls at different stages of the nesting period, and (2) cross-fostered chicks to examine the rate of acceptance/nonacceptance of chicks by parents. We found significant interindividual differences in chick begging and fledging calls. Surprisingly, all cross-fostered chicks in our experiments were accepted by their foster parents, and male parents were as equally likely to accept cross-fostered chicks as females, even though the sexes would be expected to differ in offspring recognition due to different postfledging interactions with the chick. The revealed individuality of chick calls suggests the potential for chick vocal recognition in the studied species, but parent birds may disregard the individual characteristics enabling chick discrimination. This may take place as long as the chick is found in the nest because of the high likelihood that the chick present there is the focal one. However, IR during and after fledging requires further study. Studying the complexity of IR mechanisms is important for better understanding various avian social relationships and interactions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060236821","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d2ffafdbe831a382e1939","name":"Rupert","lastName":"Palme","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"317add4e-fb25-40c6-b46c-b3dda3a64161"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c05d5","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Barcikowski","uuid":"E7CF4A7D167C88597B50A8A357FB7D1C936345116F160F6179C03733791B81D061BCF2C1BF1F6251DFAD448FD49C6BB7E4A24C49D2C73E3AFE2739D9439CE7F5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59c0349c-243a-4f41-84d4-1fbcafb1e7ca"},{"objectId":"5e70945d878c28a0473bb76e","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kidawa","uuid":"CC6F6576D2451082F35BF9EDA4CF3669E6F17BC9069869CB51786C45F5DA15E82EB585F4C4D80F6543933E05416674714AE23584EABF4B4B37E501C514EAC5F9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6706-7793","documentHash":"9c893a98-4dad-4a03-8b82-3d605f984932"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931c9","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wojczulanis-Jakubas","uuid":"F414ABFE5586B7D096AAC8642633E462750DFFD22D9BF407C8EF698BD9D4603E9A115179D01E26E44DBC3A71C9FD81C58E10F0FF84E609D2DC3D1B945CD33660","orcidId":"0000-0001-6230-0509","documentHash":"1ac974df-dcf1-4084-ac20-aa468de5e776"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931a1","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Jakubas","uuid":"8CB5C68968CB72D2141B8A05EDF54D9FC4C06E68AA50E9F882796C88AB7FF694485E3222D3A93D69355BB8F233C2BA3803BD5C11C8012170BBCE9E129FC3EBA1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1879-4342","documentHash":"fb64d2c2-6642-47df-a865-9e64f7c77b1a"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-41925-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mucopolysaccharidosis","diagnostic procedures","misdiagnosis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a0473931c8","5e70929c878c28a047399089","5e70929c878c28a0473990a5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Misdiagnosis in mucopolysaccharidoses","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547847c","mniswId":"10158","title":"Journal of Applied Genetics","doi":null,"issn":"1234-1983","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5b435c7-ea78-42f7-8f23-8d5ecfb46ffb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"658d6e874097076c14582539","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929c878c28a047399089","601cedf49543c7744e88f175","5e70929c878c28a0473990a5","5e709249878c28a0473931c8","6030e5109543c7410626f9d6","677d3163fdbe831a382e45ed"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a group of 13 hereditary metabolic diseases identified in humans (or 14 diseases if considering one MPS type described to date only in mice) in which an enzymatic defect results in the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the lysosomes of cells. First of all, as a result of GAG storage, the proper functioning of the lysosome is disturbed; then, the cells, and finally, tissue, organs, and the whole organism malfunctions are observed. Due to the rarity, heterogeneity, and multi-systemic and progressive nature of MPS, they present a major diagnostic challenge. Due to the wide variation in symptoms and their similarity to other diseases, MPS is often misdiagnosed, usually as neurological diseases (like autism spectrum disorders, psychomotor hyperactivity, and intellectual disability) or rheumatology and orthopedic disorders (like juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Perthes disease, rickets, and muscular dystrophy).

W opracowaniu skupiono się przede wszystkim na dwóch czynnikach, odgrywających dużą rolę we wzajemnych kontaktach, a mianowicie trwający wówczas procesie implantacji klasztoru cystersów w Pelplinie (z odwołaniem do koncepcji implantacji klasztorów Philippa Racinet) i budowy struktur administracji zakonu krzyżackiego na Pomorzu Gdańskim. Analiza zachowanych źródeł wskazuje, że znajdujące się w pierwszej połowie XIV w. wciąż w procesie organizacji swych dóbr opactwo cystersów w Pelplinie, blisko współpracowało z zakonem krzyżackim, odnośnie do zatwierdzania kupna, zamiany i potwierdzania granic swoich dóbr.

The synthesised in vivo αESA was very efficiently transferred to TAG and constituted about 60% of its total fatty acids in 33 DAP. The content of αESA in polar lipids (containing, among others, phosphatidylcholine—the place of αESA biosynthesis) was very low. The biosynthesis of αESA in vitro (assays with microsomal fractions and [14C]-labelled substrates) in the presence of NADPH was fairly intensive (about 60% of the corresponding intensity in vivo) when linolenic acid was used as a substrate.

receptors (TLRs) form a key component of animal innate immunity, being responsible for recognition of\nconserved microbial structures. As such, TLRs may be subject to diversifying and balancing selection, which\nmaintains allelic variation both within and between populations. However, most research on TLRs in non-model\navian species is focused on bottlenecked populations with depleted genetic variation. Here, we assessed variation\nat the extracellular domains of three TLR genes (TLR1LA, TLR3, TLR4) across eleven species from two passerine\nfamilies of buntings (Emberizidae) and finches (Fringillidae), all having large breeding population sizes (millions\nof individuals). We found extraordinary TLR polymorphism in our study taxa, with >100 alleles detected at\nTLR1LA and TLR4 across species and high haplotype diversity (>0.75) in several species. Despite recent species\ndivergence, no nucleotide allelic variants were shared between species, suggesting rapid TLR evolution. Higher\nvariation at TLR1LA and TLR4 than TLR3 was associated with a stronger signal of diversifying selection, as\nmeasured with nucleotide substitutions rates and the number of positively selected sites (PSS). Structural protein\nmodelling of TLRs showed that some PSS detected within TLR1LA and TLR4 were previously recognized as\nfunctionally important sites or were located in their proximity, possibly affecting ligand recognition. Furthermore, we identified PSS responsible for major surface electrostatic charge clustering, which may indicate their\nadaptive importance. Our study provides compelling evidence for the divergent evolution of TLR genes in\nbuntings and finches and indicates that high TLR variation may be adaptively maintained via diversifying selection acting on functional ligand binding sites."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060236834","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"144","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2023.104704","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d306cfdbe831a382e26dc","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Minias","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ba5ad58-e8f6-4791-b736-67a88d42e646"},{"objectId":"677d306cfdbe831a382e26db","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Janiszewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"644d6927-b2fa-4b5a-b926-7f36a793ac8b"},{"objectId":"677d306cfdbe831a382e26da","name":"Marian","lastName":"Novotný","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1c75a72-cd12-442a-8b69-1c061f9fd9f7"},{"objectId":"677d306cfdbe831a382e26d9","name":"Michal","lastName":"Vinkler","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb445b39-21fb-4292-8a75-3b63ae1fa520"},{"objectId":"677d306cfdbe831a382e26d8","name":"Martin","lastName":"Těšický","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"67db167c-5bfe-4256-9afe-2976b2214db7"},{"objectId":"677d306cfdbe831a382e26d7","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Włodarczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e9b2c11-37e9-4c71-a979-5f83e6fca4bc"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931ba","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Remisiewicz","uuid":"AE7CB5E3692D723B7D6B276D042CF0A17308AD108FCBDAB66956F84F73949D36D8442E5898B11CD724CE312F709897717C7EA64158966EA20922DF4CD1F41289","orcidId":"0000-0002-3613-5738","documentHash":"91c15f60-c858-415f-9e22-e6d31751ae88"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.dci.2023.104704"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aggression","explicit aggression","Makarowski\\'s Aggression Questionnaire","implicit aggression","Implicit Associations Test"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709210878c28a04738f654"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Aggression in martial arts coaches and sports performance with the COVID-19 pandemic in the background – a dual processing analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547718b","mniswId":"1649","title":"Archives of Budo","doi":null,"issn":"1643-8698","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"0ada7693-f5c7-479f-8f10-9e1f0f5bcf61"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-01-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6581569f4097076c14b6122d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709210878c28a04738f654","677cf1c2fdbe831a382b8378","677cf1c2fdbe831a382b8379","677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837a","677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837b","677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837c","677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837d","677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background and Study Aims: Considering the dual processing model, human behaviour is guided by implicit and explicit processing. Implicit or automatic processing is essentially a spontaneous processing that occurs in the absence of conscious control. Coaches’ aggression can be, therefore, assessed both explicitly and implicitly. The aims of our research were knowledge about what is specific for successful martial arts coaches, considering aggression, and whether implicit aggression is a better predictor of sports performance than explicit aggression.\r\nMaterials and Methods: Sixty-two martial arts coaches took part in the study. For assessing explicit aggression, Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and the Romanian adaptation of the Makarowski's Aggression Questionnaire were used. Implicit aggression was measured through a test derived from the Implicit Associations Test (IAT) for self-concept measurement, using the 20+40 trials subdivision and the classic 7-block version.\r\nResults: Coaches with international and national performances  associated aggression (measured IAT) with others at a stronger level (M = 0.46 ±0.010), compared to novice coaches, at the beginning of their career (M = 0.38, SD = 0.08). The average value for verbal aggression is significantly higher [t(60) = 2.12, p = 0.038] in successful coaches (which obtained a slightly above average score) compared to beginners/ young coaches (below average score). The effect size index (Hedge’s g = 0.51) shows a moderate difference between the results (for verbal aggression) of successful coaches and coaches at the beginning of their career. The binomial logistic regressions are statistically significant (p<0.05; \"Omnibus test – Model\"). The martial arts coaches, implicit aggression test is a better predictor of sports performance than explicit (verbal) aggression.\r\nConclusions: The study results are also increasing awareness regarding the level of manifestation of different factors of aggression in successful coaches, thus preventing violent and unethical behaviours, with negative impact on well-being of young athletes (mainly). The study offers valuable resources for novice martial arts coaches (and not only), sports psychologists and researchers eager to better understand the role of indirect measures in sports performance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060236838","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"23-36","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://archbudo.com/view/abstract/id/15012","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837e","name":"Carmen","lastName":"Grigoroiu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f07dd66e-86b6-419f-a151-8ad56a222ed1"},{"objectId":"677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837d","name":"Mihai Valentin","lastName":"Ciolacu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"defa4fc1-9fa0-43bd-80ee-8e904c448612"},{"objectId":"677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837c","name":"Ole","lastName":"Boe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"699fd571-28dc-4770-893f-19cf7c668c9e"},{"objectId":"677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837b","name":"Alexandra","lastName":"Predoiu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e54d7832-906d-4a49-968e-47d95855bb44"},{"objectId":"677cf1c2fdbe831a382b837a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Görner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4b29087-7c02-432a-a325-156e409988b0"},{"objectId":"677cf1c2fdbe831a382b8379","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Makarowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1cf23267-8ac9-493e-a56d-761f76ba5671"},{"objectId":"677cf1c2fdbe831a382b8378","name":"Radu ","lastName":"Predoiu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"136c2254-de6c-4eab-81ed-3f19e3222252"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f654","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"401CA3EFD2E26348DE8E3E5A1DF58C321C68B4027BCCE6F24949EEBDC6430A7C5CE03C3D973AF435A30D2D1AF2AE06310EAF81892FC17CC59BFDCD93DD71A95A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1192-2695","documentHash":"883e7571-1ead-4e91-a839-5fdca7389004"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["spatial development","Gdańsk","Middle Ages","sacral topography"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396dcc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Topografia sakralna średniowiecznego Gdańska jako problem badawczy","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd5c","mniswId":"487266","title":"Studia z Dziejow Sredniowiecza","doi":null,"issn":"2084-4492","eissn":"2544-2562","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"9d94bea0-47b4-498d-affe-2d1edc6b006e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6582da634097076c14bbbecf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709281878c28a047396dcc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the main aspects of space in the medieval town consisted of various kinds of sacred structures, above all, parish churches, but also churches belonging to religious houses and hospital chapels. Many spheres of the social life of the town centred on them, both in terms of community (corporate ones involving forms of collective religious experience within guilds and brotherhoods) and of individual experience (private piety). The article considers the issue in relation to the settlement complex of medieval Gdańsk, which initially was a city under Lübeck law, which after its destruction became three town centres successively established in the fourteenth century: the Gdańsk Main Town, the Gdańsk Old Town, and the Gdańsk Young Town. It is important to note that within them were pre‑existing and newly built parish and sister churches, hospital chapels, and churches attached to religious houses. All such buildings are of interest in the sacred topography of the settlement complex in the Middle Ages. Detailed studies of this topic should contribute to a fuller picture of the social history of Gdańsk in the late Middle Ages with special reference to functioning church institutions, not only in an institutional sense, but also as a social network linking various social levels among its inhabitants, both individually and collectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060236845","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"170-189","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.bg.ug.edu.pl/index.php/stzdsr/article/view/7174/6367","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396dcc","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Kubicki","uuid":"D918AFC177ABF4A0C23EEDB2E75BC3B52797B1B94E151C0418C3082E4BB61AE736CDC7272003E8D7635DBA32FDEB25D94473E619F6F7ABD28823E2FA2D714546","orcidId":"0000-0002-2171-5713","documentHash":"68ceb9e6-4033-4aef-b454-18777df74f72"}],"doi":"10.26881/sds.2022.25.08"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Medicago

By analyzing eight large-scale publicly available studies, we find that glycosylated MAPs are predominantly presented by MHC class II. Here, we present HLA-Glyco, a comprehensive resource containing over 3,400 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II N-glycopeptides from 1,049 distinct protein glycosylation sites. This resource provides valuable insights, including high levels of truncated glycans, conserved HLA-binding cores, and differences in glycosylation positional specificity between HLA allele groups. We integrate the workflow within the FragPipe computational platform and provide HLA-Glyco as a free web resource.

The interplay between molecular components of T cell signalling transduction and their involvement\nin cellular cascades (i.e. throughout Ca2+/CaN/NFAT, MAPK/JNK, PI3K/Akt/ mTOR, JAK/STAT pathways) has been of concern in the last few years; this is still less characterised than expected, even though some evidence has\naccumulated to date identifying them as potential objects in the management of Ps. Innovative therapeutic strategies for the use of compounds such as synthetic Small Molecule Drugs (SMDs) and their various combinations proved to be promising tools for the treatment of Ps via incomplete blocking, also known as modulation of disease-associated molecular tracks. Despite recent drug development having mainly centred on biological therapies for Ps, yet displaying serious limitations, SMDs acting on specific pathway factor isoforms\nor single effectors within T cell, could represent a valid innovation in real-world treatment patterns in patients with Ps. Of note, due to the intricate crosstalk between intracellular pathways, the use of selective agents targeting proper tracks is, in our opinion, a challenge for modern science regarding the prevention of disease at its onset and also in the prediction of patient response to\nPs treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060236879","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3006fdbe831a382e1a66","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Kuczyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c3ea7f0-a451-44b5-a739-652654368a59"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fe3","name":"Marta","lastName":"Moskot","uuid":"BDD9FFCE0780E1A77446D8CCA7A0EF1032E45071B138DB23B0D457BA7E89F1051E8193EDDE3D871D935BDF151A46BCD6C875BE3B2884E88D82810AD1BFC78200","orcidId":"0000-0002-7342-9372","documentHash":"2e56dbc2-3240-40e9-8e55-1c9edf4db653"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff2e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gabig-Cimińska","uuid":"1AC62331313BF6A3F619634A1FD39DC76C2BCFE05531C257DCDD75262F6004EBE07B5A7AB4910F6145225B0C83F036FB5D7813044ADE881429694E0BB34E2842","orcidId":"0000-0002-2664-8724","documentHash":"dee8ec27-9eb9-4b03-80f4-4555d0f90855"}],"doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2023.1170273"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Diptera","Psychodidae","Insecta","new taxa","lower Barremian","Lebanese amber","haematophagy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55a3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Libanonemopalpus grimaldii, a new genus and species of Bruchomyiinae from Lower Cretaceous Lebanese amber (Diptera: Psychodidae)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bf6cf9a7471b0ea3fba","mniswId":"31727","title":"Palaeoentomology","doi":null,"issn":"2624-2826","eissn":"2624-2834","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9b25efc2-c0c2-4427-9868-4d92e0f9a38c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6582eb134097076c14bc1a5d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55a3","677d308afdbe831a382e2b39","677d308afdbe831a382e2b3a","677d308afdbe831a382e2b3b","677d308afdbe831a382e2b3c"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Libanonemopalpus grimaldii gen. et sp. nov. is characterised, illustrated, and described from the lower Barremian amber of Bqaatouta (Lebanon).
