Injuries to the PLC can cause substantial patient morbidity. Accurate PFL visualization has been historically challenging, impeding injury diagnosis and treatment. The gold standard for in vivo PFL visualization is magnetic\r\nresonance imaging (MRI), but this procedure has slice thickness limitations, is costly, and is subject to longer wait times.\r\nUltrasonographic (US) PFL assessment is a potentially viable alternative to MRI. This study aimed to determine the viability\r\nof US PFL assessment.\r\nMaterials and methods Ten fresh-frozen lower limb specimens were evaluated for the presence and morphometric characteristics of the PFL via US using an 18.0-MHz linear transducer. The cadavers were then dissected and reassessed for the\r\npresence and morphometric characteristics of the PFLs for comparison with US fndings. Moreover, the fracture of the fbular\r\nstyloid process near the site of the insertion of the PFL (the arcuate sign) was simulated and assessed via US.\r\nResults The PFL was visualized and measured in all ten knees via both US and cadaveric assessments. There were no statistically signifcant diferences in PFL morphometric characteristics determined via US examination and dissection. The\r\nfbular styloid fracture was easily identifed in US examination.\r\nConclusion US imaging is a viable alternative for accurate and efective assessment of the normal PFL. Moreover, the arcuate sign can be evaluated via US."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056700611","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"51","pagesFromTo":"183–189","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00256-021-03813-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658fdcce4097076c14780732","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Tatoń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"226db344-a009-4d27-9789-696b49a40d32"},{"objectId":"658fdcce4097076c14780731","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Mostowy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df376d25-1b5a-4d85-8011-60753206a508"},{"objectId":"658fdcce4097076c14780730","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Wagner-Olszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd3ab059-e444-41f2-be65-729033f4a48e"},{"objectId":"658fdcce4097076c1478072f","name":"Mitchell R.","lastName":"Mann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ed8aa64-9221-402c-93e7-94cb71265457"},{"objectId":"658fdcce4097076c1478072e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Mizia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7fe23ccf-89e3-4232-80ce-fbdd36f54cd0"},{"objectId":"658fdcce4097076c1478072d","name":"Przemysław A.","lastName":"Pękala","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"972ae9e0-a745-4d0d-94d6-150af94a38fd"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eb89","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Domżalski","uuid":"00FD71E0768EBFFE66C6DBDEE1C9C2969544D541E291B65DA7A0BDD7E5485F1245E7FE0ADBB22D13AE3F31A408162A5EB523EBDEBBEA0EE7C17D54F20B76F29C","orcidId":"0000-0003-1915-0773","documentHash":"cadaabad-6463-4f14-ab8e-0993c9d8b74c"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00256-021-03813-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["optymalizacja portfela","sztuczna inteligencja w finansach","losowy las","akcje","prognozy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["portfolio optimization","artificial intelligence in finance","random forest","equities","forecasts"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Building portfolios based on machine learning predictions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a1a","mniswId":"5375","title":"Economic Research-Ekonomska Istrazivanja","doi":null,"issn":"1331-677X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"28bd9ca6-fee1-46c0-993d-b39dcb3cf2ca"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-02-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618794422467f0196422b994","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6409ab0e40970770356bfc04","5e70924f878c28a0473938a2"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper demonstrates that portfolio optimization techniques represented by Markowitz mean-variance and Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) optimizers increase the risk-adjusted return of portfolios built with stocks preselected with a machine learning tool.

on how organisations identify talent in practice remains limited. Too often it appears that the most core construct – talent – is taken for granted in terms of how key stakeholders make sense of and give meaning to it in practice. This paper examines the talent definitions held by multiple organisational stakeholders and the criteria used in the practice of identification. Drawing from content analysis of over 200 interviews, our findings demonstrate substantial discrepancies between senior leaders’ and talents’ view on the meaning of talent within organisations. Moreover, there was little awareness of the identification criteria used by decision-makers that gives individuals the talent designation. Given the potential impact of this designation on employee attitudes, behaviours, and performance, the seemingly limited relationship between the meaning ascribed to talent and the identification criteria used in practice is likely to raise concerns about fairness and transparency. The findings indicate the absence of a shared and well-defined talent philosophy which we suggest is needed to guide talent management practices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056715027","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"34","pagesFromTo":"1132-1156","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09585192.2021.1976245","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6698d3c0fdbe831880701396","name":"Hugh","lastName":"Scullion","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ca96be4-d736-44c6-8fa4-d2cad43d55dd"},{"objectId":"6698d3c0fdbe831880701395","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Jooss","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c51b85e9-3b7d-4295-b8f5-705fd7d3a4b8"},{"objectId":"6698d3c0fdbe831880701394","name":"Anthony","lastName":"McDonnell","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d4e0832-e162-4d04-83ee-4820e335a179"},{"objectId":"5e709250878c28a047393977","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Skuza","uuid":"69DE2815CB8313C692287ECCA49563BA171BF8DB4A29D10E9AA2DA46F01B13DE88D41028003FF62E6E7BEBDE044162F4C4F0B326968D58AEE092B70DA487CE3E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5265-4335","documentHash":"76998ed3-f065-40c8-9b6f-23fdee8be3d6"}],"doi":"10.1080/09585192.2021.1976245"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Aktorzy biznesowi","Interakcje biznesowe","Paradygmat biznesowy","Teoria IMP (ARA i Aktor)"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Business actors","Business interactions","Business paradigm","IMP theory (ARA and Actor)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The business paradigm: explanation for patterns of business interactions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478509","mniswId":"10367","title":"Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing","doi":null,"issn":"0885-8624","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a7e97b40-1280-4ad1-aff5-1b4a30923766"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-10-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618943872467f00198b5609f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709252878c28a047393ab1","5e709252878c28a047393a93","6409af5a40970770356c18ab","6409af5a40970770356c18ac"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\r\n\r\nThis paper aims to introduce the concept of business paradigm to conceptualize and explain differences in business interaction patterns in the IMP research.\r\nDesign/methodology/approach\r\n\r\nThe concept of the interaction and the concepts related to and driven from it describe the business at both a general level. At the same time, the IMP points out the uniqueness of business interactions. This paper addresses the specific lies between the general and the particular by referring to various patterns of interactions. To close that gap, this paper implies the Kuhnian philosophy of science to conceptualize the business paradigm.\r\nFindings\r\n\r\nThe business paradigm is a socially constructed collective term. It simultaneously captures the cognitive (what business is and what rules it has) and social (business community) dimensions of the actor’s behavior and actions. It has two interdependent dimensions: cognitive and social. It determines how the actors view and do business, and it explains the variations of interactions.\r\nResearch limitations/implications\r\n\r\nNot applicable as it is a conceptual paper.\r\nPractical implications\r\n\r\nNot applicable as it is a conceptual paper.\r\nSocial implications\r\n\r\nNot applicable as it is a conceptual paper.\r\nOriginality/value\r\n\r\nThe concept of the business paradigm is a theoretical extension of the IMP actor’s theory. The dimensions of the business paradigm capture the psychological and sociological characteristics of the business actor. The business paradigm application provides an opportunity to find that business can be different because actors in various communities have various views on what business is and how it should be properly run. Adding the business paradigm concept to the IMP theory implies strengthening the theory explanation power because the interaction explains the business’s general characteristics. The business relationship explains the business’s unique features, and the business paradigm explains the various interaction patterns.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747056715122","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"723-733","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JBIM-05-2019-0207/full/html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6409af5a40970770356c18ac","name":"Tihamér ","lastName":"Margitay","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8085d4c-d6e9-4ca1-96ff-1190961d80aa"},{"objectId":"6409af5a40970770356c18ab","name":"Tibor","lastName":"Mandjak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"335d743b-5c3b-4c17-ae41-66050e128c08"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393ab1","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Leszczyński","uuid":"F38DFA4B7701A79CAFF6A7439B18AA60705A932734D3080231CAB8E86963199BD8CA517453DDD779578AB1358D48055011399171AED2957770A7845E03E4F4B3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2989-9729","documentHash":"b45e5ab8-0d9d-433c-b309-3763791e6251"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a93","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"7A6E4C6008987D829CD75A233AEEA8961798CC5587E5E21A7EA395536F125CFFE1213EB8D879EC862C4B2C9DF6DAEBB5FE13C39D8FD6DE0FC83E6DC2554A53A1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5697-3678","documentHash":"0028a75b-3691-447d-a9eb-636d10045ea8"}],"doi":"10.1108/jbim-05-2019-0207"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of rosemary essential oil and ethanol extract on physicochemical and antibacterial properties of optimized gelatin–chitosan film using mixture design","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454786f3","mniswId":"11142","title":"Journal of Food Processing and Preservation","doi":null,"issn":"0145-8892","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"70aa64e6-ad70-4224-a3df-0f054d173acb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6194dba32467f030366463c5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6194dba32467f030366463c7","5e70923b878c28a04739221b","5e709487878c28a0473bf096","5e70923d878c28a0473923d2","5e70923b878c28a047392222","5e7091ff878c28a04738e43a","6194dba32467f030366463cc","6194dba32467f030366463cd","6194dba32467f030366463ce","6194dba32467f030366463cf","5e70923b878c28a0473921dc","6194dba32467f030366463d1"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of this study was to prepare an active, nontoxic, and biodegradable film\r\nusing gelatin and chitosan including rosemary ethanol extract (EE) and essential oil\r\n(EO) to improve its physicochemical and antibacterial properties. Films with the highest mechanical properties were acquired using a polymer composition of 4 g gelatin,\r\n3.75 g glycerol, and 1 g chitosan. This composition provided the highest elongation\r\nat break (50.10%) and tensile strength (20.61 MPa). The chemical composition of\r\nenriched films with rosemary EO was rich in 1,8-cineole, camphor, camphene, and\r\nα-pinene. The enriched films with rosemary EE were mainly characterized by the predominance of rosmarinic acid and carnosic acid. Mechanical results showed that the\r\nincorporation of rosemary EE and EO caused a significant increase in tensile strength,\r\nwhereas a significant decrease was observed in elongation at break. With the increase of EE and EO concentrations, the water vapor permeability of films decreased\r\nwhile water resistance increased. Moreover, water contact angle analysis showed\r\nthat the incorporation of rosemary EE and EO made this enriched film more hydrophobic. Fourier transform–infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy confirmed the formation\r\nof intermolecular hydrogen bonds between component functional groups, enhancing the thermal stability and mechanical properties of the enriched films with rosemary EE and EO. Optical results showed that the incorporation of rosemary EE and\r\nEO provoked variations in color, light transmission, and transparency of films. The\r\nchanges of the surface of these films were confirmed by film microstructure analyses\r\nwith scanning electron microscope (SEM). The antibacterial activity of enriched films\r\nwith EO and EE was determined against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,\r\nCampylobacter jejuni, and Salmonella enterica. In fact, the enriched films with EO and\r\nEE showed potential coatings for controlling the most common food-borne bacterial\r\ngrowth during the food storage."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056721525","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"46","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ifst.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jfpp.16059","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6194dba32467f030366463d1","name":"Moufida","lastName":"Saidani-Tounsi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"080424ea-7f9c-4d36-a68e-615963e9ab2f"},{"objectId":"6194dba32467f030366463cf","name":"Karima","lastName":"Horchani-Naifer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7cac0a0b-3ee0-4b90-aeca-3a65e70078f3"},{"objectId":"6194dba32467f030366463ce","name":"Slim","lastName":"Jallouli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29cb4038-9095-467b-90a8-22e0d80959d5"},{"objectId":"6194dba32467f030366463cd","name":"Majdi","lastName":"Hammami","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fbcf6322-5e03-49dc-9d2d-1106bd3e2673"},{"objectId":"6194dba32467f030366463cc","name":"Wannes","lastName":"Wissem

 World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  classifies malnutrition as the biggest threat to public health worldwide, and this condition is observed in 20–60% of hospitalized patients. Malnutrition is a state of the body in which due to insufficient supply or incorrect absorption of essential nutrients, the body composition changes and the body’s functions are impaired. Malnutrition is associated not only with reduced body mass index but also with obesity. Summary: Obesity is defined  as  a  paradoxical  state  of  malnutrition,  which  despite  excessive energy consumption  is  associated with a shortage  of  individual  microelements.  Deficiency  or lack of homeostasis of essential  micronutrients  can  significantly  affect  daily  performance,  intellectual  and  emotional  state, but also the physical state of the body. Food deficiency can  also  contribute  to  further  weight  gain  or  the  development of other metabolic diseases. Micronutrient deficiency \nmay  include  not  only  incorrect  dietary  choices  and  insufficient  access  to  nutrient-rich  foods  but  also  changes  in  the  absorption,  distribution  or  excretion  of  nutrients,  and  altered micronutrient metabolism resulting from systemic inflammation caused by obesity. An effective therapy method recommended  for  people  with  morbid  obesity  is  bariatric  \nsurgery aimed at both weight loss and improving quality of life. Unfortunately, the effects of these treatments are often \nmedium- and long-term complications associated with micronutrient deficiency as a result of reduced consumption or \nabsorption. Therefore, the use of bariatric surgery in patients with extreme obesity can affect the metabolism of microele-\nments  and  increase  the  risk  of  nutritional  deficiencies.  Key Messages:  Studies  by  many  authors  indicate  a  higher  incidence of food deficiency among people with excessive body weight, than in people with normal body weight of the same age and same sex. Monitoring the concentration of minerals and vitamins in blood serum is a good practice in the treatment  of  obesity.  The  proper  nutritional  status  of  the  body  affects not only the state of health but also the effectiveness of therapy. The aim of the review was to present the issue of malnutrition in the context of obesity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056724537","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e69bcb2467f030e8bb879d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"c2a28332-4e35-4746-a248-79136e02e1a4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"19-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/519503","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fbb4","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kurowska","uuid":"71F7448CA31D94B35AFB7801392922723F607E3F108467FC140CDB4034C898EB406B053E828C56E5B6FA9B2ABEC6DC7DAB1D27B08D60AC11C8F7281D611411A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2892-5315","documentHash":"07e756c9-0ca7-4593-ab94-4f7747d45ffe"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fb9c","name":"Milena","lastName":"Kobylińska","uuid":"F5BEE8701DB170D266B8F420FEEF44404854300EAA5111FE55466468877A228CA7E71FFD39DDC68972B7340B72C9092C88D3B39A16AE04A07D978DE51A36D88F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3293-900X","documentHash":"7d814361-4b26-4075-9386-e23ea0563bb8"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fb95","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Decyk","uuid":"A5454630C86B30BEBE65AF55B0ABCA954D8D57488AF3567DABF2123B6F9E96FDBC39E1C1CCB75D356F75AFF280CBC55D49C59A594CB6634999AE835BBCE61898","orcidId":"0000-0002-2246-0249","documentHash":"d881d47d-7074-49a8-93ee-bbcec8fe38c2"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6e5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Antosik","uuid":"9733CA76BA657D477B65FC89FB2A5B0F6D84708890B24AF255A9D6133EA3207A2C3B6A1B470AF0D747EC8742CBE180AA67DF12F359DEFE56F787BCEFB29CB2BD","orcidId":"0000-0001-7159-4254","documentHash":"18e1b56f-af62-4d7a-902d-902abb5cb86a"}],"doi":"10.1159/000519503"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet

This growth can be observable due to high identity recognition accuracy guaranteed by this measurable trait. In the literature, one can easily find diversified approaches and algorithms connected with this feature, however, neither of them uses discrete fast Fourier transform to describe iris sample. In this work, the authors used recently mentioned method to create feature vector and to verify human identity with diversified classifiers, e.g., artificial neural network. Before these steps, iris image was preprocessed with precisely selected operations. During the research, the authors considered different ways of image preprocessing as well as diversified ideas regarding highlighting of the most important parts of iris. Selected elements can have huge influence on a feature vector and recognition rate. Specialized framework for algorithm testing was proposed. Tests have shown that satisfactory results can be obtained with iris-based human identity recognition with feature vector consisting of the most descriptive components of discrete fast Fourier transform."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056732582","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"77-90","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-4287-6_6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6555f09840970749a80707bc","name":"Piotr ","lastName":"Jasiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1fd7c731-f6b2-48b6-9a0b-21c5d2b917e8"},{"objectId":"5e70941f878c28a0473b6882","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Szymkowski","uuid":"80C0624EC60D4DEA1E40D13250A06815BF8EA482B72B0C7704A3BDAC635A143F18E57C1DB12ADD790C7DA622299B9C0A4CDD08755DC376550F18E9EE80F49DBA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5778-9976","documentHash":"63df4847-6e23-4723-a130-1905ddf3364c"},{"objectId":"5e709208878c28a04738eea5","name":"Khalid","lastName":"Saeed","uuid":"EFC8C7FBA91A780043432546AE9F30F88B590CFC6310B0CC1B8850CD31D3ED0C34FEDD2598BE979E84B1EDC1755C763FE075200C022A204B63D1EA4D4755222C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7741-7045","documentHash":"801660fd-938f-4001-8f76-5d5e8db3764f"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-981-16-4287-6_6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Magnetic properties, Magnetic fabrics and anisotropy, Microstructures"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d37"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of cyclic loading at elevated temperatures on the magnetic susceptibility of a magnetite-bearing ore","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1b","mniswId":"7138","title":"GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL","doi":null,"issn":"0956-540X","eissn":"1365-246X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"c997c760-a0fe-4c68-8bae-cecdf9eec58d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d8c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","6197508a2467f02124c32d8f","6197508a2467f02124c32d90","6197508a2467f02124c32d91","6197508a2467f02124c32d92"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cyclic loading at elevated temperatures occurs either naturally during tectonic or volcanic-induced earthquakes or can be human-induced due to various geological engineering activities. The aim of this study is to test if mechanical fatigue in rocks can be monitored by magnetic methods. For this purpose, the effect of cyclic-mechanical loading (150 ± 30 MPa) on the magnetic susceptibility and its anisotropy of a magnetite-bearing ore with varying temperatures (400 and 500 °C) and environment (air and vacuum) was investigated. Our study shows that magnetic susceptibility decreases significantly (up to 23 per cent) under air conditions and in vacuum (up to 4 per cent) within the first ca. 1000 cycles. Further loading does not significantly affect the magnetic susceptibility which then remains more or less constant. The decrease of susceptibility parameters is stronger at 500 °C compared to 400 °C under both experimental conditions. Magnetic susceptibility was always measured after decompression of the loaded sample at room temperature so that magnetostriction can be excluded as a reason for these changes. The higher the temperature at which samples were loaded the more pronounced is the oxidation of magnetite to haematite. The transformation of magnetite into haematite under ambient conditions is the most important mechanism influencing bulk magnetic properties. The weak changes in magnetic susceptibility after vacuum loadings are probably caused by intragranular microcracks formed on the surface of magnetite grains. These surface deformation structures are accompanied by the refinement of magnetic domains, which is observed by magnetic force microscopy. Bulk magnetic grain size modifications are also confirmed by hysteresis parameters as well as by the increasing Hopkinson peak ratios determined from magnetic susceptibility measurements over Curie point. The degree of magnetic anisotropy and shape factor only change for the air-treated samples and are therefore related to the haematite formation and not to irreversible ductile deformation in magnetite. Our experimental study shows that cyclic loading can change significantly the magnetic properties of a rock due to mineral transformation below < 1000 cycles and that the first stages of mechanical fatigue, which are a precursor of the failure of rock, are closely associated with these transformations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056732874","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6284de2940970712d1b695ff","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"228","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"4ef44c34-dfb1-48bf-b3c2-3bd7faf8b7a2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"228","pagesFromTo":"1346-1360","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://academic.oup.com/gji/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/gji/ggab400/40510658/ggab400.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d92","name":"Agnes","lastName":"Kontny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3de494d5-7db8-4a1e-bad2-79f11d2cd77b"},{"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d91","name":"Boris","lastName":"Reznik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"810c611a-0414-4b73-88e8-7993f8dc31f3"},{"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d90","name":"Ralf","lastName":"Krumholz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"938e3e0a-f78f-4fec-8bbf-814b1d818905"},{"objectId":"6197508a2467f02124c32d8f","name":"Mario","lastName":"Walter","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f581da2-7e8e-4b6d-9c8c-8d05114ed0d8"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3d37","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dudzisz","uuid":"CB8A56D218873215B0E6A697AEF6BDB67E77A2E5004D09D5FE340B63B5E950B6C9AC075B91A33D58B125890908C1F1302B868364040EFD8E73C894FB75E36692","orcidId":"0000-0002-2503-451X","documentHash":"4b3ca7e2-cc85-4331-9dd3-51c0a79c35b6"}],"doi":"10.1093/gji/ggab400"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["artificial sweetener","decision-making","prefrontal cortex","risk-taking","sugar"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f078","uid":"bHxJBSVCmPcwNAkaPPCoUiw","uuid":"ebf09220-1677-4c30-b0a3-b7c7bc4e2d7f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Interdyscyplinarne Centrum Modelowania Matematycznego i Komputerowego","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ed878c28a0473b377e"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","parentUuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","rootUuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

We report that consumption of beverages containing small amounts of sucrose during several weeks impaired reward systems. This is evidenced by robust changes in the activation pattern of prefrontal brain regions associated with abnormal risk-taking and delayed establishment of decision-making strategy. Supporting these findings, we find that chronic consumption of low doses of artificial sweeteners such as saccharin disrupts brain regions’ activity engaged in decision-making and reward processes. Consequently, this leads to the rapid development of inflexible decisions, particularly in a subset of vulnerable individuals. Our data also reveal that regular consumption, even at low doses, of sweet or sweeteners dramatically alters brain neurochemistry, i.e., dopamine content and turnover, and high cognitive functions, while sparing metabolic regulations. Our findings suggest that it would be relevant to focus on long-term consequences on the brain of sweet or sweetened beverages in humans, especially as they may go metabolically unnoticed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056738421","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"1365–1378","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhab274/40323260/bhab274.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6197acd82467f02124d50f4f","name":"Sylvie","lastName":"Granon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55f894c7-6306-4251-9a28-26f551896819"},{"objectId":"6197acd82467f02124d50f4d","name":"Mohammed","lastName":"Taouis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"714ba66e-a006-401e-a0c7-42b00e622b16"},{"objectId":"6197acd82467f02124d50f4c","name":"Claire","lastName":"Rampon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f3118df-7d33-4e8e-a6c6-c9eafdb3cb4d"},{"objectId":"6197acd82467f02124d50f4b","name":"Jacques","lastName":"Callebert","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8bc0048-b245-4f86-93cb-debad0ae70e0"},{"objectId":"6197acd82467f02124d50f4a","name":"Elsa","lastName":"Pittaras","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c98dcda-b63f-422f-adea-b1fa1b345a82"},{"objectId":"6197acd82467f02124d50f48","name":"Cédrick","lastName":"Florian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"749cb290-2965-4777-8375-17e05b518018"},{"objectId":"6197acd82467f02124d50f47","name":"Ghislaine","lastName":"Poizat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4210acc7-ce27-433d-b46a-44dcf518f737"},{"objectId":"6197acd82467f02124d50f46","name":"Héloïse","lastName":"Hamelin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8505-3982","documentHash":"51807fd5-a056-4d2d-85e4-573367d25098"},{"objectId":"5e7093ed878c28a0473b377e","name":"Miron","lastName":"Kursa","uuid":"3A705775ADABE76E23C6E61D97D57DA908904C360D32B0D56DA54A90139B38AFDD6F2D92F90F69DF725DDD37CFDEAB83E2087D6AEE70DDDCE429CECC6EABDE41","orcidId":"0000-0001-7672-648X","documentHash":"8ee850e3-ad6d-47ee-8925-3369c786c9b7"},{"objectId":"5e70933f878c28a0473a596b","name":"ADAM","lastName":"HAMED","uuid":"64F2EA5A7106660BD5F796AD48F94EF17FF9E202822DF10B6DEDE006B5F09BC7FCFA0EFB9FD31D8291ABF7FD6C66FEA6E4D1771AAFBBC6A189686E8CC62C5763","orcidId":"0000-0003-1477-9177","documentHash":"364432c9-7af4-47f6-a48c-8168e63b1682"}],"doi":"10.1093/cercor/bhab274"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet

Sauna bathing is recommended to improve the sports training process, yet empirical evidence confirming its effectiveness is still inconclusive. We examined the effects of post-exercise sauna bathing on hematological adaptations and exercise capacity in healthy men. Methods: Thirteen physical education students participated in randomized cross-over study: two, 4-week interventions, with 10-week washout. The interventions involved 3 times per week 60-min stationary cycling either with 30-min of post-exercise sauna bathing (89 ± 3°C, 10 ± 2% RH) or without; no fluid was ingested during both exercise and sauna sessions. Before and after both interventions, participants were tested for total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass), intravascular volumes, erythropoietin, ferritin, red blood cell parameters with reticulocyte fractions, along with maximal/peak and submaximal variables in a graded exercise test (GXT). Results: Regardless of intervention type, tHb-mass increased (p = .014) whereas ferritin concentration decreased (p = .027); however, changes in tHb-mass were within the range of typical error (<1.8%). Absolute and relative values of maximal power and power at gas exchange threshold, as well as peak oxygen uptake (all p < .010), also increased irrespective of intervention type. Conclusions: The use of post-exercise sauna bathing with fluid intake restrictions does not provide any additional benefits in tested variables over endurance training alone.

pumps and glucose sensors are effective in improving diabetes therapy and reducing acute complications. The combination of both devices using an algorithm-driven interoperable controller makes automated insulin delivery (AID) systems possible. Many AID systems have been tested in clinical trials and have proven safety and effectiveness. However, currently, none of these systems are available for routine use in children younger than 6 years in Europe. For continued use, both users and prescribers must have sound knowledge of the features of the individual AID systems. Presently, all systems require various user interactions (e.g. meal announcements) because fully automated systems are not yet developed. Open-source systems are non-regulated variants to circumvent existing regulatory conditions. There are risks here for both users and prescribers. To evaluate AID therapy, the metric data of the glucose sensors, 'time in target range' and 'glucose management index', are novel recognized and suitable parameters allowing a consultation based on real glucose and insulin pump download data from the daily life of people with diabetes. Read out via cloud-based software or automatic download of such individual treatment data provides the ideal technical basis for shared decision-making through telemedicine, which must be further evaluated for general use."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056750380","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"43-57","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14576","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66056255409707626337f5a7","name":"Klemen

Coralliths, or circumrotatory colonies, are passively motile coral colonies constantly overturned by wave action or currents. Such overturning allows tissue growth on all sides of the colony. They are among the most rarely reported growth forms. Recent corallith-forming scleractinian corals mostly inhabit the shallowest reef environments, but coralliths can also develop at greater depths in areas of low topographic relief, unconsolidated substratum, low coral cover and high water movement. Here, we report on Devonian (Givetian Favosites goldfussi and Frasnian Alveolites? tenuissimus) coralla from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland. Our analysis suggests these colonies are coralliths, although less mature than usually reported. These corals, unlike previously described growth forms of this kind, lived in relatively deep environments: probably the upper mesophotic (Givetian, Miłoszów), or deep reef fore-slope (Frasnian, Jaźwica and Kowala). Microfacies analysis of the Jaźwica site suggests unconsolidated substratum and high hydrodynamic energy. We conclude that these corals lived in deeper environments where bottom currents caused their autorotation. A good modern analogue for such a corallith-forming environment is the Wistari Channel (Southern Great Barrier Reef), where bottom tidal currents at nearly 30 m of depth are strong enough to overturn colonies of Stylocoeniella cf. guentheri reaching 15 cm in diameter. Our discovery shows that the spectrum of coral growth forms during the Devonian peak of reef development was broader than previously assumed, and that tabulate corals displayed numerous adaptive strategies to various

is celebrated internationally for its rich and varied performance traditions and theatre histories. This groundbreaking volume is the first in English to engage with these topics across an ambitious scope, incorporating Staropolska, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Enlightenment and Romanticism within its broad ambit. The book also discusses theatre cultures under socialism, the emergence of canonical practitioners and training methods, the development of dramaturgical forms and stage aesthetics and the political transformations attending the ends of the First and Second World Wars. Subjects of far-reaching transnational attention such as Jerzy Grotowski and Tadeusz Kantor are contextualised alongside theatre makers and practices that have gone largely unrecognized by international readers, while the participation of ethnic minorities in the production of national culture is given fresh attention. The essays in this collection theorise broad historical trends, movements, and case studies that extend the discursive limits of Polish national and cultural identity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056807629","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb74e","mniswId":"400","name":"Cambridge

problem of state estimation for a certain class of non-linear uncertain systems has been addressed in this paper. In particular, a sliding mode observer has been derived to produce robust and stable estimates of the state variables. The stability and robustness of the proposed sliding mode observer have been investigated under parametric and unstructured uncertainty in the system dynamics. In order to ensure an unambiguous non-linear state (coordinates) transformation, the appropriate system model for the observer synthesis has been devised and analysed. The stability analysis of dynamics of estimation error has been carried out, based on the Lyapunov stability theory in relation to Lipschitz assumptions for non-linear functions. In order to validate the performance of the devised observer, it has been applied to the model of a continuous stirred tank reactor (bioreactor). The promising simulation results have been obtained and they demonstrate the high effectiveness of the devised approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056807947","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f34a39543c7410626f1f2","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Czyżniewski","uuid":"B5199D467BADF243B14CA51FDBEC249EB1790B72FE8ED5344680E3F04EA6DBA04E8A58AD23384867914EDBEE1BAC4764A78C78BF84899F7ED5280C7E62CC2130","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"36e743d7-7fd0-4da8-af31-ed387f62f952"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9e5","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Łangowski","uuid":"9DC5146DF6ABE83D82EEB0ADB6CEBF1DB70C38680ABFA8C879071C38B2B7A8A859AF311939645622A2250D492E7D487CB3233ED3ECA800F86400169682961045","orcidId":"0000-0003-1150-9753","documentHash":"c3a4c477-16bf-4421-8928-58b8448460ab"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.isatra.2021.05.040"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["immune response","lead","magnesium","oxidative stress","transcription factors"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Critical aspects of the physiological interactions between lead and magnesium","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454784d0","mniswId":"10295","title":"Journal of Biochemical and Molecular Toxicology","doi":null,"issn":"1095-6670","eissn":"1099-0461","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fabc68bc-685b-4ce5-99ef-52088224d4fc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6194ac1e2467f030365ced11","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6605646b4097076263386516","6605646b4097076263386517","5e709295878c28a047398723","6605646b4097076263386518"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Despite technological progress, exposure to lead is an ongoing problem.

The results indicated that nanoemulsion\ntreatments significantly prolonged the shelf-life of the fillets. Treatment inhibited increases in pH and TVB-N, and retarded lipid\noxidation and hydrolysis. Sensory assessment revealed that treatment induced shelf-life extension from 10 to 14 days, compared with controls. Microbiological analyses showed nanoemulsion treatment caused shelf-life extension from 10 to 12 days\nwith reduction of microbiological contamination by up to 1 log cfu g−1 in mesophilic and 1.5 log cfu g−1 in psychrotrophic\nbacteria.\nCONCLUSION: Considering the results, grape seed and cinnamon essential oil nanoemulsions could be considered as novel antimicrobial and antioxidant materials for shelf-life extension of flathead mullet fillets during cold storage."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056816908","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d5a2792467f04573fb2d64","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"102","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"e95f4ad9-f160-48d7-8798-adcfc2bb428d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"102","pagesFromTo":"105-112","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jsfa.11336","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6194ec992467f07a86483c57","name":"Saliha","lastName":"Boudjenah‐Haroun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27d17df7-11d2-4557-99e7-1d02c02a666b"},{"objectId":"6194ec992467f07a86483c55","name":"Mustafa","lastName":"Durmus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"167f0d38-0dda-4882-a5d6-444a322f087b"},{"objectId":"6194ec992467f07a86483c54","name":"Yilmaz","lastName":"Ucar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5f99f5d-ea34-4187-a551-9505cc9b8544"},{"objectId":"6194ec992467f07a86483c53","name":"Fatih","lastName":"Ozogul","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"306ed8e6-2e3d-4895-b9ba-c51cab0478ec"},{"objectId":"6194ec992467f07a86483c51","name":"Abdelkader","lastName":"Bensid","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"014d3760-337c-4775-97b2-80db2a2f1e9e"},{"objectId":"6194ec992467f07a86483c4c","name":"Abderrahmane","lastName":"Ameur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6dfc4425-95b6-4744-b12b-99e2d8c3ad9a"},{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b7817","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kulawik","uuid":"37B0B9B20DE16C032F406D23DB0DBB50FF82E7AAC30E627AC2043D54746982400A7233D8273632065345E1E0A49C9848BDC746A7ABE97373A70EB02B31AF4322","orcidId":"0000-0002-1696-4045","documentHash":"06fa144b-db0d-44b3-a417-51a84849752f"}],"doi":"10.1002/jsfa.11336"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Voting rule","Condorcet extension","No-show paradox","Plurality runoff","Monotonicity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"618189fd2467f038351e3599","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-84997-9","title":"Collective Decisions: Theory, Algorithms And Decision Support Systems","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-030-84999-3","ismn":null,"issn":"2198-4182","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-84997-9","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"72e20ffb-1f61-4df5-a886-9ba5a8330e33","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a04739101f","5e70922b878c28a047391000"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Voting Systems in Theory and Practice","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"619639092467f011e2b6c0e0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["619639092467f011e2b6c0e2","5e70922b878c28a047391000","5e70922b878c28a04739101f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Voting procedures are typically motivated by social choice desiderata or criteria of performance.

and objective:\nReports on tick-borne infections in free-living juvenile animals and their impact on survival of cervids in nature are lacking. The aim of the study was to detect and identify the Babesia and Anaplasma phagocytophilum species/ecotypes that may have contributed to the death of juvenile animals from a wildlife rescue centre in spring 2020.\n\nMaterial and methods:\nPCR amplification and sequencing of two genetic markers (18S rDNA and cox1 for Babesia, 16S rDNA and groEL for A. phagocytophilum) were used for screening eleven samples derived from juvenile animals which died in a rescue centre (seven roe deer Capreolus capreolus, one elk Alces alces, one red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, one European beaver Castor fiber, one red fox Vulpes vulpes). Phylogenetic analysis of full-length 18S rDNA sequence was performed to enable differentiation between two closely-related species infecting wild ungulates, Babesia capreoli and Babesia divergens (zoonotic).\n\nResults:\nThe occurrence of the typical SNPs of B. capreoli at two discriminating positions in the 18S rRNA gene allowed identification of B. capreoli infection in a roe deer calf. In two calves, Anaplasma phagocytophilum ecotype 2 was identified, including the same calf co-infection. No Babesia DNA was amplified in an elk calf treated for babesiosis. Splenomegaly was recorded in roe deer calves with A. phagocytophilum and A. phagocytophilum + B. capreoli infection.\n\nConclusions:\nThe study revealed that tick-borne infections are common among juvenile, free-living cervids and may contribute to their mortality."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056839259","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.26444/aaem/142513","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62bbb928752340195a3abe23","name":"Mustafa","lastName":"Al-Sarraf","uuid":"EF1931AEBC52D0200ABF921762228FD6DC3C4D7F8D4033137A77FF5AC40E1D2D676A6BFB00A90A98F86DF485E1FF3F59D574D68044829E81F4A40635F5B56A9B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d0d889b-37c3-4f9a-8ad4-54bdf97c6135"},{"objectId":"5fc51d61085dcb1e6ae0ba1a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kowalec","uuid":"3F6F5065ACD372B39A790E3FF7E336F08381B893BC1705BE867080307FCE147DFD641DC6770EA65741323BE1EB155517B800AB8EB039B33D6F2E7497C966E196","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b373646e-2652-4ccb-9a46-0af02f95a7b7"},{"objectId":"5e70936e878c28a0473a962f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Dwużnik-Szarek","uuid":"F11D0F98C11C94ED8FF3F89062C87CF2E840C8E5E65B9CBA84F8E329560A023E96307E1E579C1C475D1F53D06CF0B22A16B4AF73B1CDFE21F417EE0A471D88C8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2264-8345","documentHash":"b870ddc6-53dd-4bdd-8c24-6eb99b31f2c1"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7b27","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bajer","uuid":"CFABF0F0670A3951C164D446A05687F43D50517386E9CE8D94202C83A71899872438A3F8AF2E9DC6580568DE4AA89D59DCF3C66F8EB29BEB53F5E095BAB33B50","orcidId":"0000-0001-6199-8458","documentHash":"c42c126b-502c-4c00-8b3b-3d0b29d0f4b1"}],"doi":"10.26444/aaem/142513"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["news media use","political knowledge","news repertoires","cross-national","comparative research"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffd5e4c085dcb6be6b60b07"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Navigating High-Choice European Political Information Environments: a Comparative Analysis of News User Profiles and Political Knowledge","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454782a1","mniswId":"9272","title":"International Journal of Press/Politics","doi":null,"issn":"1940-1612","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b4fd5436-cfd4-4b1b-accb-bdc79c15d1ff"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-05-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61964e032467f03036842ad7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61964e032467f03036842ad9","61964e032467f03036842ada","61964e032467f03036842adb","61964e032467f03036842adc","61964e032467f03036842add","61964e032467f03036842ade","61964e032467f03036842adf","61964e032467f03036842ae0","61964e032467f03036842ae1","61964e032467f03036842ae3","61964e032467f03036842ae4","61964e032467f03036842ae5","61964e032467f03036842ae6","61964e032467f03036842ae7","61964e032467f03036842ae8","61964e032467f03036842ae9","5e7092f4878c28a04739fe39","5ffd5e4c085dcb6be6b60b07"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The transition from low- to high-choice media environments has had far-reaching implications for citizens’ media use and its relationship with political knowledge. However, there is still a lack of comparative research on how citizens combine the usage of different media and how that is related to political knowledge. To fill this void, we use a unique cross-national survey about the online and offline media use habits of more than 28,000 individuals in 17 European countries. Our aim is to (i) profile different types of news consumers and (ii) understand how each user profile is linked to political knowledge acquisition. Our results show that five user profiles – news minimalists, social media news users, traditionalists, online news seekers, and hyper news consumers – can be identified, although the prevalence of these profiles varies across countries. Findings further show that both traditional and online-based news diets are correlated with higher political knowledge.

verification of distributed systems becomes very important in distributed computing. The graphical insight into the system in the early and late stages of the project is essential. In the design phase, the visual input helps to articulate the collaborative distributed components clearly. The formal verification gives evidence of correctness or malfunction, but in the latter case, graphical simulation of counterexample helps for better understanding design errors. For these purposes, we invented Distributed Autonomous and Asynchronous Automata (DA3), which have the same semantics as the formal verification base—Integrated Model of Distributed Systems (IMDS). The IMDS model reflects the natural characteristics of distributed systems: unicasting, locality, autonomy, and asynchrony. Distributed automata have all of these features because they share the same semantics as IMDS. In formalism, the unified system definition has two views: the server view of the cooperating distributed nodes and the agent view of the migrating agents performing distributed computations. The automata have two formally equivalent forms that reflect two views: Server DA3 for observing servers exchanging messages, and Agent DA3 for tracking agents, which visit individual servers in their progress of distributed calculations. We present the DA3 formulation based on the IMDS formalism and their application to design and verify distributed systems in the Dedan environment. DA3 formalism is compared with other concepts of distributed automata known from the literature."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056858766","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-36","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10270-021-00917-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092fe878c28a0473a0ae1","name":"Wiktor","lastName":"Daszczuk","uuid":"8FC793B98C0018E4E06027DF1DE3164B49384CB72D611557B927A38E9112F816D38C6C2E679D6F504E08BF64506A8F8F502E2BC01EF3FBB64EF38FDA6C561A84","orcidId":"0000-0001-7532-362X","documentHash":"555dca1a-7d88-479c-a34f-d3da1dbac3f2"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10270-021-00917-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["photogrammetry","RVOT","right

[1] report increased mortality after open colorectal cancer surgery (HR1.26). Is this conclusion validated by the data presented? The explanation of the decision process regarding type of surgery is probably not sufficient as at the end of the analysed period (2018) only 4% patients had open surgery. With such a low percentage of patients having open surgery comparison with laparoscopic surgery group is difficult.\n\nThere seems to be a bias against open surgery, which is obviously abandoned. It is likely that this process leads to loss of necessary competence in open surgery. This trend is extremely dangerous as laparoscopic surgery must not be performed without an option of safe conversion to open surgery. The authors mention adjustment for confounders but this process is not described in the study, and obviously no pair-matching was performed. Despite the obvious negative surgical selection, the cohorts are not comparable – the open group is significantly older, has significantly poorer ASA-status and significantly more advanced TNM-stage – these alone would be a good explanation for a poorer survival. The arguments delivered by the authors of alleged increased rate of incisional hernias and adhesion-related bowel obstructions remain controversial [2, 3] and does not explain the extent of increased mortality. Finally, the presented survival data are implausible. The text states 37% with 5 years mortality in the open and 22% mortality in the laparoscopic groups. However, the numbers under figure 2 show that after 3 years, 927 of 1262 patients in the open group (73.4%) were alive, contrary to 1691/3196 (52.9%) in the laparoscopic group.

schools of thought share two fundamental assumptions about language. On the one hand, language (<jats:italic>śabda</jats:italic>) is identified with conceptual thinking (<jats:italic>kalpanā</jats:italic>), which according to the Buddhist doctrine (<jats:italic>dharma</jats:italic>) separates us from the momentary and fleeting nature of reality (<jats:italic>satya</jats:italic>, “truth”). Language is comprised of generally applicable forms, which fuel the reificatory proclivity for clinging to the distorted – and ultimately fictious – belief in substantial existence. On the other hand, the distrust of language is mitigated by the doctrine of ineffability (<jats:italic>anirdeśya</jats:italic>), which although asserts that reality is beyond the scope of linguistic description, submits that philosophical analyses of key Buddhist concepts is a means of overcoming the limitations that language imposes on our experience and facilitating insight into the nature of reality (<jats:italic>bodhi</jats:italic>). This paper provides an overview of Buddhist philosophy of language, with an emphasis on the dialectical view of language as indispensable but ultimately insufficient for contemplation. The Buddhist discussions of ineffability are explicated and compared with its treatment in modern Occidental thought, specifically the similarities and differences with Wittgenstein’s philosophy of language."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056887231","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"483-496","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11245-021-09756-z","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6040624a9543c711bc6ea524","name":"Johan","lastName":"Blomberg","uuid":"7512D0D022315D8659CF9743AC3F479055B1A5C67332C25118FCE042ABEEC2D27E0C86274B1563A786156CB2643A442B631E61B09A52D79C3220BBE30625FA17","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7cb48472-fcd2-4054-9c44-a2f79b72624a"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bfaf","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Żywiczyński","uuid":"7E0694270BE5C6991EA970FEEE4CB55A57670DF366B8B9284DFDBFFF0EE69D73A7CD6BCE467E43B340323CC1B9F817C967EEA84444EFA7684EC80D1D64180742","orcidId":"0000-0002-0267-3845","documentHash":"5d3079e2-8835-445b-ac34-3e7a1172abdb"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11245-021-09756-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["8-hydroxyquinoline","thin films","photoluminescence spectroscopy","transmittance","third harmonic generation","density functional theory calculations (DFT)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Linear and nonlinear optical properties of Manganese bis-(8- hydroxyquinoline) thin films for optoelectronic devices : experimental and computational studies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788b4","mniswId":"11918","title":"Journal of Molecular Structure","doi":null,"issn":"0022-2860","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6a90b3fb-ffdb-4989-8b77-5343a0ab6e9e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6199bbd52467f0303697d517","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c0878c28a04739bf92","5e7092bf878c28a04739bee3","66013a4e40970762631acdd0","66013a4e40970762631acdd1","66013a4e40970762631acdd2","66013a4e40970762631acdd3","5e7092bf878c28a04739bebe","5e7093ba878c28a0473afdfc","66013a4e40970762631acdd4","66013a4e40970762631acdd5","66013a4e40970762631acdd6","66013a4e40970762631acdd7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Linear and nonlinear optical properties of Manganese bis-(8-hydroxyquinoline) (Mnq2) were investigated in this work as thin film. The thin film of Mnq2 were deposited by Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) tech- nique in a high vacuum under the pressure 2 ×10-5 Tr. The morphology of the surface of the deposited Mnq2 thin film was analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) in non-contact mode. The AFM image shows an homogenous and a good quality of thin film. Optical parameters such as the energy gap (2.8 eV) were determined by transmittance measurement in the spectral range of 30 0–110 0 nm. A dependence of luminescence at low temperature from 10K to 300K is observed, showing a decrease of luminescence when the temperature increases. Third order nonlinear optical (ONL) response of Mnq2 was measured using the third harmonic generation (THG) technique. Third ONL susceptibility was calculated based on the theoretical model of Kubodera and Kobayashi. The theoretical studies of the absorption spectrum, HOMO, LUMO energy levels and HOMO-LUMO energy gap of Mnq2 have been evaluated by using den- sity functional theory calculations (DFT) using UPBE0/def2-TZVP level of theory. The calculated theoretical values of Mnq2 were found to be in good agreement with the experimental findings."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056887674","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1249","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66013a4e40970762631acdd7","name":"Youssef","lastName":"El

cities have clear connotations: The Hague is regarded as the global capital of justice the Hague is regarded as the global capital of justice (sometimes of justice and peace), Brussels as the centre of the European Union (EU), transatlantic relations (NATO) and European diplomacy, and Geneva is closely associated with human rights (Human Rights Council), International Labor Organization (ILO) and humanitarian protection (International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent). The aim of this paper is to examine the correlation between the cities’ image/connotations and their position in international relations. Do such connotations increase cities’ influence? Has this image been planned and shaped by cities themselves or was it rather a coincidence? Or have other actors – i.e. foreign States cooperating with the host State (the latter means the nation-State of the city) – contributed to it? This research objective will be achieved through an analysis of municipal legislation and strategies exploiting these connotations and associations, and content analysis of the most representative literature. The authors will also take into account the relevant cities’ participation in cities’ networks (including the profiles of such networks) and the placement of headquarters of international organizations (governmental and non-governmental) in the cities in question."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056887707","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"1034-1054","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09654313.2021.1992357","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f869171085dcb410a25ee85","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dahl","uuid":"20C6AB59AF995D3C81E60812507FB669421B4E98AD2B4905C7E129C5CB2F97B0FDF574BC593FFAA750184331793B2AC11E7A81AF086A3C69AE4CA4031E98966A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ccb112b-8412-4d26-a909-18f8c15e7006"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c16e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Szpak","uuid":"409C7C8CCFC51A3D430CBC2B3C85BC2F48DD9B02F43FF27DF07804814211437271D1938002115862C57DF62E6BE5AA8D63DBF05B799E6B11A04377EBB286E74B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1333ef45-ec06-4a3f-a987-452ec1336954"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739be55","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Modrzyńska","uuid":"B289A9EFD0199C8B4D252A5D39D2614B067EF63A30C08487F4C03C80A545FDAFFB4C82E987CB6C7049EEBAC067001B066F058AAD3B18FD26757568A2907F91C4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ce566b7-e622-418b-95f4-68b8b82e9506"}],"doi":"10.1080/09654313.2021.1992357"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Simply connected algebra","Hochschild cohomology","Auslander-Reiten quiver","tame algebra","generalized multicoil algebra"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The simple connectedness of tame algebras with separating almost cyclic coherent Auslander-Reiten components","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f4f","mniswId":"783","title":"Algebras and Representation Theory","doi":null,"issn":"1386-923X","eissn":"1572-9079","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6f66d3de-c6b6-4381-8cde-92afb49acba9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-05-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6199b8a12467f0303696bf31","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092bd878c28a04739bd6c"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We study the simple connectedness of the class of finitedimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field for which the Auslander–Reiten quiver admits a separating family of\r\nalmost cyclic coherent components.

Mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (ICP MS) was used to determine the total content of Rh in solutions obtained after the processes of digestion and extraction. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) supported the investigation of Rh NPs decomposition and proved the presence of uptaken nano forms in plant tissues. Adsorptive stripping voltammetry (AdSV) allowed to distinguish ionic and metallic forms of Rh, based on the fact that Rh NPs are electrochemically inactive. A two-step digestion procedure with H2SO4 and HNO3 was proposed for efficient decomposition of Rh NPs. Based on single extractions with selected extractants, it was found that independently of its chemical form Rh is substantially immobilized in soil. The mobility of Rh(III) and Rh NPs was below 38% and 0.02%, and the accumulation factor in leaves equaled 0.2 and 4.4, respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056904724","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d40adc2467f0627df4b087","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"806","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"3b772d0e-ab3a-4acb-a104-e2822e5be920"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"806","pagesFromTo":"art. no 151272","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969721063506?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63116aa9752340385139d10e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kińska","uuid":"E63520B7AD3213120C00C22A40C7441540487B76755B785DCF2F14735D1ABC840C2DA2AA008CBD3DF8CFC071D9F73F8097D08E06B109E61A1473743C435641EC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1666-8430","documentHash":"7bd09347-977e-442a-9ef5-95a41c4d1911"},{"objectId":"5f854d8f085dcb410a25ed6e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Biaduń","uuid":"94429B0808B971AFB6B28F35CD3F4213224FEBFC68FDCFA7A7EF475085B9176FCC7C37B370FD66CF4141E56923338EE935BE64C44001558FC91DF1AA584BC96A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0947-9383","documentHash":"11bf5fb0-15a5-4653-856e-729759b46643"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7ec4","name":"Marianna","lastName":"Gniadek","uuid":"75BEED6FE0D9045CD3C0F1573000D5AB545062B7BBDC19F966A98D9F4D327C7A8629FFB036C98D59CB109DA26ACC17673EBE341C565B590996A9CE1320E04EF5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2206-5174","documentHash":"85dd67dd-ceff-4296-b097-f80f359c7efe"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a8b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"C8736EEDD62395452CF6378F4888E875D0D76501745B5DB52FA5F1A69D99FE9F99F568D93A2B3F19D04488B93190E16F3083CA93F0C14FD310D40A6C475A4856","orcidId":"0000-0001-5310-3802","documentHash":"0166ea7e-8620-4384-a6b4-315332fc5b0e"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a79e1","name":"Beata","lastName":"Krasnodębska-Ostręga","uuid":"D40DBE82D0EE65B7F3F7C4E6EE7B0A07D14615CC42CEF23272332DF2001C9D77FCC84CF686383571004AAB60DBE659DBB6E2A1F5CE3A4728DF89A3437939D7AF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6513-7006","documentHash":"a57761f1-7eab-4f8d-bf49-90afdb2e4638"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151272"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["heritability","political attitudes","twin studies","behavioural genetics","genes"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Psychologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7cb2"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094cd878c28a0473c410c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"It Is Not Only the Environment That Matters: A Short Introduction to Research on the Heritability of Political Attitudes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479313","mniswId":"16328","title":"Political Studies Review","doi":null,"issn":"1478-9299","eissn":"1478-9302","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5c57ae0f-cd88-44c8-900a-26cd8f3b4db2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"619ce2422467f038101e7df0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709359878c28a0473a7cb2","5e7094cd878c28a0473c410c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the article, we review key methodological issues and study results on the heritability of political attitudes. These studies show to what degree the variance of observed attitudes can be explained by genetic variance. We have analysed studies differing in terms of applied methods, techniques and research tools, as well as sample populations of different age and sex structures. Regardless of these differences, the studies show that political attitudes are most likely influenced to some extent by genetic factors. This research suggests that the influence of genes on attitudes is subject to change over the life cycle. It also provides knowledge regarding the mechanisms that may link genes and attitudes. The studies conducted to date offer the opportunity to broaden the culturalism-based explanations of political attitudes with biological aspects; however, they also point to several issues that will require additional attention from the researchers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056910210","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e0de8940970740cdc748a2","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"21","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"e2f22ae0-2c34-4710-bfc0-2cbfebc24381"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"144-161","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14789299211053780","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cd878c28a0473c410c","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Wajzer","uuid":"F23D6FB7706E896B09066A5997B4A84CBA9ADDD623E2D9A42016C36A4EA3D57FA14EEC280890BBB1A8E8947C20F82AA1A29DD43C72DC5C40598B1F13FF15B607","orcidId":"0000-0002-3108-883X","documentHash":"0db2d750-c295-4b28-9791-44104bf3b04b"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7cb2","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Dragan","uuid":"1EDE101A22AC913E137B21A24210E5C68210533C1435847FB3FD13234588D326CC656BB0C75DBB96DFCE9A0271C268A7E417385D5EF6B097188E2917D48B0F59","orcidId":"0000-0002-3349-6562","documentHash":"bbbcab5d-d053-41ca-ab59-2178102a7819"}],"doi":"10.1177/14789299211053780"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biological invasions","grassland restoration","Solidago eradication","soil mesofauna"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ed","602fa36c9543c7410626f6da","5e709274878c28a047395fd8","5e709479878c28a0473bde3a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of Solidago Eradication Methods on Soil Invertebrates - Preliminary Studies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479300","mniswId":"16298","title":"Polish Journal of Environmental Studies","doi":null,"issn":"1230-1485","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"747e133a-d702-4b1d-925b-61dd40d9fefe"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2021-10-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"619cf2722467f0381022eabe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602fa36c9543c7410626f6da","5e709479878c28a0473bde3a","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ed","5e709274878c28a047395fd8"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Evaluation of belowground impacts of methods of invasive plant eradication, especially in the context of grassland restoration, gives information about rates of ecosystem restoration.

A two-factorial experiment using: (1) different methods of seed introduction and composition (sowing the seed mixture of pasture grasses, pasture grasses with legumes, seed collected from a semi-natural meadow, and application of fresh hay), and (2) different frequencies of mowing (once, twice and three times per year), was established during the restoration of grassland which had been invaded by Solidago plants. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block design with four replications. The results were revealed that mowing intensity decreased the abundance of Chilopoda and Isopoda, while the introduction of fresh hay used in grassland restoration positively affected nematodes. Also, the biological soil quality index based on arthropods (QBS-ar) indicated a decrease of soil biological quality in stands mown 2 and 3 times in comparison to mowing once. Further studies are needed to investigate the soil mesofauna dynamics exposed by mowing, and plant

In the stage of 5–6 leaves, goldenrod plants, were foliar sprayed with AEs,\nat concentrations of 5 or 10%. The biochemical properties of AEs, i.e., total phenolic content, total antioxidant potential\nand selected plant hormones, were examined. Two and ten days after spraying (DAS), damages to aboveground parts of\ngoldenrods (necrosis and wilting) were visually assessed. The fresh mass of above- and belowground parts of goldenrods\nwere measured 21 DAS. AEs from various parts of Canadian goldenrod or giant goldenrod displayed autoallelopathic properties\nof inhibitory nature. The phytotoxic potential of AEs varied depending on their source. Canadian goldenrod was more\nsusceptible to the AEs, manifested by more significant damages to aboveground parts and a greater decrease in above- and\nbelowground biomass. The most effective against growth and development of Canadian goldenrod and giant goldenrod were\nAEs from rhizomes, which caused a reduction of fresh biomass of goldenrods up to 42%, compared to water-treated control."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056910781","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63355b6f4097074d8cb139c7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"44","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"dd92620c-51ad-45b7-9576-aaf8f28d1d37"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"44","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11738-021-03330-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"619cf2412467f0381022d888","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Gala-Czekaj","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0559-2140","documentHash":"d3dad4cb-4244-49dc-a104-5b1a63a2e57d"},{"objectId":"619cf2412467f0381022d886","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Synowiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6585-7759","documentHash":"b5612899-4d53-4c84-9542-c6e9be423d6f"},{"objectId":"619cf2412467f0381022d884","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8265-6243","documentHash":"848ffd42-6f32-45f3-a0a2-a002324c1375"},{"objectId":"619cf2412467f0381022d883","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Gala-Czekaj","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0559-2140","documentHash":"b945b56e-83ec-48c7-9d49-ec85887f540a"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b85","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":"C508B84A3E98AF91D4A7CF2B3F96DCF5CDDD04199D55EC6231120160D35F2346ADF8454B963FAF986327F88BE636B80D8617AF7648BCC065B4DC89242B986449","orcidId":"0000-0002-8265-6243","documentHash":"2fccdaa3-374f-450a-82fb-cb867a75d10a"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a6213","name":"Jan","lastName":"Bocianowski","uuid":"391C1FF81E4D06BDB1BA7D2B74F8107177EB502C2A545EB148191803E6A09B0E09985B40A2747549E943652BC40A92F71703E3A3EDEDE4ECEE628E5F9AEA359C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0102-0084","documentHash":"205ebbcd-f379-4dbe-a68e-7e3989223edf"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11738-021-03330-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Eastern Mediterranean","Climate change","Intertropical Convergence Zone","Lagoon","Sea-level change","Sebennitic branch"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df17","uid":"bxvEdTB_rZDwTwDCxKD8MAA","uuid":"baafdd5c-15d8-49db-ac14-1067a5fabd1b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Geologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d5878c28a0473b1891","5e70935b878c28a0473a7e35"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","uid":"bpBenp-xOEUyWFZisxulIDw","uuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","name":"Uniwersytet Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b23a"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","uid":"b8lEq4e8f8p1V09_nBsO4Ew","uuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","parentUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","rootUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","name":"Akademia Bialska im.

The lagoon has been fed since the Middle Holocene by the Sebennitic branch of the Nile and marine intrusions through the Bughaz inlet. A sediment core (BO-1) was collected at the northeastern shore of the lagoon and sampled at centennial scale resolution in order to reconstruct the development of the lagoon. The results show that an initial and limited lagoon had developed at the end of the Early Holocene, but after a dry period ca. 7.2 cal ka BP it has been progressively transformed into a marshy area, with occasional inflows of sea water. Lower water level and higher salinity of the Burullus Lagoon at 6.0–5.5 and 4.8–4.2 cal ka BP reflected droughts in the Nile catchment. Thereafter, the river reactivated in the Burullus Lagoon area, and since 2.8 cal ka BP was accompanied by occasional inflows of sea water. Since ca. 0.8 cal ka BP, increased fluvial activity occurred in this part of the Nile delta, which terminated after construction of the Aswan dams in the twentieth century."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056927725","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d6baca40970739ecaddb41","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"107","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"2b865aa3-c0e3-4eca-ad7a-3d48c1b3fd6d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"107","pagesFromTo":"87-103","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0033589421000636","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"619e22bb2467f057769f80c2","name":"Abdelfattah","lastName":"Zalat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b21bb21a-0363-48e7-a828-0e2ad599b01d"},{"objectId":"619e22bb2467f057769f80c1","name":"Alaa","lastName":"Salem","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd7308fa-4348-402a-b6c1-a7628df60e99"},{"objectId":"619e22bb2467f057769f80c0","name":"Zhongyuan","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b78f979-b074-41dc-9f4b-11edd6e64332"},{"objectId":"619e22bb2467f057769f80be","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Holuša","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dbe420b5-3621-4fa2-a61d-2f105e6833ad"},{"objectId":"5ebed838752340254fc40ed1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Rogóż-Matyszczak","uuid":"DCF99165ACBA0CDDDD6E51691B5754564B69F2CC47A6FD108416A157AFFB13936F932C2D7190A53FC1A45371D010663D7A290614AC65F3FD60A8B27923DCAE11","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"554348a4-9d6d-4993-bd82-58037a23c469"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5aa9","name":"Jarmila","lastName":"Krzymińska","uuid":"5CED0DB061E2DB3B59ED1B200E3BA0439CE48710AA89C6237F3CFC63650F8C611047A8A38438ED6FA0D1EF988068DD308A74AD946E125E6CDA010501030C152C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae3b386b-ff9c-4927-a5f7-7c02b1a0925c"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b1891","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Woronko","uuid":"4853C0C6E6E663641609BE7FE65CFC517D9766A758E7CD66F8888D131C4D981E7B27417DE8A5ED96EB81F8AB1B30CEC697766E6CCE39C837C20E835A0756D408","orcidId":"0000-0002-2763-5650","documentHash":"7a0e80ad-5a40-40b7-9bfd-3ea3d32c19dc"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7e35","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Szymanek","uuid":"565E3EAF1119E4D7816464F9783D090F51EDEFBA4285D3440C00EF2687E6DED8C1EB31E43F79C6ABE89454C164EF9CFD99675A3EEB84CAEAD0566EA85DB613C8","orcidId":"0000-0002-6033-8025","documentHash":"84c470ae-ffb8-4e28-9bc2-82c31803a5d6"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7811","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Nitychoruk","uuid":"B9A25480891B770435B513986E15947B8011057D27F48E50B50AF4BB0BAFDD5E6A80845515E2A2EED73A4B70D979DAC47C43DA6E5D09B1E66BF42E143CC67AD6","orcidId":"0000-0002-8469-346X","documentHash":"51852181-2bec-4c53-8191-7f6bdccbd552"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a6a1f","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Marks","uuid":"048CAC78DBF8EE343584C87DF549831E6CB1B90EC367AE2169D82AD538E7D968479BF167756675C1126D0DEA86F2C16995FEE6513E4E9D4AC5C09A79A4FDCC83","orcidId":"0000-0002-4507-1828","documentHash":"961bf1b7-bb4d-49d5-9e94-3c44bea5869d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b23a","name":"Fabian","lastName":"Welc","uuid":"FB3A9EFE6895BCBF42614847D6410219AE4DC805906395C7B33EC0855E813DBE2D1E76101C522EB79E994A375B9CF9B3A97FE53AC564515EF8D381E45C7B2697","orcidId":"0000-0001-6122-1884","documentHash":"c8d59900-8f04-4ecc-ae51-f9de9bb6c6a8"}],"doi":"10.1017/qua.2021.63"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["academic

article offers analyses of the phenomenon of copying (plagiarism) in higher education. The analyses were based on a quantitative survey using questionnaires, conducted in 2019 at one of the Polish universities. Plagiarism is discussed here both as an element of the learning process and a subject of public practices. The article presents students’ definitions of plagiarism, their strategies for unclear or difficult situations, their experiences with plagiarism and their opinions on how serious and widespread this phenomenon is. Focusing on the non-plagiarism norm, that is the rule that students are not allowed to plagiarize, and in order to redefine it we have determined two strategies adopted by students. The first is withdrawing in fear of making a mistake (omitting the norm), which means not using referencing in unclear situations, e.g. when the data about the source of information are absent. The second is reducing the scope of the norm applicability (limiting the norm), characterized by the fact that there are areas where the non-plagiarism norm must be observed more closely and those where it is not so important, e.g. respondents classify works as credit-level and diploma-level texts, as in the credit-level work they “can” sometimes plagiarize since the detection rate is poor and consequences are not severe. The presented results are particularly significant for interpreting plagiarism in an international context (no uniform definition of plagiarism) and for policies aimed at limiting the scale of the phenomenon (plagiarism detection systems)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056931632","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"479-498","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10805-021-09419-z","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"660e70924097076263f0f3e7","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48117858-f1f5-4f3e-8e49-d2aeeb3469e2"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac414","name":"Beata","lastName":"Bielska","uuid":"39221AF822F8CA1D25F48191FF595541668B6925297D05A4A3DF8A85C1E721861D43C81E88027B96C92C9F4A1A6886D1F7725EBE25DD78CAE04C18D4010C24BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-5458-2435","documentHash":"3b66034e-a538-4ef4-b187-28814d78e3aa"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10805-021-09419-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fe878c28a04738e3d7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Parents' from Poland coping with the illness of a child - preliminary research.

Moreover, we study the geodesic curvature of the level curves and of the steepest descent for harmonic functions on surfaces with non-necessarily constant Gaussian curvature K. Such geodesic curvature functions turn out to satisfy certain Laplace-type equations and inequalities, from which we infer various maximum and minimum principles. The results are complemented by a number of growth estimates for the derivatives L′ and L′′ of the length of the level curve function L, as well as by examples illustrating the presentation.

Ingroup identification should be associated with favorable treatment of ingroup members. Collective narcissism, however, is more likely to predict using ingroup members for personal gain. In organizations, collective narcissism predicted promoting one’s own (vs. group) goals (prestudy: N = 179), and treating coworkers instrumentally (Study 1: N = 181; and longitudinal Study 2: N = 557). In Study 3 ( N = 214, partisan context), the link between collective narcissism and instrumental treatment of ingroup members was mediated by self-serving motives. In the experimental Study 4 ( N = 579, workplace teams), the effect of collective narcissism on instrumental treatment was stronger when the target was an ingroup (vs. outgroup) member.

The paper focuses on the biometeorological and mortality effects of the hot June that was observed in Central Europe in 2019. The basis of the study was hourly and daily Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) values at meteorological stations in Poland for June 2019. The average monthly air temperature and UTCI values from 1951 to 2018 were analysed as background. Grosswetterlagen calendar of atmospheric circulation was used to assess synoptic conditions of heat wave. Several heat strain measures were applied : net heat storage (S), modelled heart rate (HR), sultriness (HSI), and UTCI index. Actual total mortality (TM) and modelled strong heat-related mortality (SHRM) were taken as indicators of biometeorological consequences of the hot June in 2019. The results indicate that prolonged persistence of unusually warm weather in June 2019 was determined by the synoptic conditions occurring over the European region and causing advection of tropical air. They led to the emergence of heat waves causing 10% increase in TM and 5 times bigger SHRM then in preceding 10 years.

The unstable nature of renewable energy sources, depending on weather conditions, means that the amount of energy produced varies and is not always in line with peak demand. To ensure the security and stability of energy supplies in the energy system, renewable sources should cooperate with units independent of environmental conditions. With conventional steam systems, the main issue of such energy storage applied to steam turbine units presented in the paper, which, in the event of a need for a sudden reduction of the system load, prevents overloading of the boiler and turbines, improving the safety of the system. This article presents a thermodynamic model of this energy storage. A zero-dimensional (0D) model was implemented, including the operating parameters of the unit. This model directly relates to the thermodynamic parameters defined at specific points of the thermodynamic cycle. Based on the 0D model, it was shown that the process of loading the energy storage with steam leads to a load reduction of up to 4%. On the other hand, when discharging the stored energy, the net power of the steam block may increase by 0.4%. For more detailed analysis, a three-dimensional (3D) non-equilibrium with including cross effects approach was applied. This approach is based on flow models, with phase transitions that determine temperature fields, densities, phase transition in relevant space, and is used for more accurate analysis. Here we investigate the relationship between the 0D and 3D approaches in the context of steam storage. The combination of these two approaches is the fundamental novelty of the article."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056945517","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"144","pagesFromTo":"050905-1","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/energyresources/article-abstract/144/5/050905/1116405/Comprehensive-Thermodynamic-Analysis-of-Steam?redirectedFrom=fulltext","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b95e1","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Ziółkowski","uuid":"6B8100C725DCB44EB50597AB03468F19FBD9F9745740483815DC0E89E2F15DFDC8B24340E936E8D6678FE3AF216DFA415C5C30387308E6084F73C3BB4069D9CF","orcidId":"0000-0001-7480-0420","documentHash":"e2c21e6d-e083-4c5e-b0b8-0a89d2e9f88e"},{"objectId":"5e709423878c28a0473b6fa1","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Głuch","uuid":"5AE8D0BED37ECBD6E6D3A1F2B8CCF642A1EA11EECE8DE45BC9F682C611A5E7BED2951183ABD8C8416E251BD87CEE73F32FB16DD29A6C5808807D32FFDE0DEBC3","orcidId":"0000-0001-6685-1068","documentHash":"25e5da9b-62bc-4ffa-9639-0762e475395d"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b31","name":"Michał","lastName":"Stajnke","uuid":"B4CE52CF20260128541AB2AF460F6A5983A271717424EF7EB2E44F155C9E87B0833F78928FDC632D0231E90344C37BDB145F506040027B98884DE287D7D6F201","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb553490-a70a-4dc7-83f5-96c46ab11f68"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac182","name":"Anna","lastName":"Milewska","uuid":"1327812DD59C53099DBC8118D2470833D2679E031C4DA82F03CE60E085D6488E4E65F9D0843A2489AF2AE8894EBFBF4FBCEACE5ED91E57B8393B92D172E7101F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfccdf52-322f-480a-9275-5f35b3fac599"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac086","name":"Marta","lastName":"Drosińska-Komor","uuid":"344B370875E8F37C17F137AFA9676BE397235112796DD14C0D71D421EE966CBF081220CA6176567D24387354D1B4F8AC829D4E72B8EDCA743F3711815F0B988A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5614-1203","documentHash":"dee12971-d044-4a1d-9646-a360650e8429"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac083","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Szewczuk-Krypa","uuid":"26299402F7922CBD3DC073530EF839380EC2C58C98F7C3CB074E69B82E13E97232A027D713C35239842125F696281E35938D98F9588E252D335706758C0841F5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5824-0398","documentHash":"23eee5a2-5641-4cb4-b3d0-b79dc526b009"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399734","name":"Anna","lastName":"Butterweck","uuid":"E6AFC8B04851198A9D825F3DAEE06DF11815D9B7FB50EA4AFF34AF129635B55D33E66832E0261796A34A8BE741B2BA5F4898B8341747F374B30AD3B0CF1D6778","orcidId":"0000-0001-6504-3309","documentHash":"4aea95bb-3209-4de7-adbb-22243ee1df9b"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047393033","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Głuch","uuid":"2F08D27294B9C2C03B999DA2383D104F0BE24AF421D7364604E6405264E81ACABD00A096C4F921CB773B2295BC3CEC3CF742AAB8886D6B65BC2990F035327377","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"09b8ead4-e9d5-4d5e-98c5-e195cdb26557"}],"doi":"10.1115/1.4052249"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PCSE","spatial

Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to occur in DN and has been implicated in the underlying pathogenesis of disease. These complex organelles have an array of important cellular functions and involvement in signalling pathways; and understanding the intricacies of these responses in health, as well as how they are damaged in disease, is likely to highlight novel therapeutic avenues. A key cell type damaged early in DN is the podocyte and increasing studies have focused on investigating the role of mitochondria in podocyte injury.

Based on the analysis of four glass-forming Schiff bases, this article experimentally proves that self-organization via BHBs may be prevalent in H-bonding systems. Moreover, it explicitly shows that even high screening of the proton-donor and proton-acceptor groups is not a sufficient obstacle to form the BHBs. Even highly sterically hindered Schiff bases form lasting centrosymmetric dimers via a pair of BHBs in the liquid and glass phases. The driving force for their medium-range-scale ordering tendency is a disorder in the molecular scaffold, strictly bound to the N…H…O bond character. As a result, the protons of the BHBs center gain translational freedom. Finally, it is shown that, contrary to the prevailing opinion, Schiff bases can be good glass-forming systems with high glass transition temperatures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056954413","journalIssue":{"objectId":"614ce93a2467f03ebf955ab4","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"208e3de0-740b-492d-813f-c72cb8d5e664"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"348","pagesFromTo":"118052-1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016773222102777X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"619cc1cf2467f0381013d97b","name":"José","lastName":"Alemán","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af69c931-23bf-4a4c-b544-defd348923f6"},{"objectId":"619cc1cf2467f0381013d970","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Nowok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7cb912d0-c039-477e-8e4a-2b46a6fceace"},{"objectId":"602b75b99543c7410626dd79","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Grelska","uuid":"586E751973B732BCEF6F490FDA0C4D2F45C8A9E594473C67C806DB531B3DCF8ABA201F7DC7F29552C45944D7FAEA260B2CAE76A9F22084EFE40E05CBD705BE75","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b31e3dd4-5c3b-4888-9a32-46d23a621d2b"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8dd5","name":"Wioleta","lastName":"Cieślik","uuid":"918C137008D3EC10E2624FEA914A9787F6C3C0B12A59147B78667822A6DEA78D471D89C0AAFC9CFBE55A208588A0FC5F35C3388180D9BCB39AF75123584AADCD","orcidId":"0000-0001-6371-9061","documentHash":"9a37159e-a318-49e6-acd0-5c6fbcf3cc58"},{"objectId":"5e7093ec878c28a0473b360f","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Dulski","uuid":"D46B2D43DA8829C86F7302A8EFA822EDC21231D5F2E32641A4286A91BDC8B2A046B2C5D0C59ED7649D5B4F44E306148BF4B9C613938A37EA76B74F57A1AD1DC0","orcidId":"0000-0001-8686-1853","documentHash":"d5e73467-d454-4737-9626-db9c2de03af9"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac987","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Jurkiewicz","uuid":"36ED6327612C551BEB4D47A83E72D045771D9DADA97456ED7C9F801C82619A8812A7801EE863CACE3A5D8A5C76FC3285C00E1EE2390F30D25892828EF2F7F54F","orcidId":"0000-0002-4289-7827","documentHash":"a03ba1b7-75e8-4f31-8df2-7f19da7ac57e"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0d62","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szeremeta","uuid":"AE0467A2457784FCF410F9827A5C09F8AD3EFC540FB3F8DE07602C04A6944B89A0C697ACD740EE1444A2D8D83699CFCD4255BE26CE7E1588E65854661E9F33E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6105-4075","documentHash":"66ddf69c-bc80-419f-9d8a-931706623cab"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f164","name":"Robert","lastName":"Musioł","uuid":"CBCDDE25652273B05298FE524AAE4C374AB88DEF13D7D18625A2B5E5FB62724835985807CDE7C841F382F9A6BFBAF98C3E41663AA3387202CA09692F3D33EF88","orcidId":"0000-0002-6219-7369","documentHash":"a7e1649a-899a-422a-84c7-9e95e5d9cf6b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f157","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Pawlus","uuid":"92AC7357E054B99B6D310229F1C806C59CD914288AD5C6E189825BFA75C7C461F3FC97C7EAC2C58D3F1D791623DEEC9E9D5328368C097426F0623A99704B4BE0","orcidId":"0000-0001-9209-4056","documentHash":"b1ed1b04-b837-475b-a9a1-daf951df6d46"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2021.118052"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["spinal surgery","Failed Back Surgery Syndrome","patient dissatisfaction","chronic back pain","psychosocial factors"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c1878c28a0473b040b","5e7092cb878c28a04739cc01","5e709321878c28a0473a342e","5e70925e878c28a047394815","5e709470878c28a0473bd040"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","parentUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","rootUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Based on the Patient Satisfaction Index (PSI) at 6 months after surgery, we divided patients into two groups: a satisfied and a dissatisfied group. We evaluated the association between patient dissatisfaction and five categories of variables:1) sociodemographic; 2) preoperative pain and disability [pain duration, level of surgery, previous spinal surgeries, pain scores as measured by the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), numerical rating of average pain (NRS), disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)]; 3) preoperative psychological status [depression, anxiety, and overall distress as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), life satisfaction as measured by the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and surgery expectations (SE) as measured by a Likert scale]; 4) postoperative improvements in pain and disability [improvements in SF-MPQ, improvement in ODI] and 5) postoperative psychological status [HADS, SWLS]. Results showed that 17.8% patients were dissatisfied with surgery. In the multivariate logistic analysis, more negative surgery expectations, smaller improvement in ODI scores, and a greater postoperative overall distress were significant risk factors associated with patient dissatisfaction with surgery."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056956884","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d543284097074b28a9a896","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"e5e858a3-e9ba-4bc0-8c82-ae7b4f0f5b2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1084-1094","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/279722","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61980d1b2467f03036e4807e","name":"Eliza","lastName":"Krzanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57481740-ac8f-40dd-99da-78b6b6356e1f"},{"objectId":"5e709470878c28a0473bd040","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Polak","uuid":"7D1BF7CD5501D1B69F55BD9CC597D07297418837C8780C3939A523A9009DF0D427FBBD2B732D64CAAADD94404F7013654431D4F6A3AC0D0551231229559CB2F5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"549a3534-06a7-48d1-8f93-460b1e87b35f"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b040b","name":"Renata","lastName":"Zajączkowska","uuid":"530259E04E069582143F94172736B3DEB0B2E463B9303E06FAFED98128DCFBD0471D93799231310150AAD3584B25C280126B8014A147FBC55803E4287E33AAF9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ddc2cbf-719c-4e1e-bf9c-a0dcf5b00bdd"},{"objectId":"5e709321878c28a0473a342e","name":"Marek","lastName":"Moskała","uuid":"2524F122AAFDD7BEA6F81289CEDF583CDF0DB43AAFEF55C89E69F6587B00B4E439DA0F42A26CB3531543907895AA2BC08D4553BE289A80B505343A23618EB279","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b6f5a9f6-4f6f-4239-95fb-30e2442f7700"},{"objectId":"5e709312878c28a0473a2450","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Przewłocki","uuid":"A7F008213E824DB889EC7373C76D51BFF7CA319D30FDF2179E4286AF023C39D6B4DC2A08FC8B8A24E05543297DD8D0F2DF25E067B0B334F57AC65A270A9274CC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4606-1629","documentHash":"d7775f55-f886-44ce-a7dd-e8df1e359871"},{"objectId":"5e7092cb878c28a04739cc01","name":"Donata","lastName":"Liberacka","uuid":"9BA9D3F89A09CDD169CE54A33FA8315DBA165A5A9383995FBA772E793E133E10D37D88E04FF3A04B902C786A1896D133088274397BB6D215C20DF357EEECD8EC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3efea273-e5b9-45c8-b0b7-d3314cc1ce90"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a047394815","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Wordliczek","uuid":"A6FC1ED536C56FEE1E3411EEBAC03392F87A23DA1A3447467A1CA987A6736CE7BF2F6E7C41CF7B91A07663FBCF6F6E668B61B18B30ED7D436DD0B23F1E25809B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da5af8ef-2fb8-4191-bca1-53ae006853b5"}],"doi":"10.1080/13548506.2020.1859562"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

The research covered the area of the Polish\r\nCarpathians within voivodships of Małopolskie and Podkarpackie, in which there are 201 communes. The\r\noccurrence of landslides in relation to existing and potential residential areas was examined in detail for 14 selected\r\ncommunes. This area due to their geological structure and relief is prone to landslides in inhabited areas. The\r\ncurrent vector databases of landslides (the Landslide Counteracting System-LCS, SOPO Polish acronym), data on\r\nplanning coverage in communes (Ministry of Development and Central Statistical Office of Poland), location of\r\nexisting buildings (Database of Topographic Objects, BDOT, Polish acronym), and range and purpose of local\r\nspatial development plan (LSDP; Geo-System) were used. A high natural hazard of landslides in the 14 analysed\r\ncommunes in the Polish Carpathians (1–23% of the communes area) was demonstrated, as well as faulty spatial\r\nplanning related to the designation of land for development in local plans (up to 11% on landslides).

Here, we studied the DC and low-frequency noise characteristics of a randomly oriented network of carbon nanotubes under NO2 gas atmosphere at two different wavelengths of the UV light-emitting\\ndiodes. The UV irradiation allowed to sense lower concentrations of NO2 (at least 1 ppm) compared to dark conditions. Our experimental studies confirmed that the flicker noise of resistance fluctuations under UV irradiation significantly enhanced the sensing characteristics of nanotube networks at low concentrations. We observed a dominating 1/f-like noise component below 1 kHz. The sensitivity of nanotube networks was higher for shorter wavelength, whereas drift in the resistance was smaller for longer wavelength. The measurements\\nunder the NO2 gas atmosphere revealed a remarkable reduction in DC resistance drift of the nanotube network between consecutive cycles of gas sensing. This phenomenon was explained via absorption-desorption of NO2 gas molecules on nanotubes surface. Since small concentrations of NO2 pose a threat to the ecosystem, these results\\nmight play a significant role in the development of sensitive nanotubes-based photo-activated gas sensors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056965788","journalIssue":{"objectId":"652ebd7940970777573881eb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"352","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"2b715e2c-9f39-4607-8c06-3711725b8d0a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"352","pagesFromTo":"131069","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"608bb99c9543c73526c48ca7","name":"Dmitry","lastName":"Lyubchenko","uuid":"5C2CB96E122B33B90C2A09B37CBE6897BF1716EC6B28C08C66C6A9BCA75CE888383EC0998CD55550669A79616DA7A7B2C19A81DCED18E13655A6AC3B08DE3B35","orcidId":"0000-0003-1443-403X","documentHash":"1f554b1e-5662-4715-a64d-849cbbdbd0d9"},{"objectId":"602f4fbc9543c7410626f320","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Drozdowska","uuid":"9003A9524EE76A711EB1B84CB7775E12AF588CBDAAC141E5BCC4BA5DD0688BC2E5484BAEE94690C0E8640D79DC7CAE7319F76A367E0680A12BE788A777274356","orcidId":"0000-0003-0056-0967","documentHash":"b2cd0dc5-2da0-4785-be4f-7167fb41b71c"},{"objectId":"5fc4a969085dcb1e6ae0b88e","name":"Sergei","lastName":"Rumiantcev","uuid":"F8F3508F02F1313E53D2F826E8DF11E18D8C0B2A513F76E9649D9C38CD7D52A20C2B54B63379F6001FCCB94CA797E008ABDA5243DA0569F4DF3F95FFA1B35A23","orcidId":"0000-0002-8308-4187","documentHash":"5b6ff4b3-08d9-42bf-9247-bf82a8284926"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d7e","name":"Adil","lastName":"Rehman","uuid":"8E31971EB50A90E4ABF9BDA1D547C256352AFE75EBE00704B561990B438958FFE3FC7E912150F0260A2794C3B1361580B860265F82316470928E969C4DC4B03C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4330-5846","documentHash":"2801d548-7381-460f-9edd-6dc8b4e98eff"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bea45","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Cywiński","uuid":"5A3E35D6581F0764F21F7B16B792C20B93382572A31937BB324D60316BE5562AB082D2F6242A49BED876D8C0816B4AFD9FD122AEADB3C2A269DC68DD906BCEB0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3616-8756","documentHash":"18c0cdf1-c8b0-4eb5-9e2c-202de5aec80a"},{"objectId":"5e7093ee878c28a0473b3843","name":"Krystian","lastName":"Pavłov","uuid":"B79D9AB840B02CA8F45DA6B1CF9C6394CD45BC3A9069D323C7731D8D4B57FA9E33F10B24FAB75BF8C9159379AD2BD32E77CCDB594A97915E3AA68EBD1E04FBEC","orcidId":"0000-0002-0328-4884","documentHash":"0fc25295-5d42-4cf8-bf7a-65166ba159fe"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473ace92","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":"04F076713D8DB0E5EDFC5D5AB8FD8480D2FC82160BBBBF1C49CCA9C9B465206CA42352427D492D3D90CCA24EB772A3FADE63841C1E34F1B4A50517EA27763687","orcidId":"0000-0001-6616-2932","documentHash":"58a79c6a-3bc5-4471-acef-9f2ba04e6dd7"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473945d6","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Smulko","uuid":"4CB0DB7EF7D09BD3913B7EE063742EF8A9B68DFA3BE1A80D39561A2FAF9BCE329CD6E47A8C614279581BE3454AF6CAE0763EF3CC99A9951B96200978E8AB66A5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1459-4199","documentHash":"c4abe87e-7457-43c0-99c4-ee9e451b9181"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.snb.2021.131069"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6203b0492467f03b338010b4","doi":null,"title":"Self-Management,

While the interpersonal functions of epistemic adverbs have been discussed extensively, their textual functions have received less attention, and have mostly been reported for high confidence adverbs, such as indeed. This study attempts to explore the potential of low confidence adverbs to perform textual functions. It focuses on perhaps – one of the most frequent epistemic adverbs in English. Using Halliday’s typology of expansion markers, it examines the occurrences of perhaps in a sample of the British National Corpus. Its findings indicate that while the uses of perhaps as a connective marker are considerably less frequent than its uses as an epistemic adverbial, there are several textual functions which it performs with some regularity. They include its use as a marker of apposition (exemplification), concession, clarification (corrective uses/reformulation), and, less often, alternation. Additionally, it performs opening and closing functions in the rhetorical domain of discourse. The connective functions of perhaps seem to be related to its ability to signal alternatives, which it shares with other low confidence adverbs, which is why similar connective functions can be expected from the other adverbs in this category."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056974507","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"268","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384121001637","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473930da","name":"Agata","lastName":"Rozumko","uuid":"F35A9939D53BE45AA44ECE5B04FD60818E3E8D960381AB8045EEDE21944FC1C0F4AA3871D9863DAF202FE40A8549DBE0DF05FCA09CE344F9D09E7F44CD5ADEA6","orcidId":"0000-0001-7718-3253","documentHash":"8a300399-0917-48b7-b27f-3cae0ffedbfb"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.lingua.2021.103191"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nerve roots","Radiculopathy","Uniaxial stretching tests"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61acf76a2467f032cc3eb287","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-86297-8","title":"Biomechanics in Medicine, Sport and Biology","year":2022,"volume":"328","isbn":"978-3-030-86296-1","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-86297-8","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"aff004b7-215d-4a2a-a19f-6bbc0e592644","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390847"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Characteristics of Nerve Roots Mechanical Properties Exposed to Uniaxial Stretching Tests","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"619e24892467f057769ffbe7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709224878c28a047390847","662a3ec040970762633a637f","662a3ec040970762633a6380","662a3ec040970762633a6381","662a3ec040970762633a6382"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents the problem of the mechanical response of nerve roots under stretching conditions. Research into the functioning of the nervous system shows a relation between deformation, blood flow characteristics, and nerve root impulse transmission. These studies show that vascular hypofusion of peripheral nerves occurs at a deformation of 15%. It is also known that impulse conduction disturbances occur at 6% strains. This calculation shows that one of the causes of diseases of the nervous system may be excessive deformation of its structures. One such disease is radiculopathy. Understanding the mechanical response of tissues exposed to damaging conditions requires computations from complex constitutive models that cannot be solved analytically. Therefore, the properties of the tissue material are investigated using numerical approximation methods. For this purpose, it is necessary to experimentally study the properties of the material that allow to determine the parameters of the numerical models used. The aim of the research was to determine the material properties of nerve roots. The analysis was carried out in order to obtain data that would simulate the conditions of the development of nerve root diseases. Modelling was performed using the Finite Element Method (FEM). Mechanical properties were determined on the basis of uniaxial stretching of the nerve roots of the rabbit’s lumbar spine on a testing machine. The tests showed that the rabbit’s nerve root strength is 0.9 ± 0.53 MPa, the relative deformation is 12.73 ± 4.03%, and the Young’s modulus is 2.53 ± 1.00 MPa. The results show the range of strength and stiffness values for various species of animals and humans. The conducted research has shown that the sample preparation procedure has an important influence on the obtained values."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056974586","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"123-131","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86297-8_11","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3ec040970762633a6382","name":"Romuald","lastName":"Będziński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af78d623-b54b-4e52-af3f-3b4248e7645b"},{"objectId":"662a3ec040970762633a6381","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Klekiel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd8b437c-1803-4d3d-bb68-e035c1dd506a"},{"objectId":"662a3ec040970762633a6380","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Mackiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90787d09-2420-4681-bde1-3cabfecc68f4"},{"objectId":"662a3ec040970762633a637f","name":"Monika","lastName":"Palmerska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e43659f-3173-4a5d-ae67-0b2255a45ce9"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390847","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Noszczyk-Nowak","uuid":"6DC54712F4B79078C7952DA1EF0CBC6AB8AEE4F87B35320F4BF6066244941C529D2C51CFAC80CFC451848B925BC7844C1B9851507D380358004C5DFF3ED7B5D0","orcidId":"0000-0001-7899-3936","documentHash":"8f32422c-30ee-4d46-aaa8-08771f8764af"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-86297-8_11"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Scatter correction","Local features","Random forest","Authentication","Honeybush"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e222","uid":"bqUMsPRTnkdr3xb8gKTDKbg","uuid":"61f7b6ee-2f6b-4841-b62c-d6ff496bd8bf","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Instytut Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602b7fc89543c7410626dddc","5e7092e6878c28a04739ee9d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Class-modelling of overlapping classes.

It is protected as Geographical Indication (GI) since it is produced from a number of Cyclopia species that are endemic to South Africa. Most commonly used for honeybush tea production are C. intermedia, C. subternata and C. genistoides, differing slightly, but distinctly in flavour. Demand for species-specific honeybush tea instead of mixtures have increased, meriting a strategy for authentication of C. intermedia, C. subternata and C. genistoides. Samples of these three species were analysed, using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the near-infrared spectral range. The data were pre-processed and used for class-modelling, a general approach well suited for authentication purposes. Unfortunately, since the HSI data of Cyclopia species studied are very similar, the classification results obtained with individual class-models are unsatisfactory, e.g., class-models constructed for C. genistoides and C. subternata yielded correct classification rate (CCR) values of 76.4 and 83.1%, respectively. On the other hand, discriminant modelling, which is another type of classification technique, led to good classification outcomes (CCR 98.9%). However, the classical discriminant model cannot be applied for authentication purposes since it always assigns a new sample to one of the classes studied, even if in reality, it belongs to none of them. Counterfeits or non-representative samples would be incorrectly assigned by the discriminant model to one of the authentic classes. Therefore, in this study, a two-step authentication of overlapping classes is proposed, which combines the advantages of class-modelling and discriminant methods. When applied to the authentication of Cyclopia species studied, the two-step approach yielded a CCR of 97.4%, which is a significant improvement compared to results obtained with the individual class-models. The proposed approach is general and can be applied when classes studied are very similar, and individual class-models lead to unsatisfactory results."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056980781","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1191","pagesFromTo":"339284-1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267021011107","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"619f31542467f07d9861b213","name":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Joubert","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9717-9769","documentHash":"b1e0196d-8be7-4fea-8230-e0c01131799e"},{"objectId":"619f31542467f07d9861b212","name":"Janine","lastName":"Colling","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4680-711X","documentHash":"b364861d-870a-4200-ac24-8967a776205c"},{"objectId":"619f31542467f07d9861b211","name":"Hèlené","lastName":"van

paper refers to micromagnetic simulations of magnetization processes of fractal-like core–shell nanoparticles. The objects were generated using the 3D diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) algorithm for obtaining fractals with two kinds of magnetic phases – magnetically soft core and magnetically hard shell. The simulations were carried out using the cluster Monte Carlo algorithm designed for spin continuous and multiphase magnetic systems. The presented research includes different degrees of branch development, different strengths of the exchange coupling between the phases, as well as different soft phase contents. As was shown, the influence of microstructure on the coercivity mechanism is a complex phenomenon. The core–shell coupling and the magnetic properties of the entire system can be controlled by fractal development. The spring-exchange mechanism and high surface development of the fractals makes it possible to obtain a value of the |BH|max parameter higher than 300 kJ/m3. For K = 5 × 10−5 eV and K = 5 × 10−4 eV, it requires about 30% and 7% contribution of the hard magnetic phase, respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056986112","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6019314c2467f018b1baa0a6","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"557a387f-2832-4fe2-b73e-62614e5b6972"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"547","pagesFromTo":"168800","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0304885321010209?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"619f824c2467f07d9872e50c","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Ziółkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e2ea74ee-84df-4e6d-ac80-94ce3f4379dd"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f0d0","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Chrobak","uuid":"9EA6D3CF708C61F324C7B64525B1E64E1C29932E748CEB24C8EF44548EF859D870AFA47005E638592AA9006C31E394F5DE1FE30BBC2D0EECF7DDB061279AAF02","orcidId":"0000-0003-1766-1350","documentHash":"b2cb9453-579b-4abe-96b7-5b462bec9ab2"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f0bf","name":"Artur","lastName":"Chrobak","uuid":"1369C460F9763DB7D4BCF02B47B89492DF6AF40909A69FD04EF44A9F5FA8E2EFB02B4FAAC433E06A5409FE967265E1EDD21190569DDC804BCC52C96AC9D16754","orcidId":"0000-0002-6482-3319","documentHash":"8e942fb5-ceee-4fe8-9235-9e40cc8331ad"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jmmm.2021.168800"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["transformative learning","personal transformation","experiential education"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc81","uid":"bjwG-H5KkyMtacXPwfRFCTQ","uuid":"6df72f86-fe9b-4e01-9121-db36db218bd8","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc81","parentUuid":"6df72f86-fe9b-4e01-9121-db36db218bd8","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc81","rootUuid":"6df72f86-fe9b-4e01-9121-db36db218bd8","name":"Uniwersytet Dolnośląski DSW we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092de878c28a04739e5c8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"“I felt as if I was becoming myself anew”: Transformative Learning Through Action Research Projects Carried out by Beginner Teachers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547af93","mniswId":"13076","title":"Journal of Transformative Education","doi":null,"issn":"1541-3446","eissn":"1552-7840","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c0cb514c-c2de-402d-b1fd-0b81d9269f5a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a503ac2467f00d7dab79c4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092de878c28a04739e5c8"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article explores action research as a tool for promoting transformative learning of prospective teachers. Drawing on two B.A. or M.A. projects carried out at a university in Poland in which teacher-students used action research and the educational ethnography design to examine themselves as teachers and their practice, the article demonstrates the potential of such an approach for the transformation of students’ meaning perspectives and, eventually, of their personal and professional identities. The transformation the teacher-students experienced entailed their emancipation from the teaching models imposed on them in their institutions and the development of their personal teaching theories. This was followed by their transition to deliberate action, increased sense of agency, and readiness to assume responsibility for wider social change, consequently bridging the theory-practice divide. The author argues that despite the challenges of action research in the university context, its transformative potential makes it a valuable component of teacher education."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056986693","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"62-79","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/15413446211049467","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e5c8","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Gawlicz","uuid":"8471822E2E338A32C4071F746A25EA7728678D5DD33C3678220B4835E44EBFF538D1B6AAB56F133A5D2E607433A34C3344E3E57FFBE24161A3FC31A0C9713CA1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1668-5393","documentHash":"8331fb65-8287-448f-9236-0e4e896ebd4f"}],"doi":"10.1177/15413446211049467"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Soil erosion","Soil","Concentrated flow erosion","Google earth","Earth observations"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918e878c28a04737e44c","uid":"bOsTJEvmlvq1TPV2NgBPXuw","uuid":"75fdfd10-8c3b-4407-8102-72c611142d0e","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Nauk o Ziemi i Gospodarki Przestrzennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebed7eb752340254fc40d73"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Monitoring gully erosion in the European Union: A novel approach based on the Land Use/Cover Area frame survey (LUCAS)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c5f0","mniswId":"9561","title":"International Soil and Water Conservation Research","doi":null,"issn":"2095-6339","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"70ec8ac1-9368-484e-96e9-8901394b6eef"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-10-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a51c6a2467f0352ae0e940","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7a","5ebed7eb752340254fc40d73","61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7c","61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7d","61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7e","5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f21","61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7f","61a51c722467f0352ae0eb80"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The European Commission's Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection (COM(2012)46) identified soil erosion as an important threat to European Union's (EU) soil resources. Gully erosion is an important but hitherto poorly understood component of this threat. Here we present the results of an unprecedented attempt to monitor the occurrence of gully erosion across the EU and UK. We integrate a soil erosion module into the 2018 LUCAS Topsoil Survey, which was conducted to monitor the soil health status across the EU and to support actions to prevent soil degradation. We discuss and explore opportunities to further improve this method. The 2018 LUCAS Topsoil Survey consisted of soil sampling (0e20 cm depth) and erosion\nobservations conducted in ca. 10% (n ¼ 24,759) of the 238,077 Land Use/Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS) 2018 in-field survey sites. Gully erosion channels were detected for ca. 1% (211 sites) of the visited LUCAS Topsoil sites. Commission (false positives, 2.5%) and omission errors (false negatives, 5.6%) were found to be low and at a level that could not compromise the representativeness of the gully erosion survey. Overall, the findings indicate that the tested 2018 LUCAS Topsoil in-field gully erosion monitoring system is effective for detecting the incidence of gully erosion. The morphogenesis of the mapped gullies suggests that the approach is an effective tool to map permanent gullies, whereas it appears less effective to detect short-lived forms like ephemeral gullies. Spatial patterns emerging from the LUCAS Topsoil field observations provide new insights on typical gully formation sites across the EU and UK. This can help to design further targeted research activities. An extension of this approach to all LUCAS sites of 2022 would significantly enhance our understanding of the geographical distribution of gully erosion processes across the EU. Repeated every three years, LUCAS soil erosion surveys would contribute to assess the state of gully erosion in the EU over time. It will also enable monitoring and eventually predicting the dynamics of gully erosion. Data collected were part of the publicly available\nGully Erosion LUCAS visual assessment (GE-LUCAS v1.0) inventory."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056989124","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"17-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61a51c722467f0352ae0eb80","name":"Panos","lastName":"Panagos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57537162-ad84-4795-b958-aa2409d0032d"},{"objectId":"61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7f","name":"Simone","lastName":"Scarpa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2020526-4bc2-4016-bb6c-29eb8958a8ba"},{"objectId":"61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7e","name":"Javier","lastName":"Hervas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3491ddba-7830-4978-bff1-df423b6bcf16"},{"objectId":"61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7d","name":"Cristiano","lastName":"Ballabio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1370ca14-cedc-417f-a991-e5272e86598d"},{"objectId":"61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7c","name":"Matthias","lastName":"Vanmaercke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73b69893-e04d-4a3e-8735-489d45443a4b"},{"objectId":"61a51c722467f0352ae0eb7a","name":"Pasquale","lastName":"Borrelli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"21394c9f-7f77-423c-971a-d1db2d44669b"},{"objectId":"5ebed7eb752340254fc40d73","name":"Jean","lastName":"Poesen","uuid":"D29B7A1EFC0A991B826FDD2646418935A73E1BDE11906E166850F8F3F1F4FC63467F00EC2A583721567180FC2DADCB5AAE2BA63502DB51AB5D6C1BDABD6657B9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6218-8967","documentHash":"f4ff93c0-be91-4abb-9708-a2e3a90838ff"},{"objectId":"5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f21","name":"Michael","lastName":"Maerker","uuid":"E6CC536CB1B13BBD20EDAB088773DFD4903CE4FFF127B80F185D5442A1ABC1560541BE1FC58B5A21FABF0DF9A20A7194495F01046DB8CEDEF758E347A52C42EF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"efe944e2-8719-4deb-a4e5-80d8ed5efc54"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.iswcr.2021.09.002"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet

paper focuses on the short stories by the Guatemalan author Eduardo Halfon, a third-generation Holocaust writer, which are analyzed as a particular case of “world literature” as defined by David

Halfon’s travel writings to Poland are thus interpreted according to the host (Polish) culture’s values and needs. First, the study concentrates on how Halfon’s travel accounts to Warsaw question and interact with the changing historical narratives about the Poles as “implicated subjects”, witnesses and accomplices in the Shoah. Secondly, the analysis deals with the Halfon’s narrative experiences in the provincial city of Lodz, his grandfather’s birthplace, where the crystalized discourses about the past are altered by inverting roles of victims and perpetrators and introducing other possible interpretative approaches (based on cultural implication of emotions and theories of the

increasing number of studies have demonstrated cognitive impairment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The literature indicates many factors play an important role in this clinical problem, such as the severity of depressive symptoms and the treatment used. The aim of this study was to systematically review studies comparing cognitive functioning between healthy participants and RA patients and to determine both the severity and potential moderators of cognitive impairment.\n\nMethods\nFor this purpose, 16 studies that fulfilled all selection criteria were carefully selected. Altogether, 921 patients with RA (812 women and 109 men) and 700 controls participated in these studies. Due to the inability to perform a network meta-analysis, it was decided to determine the effect sizes for studies which used the same measurement methods.\n\nResults\nThe analysis demonstrated greater impairment of cognitive functioning in patients with RA than in healthy controls, with effect sizes ranging from small to large, depending on the assessment method used in the study.\n\nConclusions\nThe study pinpoints potential biases, lack of replication, and inconsistencies in reporting data as possible confounding factors and suggests further recommendations for assessment methods, research directions and clinical implications.\n\nClinical trial registration\nNot applicable."}],"lastRefresh":"1747056998441","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61a5d6ef2467f0269e76b777","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"89","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"76ebadb1-a929-41f6-bd7d-f34f20403abd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"89","pagesFromTo":"Numer artykułu: 105298","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1297319X21001718","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6a0f","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wytrychiewicz","uuid":"314D56D9A4E8917B19804152DC377BB94BEF1FA8DDCA150D2D3A0BECCAE864DD9F7D94663BC96BD4115AD840F7EC716423738939D05EE23FB6EDD22B8CA594CA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8236-4363","documentHash":"cabc6da8-d1b8-42c8-a111-068ea6f69ef9"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a7937","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Pisula","uuid":"28A4A128A8E4CF334814601F3F0AF4B6EC8E1EA6187899820D9E7C42CDC1FB558F82E74C575628D3EA05CF43A6C2663E5CF774C19204FDBF23F994FBA4779F32","orcidId":"0000-0002-7458-5043","documentHash":"b93bed22-1e05-43e8-bbaa-52b78dcb64eb"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a1af","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Pankowski","uuid":"98F68DFEAD531946F5831B96FA2D181B774B2CBA3899766269265F6DDE4A5D0084FD8F1E36E75EE48DAEB841FFB6B7A78AF024F97B02E6998BE2F3D5F2CD234B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7667-5803","documentHash":"0ca3176d-6f37-4e86-b37a-989e3180c024"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395ef2","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"0974B7870C5620B0E72EF5C8C88DD355BDA81D2DFFF9F3559D5380FFC4D717C3E348851DDC9D44316B6B5461A957ACB8282DD52DEFD3E8B1FCE720E27175FBDC","orcidId":"0000-0003-0838-9754","documentHash":"604bb29e-1cc7-4691-8e50-0c00804ef2ad"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jbspin.2021.105298"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62a1028b4097070cd36b6acd","doi":"10.1016/bs.mie.2022.03.047","title":"Methods in Enzymology.

Global monitoring must rely on methods available and comparable across nations to quantify AR occurrence and identify sources and reservoirs, as well as paths of AR dissemination. Numerous analytical tools that are gaining relevance in microbiology, have the potential to be applied to AR research. This review summarizes the state of the art of AR monitoring methods, considering distinct needs, objectives and available resources. Based on the overview of distinct approaches that are used or can be adapted to monitor AR, it is discussed the potential to establish reliable and useful monitoring schemes that can be implemented in distinct contexts. This discussion places the environmental monitoring within the One-Health approach, where two types of risk, dissemination across distinct environmental compartments, and transmission to humans, must be considered. The plethora of methodological approaches to monitor AR and the variable features of the monitored sites challenge the capacity of the scientific community and policy makers to reach a common understanding. However, the dialogue between different methods and the production of action-oriented data is a priority. The review aims to warm up this discussion."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057004342","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"424","pagesFromTo":"127407","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.127407","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"619902392467f034b482d82e","name":"Celia

nanotubes (HNT) and montmorillonite (Mt) were modified by a novel, dicarboxylic fatty acid substituted amido-imidazolium chloride. It was found that the modification process of the clays by the imidazolium compound improved their dispersion in the polymer matrix, while HNT were a more beneficial filler of PP than Mt. PP/imidazolium modified HNT composites (PP/HNT-M) showed significant increase in thermo-oxidative stability, flexibility, and toughness, combined with a slight reduction in stiffness, as well as a lack of changes in crystallinity and strength, compared with neat PP. These effects were not observed for PP/Mt composites. The formation of strong interactions between the imidazolium compound and tubes' surfaces was supposed to be responsible for the more advantageous properties of PP/HNT-M composites."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057010011","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"43","pagesFromTo":"987-997","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pc.26428","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6639fb7e4097076263a16644","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kosno","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a39310b-c671-4edd-858c-99e771c0fde9"},{"objectId":"6639fb7e4097076263a16643","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Kudła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88b65e36-d676-460b-b33e-457db3861007"},{"objectId":"6639fb7e4097076263a16641","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Piechota","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ccd54e6-1a60-4e25-840e-2c7b7c3c3b35"},{"objectId":"5e709339878c28a0473a5331","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Groch","uuid":"DBBBC9B16D200C88B1A2313DDEEA889BA2D1F89398ABA78685EE40D86BB88B20567D2E094AF2603238A0B155A245E3A8DD65E33179C287533276A84CB51C3E2A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4422-0692","documentHash":"633aa951-5e17-42ff-b4f7-7f5bc6b91738"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dca1","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Bączek","uuid":"9E3483443D26DF3FC3C47BEF04B16127DD14063D01A70E11A62C365D4F3A2F9CB14DF1FF5A580B058D6387761927C90C6242FEE868BCF3D4E79BF708FB6CAC23","orcidId":"0000-0002-6079-2973","documentHash":"a953c5bd-de69-4b8b-b2ec-09bdbfafd693"},{"objectId":"5e7091f5878c28a04738dbc9","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Czaja","uuid":"E5A9394195ABFAD708B6561325D1BC00B6B0488BEA76F411FFFFEEB68F876E01551326CBB16FF72A9E26BAED3741DE3A895EB7C5E767042C8D2D8B0808714FA0","orcidId":"0000-0002-0953-5330","documentHash":"d43e0f7d-8767-4e3d-88a1-1151fc5f190f"}],"doi":"10.1002/pc.26428"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61a642372467f0269e92d9be","doi":null,"title":"Terraforming Mars","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9781119761969","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://www.scrivenerpublishing.com/cart/title.php?id=637","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"75baac94-f755-46a7-afb7-e5d941df5793","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb85e","mniswId":"38400","name":"John Wiley & Sons","documentHash":"c6209f49-a4d0-4398-af19-7dffcc4e488c"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709413878c28a0473b5d3d"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Ethical, Political and Legal Challenges Relating to Colonizing and Terraforming Mars","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61a642802467f0269e92e745","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709413878c28a0473b5d3d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The idea of Mars colonization and terraforming includes many ethical, political and legal issues.

Thorn), conducted in 2017–2018 by an interdisciplinary\r\nresearch team. Noninvasive research, including aerial, surface and geophysical\r\nprospection and geological soil coring, was preceded by archival and library queries\r\nand analysis of historical written and cartographic sources as well as contemporary\r\nremote-sensing digital images. These all pointed clearly to an area to the west of\r\nToruń, north of the entrance to the Wood Port on the Vistula. A systematic aerial\r\nsurvey led to the discovery of an extensive anthropogenic structure in this area. Magnetic\r\ngradiometry survey revealed anomalies typical of human activity that were\r\ninterpreted as, among other things, the remains of moats and buildings indicating the\r\narea of the town's first location. Their physical character was confirmed through geological\r\ntests. Moreover, the existence of an embankment surrounding the town is\r\nsuggested by the traces of an alluvial fan formed within the fortifications by flooding.\r\nThe authors point out the limitation of the possibility to identify such sites by field\r\nwalking-method within the methodology of the Polish Archaeological Record. The\r\nacquired results provide strong grounds for a continuation in the form of further\r\ninterdisciplinary archaeological research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057017554","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"275-292","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/arp.1851","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"660be5654097076263dc737c","name":"Romualda","lastName":"Uziembło","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d04e325-78c1-4414-b5d2-73d70a28031a"},{"objectId":"660be5654097076263dc737b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wroniecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d5dfd1f-5ad1-4506-abf7-bcb11f26f019"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bd81","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Molewski","uuid":"65A4499AC33D8F9131D329BD2708D0C3924E7894C201DDAA4AE334E4CE55DA564F5F87C4F0EC484ED6D4B5CCBCE3575469FAFC256EF46EA6562576C0E223FECE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7375-815X","documentHash":"af79b690-1d04-4a9c-9d94-22e194f1bd26"}],"doi":"10.1002/arp.1851"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1NzAxNzU1NA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
