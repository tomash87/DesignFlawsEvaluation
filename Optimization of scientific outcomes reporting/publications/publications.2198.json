The  ability  to  correctly  understand  and  use  financial services  is  already  an integral part of the knowledge of an adult. Because of this, measuring the level of financial literacy plays an important social role.The aim of this article is to analyze market behavior and consumer knowledge on the financial market in the light of scientific achievements and own research. The authors examine the actual level of financial knowledge of Polish consumers and analyze the mistakes made by consumers.Design/methodology/approach–In  the  article,  the  authors  reviewed  the  literature  and  the most  important  studies  on  financial  knowledge  and  consumer  behavior  in  the  financial  market  in Poland and  Ukraine–in  the  context  of  the  pan-European  OECD/INFE  study.  Then,  the  authors presented  their  own  study  of  Polish  consumers.  The  results  of  the  survey  conducted  on   a representative  group  of  consumers  were  subjected  to  statistical  analysis  to  detect  relationships  and correlations.  Pearson's  χ2  non-parametric  test  was  used  to  examine  the  relationship  between  two variables  measured  on  a  qualitative  scale.  The  strength  of  the  relationship  is  calculated  based  on Cramer's V coefficient. The study conducted by the authors allowed them to formulate conclusions. Findings–Hypotheses were formulated regarding consumer behavior on the financial market. They were examined and confirmed by the results of the study. Consumers tend to overestimate their own  financial  competence  and  knowledge  in  this  area.  They  also  remain  uncritical  towards  their mistakes. They also succumb to behavioral cognitive errors. As a result, decisions and choices made on the financial market are not always rational.Practical  implications–The  results  of  these  studies  are  interesting  for  people  and  bodies responsible  for  consumer  protection  on  the financial  market.  The  awareness  of  the  low–actual–level of knowledge and the tendency to make cognitive errors put in a new light the foundations of the  policy  in  the  field  of  institutional  consumer  protection  (the  postulate  of  increasing  the  level  of protection) and the assessment of the economic education system (it is insufficient)Originality/value–This  article  presents  new  and  unique  results  of  a  survey  of  a  representa-tive group of consumers. The survey was one of the first–on a European scale–toaim not only to collect  consumers' declarations  regarding  their  financial  knowledge,  but  also  to  critically  verify  the answers obtained."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635389","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://science.lpnu.ua/semi/all-volumes-and-issues/volume-8-number-2-2024/behavior-polish-consumers-financial-market-light","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67b2f0e4fdbe8362a55dda3f","name":"Oleksiy","lastName":"Druhov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"530c8a48-fe55-40fb-a455-03e54b5ff922"},{"objectId":"5e7093ac878c28a0473aed92","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Gębski","uuid":"26D215C99C7DD6B0C6F8F3EB662BC04ABDBB6456376F8E5C461781DABD590BF550FD388103C9DD1F55B32779DDED1399639C448E11A49A9142459CD362C45264","orcidId":"0000-0002-5370-3987","documentHash":"0a037620-e5ee-4de7-abc5-19587106831f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["environmental waters","adsorptive stripping voltammetry","chromium determination","surface active substances"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a008a","5e7092f5878c28a0473a0091"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of Temperature on the Removal of Interferences in the Voltammetric Procedure for the Determination of Cr(VI)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67c6e23dfdbe830b4ec3dc23","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a0091","5e7092f5878c28a0473a008a"]},"issue":"13","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>The aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of temperature on the removal efficiency of surfactant-induced interferences.

and green preparation of efficient sorbents is critical to the removal of organic contaminants during water treatment. In this study, the co-pyrolysis of macroalgae and oyster shell was designed to synthesize nitrogen-doped porous biochars for sorption removal of atrazine from water. Oyster shell played a significant role in opening pores in macroalgae-derived biochars, resulting in the surface area of the macroalgae (Enteromorpha prolifera and Ulva lactuca) and oyster shell co-pyrolyzed carbonaceous as high as 1501.80 m2 g−1 and 1067.18 m2 g−1, the pore volume reached 1.04 cm3 g−1 and 0.93 cm3 g−1, and O/C decreased to 0.09 and 0.08, respectively. The sorption capacity of atrazine to nitrogen-doped porous biochars (the Enteromorpha prolifera, Ulva lactuca and oyster shell co-pyrolyzed carbonaceous) reached 312.06 mg g−1 and 340.52 mg g−1. Pore-filling, hydrogen bonding, π-π or p-π stacking and electrostatic interaction dominated the multilayer sorption process. Moreover, the nitrogen-doped porous biochars showed great performance in cyclic reusability, and the Enteromorpha prolifera, Ulva lactuca and oyster shell co-pyrolyzed carbonaceous sorption capacity still reached 246.13 mg g−1 and 255.97 mg g−1, respectively. Thus, this study suggested that it is feasible and efficient to remove organic contaminants with the nitrogen-doped porous biochars co-pyrolyzed from macroalgae and oyster shell, providing a potential green resource utilization of aquatic wastes for environmental remediation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635397","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"6","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42773-024-00372-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f38a","name":"Yang","lastName":"Song","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90304c29-c9d7-41da-baee-f00d69a99e17"},{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f389","name":"Xin","lastName":"Jiang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2501458f-9c37-4914-8b8c-8fc82cadbe8a"},{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f388","name":"Yongrong","lastName":"Bian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2945b4ee-7637-4306-a374-1e097d411bb2"},{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f387","name":"Yi","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"91e38b38-98cd-4099-9fa9-b930300315f6"},{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f386","name":"Huihui","lastName":"Cao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"037f044d-6496-444e-aab1-7d717f4ead23"},{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f385","name":"Shi","lastName":"Yao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26b02bf5-5b6a-42d2-b425-f29244b95160"},{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f384","name":"Ronting","lastName":"Ji","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f722fab2-638d-4eb9-8dfe-50ecd53b384b"},{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f383","name":"Cuiying","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d8fd2d3c-b28e-45e3-bb61-0a6e84ba4857"},{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f382","name":"Cheng","lastName":"Hu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49ca937d-5092-442c-83f8-e6ed0ce6e67e"},{"objectId":"67ab44aefdbe8362a573f381","name":"Liying","lastName":"Song","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38f048c9-0fd8-44c6-92c3-7bed06114ea0"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e16","name":"Irmina","lastName":"Ćwieląg-Piasecka","uuid":"43C5D2F1403E89BC1E2A2FFD8D9CF926297DFE440A815E8F4067C9EEAC68B599C1C1F087EAB79F04562BD68267552B7B645D10D67F873CFA52279968B58C0E8E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1439-0295","documentHash":"012e17ed-1e55-40dd-bf24-1f024cf81c58"}],"doi":"10.1007/s42773-024-00372-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a0075","67c6db08fdbe830b4ec333d8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Properties of composite systems based on suspensions of lactobacillus and silica","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"6684f3f4fdbe83043b595ed1","mniswId":null,"title":"Surface","doi":null,"issn":"2617-5975","eissn":"2617-5975","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"0da832ce-6172-4f06-b353-ae4e19bb4001"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67c6db08fdbe830b4ec333d4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c6db08fdbe830b4ec333d5","67c6db08fdbe830b4ec333d6","67c6db08fdbe830b4ec333d7","67c6db08fdbe830b4ec333d8","5e7092f5878c28a0473a0075"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Low-temperature 1H NMR spectroscopy and DSC methods were used to study the hydration process of Lactobacillus, the influence of a weakly polar organic environment on it, and the encapsulation of cells with silica and the possibility of penetration of such an active substance as trifluoroacetic acid (TFAA) into them.  It is shown that the spectral parameters of water in concentrated cell suspensions of Lactobacillus significantly depend on the concentration of the suspensions, which is probably related to the possibility of forming a stable cell gel, which can be encapsulated by silica particles both in the air environment and in the environment without its destruction chloroform with the addition of trifluoroacetic acid.

Their behavioural patterns and beliefs may determine the effectiveness of concerted action towards the energy transition. This is why it is so important to understand the conditions and constraints affecting older people in order to better refine solutions to encourage them to participate in the energy transition. The aim of this work is to identify the challenges faced by older people within the context of the energy transition. The study was based on a systematic literature review using the Scopus database. Based on the conducted review, four main areas of challenges for older people in the context of the energy transition were identified: (i) economic, (ii) health and well-being, (iii) social and community, and (iv) policy and regulatory challenges. The identified variables in each group provide a better understanding of the challenges faced in the energy transition by older people.

Research has shown that reactions of Glc-1PH2 with carbonates produce new complexes with ammonium ions [Glc-1P(NH4)2·3H2O] and mixed complexes: potassium–sodium and ammonium–sodium [Glc-1P(X)1.5Na0.5·4H2O; X = K or NH4]. The crystallization of dicationic complexes has been carried out in aqueous systems containing equimolar amounts of cations (1:1; X–Na). It was found that the first fractions of crystalline complexes always had cations in the ratio 3/2:1/2. The second batch of crystals obtained from the remaining mother liquid consisted either of the previously studied Na+, K+ or NH4+ complexes, or it was a new sodium hydrate—Glc-1PNa2·5·H2O. The isolated ammonium–potassium complex shows an isomorphic cation substitution and a completely unique composition: Glc-1PH(NH4)xK1−x (x = 0.67). The Glc-1P2− ligand has chelating fragments and/or bridging atoms, and complexes containing one type of cation show different modes of coordinating oxygen atoms with cations. However, in the case of the potassium–sodium and ammonium–sodium structures, high structural similarities are observed. The 1D and 2D NMR spectra showed that the conformation of Glc-1P2− is rigid in solution as in the solid state, where only rotations of the phosphate group around the C-O-P bonds are observed.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635408","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"2133","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/9/2133","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6711f3b3fdbe831eab26b913","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Lis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"72b5de52-f264-4565-b006-240db4cd6da0"},{"objectId":"6711f3b3fdbe831eab26b912","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Stępniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34ea7aa2-99ac-41cd-b1d0-aadfcd1b4d87"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa116","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Łastawiecka","uuid":"57CEBE08C44D69BD966BD1C467C0E133E00784C120574E9C8F39F8758937E215805ACEFC0ABD3CE45ABD1F755A1091F33785653C47D1A2DA838F2464DCD4E511","orcidId":"0000-0001-6546-1519","documentHash":"ae865f6c-e302-494e-bdc0-93278d573388"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00b6","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kozioł","uuid":"1C007A06D84A06907403C0C9F5E84F45179C5203DB2D67699819C51BC045C6D3B70006ECF9BE88DF146B6136E47A43CE927D71A9F65FD19E7FF99283DC8A0627","orcidId":"0000-0001-5339-7505","documentHash":"5fdbe4d8-b59e-4466-a6ab-282bf759944f"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules29092133"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["osteoderms","histology","anatomy","Varanus komodoensis","scales","skin","structure"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b51f8","5e709422878c28a0473b6d04","5e7093c2878c28a0473b0565","616cdc2875234017e0554e8d","5e709210878c28a04738f653","5e709210878c28a04738f67f","67ab3e17fdbe8362a57346fd","67ab3e17fdbe8362a57346fe"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Histological Study of Skin Structures From Selected Body Areas in the Varanus komodoensis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788bb","mniswId":"11927","title":"Journal of Morphology","doi":null,"issn":"0362-2525","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2b55e932-3b6d-45cf-baee-203e05c5d5f7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab3e17fdbe8362a57346fc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c2878c28a0473b0565","5e709422878c28a0473b6d04","67ab3e17fdbe8362a57346fd","616cdc2875234017e0554e8d","5e709408878c28a0473b51f8","5e709210878c28a04738f653","67ab3e17fdbe8362a57346fe","5e709210878c28a04738f67f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The skin of the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) is covered by a form of armour formed mainly of scales, which often co-occur with osteoderms. Scales are keratinized, non-mineralized structures in the uppermost layer of the epidermis that are in contact with each other to form a system in which individual scales are isolated from each other by a softer skin fold zone. In the Varanus, the surface of the scales is flat and smooth (thoracic limb, abdomen, and tail areas), domed and smooth (head area) or domed with conical ornamentation (dorsal surface, pelvic limb—dorsal surface areas). In contrast, osteoderms are mineralized structures that are an integral part of the skin, located below the epidermal surface and positioned parallel (head, tail, thoracic limb-dorsal surface, thoracic limb-palmar surface, and tail) or obliquely (pelvic limb-dorsal surface, groin, abdomen) to the surface. Regardless of the body region, osteoderms are structures that are completely anchored in the dermis, and their surface is smooth and devoid of ornamentation. Tangential sections of the osteoderms demonstrate concentric resting lines. Histological sections of the varanid dermis show the presence of collagen bundles, parallel interlacing or crossing bundles of collagen fibers of varying thickness and degree of compactness, accompanied by muscle fibers. In the area of skin close to the osteoderm, loosely arranged bundles of collagen fibers are present, while in the zone distal to the osteoderm, a compact arrangement of these fibers is present. This study documents the morphological diversity and distribution of osteoderms and scales in selected areas of the body of V. komodoensis. Scales are characterized by a high polymorphism related to body region, while osteoderms show a high morphological similarity independent of the area of occurrence."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635409","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"286","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.70021?af=R","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3e17fdbe8362a57346fe","name":"Ludwika","lastName":"Hrabska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ceb42313-12a1-443c-82b3-564850737171"},{"objectId":"67ab3e17fdbe8362a57346fd","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Janeczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be15afd7-47ba-4589-89d1-0735accde44b"},{"objectId":"616cdc2875234017e0554e8d","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Nowotarska","uuid":"BA815F3AA13DE48319C04B4C0355DFDFE56DA633D839391F470362598C45AD6024DBC7EDE52F5408D4E849B1F492208BF74488D1FED9D72E8249461A2E55D338","orcidId":"0000-0001-8512-8174","documentHash":"1903fd49-8101-4049-81dc-86123847a376"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d04","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Tarnowska","uuid":"5EEFD02C341A07501461B798522FA7378828766AC37A02F353053590F140D179562E70A51DFEAA4DE25CDB3330F44684A0A400902376E63D74FAEFA119285F17","orcidId":"0000-0001-6242-5280","documentHash":"af647376-73df-4c54-b6ee-fc3ed789cddf"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b51f8","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Goździewska-Harłajczuk","uuid":"06E4013E77388EE93B0357F35C3830ECE414111C91652095310B72C40865D3412BD10191EBEE33B1E1C84B206B531C74BFD3FB126E829323729746A06B897CA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4412-1966","documentHash":"7bccc158-5abc-4da0-9637-9f87a36978ae"},{"objectId":"5e7093c2878c28a0473b0565","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lipińska","uuid":"7850D7EA723DDA259CE3B92F56F84FE29ED21B183C90BA10D120FFD45C266E2145965DB3FD82E0E1EF2630C95FAD2518913DC8EE0A659DC8094F079C42D49C19","orcidId":"0000-0002-9858-2031","documentHash":"8a0dbc8f-405a-4279-9de9-8506566241de"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f67f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kuropka","uuid":"3FC1875347673055A72C78EDC491C8234C60AA65723287D648FAAF759FFAACB097DBDD8DE9D633E2BF52C39D7B8E26589626F44BBC025CD50FFF247F0B9ED47B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0682-4743","documentHash":"f10c068d-c14d-48ad-93f4-185c5fe9fdbf"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f653","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Klećkowska-Nawrot","uuid":"0A5A4277903B2DD08057F2C7DDB01291CED2905E3B8CEB11F0A18FB79C2686C624D1047DB0A6B6E967800C88C095789E149E618427739B2C5AFFA34ACB447915","orcidId":"0000-0003-1154-8736","documentHash":"6e75be22-58a7-4dcc-be24-aa9a56301252"}],"doi":"10.1002/jmor.70021"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Transport properties","Hydrodynamics","Molecular dynamics simulations","Diffusion","Metabolism"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a657d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Size Sensitivity of Metabolite Diffusion in Macromolecular Crowds","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f50","mniswId":"14735","title":"Nano Letters","doi":null,"issn":"1530-6984","eissn":"1530-6992","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1dfd9743-a5c9-42bf-b989-e81d64a3241c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66fbb7cafdbe837a1e189dc6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a657d","6711f40bfdbe831eab26d2cd","6711f40bfdbe831eab26d2ce","6711f40bfdbe831eab26d2cf","6711f40bfdbe831eab26d2d0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Metabolites play crucial roles in cellular processes, yet their diffusion in the densely packed interiors of cells remains poorly understood, compounded by conflicting reports in existing studies.

Using Ficoll as a crowder, we observe a linear decrease in tracer diffusivity with increasing occupied volume fraction, persisting─somewhat surprisingly─up to volume fractions of 30–40%. While simulations suggest a linear correlation between diffusivity slowdown and particle size, experimental findings hint at a more intricate relationship, possibly influenced by Ficoll’s porosity.

Unfortunately, its dark color was completely unacceptable to consumers and eliminated these products from the market despite their very good health-promoting properties. This study attempted to produce corn snacks enriched with pomace from various flax varieties with the addition of cocoa, which could mitigate the poor perception of their dark color by consumers. The snacks produced with the addition of common flax and cocoa received high scores given by panelists, not diverging from those given to the snacks with golden flax pomace addition. In particular, the addition of cocoa contributed to a significant improvement in the sensory evaluation of the color of the snacks produced with dark pomace addition, while not deteriorating their other assessed parameters, compared to the snacks prepared without cocoa. There were also no differences in the mechanical properties between the snacks with different pomace types added.

However, the nature of avian sperm presents a global issue in ensuring superior frozen semen for artificial insemination. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the impact of using dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and ethylene glycol (EG) as cryoprotectants on post-thawed sperm motility, quality, antioxidant indicators, and fertilizing capacity. Twice a week, fresh semen ejaculates were collected from fifteen adult roosters and immediately evaluated to constitute a pool from clean and qualified samples. The pooled semen was further diluted at a ratio of 1:2 (v/v) with an extender and then subjected to a freezing protocol in a liquid nitrogen vapor after adding a cryoprotectant solution containing 6% of either DMA, DMSO, or EG, respectively. After thawing, characteristics of sperm motion, quality, antioxidants, and fertilizing ability were evaluated and compared to fresh and cooled semen as controls. The results demonstrated that semen cooling negatively affected some parameters of sperm motility, quality, antioxidant biomarkers, and fertility. In comparison to the DMSO and EG groups, employing DMA considerably (P < 0.05) raised the percentages of sperm progressive motility, viability, plasma membrane intactness, and DNA integrity. The DMA group showed a significant increase in the catalase and glutathione reduced antioxidant enzyme activity and a reduction in nitric oxide and lipid peroxidation. After artificial insemination, the DMA and DMSO groups exhibited considerably (P < 0.05) better rates of hatchability and fertility than the EG group. It is concluded that freezing extenders containing 6% DMA is better than DMSO or EG to improve the post thaw semen quality and fertility in chickens."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635420","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"103","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psj.2024.104190","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab499dfdbe8362a57616b3","name":"Farid","lastName":"Nassar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f5f2fad-c0fd-48c7-9838-d89f8a5a45e2"},{"objectId":"67ab499dfdbe8362a57616b2","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Abbas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e9a0ffa-e5aa-4ead-bfa6-ce53c6e8d1d5"},{"objectId":"67ab499dfdbe8362a57616b1","name":"Mona","lastName":"Ghaly","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4fd6a492-e5bf-4bfc-bdf3-11aee35fc628"},{"objectId":"67ab499dfdbe8362a57616b0","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Saad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b847cf45-dca9-47f6-87c1-73d77c8969ea"},{"objectId":"67ab499dfdbe8362a57616af","name":"Farid","lastName":"Stino","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5bc950e3-3a03-400e-8e0c-f01095edcf41"},{"objectId":"67ab499dfdbe8362a57616ae","name":"Gamal","lastName":"Mehaisen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b043b9fa-30d4-4c36-ab40-0d7132eee1a4"},{"objectId":"67ab499dfdbe8362a57616ad","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Elomda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7d71005d-2253-41fe-9926-f369a13eab90"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af769","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Partyka","uuid":"6956953924569AAF5630A4EA554F799A0E8E0BFB5E02CBEF501ACA0F25B08631E4B4E15B8B0D9C87FF63B4D8760B70F0D35468FF2C2B0B854A1F092A7982AC48","orcidId":"0000-0001-9131-3552","documentHash":"f3d3fcea-3ba0-4a60-8701-f65b0e6b5d76"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.psj.2024.104190"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","uid":"bm3qIJZlNw1U92UVKrOsP_w","uuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","parentUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","rootUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Białymstoku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c5","5e709375878c28a0473aa24a","67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c7","67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Quality of life in women diagnosed with breast cancer","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a27d","mniswId":"16165","title":"Pielęgniarstwo Chirurgiczne i Angiologiczne-Surgical and Vascular Nursing","doi":null,"issn":"1897-3116","eissn":"2084-9850","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"958daa24-81b4-438c-a548-eb204a4480ba"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c5","67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c6","5e709375878c28a0473aa24a","67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c7","67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c8"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060635421","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"23-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Quality-of-life-in-women-diagnosed-with-breast-cancer,50,50533,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c8","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Tabaka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"268d0a4e-ad5c-4a30-8e28-364e1781c323"},{"objectId":"67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c7","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Perkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"616bb696-e237-4070-870f-5606997b4e82"},{"objectId":"67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c6","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Perkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2afde9cb-cbb1-4f1c-a856-feabdc39b39b"},{"objectId":"67ab279bfdbe8362a57264c5","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Harasim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"91fef957-7d32-4c8b-a457-ce971416cd02"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa24a","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Lewko","uuid":"4430DD0DB7E7BD142E198D321A393466076159C88B41EFBD9526725BBA39EAC485EC58181BFFA6C5C5457C1176E8993C0C916AF8AC280B04B0DA8F375B2E540B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3074-1320","documentHash":"6e53a09c-d8a6-4298-8357-8ab9e1965c08"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67ab3e39fdbe8362a5734b99","doi":null,"title":"Wprowadzenie do bezpieczeństwa IT.

In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most common muscular dystrophy in adults, MBNLs are sequestered on toxic RNA containing expanded CUG repeats, which leads to disruption of MBNL-regulated processes and disease features of DM1. Herein, we show the significance of MBNLs in regulating microtranscriptome dynamics during the postnatal development of skeletal muscles and in microRNA (miRNA) misregulation observed in mouse models and patients with DM1. We identify multiple miRNAs sensitive to MBNL proteins insufficiency and reveal that many of them were postnatally regulated, which correlates with increases in the activity of these proteins during this process. In adult Mbnl1-knockout mice, miRNA expression exhibited an adult-to-newborn shift. We hypothesize that Mbnl1 deficiency influences miRNA levels through a combination of mechanisms. First, the absence of Mbnl1 protein results in alterations to the levels of pri-miRNAs. Second, MBNLs affect miRNA biogenesis by regulating the alternative splicing of miRNA primary transcripts. We propose that the expression of miR-23b, miR-27b and miR-24-1, produced from the same cluster, depends on the MBNL-sensitive inclusion of alternative exons containing miRNA sequences.

Biorąc pod uwagę zmieniające się pod m.in. wpływem rozwoju technologicznego warunki oraz możliwości organizacji pracy, w artykule skoncentrowano się na pracy zdalnej i hybrydowej oraz na perspektywach ich rozwoju. Kolejnym obszarem analiz były obowiązki pozazawodowe, w tym opiekuńcze, oraz ryzyko powstawania konfliktów pomiędzy nimi a pracą zawodową. Ostatni aspekt dotyczył czasu wolnego i zadowolenia z niego. Zasadniczą część analiz oparto na wynikach badań własnych, przeprowadzonych, metodą CAWI, w grudniu 2021 roku na reprezentatywnej grupie 1067 Polaków. Uzyskane wyniki pozwoliły na realizację celu badawczego oraz sformułowanie wniosków, które wskazują na potrzebę zachowania równowagi w życiu, przy uwzględnieniu stabilności, a jednocześnie elastyczności zatrudnienia, czemu sprzyja wykonywanie pracy w formie zdalnej lub hybrydowej."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635430","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ab2f98fdbe837dc75ce167","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"187","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"d686e762-675c-4690-8b2a-9216e9320532"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"187","pagesFromTo":"6-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://rynekpracy.praca.gov.pl/article/540897/pl","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e2c4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Skórska","uuid":"1D774FC3BED7396A222D4A6749A4C2106E47CEC58E11230F8DB1E92289E29B8AD7E03FB536B07D82594CCDEC93B2D6B326AC9ADDFA7D3D992D6D1FBAF36C65B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-2816-7123","documentHash":"cf2bb9cd-574b-4ad5-86e7-e35f25d8f4e4"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cd878c28a04739ce9a","67ab4711fdbe8362a5756747"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sex-specific association of immunological markers in CS-delivered newborns with pre-pregnancy body mass index and gestational weight gain of mothers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4711fdbe8362a5756746","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cd878c28a04739ce9a","67ab4711fdbe8362a5756747","67ab4711fdbe8362a5756748"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Just as overweight and obesity may impair immunity, excessive body weight-related parameters of women in the pre-conception period and during pregnancy are possible detrimental factors for fetal programming of the immune system in their offspring.

The examined group of this cross-sectional pilot study consisted of 101 pregnant women and their healthy CS-delivered newborn children. The concentration of antibodies in maternal serum (MS) and UCS were determined by ELISA method. PTR was assessed as a ratio of the concentration of antibodies in the UCS and MS. A significantly lower PTR of IgG and their concentration in the UCS were demonstrated in newborns of mothers with an excessive pBMI compared to those with pBMI < 25 and the association was more pronounced in male newborns. The lowest PTR of beneficial IgG and their concentration in the UCS as well as the highest PTR of detrimental Lf-ANCA and their concentration in UCS were observed in newborns born to mothers with co-occurrence of both an excessive pBMI and GWG. It seems that maternal preconception overweight and obesity along with an excessive GWG can be a predictor of unfavorable immune effects in fetuses.

The administration of antibiotics can help mitigate these negative effects. However, inappropriate use can lead to severe complications, such as raising antibiotic resistance. The purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of antibiotic use and disease frequency over four years, based on the size of dairy farms and the type of farm. The study covered a 4-year period and included medium dairy farms (20–50 cows, n = 13), large dairy farms (>250 cows, n = 8), and large beef farms (n = 8). The collected data involved antimicrobial use but also included farm demographics, animal health, disease frequency, and herd management practices. The criteria used to categorise antibiotics into groups A–D were based on the EMA guidelines. The carried-out study showed that the large dairy cattle farms had the highest antibiotic consumption (18.29 mg·PCU−1), due to the high frequency of diseases, and consequently, the treatment of calf (diarrhoea, lung inflammations) and cow diseases (general treatment and mastitis).

WSA provides a set of boundary conditions at 0.1 au necessary to initiate the heliospheric part of EUHFORIA, namely, the domain extending beyond the solar Alfvénic point. To calibrate WSA, we observationally constrain four constants in the WSA semiempirical formula based on PSP observations. We show how the updated (after the calibration) WSA boundary conditions at 0.1 au are compared to PSP observations at similar distances, and we further propagate these conditions in the heliosphere according to EUHFORIA’s magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approach. We assess the predictions at Earth based on the dynamic time-warping technique. Our findings suggest that, for the period of interest, the WSA configurations that resembled optimally the PSP observations close to the Sun were different from the ones needed to provide better predictions at Earth. One reason for this discrepancy can be attributed to the scarcity of fast solar wind velocities recorded by PSP. The calibration of the model was performed based on unexpectedly slow velocities that did not allow us to achieve generally and globally improved solar wind predictions compared to older studies. Other reasons can be attributed to missing physical processes from the heliospheric part of EUHFORIA but also the fact that the currently employed WSA relationship, as coupled to the heliospheric MHD domain, may need a global reformulation beyond that of just updating the four constant factors that were taken into account in this study."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635443","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"971","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad53c6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66cc4e0afdbe832737e6c3f0","name":"Luciano","lastName":"Rodriguez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85420fd1-b2ed-445a-95b7-cc8c5b49c78e"},{"objectId":"66cc4e0afdbe832737e6c3ef","name":"Michael

article presents a legal and comparative reconstruction of the types of employment in public administration in Poland. It shows the features that distinguish the sources and essence of administrative and legal employment relationships from non-administrative-law service relationships and from contractual employment relationships. The aim of the article was to point out legislative inconsistencies in regulating the basis for establishing employment relationships in public administration. This inconsistency was illustrated using the example of changes in the employment of academic teachers in higher education institutions in Poland based on the provisions of the Law on Higher Education and Science, which has been amended a number of times. It has been shown that the employment relationships of academic teachers, despite being formally contractual, are in fact characterized by so many administrative and legal elements that they meet conditions for recognizing them as relationships established on the basis of appointment. The conclusion of the considerations will come down to the formulation of the de lege ferenda postulate for legislative intervention by the amendment in the current regime/ legal sources of employment of academic teachers. It is proposed that the sources of establishing employment relationships for academic teachers be expanded to include sources that ensure a minimum standard of legal security in terms of the stability and predictability of employment required when employing public officials who are academic teacher."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635447","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://zeszytynaukowe-sgsp.pl/article/549345/en#article","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8ebc","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kociołek-Pęksa","uuid":"FB3DAC14122A167AF9FDE63E7665A5A39499A0E34378B44AC94957C18AC2C84E102F94BC3EDA6E84849BE9BCDECDF4F8887C345C2AC967B6A75D69D4570E2DC5","orcidId":"0000-0001-6707-6606","documentHash":"9dc874a8-7ab3-4ecf-93e6-fb561884554a"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0054.9345"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Genotoxicity.","Biocompatibility","Cytotoxicity","Green synthesis","Silver nanoparticles"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a023c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Aqueous dispersions of ‘green’ silver nanoparticles for eco-applications: Synthesis, structure and biosafety","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788ad","mniswId":"11911","title":"Journal of Molecular Liquids","doi":null,"issn":"0167-7322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e2167a97-56be-4ac4-81e7-457a12a26deb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6749be72fdbe83251668fb46","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c6e2f6fdbe830b4ec3e252","67c6e2f6fdbe830b4ec3e253","67c6e2f6fdbe830b4ec3e254","5e7092f7878c28a0473a023c","67c6e2f6fdbe830b4ec3e255","67c6e2f6fdbe830b4ec3e256","67c6e2f6fdbe830b4ec3e257","67c6e2f6fdbe830b4ec3e258"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sustainable agriculture requires the use of intelligent compounds with multifaceted effect on soil and plants. Such conditioners can be hydrogels enriched with nanoparticles, but only those synthesized using ‘green chemistry’ methods. Therefore, the main aim of the study was to synthesize and characterize innovative ‘green’ silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for agricultural applications. AgNPs were created using water or alcohol extracts of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus viminalis Labill) and aloe (Aloë arborescens Mill) as well as tannin to reduce silver ions (Ag+) to zero valent form (Ag0). The synthesis was conducted under autoclave conditions or at room temperature, in the presence of potassium carbonate. The AgNPs characterization was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) method, whereas stability of the AgNPs suspensions under various conditions was estimated using turbidimetry. Biosafety of the formed species was determined based on genotoxicity (comet test) and cytotoxicity (study with crystal violet and MTT) assays. The obtained results confirmed the presence of zero valent silver phase in the nanoparticles and showed that their crystallite size was 14–24 nm, with different degrees of polydispersity depending on the synthesis conditions. Hydrodynamic diameter of AgNPs and their aggregates in the aqueous dispersions varied from 6 nm to 103 nm, and the smallest aggregation degree was noted for the nanoparticles synthesized using tannin. All synthesized nanoparticles were biosafe.

Following this alloying approach of group-IV semiconductors, adding tin (Sn) into the alloy appears as the obvious next step, which leads to additional possibilities for tailoring the material properties. Adding Sn enables effective bandgap and strain engineering and can improve the carrier mobilities, which makes Si1−x−yGeySnx alloys promising candidates for future opto- and nanoelectronics applications. The bottom-up approach for epitaxial growth of Si1−x−yGeySnx, e.g., by chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, allows tuning the material properties in the growth direction only; the realization of local material modifications to generate lateral heterostructures with such a bottom-up approach is extremely elaborate, since it would require the use of lithography, etching, and either selective epitaxy or epitaxy and chemical–mechanical polishing, giving rise to interface issues, non-planar substrates, etc. This article shows the possibility of fabricating Si1−x−yGeySnx alloys by Sn ion beam implantation into Si1−yGey layers followed by millisecond-range flash lamp annealing (FLA). The materials are investigated by Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, micro-Raman spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy. The fabrication approach was adapted to ultra-thin Si1−yGey layers on silicon-on-insulator substrates. The results show the fabrication of single-crystalline Si1−x−yGeySnx with up to 2.3 at. % incorporated Sn without any indication of Sn segregation after recrystallization via FLA.

W pierwszym rozdziale krótko opisano historię pływania od początku aż do ostatnich igrzysk olimpijskich. Ludzkość dzięki umiejętności pływania korzystała z możliwości łowieckich. W okresie antyku cenione były osoby potrafiące pływać. W późniejszym okresie umiejętność przemieszczania się w wodzie wykorzystywana była do walk zbrojnych. W średniowieczu pływanie zostało zupełnie porzucone, jednak okres odrodzenia był powrotem do antyku. Pływanie zaczęło być uprawiane również przez sportowców, co doprowadziło do rywalizacji. Najpierw na akwenach otwartych, a z biegiem czasu na pływalniach krytych. Powszechne pływanie jakie jest znane w dzisiejszych czasach rozpoczęło się w drugiej połowie XIX wieku. To wtedy zaczęły powstawać pływalnie i szkółki pływackie. Aktualnie społeczeństwo chętnie korzysta z akwenów wodnych, buduje się coraz więcej pływalni zamkniętych czy dużych kompleksów, tzw. “aqua parków”. Ważną rolę w celu rozpowszechnienia pływania pełnią programy nauki pływania. W poniższej pracy zostały one podzielone na: programy rządowe i programy wodnego ochotniczego pogotowia ratunkowego. Ważną rolę w kontekście nauki i rozpowszechnienia pływania spełniło wodne ochotnicze pogotowie ratunkowe, które wprowadziło karty pływackie."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635459","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"227-235","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pcs.khmnu.edu.ua/index.php/pcs/article/view/294/286","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab421dfdbe837dc75eb502","name":"Bohdan","lastName":"Ferenchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d11bb15f-97e3-4ef1-9f6b-f817a6c1d069"},{"objectId":"67ab421dfdbe837dc75eb501","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Batulin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd4909b4-0f6a-4da1-86a7-410944774227"},{"objectId":"67ab421dfdbe837dc75eb500","name":"Nataliia","lastName":"Tsyhanovska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d75e4cf1-60ac-4ee9-a5fe-7396d2090858"},{"objectId":"651f712a40e3ff22d348dcb2","name":"Damian","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"69A5802C500D6AFCDFE15B74539E9E15662CA39767C44678DF6795EF394B176BB1064AA4BA160E60A4A52383FF2745FFB459C6F5F487714418C462C30A6D54D8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef3219ee-d46f-4323-918b-2c77f69e1da2"},{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4d3b","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Skalski","uuid":"E098E64C52C907FF7FFF6305D86E7360AC3A5C936BF54560478D8AF2040FD781004BAFB24FDD438F903D2F29D5E30BE36B5113C502BB1D16A1F53A270D6C4BC9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3280-3724","documentHash":"16d42828-7a11-4d6d-9f71-3240a4c0a568"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63a43f7540970710a6dc7e11","doi":null,"title":"Interdyscyplinarne wyzwania nauk o zdrowiu.

However, many factors limit the widespread use of peptides in medicine, and low solubility is among the most common problems that hamper drug development in the early stages of research. Solubility is a crucial, albeit poorly understood, feature that determines peptide behavior. Several different solubility predictors have been proposed, and many strategies and protocols have been reported to dissolve peptides, but none of them is a one-size-fits-all method for solubilization of even the same peptide. In this review, we look for the reasons behind the difficulties in dissolving peptides, analyze the factors influencing peptide aggregation, conduct a critical analysis of solubilization strategies and protocols available in the literature, and give some tips on how to deal with the so-called difficult sequences. We focus on amyloids, which are particularly difficult to dissolve and handle such as amyloid beta (Aβ), insulin, and phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635462","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/tcr.202400053","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3f38fdbe8362a5735d91","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szefczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97d25a4a-aa52-4ab4-a0bd-bf9daf55aee0"},{"objectId":"67ab3f38fdbe8362a5735d90","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Gąsior-Głogowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e455bea-b10a-416f-b9a9-a0607ee74665"},{"objectId":"67ab3f38fdbe8362a5735d8f","name":"Julita","lastName":"Nadwodna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57887b8b-b98b-4b82-8a26-921bb46f634b"},{"objectId":"67ab3f38fdbe8362a5735d8e","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Olek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"528b55f5-1dc3-42e6-bf87-f783ed75f1bd"},{"objectId":"67ab3f38fdbe8362a5735d8d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Stottko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e31463b-2d12-4524-873c-5e6f55f5652e"},{"objectId":"67ab3f38fdbe8362a5735d8c","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Polańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c61abe75-5926-4702-9325-1f2a90e81da8"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b6267","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Szulc","uuid":"B7708E41A614C23F997A9B64A1ECC39B813DBDDB15C1459269F3888295440AA6EB835853251180C5DA7DD2F50A886467DFBA207A27C1555AFDC86C9D2AF8B280","orcidId":"0000-0003-2951-1827","documentHash":"d8fb0c2f-7200-4d0e-ad2b-297a63966200"}],"doi":"10.1002/tcr.202400053"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"66695cc54097074fa1a574ea","doi":null,"title":"Science and industry challenges and opportunities Edited by: prof. dr hab.

study investigates the impact of cellulose-derived polymers, anionic carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), and cationic cellulose (CC) on the colloidal and thermal stability of zeolite Na-X materials. By exploring polymer adsorption onto Na-X surfaces and characterising the resultant materials, using FT-IR, XPS, SEM, PSD, CHN, and zeta potential, the research unveils how CMC and CC modify zeolite properties. This investigation elucidates the potential roles of these polymers in colloidal systems with zeolites, revealing their promise for crafting organic-inorganic materials. Additional insight was also provided by careful examination of the thermal stability (TGA-DSC) of the obtained cellulose/zeolite materials. Furthermore, the study distinguishes the different adsorption mechanisms of CMC and CC, with CMC relying on some weak interactions (H-bonding and van der Waals forces), while CC interacts mainly via electrostatic forces.

Due to the ordered pore system of the SBA-15 silica, this material proved to be a good carrier for both the biologically active nanophase (highly dispersed silver nanoparticles, AgNPs) and the adsorption active phase (chitosan). The antimicrobial susceptibility was determined against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Gram-negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 700603, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853), and yeast Candida albicans ATCC 90028. The zones of microbial growth inhibition correlated with the content of silver nanoparticles deposited in the composites and were the largest for C. albicans (14–21 mm) and S. aureus (12–17 mm). The suitability of the composites for the purification of water and wastewater from anionic pollutants was evaluated based on kinetic and equilibrium adsorption studies for the dye Acid Red 88. The composite with the highest amount of the chitosan component showed the greatest adsorption capacity (am) of 0.57 mmol/g and the most effective kinetics with a rate constant (log k) and half-time (t0.5) of −0.21 and 1.62 min, respectively. Due to their great practical importance, AgNP–chitosan–silica composites can aspire to be classified as functional materials combining the environmental problem with microbiological activity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635477","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/24/13548","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3453","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zienkiewicz-Strzałka","uuid":"BAD7C94BE8346F1128491D961657B49CEC0247CB901A33EF0C572B1EDD5C417AA77ECBB2E5001C305EDA9223834F999C3F511B13DFEB8AD29131943D93D9C1D5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0775-5417","documentHash":"9c86631e-2687-4353-92d1-408b4675d4c5"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ec","name":"Anna","lastName":"Deryło-Marczewska","uuid":"31DD4B3962D924B13870C1856501C9F7087C15D43C70E3B1BA51DA25D46DF02DD44484255BAE0346CD01F503D4D3D126600BC9872600002B92BD3B370B30F34B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0208-1257","documentHash":"c35e33bb-fefb-4874-af00-4ed42430f564"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02eb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Błachnio","uuid":"9E695AD6887C15E10A5BC7B76856E3747B78EC3C83F8AFDE38815EEB6CEC9580FF23DA1D2BF02240DF032CFC8DB1C9D36C4DF0C97BCE5309FB6C63EF9771E0E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-6281-9084","documentHash":"ced6f953-45ba-4712-ba96-3cfb334ed7e8"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff44","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Kutkowska","uuid":"57E495BD1112F0F0300EE235B076F391A995D169067CC444FF049AC7231B93EC9316874941854378CC3B9C5269D6FE9BA3E0545B75112C45FF5501AF64975002","orcidId":"0000-0002-3307-591X","documentHash":"249668f8-227a-446d-a9b0-cb2c03ef446a"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms252413548"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["glucose detection in saliva","additive manufacturing","coplanar waveguide","biosensor","interdigital capacitor","metal-on-glass","microwave sensors","3D printing"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b4c","601cc5309543c7744e88f140"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Additively manufactured microwave sensor for glucose level detection in saliva","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b45","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b46","601cc5309543c7744e88f140","67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b47","67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b48","67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b49","5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b4c","67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b4a"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, a novel realization of an ink-on-glass microwave sensor for biomedical applications is proposed. The Aerosol Jet Printing (AJP) technology is leveraged to implement a compact single-layer coplanar waveguide sensor featuring arc-shaped interdigital fingers that can accommodate a droplet of the Material-Under-Test (MUT). Such geometry provides a high sensitivity to even a very small deviation of MUT`s electrical properties when placed as a superstrate. An application towards the detection of trace amounts of glucose in saliva, which is a biomarker for diabetes, is showcased. The design and fabrication process of an exemplary sensor is discussed in detail. A circular geometry feature is introduced that helps a droplet to lie over the sensitive region due to wettability difference of glass substrate and silver ink. Sensor operating in K-band is developed providing a tradeoff between circuit size and droplet volume. The study is conducted for an artificial saliva requiring roughly a 0.5 µL droplet where changes in mixture content are proportional to relative changes of sensor`s transmission coefficient in a broad frequency range for occupied vs. empty states. The obtained results show that 10 mg of glucose per 100 ml of saliva can be easily distinguished in a frequency range of 20–30 GHz, whereas a monotonical change is visible for frequencies 20–26 GHz, which indicates the applicability of this sensor towards the detection of saliva-glucose levels and potential application in the detection of small amounts of other substances in liquids."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635483","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-79867-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b4a","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Sorocki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f709346f-5a6f-4e73-a4cd-2bc9f7ed822f"},{"objectId":"67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b49","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Gruszczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5593c24a-af7a-48e3-8bf7-b689742ec8aa"},{"objectId":"67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b48","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wincza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"10fe77e7-00b3-43cf-ba6d-d88597477a1a"},{"objectId":"67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b47","name":"Blanka","lastName":"Piekarz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea3a6e85-b7bd-4083-a2cc-05993f171ba4"},{"objectId":"67a4eccafdbe8362a56c1b46","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Piekarz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1f374bb-0063-43db-a716-09e5b308c393"},{"objectId":"601cc5309543c7744e88f140","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Skarżyński","uuid":"F061FB2C5912DF504B0C56C9C502B5F00F6D1817244FA7CB85C3D78DB35E9931CE95F5602324756630BB346D1DC3EDC2228E378BACAAB39476AD9CE9E00E6992","orcidId":"0000-0001-6378-4090","documentHash":"dba7a9ea-be4b-4e8a-af6d-95852ff317f0"},{"objectId":"5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b4c","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Słoma","uuid":"C993118E4622395D99B3F1EBCB68C5A699161C6296F1FB08E4D5E17CEF311F7217566ADADF1E7EB7FB90EF8F3CA62B14D1D54E299EF930B3EF935DF4F585293F","orcidId":"0000-0002-8777-6041","documentHash":"0ab39b05-0633-431f-b3e7-aa0ee4cf8260"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-79867-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["edukacja leśna","zwierzęta leśne","przygotowanie do pracy","praktyki wspomagane","niepełnosprawność intelektualna","las"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["preparation for work","forest","forest animals","forest education","intellectual disability","supported internships"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67a9f3a7fdbe8362a5683827","doi":null,"title":"Zwierzęta leśne w kulturach świata","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67705-54-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://cwn.ajp.edu.pl/2025/13/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"16c2cd0b-04ed-461f-b2a7-924bdeee2e69","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb775","mniswId":"11000","name":"Akademia im.

It consists of one allocaudate, five salamander, five frog, one gecko, chamaeleonids, anguine lizards, one lacertid, one skink and five snake taxa. The entire herpetofauna of Echzell is represented by genera and/or families very broadly known from the early Miocene of Europe.\nContrary to other early Miocene herpetofaunas, the Echzell assemblage includes surprisingly only one form of crocodile-newts (Chelotriton). The Echzell Palaeobatrachus robustus represents the youngest record of the species and extends its stratigraphic range to the late early Miocene. Regarding chameleons, the frontal is partly preserved, but represents the first described frontal of the extinct species Chamaeleo andrusovi. The only anguine lizard that can be identified in the assemblage is represented by a new genus and\nspecies Smithosaurus echzellensis. Our phylogenetic analyses consistently recovered it as the sister taxon to either [Ophisauriscus quadrupes + Ophisaurus holeci] + [Anguis + Ophisaurus] (in the first analysis) or [Anguis + Ophisaurus] (in the second analysis). However, the results are based on limited fossil material – the parietal – and the support for the clade is very low. Thus, the interpretation of the Smithosaurus relationship among anguines needs to be taken with caution and has to be tested in further studies. Among\nsnakes, Natrix longivertebrata represents the oldest record of the species and extends the stratigraphic range of this fossil snake back to the early Miocene. In addition, we provide here a broader comparison of the Echzell amphibian and reptilian assemblage with their European records for the MN3 and MN4 biostratigraphical units. Besides that, the entire herpetofauna of Echzell includes very\nbroadly known early Miocene European forms. Remains of other groups of the same period such as Bufonidae, Hylidae, Pelodytidae, Amphisbaenia, Varanidae, Cordylidae, Pseudopus, are not found in the material available to us. We also conclude that the amphibian and reptilian fossil record across MN3–MN4 is significantly biased by taphonomic and/or environmental conditions. The amphibian and reptilian assemblage of Echzell is rich in forms living in humid and warm environments with forested areas, permanent water bodies and also some open habitats. The following climatic parameters can be reconstructed based on the herpetofauna: a mean annual temperature of 17.4–28.8 °C, minimal warm month temperature 18–28.3 °C, minimal cold month temperature 8–22.2 °C, and mean annual precipitation with a value of 791±254 mm"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635486","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ab4951fdbe837dc760580c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"25","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"4206ca48-c8a5-410b-bc40-f3e6f385fdc6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"99-145","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://fr.pensoft.net/article/83781/download/pdf/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab4951fdbe837dc760580f","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Mörs","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b2b95d6-0844-4e26-b621-9df48e627991"},{"objectId":"67ab4951fdbe837dc760580e","name":"Andrej","lastName":"Čerňanský","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37d60820-d714-4820-9e28-316be9427381"},{"objectId":"67ab4951fdbe837dc760580d","name":"Davit","lastName":"Vasilyan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68d884c6-1a4a-43b9-b5eb-66a7ea38dec2"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa56","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Szyndlar","uuid":"160091F1974A96D91504ABDBEB2215C8E37C3D0842DAC55EA7EFC5850252B592813BD62B2615FC4667A2C1D79E3DD066785BAA8B431ACDB37525963314096DDD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8645-7225","documentHash":"0964ca54-b937-4532-a548-9bcaafbe7d64"}],"doi":"10.3897/fr.25.83781"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antioxidant","bread","food industry","anti-inflammatory","antibacterial","anti-diabetic","extruded snacks","sweet snack products","fruit pomace"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709438878c28a0473b8570","5e7093af878c28a0473af2a1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Health-Promoting Properties and the Use of Fruit Pomace in the Food Industry—A Review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","doi":null,"issn":"2072-6643","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"249ff7e0-f443-46aa-b5c4-21f8cf400d2e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4786fdbe8362a575b178","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709438878c28a0473b8570","5e7093af878c28a0473af2a1"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fruit pomace, a by-product of the fruit industry, includes the skins, seeds, and pulp most commonly left behind after juice extraction.

Due to, among other properties, their high content of dietary fiber and polyphenolic compounds, fruit residues are used to design food with functional features, improving the nutritional value and health-promoting, technological, and sensory properties of food products. This article presents the health-promoting (antioxidant, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial) properties of fruit pomace. Moreover, the possibilities of their use in the food industry are characterized, with particular emphasis on bread, sweet snack products, and extruded snacks. Attention is paid to the impact of waste products from the fruit industry on the nutritional value and technological and sensory characteristics of these products. Fruit pomace is a valuable by-product whose use in the food industry can provide a sustainable solution for waste management and contribute to the development of functional food products with targeted health-promoting properties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635488","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/16/2757","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b8570","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Raczkowska","uuid":"265B72BBCC30521D615A08777029BA880582EA5DDCC30662228491E7C371B95D70C902D7D8DA1575FD1E6502CAA1C5C1BA4206222050362CD46028FF5EE4E9F8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4205-1351","documentHash":"c5a71fd3-452c-4089-abb2-77fdffcd017b"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af2a1","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Serek","uuid":"815512F39D6EB91516F36FD9ADB3C85DE7CA5735542C65DDC92D1D81295E5B6F21F016E095B8E042477A1C6B062575F2FC73415F8D795E52CCE21FF03019020F","orcidId":"0000-0002-4685-4373","documentHash":"a811cc88-6486-4767-b7ac-0dad8f29bbba"}],"doi":"10.3390/nu16162757"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Jason-1/2/3","GRACE","satellite altimetry","sea level changes","Baltic Sea"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709437878c28a0473b83c7","659777ba40e3ff6b129a37a0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Changes in the Water Surface Level of the Baltic Sea from Satellite Altimetry and Gravity Missions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479c60","mniswId":"1824","title":"Artificial Satellites","doi":null,"issn":"1509-3859","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6f6fc286-7730-4829-ae9d-8ef780db424c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab3886fdbe8362a5734052","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659777ba40e3ff6b129a37a0","5e709437878c28a0473b83c7"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Satellite altimetry provides high-accuracy geometrical measurements of sea level changes. We analyze altimetry time series representing sea surface height anomalies over the mean sea surface provided by the TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 satellite missions to estimate the annual rate of sea level rise. Then, we compare the results with satellite gravimetric data from GRACE and GRACE Follow-On missions and surface water temperature data, employing statistical analyses to examine the interrelationships and correlations between them. We carry out the main analyses for the period 2001–2021 with a division into 5-year periods for six different areas of the Baltic Sea. The altimetric results show that between 2001 and 2021, the water level of the Baltic Sea rose by 5.8 mm/year on average. About 72% of the changes detected by altimetry missions can be explained by satellite gravimetry from GRACE and GRACE Follow-On, which means that the mass component is responsible for most of the observed sea level change, whereas the remaining 28% can be greatly explained by thermal expansion due to the water temperature rise."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635490","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"59","pagesFromTo":"100-126","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/arsa-2024-0008","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659777ba40e3ff6b129a37a0","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Białas","uuid":"05F3E8AD4BA700D5ACD72E0AA13DD504C01ECAA9050947861B0C379CBA140190D3151D75859826D99743AFF92F8DEF6468CA7EA4B8D43A44C25A024E19FD452E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d23e5db-52f6-4e9b-8805-daa4918dc9ec"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83c7","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"SOŚNICA","uuid":"22D515E8674D468ED4D4CF62223E7EECD8B8352CEB0CD1836B9DDC1CE8294387C0820DC8358CDFCBC932A875FC2E9DCD5A7090797CD99D2610AC43E60CE18002","orcidId":"0000-0001-6181-1307","documentHash":"083640a6-2e12-412c-8dfb-f1627940b3cb"}],"doi":"10.2478/arsa-2024-0008"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Surface tension","Rhamnolipid","Contact angle","SurfactinTritons"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67c6f8f0fdbe830b4ec68637","5e7092f7878c28a0473a0243"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Adsorption and wetting properties of biosurfactants, Tritons and their mixtures in aqueous and water-ethanol environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476eab","mniswId":"473","title":"Advances in Colloid and Interface Science","doi":null,"issn":"0001-8686","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7e59a7aa-e193-403b-9f76-7431fdb91bef"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67c6f8f0fdbe830b4ec68636","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0243","67c6f8f0fdbe830b4ec68637"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Adsorption of rhamnolipid (RL) and surfactin (SF) as well as their mixtures with Triton X-100 (TX100) and Triton X-165 (TX165) at the solution-air (S-A), PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene)-S, PMMA (poly (methyl methacrylate))-S, Q (quartz)-S, PMMA-A, and Q-A as well as their wetting properties regarding the surface tension of the PTFE, PMMA and quartz and its components and parameters were discussed using the literature data. The mutual influence of biosurfactants and Tritons on the S-A, PMMA(quartz)-A and PTFE(PMMA, quartz)-S interfaces tensions was considered in terms of their adsorption at these interfaces for both aqueous and water-ethanol solutions of the biosurfactant mixtures with Tritons.

Changes of these interface tensions as a function of concentration and composition of the mixtures were compared to those affected by individual mixture components. In turn, these changes of the interface tension were considered as regards properties of the biosurfactants, Tritons and ethanol layers adsorbed at the S-A, PMMA(quartz)-A and PTFE(PMMA, quartz)-S interfaces. Based on the changes of the contact angle of the aqueous and water-ethanol solutions of the biosurfactants and Tritons as well as biosurfactants mixtures with Tritons on PMMA and quartz as a function of mixture concentration and composition, the changes of the PMMA and quartz surface tension were analyzed using various approaches to the surface and interface tension. The thermodynamic functions change as a results of RL, SF, TX100, TX165, ET as well as the mixtures of RL and SF with Tritons adsorption at different interfaces were also analyzed based on the literature data.

underrepresentation of women in academic conferences is an underexplored aspect of gender disparity in science. This study aims to expand knowledge on this issue by investigating whether the virtualization of academic conferences in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic changed the gender structure of conference participants. We explored this question utilizing authorship data from the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index for 180 conferences in 30 conference series held between 2017 and 2023, with a total number of 88,384 papers and 404,295 authors. At least one edition of each analyzed conference series was launched in a virtual or hybrid form. This sample enables a comparison of differences in the gender participation of conference authors while controlling for heterogeneity among conference series. Using linear and logistic regression models, we identified a positive difference in women’s involvement in virtual and hybrid conferences compared to onsite events. However, this effect was due less to the increased participation of women in virtual and hybrid conferences than to the decreased participation of women in the onsite editions of the analyzed conference series."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635495","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67b33439fdbe83707bf75e2c","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"130","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"141c4b26-a209-42fd-887a-831f44aa7eb4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"130","pagesFromTo":"423-445","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11192-024-05212-y.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"606e740a9543c745d80e5be1","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zegler-Poleska","uuid":"BABDC5FC3036AFCB4270BD890109C8135FE6B92F1B94BD78D6144B44D9276EE30971978E65BC247335408BAA2D247D021153158D9D4EA5999DDABBC52F65D193","orcidId":"0000-0002-7574-5985","documentHash":"59b9a280-0bb4-43dc-914c-abd323bf52f6"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b18b2","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Olechnicka","uuid":"9CC5147A9A99C8D941DD7B05E2C441D0A108F58838BE0B3A5962C11C9A956A48B0E155BCE1380CC2597BA29F43F8F42DE55C228CF2980D67AA25F176ACCF3689","orcidId":"0000-0001-5525-636X","documentHash":"44c450a8-f6d0-4a33-ac51-c2c141de1f85"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af1fa","name":"Adam","lastName":"Płoszaj","uuid":"8C777C28B4510A30A4D4E904184817913EE6F6E1DC63C048AA0C0CCB6C6AF62F8A46C20765CE5861CAE7E3E4C3C71501B305B8C90B87DEA4A072C4F6F54A0B36","orcidId":"0000-0002-6638-3951","documentHash":"d3bbd23a-d767-404d-81cc-09baec87ea4c"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11192-024-05212-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65e6d698409707765817f40e","doi":null,"title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Wydziału Nauk o Zdrowiu Uniwersytetu Medycznego w Białymstoku.

As an example, the Lower Silesia region was selected, characterized by agricultural, industrial and natural areas present in its close proximity. Four major cities and the surrounding municipalities (30 objects in total) were covered by the observation. The research was carried out in the period of 1995–2020 and was based on the data provided by Statistics Poland—Local Date Bank. Statistical tools were used which allowed for obtaining the results, enabling inference and the formulation of recommendations. An analytical method was applied which included the linear ordering method and synthetic development of measures. This resulted in preparing rankings of the analyzed objects (municipalities) and making the respective comparisons. The obtained results indicate that a continuously deepening imbalance in the distribution of the demographic potential is observed in the analyzed region. Although the capital city maintained the number of residents at a constant level, the population of the other analyzed cities decreased. Depopulation affected almost half of the 30 analyzed municipalities, and it is a serious problem in striving for the sustainable development of the region. The problem was exacerbated by the absence of a correlation between the demographic potential growth and the increase in the synthetic development measure value which characterized the water and sewage system. This means that the infrastructure preventing anthropopressure and providing basic services directly influencing the quality of life is developing at a different pace than the increase in the number of residents. The above indicates the need for the immediate development of a conscious settlement policy for the region of Lower Silesia.

The bulk β-Ga2O3 crystals are grown using the optical floating zone method and cut to prepare three basic planes for optical investigations. The Ga2O3 emits PL from red (1.7 eV) to near UV (3.5 eV). The maximum is at about 3 eV. It is shown that the excitation of Ga2O3 depends on polarization: the lowest excitation energy 4.7 eV is observed for polarization along the b axis. The PL emission is clearly polarized, which can be used to build diodes emitting polarized light: polarized light-emitting diodes. For example, the main emission from the (100) plane is polarized along [001] direction. Analysis of polarization and dynamics of PL shows that the main emission band is composed of a few spectrally overlapping luminescence bands. The bands are resolved thanks to different polarization and significantly different dynamics. The violet PL at about 3.0 eV has a lifetime τ = 0.6 μs and the blue PL at about 2.8 eV has τ of about 600 μs. Such long lifetimes are characteristic of deep centers, for example, the oxygen vacancy VO or the VGa–Gai–VGa defect."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635508","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"2400566-1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pssb.202400566","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656feaba40e3ff4ef3feaf29","name":"Aliaksei","lastName":"Bohdan","uuid":"7EC5BE7097B60403D1BD686C07E896FFEDE7B45AC0D2B490ED7513D24CEA0BAF88C3CCB0C5E089C6E9E65D6F6BB70EAD4C92287BE4DA919FE7D598C56000FD3C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0f5e4b2e-f9e0-4ca8-ab9a-dfb4ba003f72"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c172e","name":"Jan","lastName":"Fink-Finowicki","uuid":"3F723AEA7A193B797CE4940F0C152DF8F7D406A259933D62403FC0F81D09B03CFA1ECA037EB6118C89706169BBD062F6B7743C653EA1CBDFD1A8DEBB56B7E6B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2068-1678","documentHash":"432e53f1-2fcb-44de-ae7b-bde00d434322"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a791c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Korona","uuid":"F0AD6DDB1A720576FD77B15CB431301A2EF8AF8BD0AE83AC00709460938E24D9168A8446E29EEA2C3DBDEFD34AD8C6A1FDCD749B32737F173EED137DED236ACA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1698-5129","documentHash":"5160ed24-e976-4678-a6f6-0dff2b8c62cf"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7700","name":"Roman","lastName":"Stępniewski","uuid":"F90F4F800CCA0B2CBA2BA58EE8397133D9C8965B8766FA77AE452A06D840FA25ADB2686AE9745B73F1F8CEC0D1AE1512FC6C5F30CCD8D994C1511E8758D81272","orcidId":"0000-0002-7557-7328","documentHash":"7403b556-56bb-4dd3-b4a6-fc61d9c00ad9"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bac7","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Teisseyre","uuid":"B8EA9B08E016F623CA1BE44C967B3CFEFCB29303A4C1AB55293493D94EC5CE0763D18144BF3517D306C1E92C6467D8EAF4D223507C34130DEB7FF8BC59B616D2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8640-1283","documentHash":"75ba7d92-035c-4417-999e-c9baa812356a"}],"doi":"10.1002/pssb.202400566"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["food chain","crop production","plants","microplastic","plant pathogens","toxic compounds"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["617768287523400564d3af34","5e70920d878c28a04738f2d8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Microplastic and Nanoplastic in Crops: Possible Adverse Effects to Crop Production and Contaminant Transfer in the Food Chain","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e776","mniswId":"25607","title":"Plants","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2223-7747","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9b5e2d0-7e4e-4b87-9cc1-37b3d46db596"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab445cfdbe8362a573bbe7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["617768287523400564d3af34","5e70920d878c28a04738f2d8"]},"issue":"17","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"With the increasing amounts of microplastic (MP) deposited in soil from various agricultural activities, crop plants can become an important source of MP in food products.

Some of the adverse effects of microplastic on plants have been already described in the meta-analysis; however, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest findings about possible adverse effects and risks related to wide microplastic occurrence in soil on crop production safety, including topics related to changes of pesticides behavior and plant pathogen spreading under the presence MP and possibly threaten to human health."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635513","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/13/17/2526","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"617768287523400564d3af34","name":"Bhakti","lastName":"Jadhav","uuid":"B4E050613EE18AF78C05CB314EF0098FC4FF6B53C75B6ED459ED0633BACBD801427AB6A510851DC141E12AB42B7983EA5A583EAF34B7DC69025B897096351948","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47b639d6-1689-4ac7-b254-1e015b51aaeb"},{"objectId":"5e70920d878c28a04738f2d8","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Medyńska-Juraszek","uuid":"A97CAD4C33290C92643BF27D1123970777A0D8E5397A8E4A6B73B39C75293098728F6313E70FFFDDC36A00239FF1AC0E735274DD97063B766B39B3313691A4DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-9891-2600","documentHash":"ce4f4572-f246-4666-b3e0-c6d43ca7d7fd"}],"doi":"10.3390/plants13172526"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs","methods: observational","Sun: heliosphere","methods: numerical","magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)","solar wind"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Multi-spacecraft study with the Icarus model","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477233","mniswId":"1982","title":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","doi":null,"issn":"0004-6361","eissn":"1432-0746","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f677d31f-f33f-4fa2-b4f3-7cca75d47be5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66ed6263fdbe83273773ed12","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66ed6263fdbe83273773ed13","66ed6263fdbe83273773ed14","66ed6263fdbe83273773ed15","66ed6263fdbe83273773ed16","6325312975234038513dfa2b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Context. Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the main drivers of the disturbances in interplanetary space. Earth-directed CMEs can be dangerous, and understanding the CME interior magnetic structure is crucial for advancing space weather studies. It is important to assess the capabilities of a numerical heliospheric model, as a firm understanding of the nature and extent of its limitations can be used to improve the model and the space weather predictions based on it.\r\n\r\nAims. The aim of the present study is to test the capabilities of the recently developed heliospheric model Icarus and the linear force-free spheromak model that has been implemented in it.\r\n\r\nMethods. To validate the Icarus space weather modelling tool, two CME events were selected that were observed by two spacecraft located near Mercury and Earth, respectively. This enables us to test the heliospheric model computed with Icarus at two distant locations. The source regions for the CMEs were identified, and the CME parameters were determined and later optimised. Different adaptive mesh refinement levels were applied in the simulations to assess its performance by comparing the simulation results to in situ measurements.\r\n\r\nResults. The first CME event erupted at 15:25 on July 9, 2013. The modelled time series were in good agreement with the observations both at MESSENGER and ACE. The second CME event started at 10:25 on February 16, 2014, and was more complicated, as three CME interactions occurred in this event. It was impossible to recover the observed profiles without modelling the other two CMEs that were observed, one before the main CME and one afterward. The parameters for the three CMEs were identified and the three CMEs were modelled in Icarus. For both CME studies, AMR level 3 was sufficient to reconstruct small-scale features near Mercury, while at Earth, AMR level 4 was necessary due to the radially stretched grid that was used.\r\n\r\nConclusions. The profiles obtained at both spacecraft resemble the in situ measurements well. The current limitations of the space weather modelling tool result in an excessively small deceleration of the CME propagation during the CME–CME interaction as measured by MESSENGER and ACE."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635515","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"689","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/09/aa50430-24/aa50430-24.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66ed6263fdbe83273773ed16","name":"Pascal","lastName":"Démoulin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"846db3fa-8137-4133-8c91-7389167aedb5"},{"objectId":"66ed6263fdbe83273773ed15","name":"B.","lastName":"Schmieder","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94477627-b91f-4ff6-9d16-1c6028775d0d"},{"objectId":"66ed6263fdbe83273773ed14","name":"Benjamin","lastName":"Grison","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fbeab549-f86e-4d55-bf29-48dc1c075b9f"},{"objectId":"66ed6263fdbe83273773ed13","name":"Tinatin","lastName":"Baratashvili","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2cfaaf04-5577-4e42-8188-75d3adc218e1"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202450430"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["organizator

A one factor at a time approach (volume concentration of extract, volume concentration of AgNO3, pH and temperature) was used to optimize the best condition, and results were assessed through UV-visible spectroscopy and particle size distribution. The results showed that 20 mL of plant extract, 80 mL of AgNO3, pH 08, 100 °C temperature were the optimum reaction conditions under which we obtained the smallest Ag-NPs (7 nm). The scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the spherical and crystalline nature of Ag-NPs. The antibacterial activity assay demonstrated a high antibacterial effect of Ag-NPs against S. aureus, P. mirabilis, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, and that impact was greater with smaller-sized nanoparticles (7 nm). This study shows that leaf extract of C. monogyna is a possible medium for the green fabrication of Ag-NPs, and control over reaction factors can establish the characteristics and antibacterial effectiveness of Ag-NPs.

The aim of the dissertation was to determine the incidence of medial coronoid process disease in dogs and to compare the diagnostic usefulness of computed tomography and X-ray examination in determining this primary cause of elbow dysplasia. Material and methods: The research was conducted on 58 dogs, including 36 German Shepherds, 13 Labrador Retrievers, and 9 Golden Retrievers, of both sexes (28 males and 30 females), aged 3 to 15 months. All the dogs underwent X-ray examination and computed tomography. Results: Based on X-ray examination, elbow dysplasia with a visible primary cause was diagnosed in 38 dogs, with medial coronoid process disease found in 20 cases. Medial coronoid process disease ulna was diagnosed in 12 German Shepherds, 3 Golden Retrievers and 5 Labrador Retrievers. Computed tomography of the elbow joints revealed dysplasia in 52 dogs, including medial coronoid process disease diagnosed in 44 cases. Medial coronoid process disease was diagnosed in 29 German Shepherds, 4 Golden Retrievers and 11 Labrador Retrievers. Comparing the results of X-ray examination with the results of computed tomography in dogs, a  statistically significant difference was shown between the two diagnostic methods in diagnosing medial coronoid process disease (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Based on this research, it was determined that medial coronoid process disease occurs much more frequently than osteochondritis dissecans of the medial condyle of the humerus or ununited anconeal process of the ulna, and is only slightly more frequent than incongruity. Fragmentation was the most commonly observed abnormality of the medial coronoid process. Moreover, computed tomography proved its diagnostic superiority over X-ray examination in detecting medial coronoid process disease in dogs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635521","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"80","pagesFromTo":"264-270","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/pdf2024/062024/2024066880.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d2d","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Kubiak-Nowak","uuid":"1ED5760FA8344C7215DABACF15DF0A8B7DDDE4E0D133B5FB10D95E3C72B3CBCE1D601C6344C27A956E30F6BF9ABD9CE368D6D689BBC15E8F0C68FC169C4B3F08","orcidId":"0000-0001-9842-9240","documentHash":"e318c749-fc0d-4256-993a-b270fe31eb25"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cf1","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Borawski","uuid":"A288BB832FA9188296B8991B414646CB7A401ADCFF8920C0BD00C83CD36DC9C068C2D0C23CEDA269479F6B1CFDA88E3986F0C04038E3C474A1D0BF06CD5896BB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0294-3777","documentHash":"5f19f03f-a6c0-4a2c-b201-052bf71fda28"},{"objectId":"5e709237878c28a047391e35","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Prządka","uuid":"A9E4B1F0863AEDDC42EF8B29FF4B1C4A30E4BB310F2DEE73C97E935D63600D503EB4CCEC7BD5FFC059F54211D928E1C07386BD6103057E5BB49E6A7DFF9EF257","orcidId":"0000-0003-3596-2990","documentHash":"bc3e91d6-2104-4b7a-8974-4461a64577cf"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390873","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Glińska-Suchocka","uuid":"9EEFB8B5444F452AABEBDF2BEAB7783EA64A4DB59E0F0F23219DADD271D98A792BA6EE27BCE740EBC87F1005359E577ECF637716F01DB3EA0B33D8EB4164C24A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9480-1508","documentHash":"90430180-f0fd-4e73-9360-5f10ca090836"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390855","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Spużak","uuid":"9ED46EAC4FFB756170ADF977E35418F4536EB2B6FA9C42AFBB6691548387039470C40CC8F904DB92C5168765A57B7A791A46C896408909881A1C8B381F0F2133","orcidId":"0000-0002-0048-1225","documentHash":"b2f716c9-4a62-4fc2-a274-4a4bf1ba39b0"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e27a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kubiak","uuid":"73C51E687565681733FDD51400110034BD9AFF7F9ADB92EBC4FF38266796A47509AD2800D37549B2622F75382A43F8C6AFE04568C3B34259269E14A788ABDF3C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9640-2597","documentHash":"1e73cdf9-bbe3-46a1-b28a-2f9c0fa1955c"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e279","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Jankowski","uuid":"95D16DCF17F814DEDE55BAD5290241BB3060A77A54C90FF19BFF905CC5A66F3712C24F460792A59911A946FCFF4EA2964227374A5E22505A8B8F71E711087522","orcidId":"0000-0002-2356-2511","documentHash":"0769e6cf-49d4-4dd6-baed-8c13347a5876"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e278","name":"ZDZISŁAW","lastName":"KIEŁBOWICZ","uuid":"CA3A3030B21BD397A7F4C274FC32E5293877D00089118295C23138F6B24C041431278D20F123EB1D9A27650B040BDA57C8BFDD412B1234967AEEE10D5AA1A9B7","orcidId":"0000-0003-4946-0449","documentHash":"516738fc-5255-4c55-b500-9297c632ed1b"}],"doi":"10.21521/mw.6880"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut

thiophosphates (MTPs) are a large family of 2D materials that exhibit large structural and chemical diversity. They also show promise for applications in energy harvesting and photodetection. Strain and defect engineering have previously been demonstrated as useful mechanisms to tune several properties of MTPs such as resistivity, magnetic state, and electronic band gap. However, the effect of these stimuli on engineering tunable light emission in MTPs remains unexplored. Here, it is experimentally demonstrated that sulfur vacancies in metal thiophosphate allow defect-state-to-valence-band transitions leading to visible light emission at sub-bandgap energies, while structural defects in the material can enhance and modulate the photoluminescence spectrum. It is also showed that the structural-defect-enhanced light emission can be further tuned by temperature-induced strain gradients."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635523","journalIssue":{"objectId":"670ceb53fdbe83238aeb1476","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6cef1e31-7c60-4e4f-a959-e7f4da318576"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"2400481-1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adom.202400481","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"670ceb53fdbe83238aeb147b","name":"Svetlana V.","lastName":"Boriskina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"592155ca-4452-42ba-b107-871d2d24526a"},{"objectId":"670ceb53fdbe83238aeb147a","name":"Michael A.","lastName":"Susner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"72ef58b7-e760-47f5-8ec7-bbf24cd26ef5"},{"objectId":"670ceb53fdbe83238aeb1479","name":"Rahul","lastName":"Rao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"86b0db68-60ee-4dc8-a687-9f3031fd33d9"},{"objectId":"670ceb53fdbe83238aeb1478","name":"Ryan","lastName":"Siebenaller","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e24573e4-2302-48eb-ae85-2949cc7ccd02"},{"objectId":"670ceb53fdbe83238aeb1477","name":"Abhishek","lastName":"Mukherjee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68d5cda2-5b60-48bd-a296-df6a8028408e"},{"objectId":"67073c28ece39845a342f221","name":"Ajeesh","lastName":"Somakumar","uuid":"56D29055AB7318F22D550F486D1FDB25F4839801CF576009D5AAB0B8FF229077E7B23114AE9147425D7EC496B5156A0A4334C3F71C2FA87FA95EEF9BC19DADA2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"20bce07c-7c5a-4188-9b2a-38312478f62b"},{"objectId":"624ba9a87523402df09ca8fb","name":"Damian","lastName":"Włodarczyk","uuid":"46667E33825B0BA9C046B222EF0ED10DAB80F64F62F5CAA18C92F7889A61696C03277A968AD9F2B7724D57E661F31A42AF2D26CC9F5B6AF4CBCD467C9C0E6241","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4878a7e0-4156-45fa-9377-2e509dc2c9f9"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a8","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sybilski","uuid":"131956E391C55E8585A32F74FCCC87C9D33D63D00ABC1373997A7BCB02D776C53D539704D108723530DAEA32929223A9E9F489F8689D3686BBA03C36E44A7D9D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c553a12-c17b-429d-b9d6-237a02e5bb2e"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ea7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Suchocki","uuid":"B4F92D3EB438C6EE801941953070B69ACF8778481E00775A532482562A0ABAB70AD2EDFE7CD1BC23DA59D4A4615609CEBE61F4E5B5991652E2817810381B622C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7126-1951","documentHash":"f96bd335-71f8-4794-afa9-e315c30f8c78"}],"doi":"10.1002/adom.202400481"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a00b2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Najnowsze metody leczenia stomatopatii protetycznych - przegląd piśmiennictwa","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4143","mniswId":"201742","title":"Magazyn Stomatologiczny","doi":null,"issn":"1230-0888","eissn":"2657-7356","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"72469631-f46b-46eb-8b2f-edfce55fb147"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6711f3e5fdbe831eab26cf59","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6711f3e5fdbe831eab26cf5a","6711f3e5fdbe831eab26cf5b","5e7092f5878c28a0473a00b2","6711f3e5fdbe831eab26cf5c"]},"issue":"4/2024","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W publikacji omówiono rodzaje stomatopatii protetycznych, ich etiologię oraz czynniki ryzyka predysponujące do wystąpienia objawów.

evaluation of energy input and output processes in agricultural systems is a crucial method for assessing sustainability levels within these systems. In this research, the investigation focused on the input and output energies and related indices in sunflower farms in Khoy County during the agricultural year 2017–2018. Data were collected from 140 sunflower producers through specialized questionnaires and face-to-face interviews. Additionally, artificial neural networks (ANNs), specifically the multilayer perceptron, were employed to predict the output energy. The results revealed that a substantial portion of the total input energy was attributed to chemical nitrogen fertilizer (43.98%), consumable fuel (25.74%), and machinery (8.42%). The energy efficiency (energy ratio) in these agroecosystems was relatively low, measured at 1.57 for seed and 7.96 for seed and straw. These values should be improved. The energy efficiency in seed production was computed at 0.06 MJ·ha−1, while, for the combined seeds and straw, it was 0.57 MJ·ha−1. In particular, seed energy efficiency represents approximately 11% of the overall biological energy efficiency, highlighting that a substantial 89% of the produced energy is associated with straw. The proper use of this straw is crucial, as its improper handling could lead to a drastic decrease in overall efficiency. Furthermore, the explanatory coefficient (R2) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to predict the output energy with the best neural network were 0.94, and 1.77 for the training data, 0.97 and 1.55 for the test data, and 0.9 and 2.08 for the validation data, respectively; additionally, 0.97 and 0.42 were obtained by an ANFIS."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635530","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/11/2795","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab4748fdbe8362a575891c","name":"Ebrahim","lastName":"Taghinezhad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"941cc203-f4ab-4d5d-a110-2515982d4fca"},{"objectId":"67ab4748fdbe8362a575891b","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Tahmasebi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c8be7ff-ed49-47ce-93e0-df6880db1eb1"},{"objectId":"67ab4748fdbe8362a575891a","name":"Javad","lastName":"Tarighi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ff04982-9116-480e-9ec2-7d6e53e7a414"},{"objectId":"67ab4748fdbe8362a5758919","name":"Vali Rasooli","lastName":"Sharabiani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf9492ea-bc87-43e6-9ef8-977fd48e8a77"},{"objectId":"67ab4748fdbe8362a5758918","name":"﻿Hossein Lotfali","lastName":"Nezhad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c591443-5f40-481f-9e9b-11de942851de"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a7","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Szumny","uuid":"AE28B651B632C894879C2606F003399974DB4F842D3C49CA1D5C8EB76BBAD0B5F2BCC1B7BA62F3E92848A2BD932035D823CDA1FF929B80C04EA5CC526CE6F2D5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9058-1598","documentHash":"8b015d67-9d2a-4720-a998-2fe34600ba49"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17112795"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"66695cc54097074fa1a574ea","doi":null,"title":"Science and industry challenges and opportunities Edited by: prof. dr hab.

In the both cases the emphasis is on the accuracy. Formally, the radial equation describing perturbations of the (2+1)-dimensional black hole is a special case of the general master equation of the 5-dimensional Tangherlini black hole. Similarly, the (3+1)-dimensional equation can be obtained from the master equation of the 7-dimensional Tangherlini black hole. For the (2+1)-dimensional analog black hole we used three major techniques: the higher-order Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) method with the Padé summation, the Hill-determinant method and the continued fraction method, the latter two with the convergence acceleration. In the (3+1)-dimensional case, we propose the simpler recurrence relations and explicitly demonstrate that both recurrences, i.e., the eight-term and the six-term recurrences yield identical results. Since the application of the continued-fraction method require five (or three) consecutive Gauss eliminations, we decided not to use this technique in the (3+1)-dimensional case. Instead, we used the Hill-determinant method in the two incarnations and the higher-order WKB.

We focus on the longterm changes in Keplerian elements by averaging them over several complete revolutions forming mean orbital elements giving an explanation of the main perturbing forces for each Keplerian parameter. The combined International GNSS Service (IGS) orbits are employed which were derived in the framework of IGS Repro3 for ITRF2020 preparation spanning eight years from 2013 to 2021. The semi-major axis for GPS satellites is affected by a strong resonance with Earth’s gravity field resulting in a long-period perturbation similar to a secular drift. The semi-major axes of Galileo and GLONASS do not show any large-scale rates, however, Galileo satellites are affected by the Y-bias resulting in semi-major axis drifts. A significant perturbations due to solar radiation pressure affect the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and the argument of perigee. Notably, for Galileo satellites in eccentric orbits, the signal with a one-draconitic year is evident in the semi-major axis. The evolution of the mean right ascension of the ascending node and argument of perigee is primarily characterized by nearly linear regression mainly due to even zonal harmonics of the Earth’s gravity field. The long-term evolution of eccentricity and inclination does not follow a linear trend but exhibits clear oscillations dependent on the secular drift of the right ascension of the ascending node (for inclination) or the argument of perigee (for eccentricity). Additionally, the long-term perturbation of inclination reaches its maximum when the absolute value of the Sun’s elevation angle above the orbital plane (β angle) is at its minimum, while the eccentricity reaches its minimum simultaneously with the minimum of the β angle."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635535","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-024-01708-5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f925a9543c7410626f61e","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Zajdel","uuid":"5E7BB79C3A34BEF743303834A2DBB23BF5EFF85CEB7F1AFDE8C949BF43ECB7477C36C3D2ECD294A54E31DAE35D3937A3551D6FDD070CF1252A87DB6EB38D4ACF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de7129cf-4f7b-4a9c-8998-38645d850a36"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83c7","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"SOŚNICA","uuid":"22D515E8674D468ED4D4CF62223E7EECD8B8352CEB0CD1836B9DDC1CE8294387C0820DC8358CDFCBC932A875FC2E9DCD5A7090797CD99D2610AC43E60CE18002","orcidId":"0000-0001-6181-1307","documentHash":"083640a6-2e12-412c-8dfb-f1627940b3cb"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10291-024-01708-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a023c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effects of whey proteins and erythritol combination on the physical and quality characteristics of untempered, high-protein white chocolates without the saccharose addition","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478138","mniswId":"8513","title":"International Dairy Journal","doi":null,"issn":"0958-6946","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3035a862-0071-4680-96c3-cfecea9d667f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66d19c09fdbe83273705afd9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c6e2d4fdbe830b4ec3e197","67c6e2d4fdbe830b4ec3e198","5e7092f7878c28a0473a023c","67c6e2d4fdbe830b4ec3e199","67c6e2d4fdbe830b4ec3e19a","67c6e2d4fdbe830b4ec3e19b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to assess impact erythritol and whey protein isolate (WPI) impact on the physical characteristics of untempered, high-protein (12/16/20/24% (w/w) of protein) white chocolates without the saccharose addition.

In situ observations by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have revealed new properties of the proton velocity distributions (VDs), including hammerhead features that suggest a non-isotropic broadening of the beams.\r\nAims. The present work proposes a very plausible explanation for the formation of hammerhead proton populations through the action of a proton firehose-like instability triggered by the proton beam.\r\nMethods. We investigated a self-generated firehose-like instability driven by the relative drift of ion populations using a simplified moment-based quasi-linear (QL) theory. While simpler and faster than advanced numerical simulations, this toy model provided rapid insights and concisely highlighted the role of plasma micro-instabilities in relaxing the observed anisotropies of particle VDs in the\r\nsolar wind and space plasmas.\r\nResults. The QL theory proposed here shows that the resulting transverse waves are right-hand polarized and have two consequences on the protons: (i) They reduce the relative drift between the beam and the core, but above all, (ii) they induce a strong perpendicular temperature anisotropy specific to the observed hammerhead ion beam. Moreover, the long-run QL results suggest that these ham-\r\nmerhead distributions are rather transitory states that are still subject to relaxation mechanisms, in which instabilities such as the one discussed here are very likely involved. This foundational work motivates future detailed studies using advanced methods."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635539","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"692","pagesFromTo":"1-6","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/386139716_Decoding_the_formation_of_hammerhead_ion_populations_observed_by_Parker_Solar_Probe","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6759511bfdbe8357175591c0","name":"Peter ","lastName":"Haesung Yoon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e486a463-6f21-41fe-9775-efd01385592c"},{"objectId":"6759511bfdbe8357175591bf","name":"Rodrigo A.","lastName":"López","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"485f9f71-284a-4a5f-aedb-063a755aed32"},{"objectId":"6759511bfdbe8357175591be","name":"Marian","lastName":"Lazar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63a5689e-e65f-4f36-9a90-2565d498280c"},{"objectId":"6759511bfdbe8357175591bd","name":"Shaaban Mohammed ","lastName":"Shaaban","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9f39aed-381e-405b-a99f-4403c5f2871e"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202452205"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922a878c28a047390eb5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Reflection moderates the link between loneliness and eudaimonic well-being in mothers of young children: A COVID-19 pandemic study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454791f5","mniswId":"15884","title":"Personality and Individual Differences","doi":null,"issn":"0191-8869","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"06abacc9-b599-4ffa-b1d1-85c14977ca6e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67a9a973fdbe8311176714a5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922a878c28a047390eb5","67a9a973fdbe8311176714a7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Loneliness is a significant threat to well-being and was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for vulnerable groups such as mothers of young children. Although much needed, research on protective factors against maternal loneliness is lacking. The present study aimed to address this gap by investigating whether reflection, understood as curiosity-driven self-focused attention, could moderate the relationship between loneliness and eudaimonic well-being (EWB) during the pandemic. The hypotheses predicted that loneliness in the romantic, family, and social domains would be negatively associated with EWB, and that these relationships would weaken with an increase in reflection. In a cross-sectional study of 559 Polish women (aged 20–46, M = 30.72, SD = 4.11) with one child under 6 years, participants completed measures of loneliness, EWB, and reflection, with rumination as a covariate. We used the latent variable interaction approach to test main and interaction effects. As hypothesized, loneliness domains negatively correlated with EWB, moderated by reflection. Higher reflection weakened links between social and family loneliness and EWB. Considering that the cognitive characteristics of reflection can be effectively developed through training, these findings can inspire psychological interventions dedicated to coping with the loneliness experienced by mothers of young children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635541","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67a9a973fdbe8311176714a6","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"238","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e58a7f2d-c148-45d7-93b9-cf6593d6e831"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"238","pagesFromTo":"113088","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0191886925000509?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67a9a973fdbe8311176714a7","name":"Monika","lastName":"Czaja","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2f85b06-f58d-41db-82db-81c51697d239"},{"objectId":"5e70922a878c28a047390eb5","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Borawski","uuid":"114D21B7F0D3653E85D75E94BFE4DEFF0097F116934F387E0FBF9244C2CD217DA0CADEE0E583682D5B522AA08FB070FACD815B04EE6B0B61154AE0C58258D6A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1504-2145","documentHash":"d63b4f66-6964-4db1-9dd4-5e64eb028a67"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.paid.2025.113088"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"66695cc54097074fa1a574ea","doi":null,"title":"Science and industry challenges and opportunities Edited by: prof. dr hab.

The polymeric ion-selective membrane consisting of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) as a membrane matrix, 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE) as a plasticizer, complex of cobalt(II) nitrate and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Co(Bphen)2(NO3)2(H2O)2) as an ionophore, and trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride (THTDPCl) as an lipophilic ionic additive was further enriched with\r\na nanocomposite consisting of copper(II) oxide nanoparticles and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs/CuONPs). To verify whether the additional implementation of conductive materials into the membrane composition improved the performance of the\r\nelectrodes, a series of tests were carried out, including the determination of characteristic of the electrodes, linearity range, detection limit and slope, selectivity, as well as\r\nmeasurements of stability and potential reversibility."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635542","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"160-163","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bazawiedzy.umcs.pl/info/article/UMCSc157ff4558f44c28b1700b23c596a9ca/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6711f3b1fdbe831eab26b857","name":"M.","lastName":"Wardak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a079176e-2c6f-4945-a205-ffaa4cb1568c"},{"objectId":"6711f3b1fdbe831eab26b856","name":"K.","lastName":"Morawska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3560067b-915f-4dcd-8060-950c79e58b14"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a008c","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Lenik","uuid":"68EDD5AA03089A468BEEDFE193635A847D5CFE7C67CDE73F7A56AA200DDADBD370EECE513BC5C73391F959277C2D1736C496FB6AEEE470AC6D40C0C58882606F","orcidId":"0000-0002-2364-4429","documentHash":"ac488f3a-b579-4b0b-9e75-31fce9034134"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a008a","name":"Cecylia","lastName":"Wardak","uuid":"FAD5C85E74559A5682EC839BE79E9A9C43796401C2AA1D76F5A22B8C1852B07390DFB1E5F62AC42BDF54E1B97DBCDFDD7AE929E7F96EC24884C71CD14953A1E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5785-3237","documentHash":"255fb411-39fb-4d18-8922-59568baed0b2"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

aim of this study was to assess the effect of long-term catch crop application on the structural properties of humin, which is considered the most recalcitrant fraction of soil organic matter. Soil samples from a 30-year field experiment on triticale cultivated with and without catch crops were analysed to determine the total organic carbon content and fractional composition of humic substances. Meanwhile, humin isolated from bulk soil was analysed to determine its elemental composition and spectroscopic properties measured with UV-Vis, fluorescence, and 13C-CPMAS-NMR. It was found that catch crop farming enhanced the formation of highly reactive humus substances, like low-molecular-weight fractions and humic acids, while decreasing the humin fraction. The higher H/C and O/C atomic ratios of humin and the UV-Vis, fluorescence, and 13C-CPMAS-NMR results confirmed a higher share of oxygen-containing functional groups in humin isolated from the soil with catch crop rotation, also corroborating its greater aliphatic nature. Under the conditions of our field experiment, the results indicated that organic residues from catch crops quickly undergo the decay process and are transformed mainly into highly reactive humus substances, which can potentially improve soil health, while mineral fertilisation alone without catch crops favours the stabilisation and sequestration of carbon."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635558","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/21/5049","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab43bcfdbe8362a57375a4","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Parylak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e987fc68-a83b-494e-9cee-72ee2b39883d"},{"objectId":"67ab43bcfdbe8362a57375a3","name":"Maria","lastName":"Jerzykiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d4b00761-6082-4908-ac2f-bac2ff60442a"},{"objectId":"67ab43bcfdbe8362a57375a2","name":"Riccardo","lastName":"Spaccini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"16651dc1-6443-40e7-baaa-7d5973dfc8e0"},{"objectId":"67ab43bcfdbe8362a57375a1","name":"Lilla","lastName":"Mielnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"87773045-f185-4fa6-86fa-d28d19517720"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e21","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Dębicka","uuid":"F3CB8A652276898BCE29ADFD380FB2DD34B90070E36D9296D2B442F30D8C36E7B30A550C0D6ACC18B9B03BFEFF39C35A912DDF06AB36508CC65946E6234B4E0C","orcidId":"0000-0003-4659-5380","documentHash":"e0d92ce0-46f7-44f9-a335-be2425fd928d"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e16","name":"Irmina","lastName":"Ćwieląg-Piasecka","uuid":"43C5D2F1403E89BC1E2A2FFD8D9CF926297DFE440A815E8F4067C9EEAC68B599C1C1F087EAB79F04562BD68267552B7B645D10D67F873CFA52279968B58C0E8E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1439-0295","documentHash":"012e17ed-1e55-40dd-bf24-1f024cf81c58"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e234","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Weber","uuid":"5704148C7AF7A9E73E1BCB701D8630011B3C50BAE890B4985CEFB916C702F62B405B8CAB5692D5FF2D5FA21AD2D4B15DC51B1322B3D6DCF50194C3E2CED99546","orcidId":"0000-0002-7683-7291","documentHash":"eb63d81f-2acd-4253-8dec-a760a8f7a788"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e22e","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kocowicz","uuid":"3A40C45FD29746176D4F145AE187B02EF771DF660C6C4C84BACB398D7ED5107C5E48BAB560D388E33BA3278396CBB7F208D22C9D50B610D73712D38A3BCFCD90","orcidId":"0000-0002-0958-3543","documentHash":"4467546f-2be6-49ae-8d97-d940b0cd3982"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e229","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Jamroz","uuid":"2A07028FEE858449C58B2164CB5E6A069FB4749C9A21DD4B64D1B425CBD9A30E657CE542565F2EBA6199F5574C3F77647BB2C7B51AD85F7BDE6856A661502FA9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0130-181X","documentHash":"294cb595-fa74-49a2-9647-e43f077fb1b4"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules29215049"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika

analyzed the planetary boundary layer (PBL) characteristics in Warsaw, Poland for a day of summer, autumn, winter, and spring of 2021 by integrating and comparing measured and simulated data. Using remote sensing lidar sensor data, the PBLH was calculated using wavelet covariance transform (WCT) and the gradient method (GM). Also, simulations of turbulent fluxes were performed utilizing the large eddy simulation (LES) from the Parallel Large Eddy Simulation Model (PALM) to better understand how turbulence and convection behave across different seasons in Warsaw. The PBLH diurnal cycles showed pronounced changes in their vertical structure as a function of the season: the winter heights were shallow (~0.7 km), while summer heights were deeper (~1.7 km). The spring and autumn presented transient characteristics of PBLH around 1.0 km. This study is crucial for enhancing urban air quality and climate modeling. The PBLH simulations from PALM showed agreement with the measured data, with an underestimation of approximately 10% in both methods. Through PALM, it was possible to observe that summer exhibited increased convection, enhanced mixing efficiency, and a deeper boundary layer compared to other seasons throughout the daily cycle.

Cotton is one of the topmost fiber crops throughout the globe. During the last decade, abrupt changes in the climate resulted in drought, heat, and salinity. These stresses have seriously affected cotton production and significant losses all over the textile industry. The GhAGC kinase, a subfamily of AGC group and member of serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinases group and is highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms. The AGC kinases are compulsory elements of cell development, metabolic processes, and cell death in mammalian systems. The investigation of RNA editing sites within the organelle genomes of multicellular vascular plants, such as Gossypium hirsutum holds significant importance in understanding the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Methods: In present work, we characterized twenty-eight GhAGC genes in cotton and constructed phylogenetic tree using nine different species from the most primitive to the most recent. Results: In sequence logos analyses, highly conserved amino acid residues were found in G. hirsutum, G. arboretum, G. raimondii and A. thaliana. The occurrence of cis-acting growth and stress-related elements in the promoter regions of GhAGCs highlight the significance of these factors in plant development and abiotic stress tolerance. Ka/Ks levels demonstrated that purifying selection pressure resulting from segmental events was applied to GhAGC with little functional divergence. We focused on identifying RNA editing sites in G. hirsutum organelles, specifically in the chloroplast and mitochondria, across all 28 AGC genes. Conclusion: The positive role of GhAGCs was explored by quantifying the expression in the plant tissues under abiotic stress. These findings help in understanding the role of GhAGC genes under abiotic stresses which may further be used in cotton breeding for the development of climate smart varieties in abruptly changing climate."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635568","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-024-05598-0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3e3cfdbe8362a5734c1e","name":"Ehab","lastName":"Salama","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b693eb5-b3d5-4ab0-b750-7392a020dc77"},{"objectId":"67ab3e3cfdbe8362a5734c1d","name":"M.

The shock compression method produces activated carbon with surface functionalities, primarily hydroxyl groups, and varying morphological properties. Two approaches, unidirectional and isotropic compression, yield distinct surface structures: the former preserves a relatively flat surface, while the latter generates corrugated features with valleys and ridges. These features significantly impact the adsorption properties of methylene blue (MB), a commonly used dye. Simulations reveal that MB molecules are highly mobile on flat surfaces, aligning with a mobile adsorption model. However, on corrugated surfaces, MB exhibits localized adsorption, with the deepest valleys effectively immobilizing the dye molecules. Additionally, the study highlights the influence of surface hydroxyl groups, which, through interactions with water molecules, prevent MB from occupying these regions. The findings underscore that traditional adsorption models may not fully capture the dynamics of MB adsorption on activated carbons with complex morphologies. These insights are critical for advancing carbon-based adsorbents in water purification applications.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635573","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"6030","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/24/6030","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67c6e2f2fdbe830b4ec3e228","name":"Robert","lastName":"Pietrzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9b01f30-a058-44cf-836d-e0694447fddc"},{"objectId":"67c6e2f2fdbe830b4ec3e227","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Wolski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d11c549-0e7f-4de8-b11b-945bd7bbe501"},{"objectId":"67c6e2f2fdbe830b4ec3e226","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Panczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"33ad44be-6de1-41a8-a92e-5fa6c4f11483"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nieszporek","uuid":"CE187BADC1005F63DC0E7BA3B2A4A2BB98F060B4A50222EF56C8FF659D0A0992C8B611C779729E1EE0BD2FD8040D27DC4C32565497829CD1EE13811A4A59FF0E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4132-5499","documentHash":"dbbec7d2-d2a2-48de-9c4d-36dc2e907047"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules29246030"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709349878c28a0473a66bb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Recent advances in strontium ion removal from wastewater","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9ef","mniswId":"1479","title":"Applied Materials Today","doi":null,"issn":"2352-9407","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"021ac7b0-c4e7-4ccf-9963-2656fb75670b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b1","67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b2","67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b3","67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b4","67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b5","67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b6","67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b7","67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b8","5e709349878c28a0473a66bb","67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b9","67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685ba"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This review discusses current developments in strontium ion removal technologies from contaminated wastewater, focusing on new materials and methodologies for treatments of concern to the environment and health. Strontium, in particular its radioactive isotope, namely strontium-90 (90Sr), represents one of the dangerous pollutants that call for effective remediation. The salient features of this advancement mainly deal with improved adsorbents consisting of MOFs (metal-organic frameworks), carbon-based nanomaterials, and biosorbents, which enhanced the uptake of strontium by high surface area and selectivity. Efforts are also being extended towards optimization for ion-exchange resins for higher efficiency coupled with reusability. The membrane filtration techniques involving nanofiltration and reverse osmosis yielded promising results, although membrane fouling remained a problem. Environmentally friendly, low-cost adsorbents from natural materials support sustainable water treatment. These are realized when scalability, cost-efficiency, and long-term performance challenges remain open; they thus are a worrisome element to call for further research and innovation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635575","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"43","pagesFromTo":"102641","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352940725000605","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685ba","name":"Salah","lastName":"Knani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"54e6c278-64cb-40c1-ad22-0db1c9b748f8"},{"objectId":"67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b9","name":"Besma","lastName":"Graba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c85de09-959b-4be2-a9c5-c1aef162b0fb"},{"objectId":"67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b8","name":"Yuhoon","lastName":"Hwang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"535b407e-2cf4-46c9-972f-6541fae38d61"},{"objectId":"67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b7","name":"Fatima","lastName":"Rida","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c02cbd1-fbdc-4be0-9493-3a238a17fe5c"},{"objectId":"67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b6","name":"Meryem","lastName":"Boudkhili","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"575097f7-d31b-4ecf-a778-b1a667c19e06"},{"objectId":"67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b5","name":"Mohammed","lastName":"Benjelloun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"594880a1-9512-4add-9e9d-ef16f065a9b5"},{"objectId":"67c6f8e2fdbe830b4ec685b4","name":"Dison S.P.

This study compared the oxidative imbalance after combat training in horses in the regular police service and in horses that had just been schooled. Blood collection was performed immediately after training and after 16 h rest. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant status (TAS) were determined as the markers of enzymatic antioxidant defence. At the same time, lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonylation (Carb) were assessed as oxidation biomarkers. Additionally, oxidative imbalance indexes such as SOD/CAT, SOD/GPx, TBARS/TAS and TBARS/GPx were calculated. Animals during schooling had significantly lower SOD activity in erythrocytes than those experienced. CAT activity in erythrocytes was insignificantly higher immediately after training than during recovery. The SOD/GPx ratio was higher in experienced animals, which may reflect the intra-erythrocyte imbalance between enzymes producing and degrading hydrogen peroxide towards the first one. The concentration of carbonyl groups was significantly higher after the combat training compared to the recovery period in all horses. In inexperienced animals slight increase in TBARS/TAS and TBARS/GPx indexes were observed during the recovery time after exercises, contrary to experienced horses, in which these markers decreased slightly. These results suggest that the oxidative imbalance in inexperienced horses, although less pronounced just after combat training, was more prolonged as compared to horses in regular service."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635582","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"171","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034528824000857?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab49acfdbe8362a576172e","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Miśta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"219a232b-f31d-442b-9d07-4fb9abda1f54"},{"objectId":"67ab49acfdbe8362a576172d","name":"Raghvendra","lastName":"Bohara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a4fcc5b6-8ad6-4e66-90db-cc06483a29c6"},{"objectId":"67ab49acfdbe8362a576172c","name":"František","lastName":"Zigo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56c53b1c-c04e-42ad-9ae1-6896db4d2247"},{"objectId":"67ab49acfdbe8362a576172b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Walski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"979f7a3c-aeb7-4f59-9108-127355463625"},{"objectId":"67ab49acfdbe8362a576172a","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Pavlak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7d8e0cb1-8fd3-4078-9e4f-468a38be93d9"},{"objectId":"67ab49acfdbe8362a5761729","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Bujok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7cfe1ea1-0594-4aeb-bd79-dee59f21e094"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739961d","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Trochanowska-Pauk","uuid":"7C54DED948F72A537577EBDDEB39929345BF6AB2843580D123C13DFA04EE567F55E9BA4598725411003D0261656D6F2B25473D8D2F1776B88158562FC3814C85","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"900e01aa-4f2e-4c59-bd20-34fd8519c3e5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.rvsc.2024.105219"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Merocyanine 540","Yo-Pro 1","Semen","Cryopreservation","Domestic cat","Osmotic resistance"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67ab499afdbe8362a576169b","67ab499afdbe8362a576169c","67ab499afdbe8362a576169d","5e709440878c28a0473b8ec7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"In search of freezability predictors for feline spermatozoa – osmotic challenge tests and markers of sperm membrane structure","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477038","mniswId":"1150","title":"Animal Reproduction Science","doi":null,"issn":"0378-4320","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e96525b8-e17a-48db-9b63-b9acf4606303"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab499afdbe8362a576169a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709440878c28a0473b8ec7","67ab499afdbe8362a576169b","67ab499afdbe8362a576169c","67ab499afdbe8362a576169d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Semen cryopreservation is a crucial part of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in animals, and recently it is gaining more and more attention among cat breeders. Even if fresh semen quality is good, sometimes spermatozoa do not survive freezing. The freezability prediction was widely studied in many species, but not in the domestic cat. The aim of this study was to verify the usefulness of osmotic challenge tests and membrane structure markers (Yo-Pro 1 and Merocyanine 540) for the prediction of the quality of post-thawed feline semen. Semen was collected by urethral catheterization from 22 male cats. After a basic evaluation of semen, 20×106 spermatozoa were cryopreserved; the rest were evaluated by flow cytometry for membrane integrity (SYBR-14/PI), acrosome status (lectin PNA/PI), mitochondrial potential (JC-1) and membrane stability (Yo-Pro 1/M540 staining). Hypo- and hyperosmotic challenge tests were also performed. The thawed samples were evaluated as fresh ones. The Pearson correlation between all parameters in fresh semen and all parameters in cryopreserved spermatozoa was assessed. Although some moderate correlations were found between the results of the osmotic tests and markers of sperm membrane stability (Yo-Pro 1 and Merocyanine 540) and post-thaw semen quality parameters, the predictive value of studied markers was rather weak – no cut-off values could be established and, based on regression models, they explained less than 40 % of variability in post-thaw quality. Our results confirm that cryodamage is a complex matter, in which many different factors play a role, affecting sperm motility and membrane integrity differently."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635585","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"268","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378432024001544","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab499afdbe8362a576169d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Niżański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a08fe7f-9976-4c4a-8d0f-e937b057798a"},{"objectId":"67ab499afdbe8362a576169c","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Smalec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a326e425-03c9-4cfd-926f-62e0e3833247"},{"objectId":"67ab499afdbe8362a576169b","name":"Maria","lastName":"Eberhardt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52a0038e-1d02-4448-82ff-5856ef739558"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8ec7","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Prochowska","uuid":"E5329A97BB1D738E9BFA1AF6C87B1426CE186C4E912B4A521598608F86AFDCABDD1437B549E6FF1BA23FB34B72322520EB02AD888CE5879D8FB38273397A7A62","orcidId":"0000-0002-5708-8141","documentHash":"b889b495-95af-46b0-8eac-6150c187d8bf"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.anireprosci.2024.107563"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Heliophysics","Open science","Artifical Intelligence","Metadata","GPU computing","Python"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Heliophysics and space weather information architecture and innovative solutions: Current status and ways forward","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476edd","mniswId":"542","title":"Advances in Space Research","doi":null,"issn":"0273-1177","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8ca0258d-c418-4548-8427-13ed4866a947"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fcb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fcc","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fcd","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fce","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fcf","6325312975234038513dfa2b","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd0","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd1","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd2","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd3","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd4","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd5","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd6","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd7","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd8","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fd9","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fda","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fdb","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fdc","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fdd","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fde","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fdf","67595d7dfdbe8357175e5fe0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Over the past 10 years, a paradigm shift has happened in the world of science and information technology. Open science is becoming the de facto standard, as underlined by the recent recommendation on Open Science approved by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in November 2021. In parallel, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies are already part of our daily life, profoundly impacting our societies. This reality is far different from when the 2015–2025 COmmittee on SPAce Research (COSPAR)/International Living With a Star (ILWS) Space weather roadmap was laid down by Schrijver et al. (2015).\r\n\r\nHence, when the COSPAR International Space Weather Action Teams (ISWAT) initiated community-wide efforts, back in 2018, to join forces in order to advance space weather predictive capabilities, four ISWAT overarching activities were eventually established: assessment, information architecture and data utilization, innovative solutions and education/outreach. These topics are indeed transversal activities across all subfields of space weather research, focusing on either the variability of heliospheric regions or physical phenomena and their specific space weather impacts.\r\n\r\nHere, we present the combined output of the information architecture and innovative solutions working groups. The first part is related to the heliophysics and space weather information architecture key building blocks (section 2). The second part is dedicated to open science tools and infrastructures, first detailing the tools to boost open science (section 3), then presenting actual and upcoming open science infrastructures (section 4). The third part is related to AI/ML solutions applied to the data available through this information architecture (section 5). The last part tries to encompass the breadth of activity presented and provides a number of recommendations, underlining some opportunities but also challenges ahead. Overall, this paper tries to highlight how powerful this open science ecosystem is, but also fragile, requiring sustained support from its various decision makers

One promising approach to enhancing composting conditions is using novel analytical methods based on artificial intelligence. To predict and optimize the emissions (CO, CO2, H2S, NH3) during the early-stage of composting process machine learning (ML) models were utilized. Data about emissions from laboratory composting with compost’s biochar with different incubation (50, 60, 70 °C) and biochar doses (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15% dry mass) were used for ML models selections and training. ML models such as acritical neural network (ANN, Bayesian Regularized Neural Network; R2 accuracy CO:0.71, CO2:0.81, NH3:0.95, H2S:0.72) and decision tree (DT, RPART; R2 accuracy CO:0.69, CO2:0.80, NH3:0.93, H2S:0.65) have demonstrated satisfactory results.

This paper aims to explore various aspects of reproductive performance in African penguins within a large ex situ colony at Zoo Wrocław in Poland, covering 9 years of breeding behaviors. The analysis reveals parallels in colony growth and partner change patterns with those observed in the wild. Positive correlations were found between breeding success and pair-bond duration, with the increasing colony size influencing reproductive performance. Contrary to their wild counterparts, captive African penguins initiate breeding attempt and produce a fertilized egg at a younger age. However, successful breeding still requires gaining experience or forming pairs with more experienced partners. Our research indicates that providing captive African penguins with unlimited food resources and sufficient nesting space results in rapid colony growth. The increased colony size facilitates breeding behaviors that positively influence population dynamics, particularly through the maintenance of long-term pair bond relationships and the potential for partner changes when necessary or desirable to enhance breeding success. We present compelling case studies in pair fidelity, offering valuable insights and implications for the management of captive populations and conservation efforts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635601","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-54105-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3e49fdbe8362a5734ea7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mucha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a02efce-aec1-403c-af8a-9e1279f07e78"},{"objectId":"635c90287523405a7dcc9343","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Borecki","uuid":"BB58D3A9F14FC00F590F3CCE34532F1430C360D8EEBC0365E716745B431583960CBF6BEC5D6B1AAECD31EFEE84BDB8AE1DDBD73D33792B27AB042B70F47075B0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4616ba20-8160-4faf-b791-afa91c7bac2a"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6dab","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Rosenberger","uuid":"D3F3D1F7C6AF0BAD90BD83A1258FAC7D1AB5848F9D0B1EF9091056D60DB3BA6AAA568CBA3EA43DE32217FDF4436DFC705BBE5D36C3DBCCD1751E069D6C454ECB","orcidId":"0000-0001-8169-6377","documentHash":"e9072ec1-ae39-471b-8a20-00538d1bcaee"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af769","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Partyka","uuid":"6956953924569AAF5630A4EA554F799A0E8E0BFB5E02CBEF501ACA0F25B08631E4B4E15B8B0D9C87FF63B4D8760B70F0D35468FF2C2B0B854A1F092A7982AC48","orcidId":"0000-0001-9131-3552","documentHash":"f3d3fcea-3ba0-4a60-8701-f65b0e6b5d76"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-54105-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["logika prawnicza","prawo karne materialne","wykładnia językowa","spójniki","funktory prawdziwościowe","koniunkcja","dysjunkcja","alternatywa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["legal logic","substantive criminal law","linguistic interpretation","conjunctions","truth functors","conjunctions of alternatives","disjunction","conjunction"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcc3","uid":"bE0P3cRnJnpZ6fN9DrquQzA","uuid":"d8ce144a-93fb-4475-95d8-94e322e3a8fb","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcc3","parentUuid":"d8ce144a-93fb-4475-95d8-94e322e3a8fb","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcc3","rootUuid":"d8ce144a-93fb-4475-95d8-94e322e3a8fb","name":"Menedżerska Akademia Nauk Stosowanych w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63520429752340623bbf00f6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zastosowanie odpowiedników  słownych koniunkcji, alternatyw  i dysjunkcji w prawie karnym  materialnym - czy dyrektywa  języka powszechnego pozwala  na odstąpienie od ich znaczenia  przyjętego w logice prawniczej?","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9b17dad204581b62ebc15","mniswId":"201298","title":"Studia Społeczne","doi":null,"issn":"2081-0008","eissn":"2449-9714","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"486243fb-d1cc-4933-ae71-be99a01bcc79"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2024,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4808fdbe837dc75fc5d6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63520429752340623bbf00f6","67ab4808fdbe837dc75fc5d7"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem niniejszego artykułu jest wykazanie, że prawodawca niekoniecznie świadomie, a co za tym idzie – również niekonsekwentnie w procesie tworzenia prawa posługuje się spójnikami w ich znaczeniu przyjętym przez logikę prawniczą.

The article analyzes the legal rules in \nwhich correctly, as well as incorrectly, the legislator used conjunctions of alternatives, disjunctions and conjunction in the Criminal Code. A formal-dogmatic method was used, as well as an analytical method to demonstrate the thesis put forward, which is that it is sometimes necessary to refer to the directive of the common language in order not to derive absurd norms from the provisions in the process of their interpretation. The considerations referred to the rules in force in this regard expressed in the “Principles of Legislative Techniques”, as well as to the jurisprudence of the courts in cases of legal rules whose interpretation is controversial or disputed in the doctrine and judicature. The conclusions of the study confirm the thesis.

Given the insufficient antioxidant defense of spermatozoa against LPO, there is a rising interest in integrating additional additives into extenders to ameliorate mammalian semen quality. Among these additives, flavonoids have garnered considerable attention due to their potent antioxidative properties. Hence, our study aimed to assess the efficacy of flavone (FL) and 3-hydroxyflavone (3-OH = ) supplementation in the cryopreservation medium to protect canine sperm against the damaging impacts of freezing and ensure the preservation of their reproductive potential. Semen was collected from five Beagle stud dogs and then pooled. Then, the sample was divided into 7 groups, each treated with 1) 0 mM, 2) 0.1 mM FL, 3) 0.2 mM FL, 4) 0.4 mM FL, 5) 0.1 mM 3-OH = , 6) 0.2 mM 3-OH = , 7) 0.4 mM 3-OH = . Semen samples were subjected to cryopreservation in French straws and glycerol as a cryoprotectant. In the frozen thawed semen, sperm motility parameters by CASA system and sperm membrane integrity, acrosome status, mitochondrial activity, DNA fragmentation, early apoptosis with capacitation, and LPO were assessed using flow cytometry just after thawing (0 h) and 4 h post thaw. Results reveal significant increase in the proportion of live spermatozoa with undamaged acrosomes in the FL 0.1 and 3-OH = 0.2 groups at 0 h post thaw. At this time point, 3-OH = 0.1 significantly reduced the DNA fragmentation index (DFI) compared to the FL 0.1 and 0.2 groups. However, after the next 4 h, 3-OH = 0.4 exhibited the lowest (P < 0.05) DFI compared to FL 0.2 and 3-OH = 0.1. Additionally, 3-OH = 0.4 showed the highest (P < 0.05) proportion of non apoptotic and non capacitated spermatozoa compared to FL 0.1 0 h post-thaw. Simultaneously, the same group demonstrated significant reduction in apoptotic and capacitated sperm cells, at 0 h and 4 h post-thaw. Moreover, 3-OH = at 0.1 (0 h and 4 h) and 0.2 mM (4 h) significantly enhances the proportion of live sperm without LPO post thaw. Whitin the FL groups, only 0.4 FL significantly increased the percentage of live sperm without LPO. No significant effect of the tested substances was observed on sperm motility, cell membrane integrity, or mitochondrial activity. These findings highlight the promising role of flavone and 3-hydroxyflavone in enhancing sperm resilience during cryopreservation, suggesting their protective function against acrosome damages, capacitation, apoptosis and lipid peroxidation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060635605","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"226","pagesFromTo":"319-327","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093691X24002589?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3e6afdbe8362a5735765","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Niżański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f42b4a3b-0dc0-4b93-bda1-caf1026dc5eb"},{"objectId":"67ab3e6afdbe8362a5735764","name":"Michele","lastName":"Meco","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83f218e0-9422-47b9-ae84-312105e6b851"},{"objectId":"67ab3e6afdbe8362a5735763","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Kalinin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"33806b53-6e5c-44e6-a665-9d744c271213"},{"objectId":"67ab3e6afdbe8362a5735762","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Smalec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4847e94f-2fdf-409f-b1c9-8fd3cb2178c9"},{"objectId":"67ab3e6afdbe8362a5735761","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Ligocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3019a8df-d934-4d29-a787-46a9bf67edac"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af769","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Partyka","uuid":"6956953924569AAF5630A4EA554F799A0E8E0BFB5E02CBEF501ACA0F25B08631E4B4E15B8B0D9C87FF63B4D8760B70F0D35468FF2C2B0B854A1F092A7982AC48","orcidId":"0000-0001-9131-3552","documentHash":"f3d3fcea-3ba0-4a60-8701-f65b0e6b5d76"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394d4d","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Kostrzewa-Susłow","uuid":"CB57216B5086100EBF2D52F670F0607207FAC77275A41EFA1AAD3501471DBCA8414D60CECF9225E36D898B7B19D5DAED1DFDC1F566FE3FFF85CE78BDF3562AB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9259-0161","documentHash":"1d57b3d8-a7f8-4123-b1e6-a78080eeaf0a"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394d20","name":"Monika","lastName":"Dymarska","uuid":"8ED0079AC055E683BD5975C46837D53CA807D2900658ACCD19C3CB1463578DEFEE982B750BB922E862D70AB34464FCAA4C787B57253EE8E7E5DC551DDD18DFD9","orcidId":"0000-0002-2688-8883","documentHash":"fcea190d-b7be-4949-a50e-f8c387588a6f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2024.06.025"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","uid":"bm3qIJZlNw1U92UVKrOsP_w","uuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","parentUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","rootUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","name":"Uniwersytet
