These data are collected by the administration of a questionnaire made of items concerning different aspects related to the immigration phenomenon. For this analysis, we rely on a latent class approach considering a variety of models that allow for: (1) multidimensionality; (2) discreteness of the latent trait distribution; (3) time-constant and time-varying covariates; and (4) sample weights. Through these models we find latent classes of Europeans with similar levels of immigration acceptance and we study the effect of different socio-economic covariates on the probability of belonging to these classes for which we provide a specific interpretation. In this way we show which countries tend to be more or less positive toward immigration and we analyze the temporal dynamics of the phenomenon under study."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058053830","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c00f7540970702a66d54c6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"8ff81d1e-9983-4215-883f-10b89a1fe486"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"235-271","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11634-021-00479-y.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61de55062467f0772e364676","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Bartolucci","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7057-1421","documentHash":"ba7a8862-bf92-4059-b96c-fff29734c6fd"},{"objectId":"5e7092da878c28a04739e253","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Genge","uuid":"EC19F2D5E7C7A7E5DCEDAEBB861CC8CCEFDE1B3CDE5F7773A016B96390D05FEC48146F099245A7C1876B78092161DF499FD60075676AF7D18381B6CBDA34B6C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-8899-3697","documentHash":"8624394a-c1d4-4b91-bf84-ed9f6539a1b1"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11634-021-00479-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

methods based on environmental variables are useful in the planning of conservation strategies for species and ecosystems. However, there is a lack of work on the regionalization of the vast space of North Africa and the distribution of plant species. The current lists of endemic plants are focused mostly on an occurrence at the country level and not on regions with different conditions. The aim of this work was to lay out an environmental scheme for northwest Africa and to collect data about the occurrence of endemic plants in this area. Clustering with 12 of 33 tested environmental rasters was performed to divide the Maghreb into environmental clusters. Then, a list of 1618 endemic plant taxa (1243 species and 375 subspecies) was prepared and their distribution in estimated environmental clusters was examined. Eleven clusters with different conditions were estimated. The main drivers of regionalization were temperature amplitude, precipitation seasonality, and precipitation of the warmest quarter. According to the occurrence of endemic plants, northwest Africa may be divided into three zones: Atlas, Mediterranean (two environmental clusters), and southern zone (eight environmental clusters). The presented results provide a good basis for understanding the spatial patterns of the Maghreb, including its environment and species diversity. A designed list of endemic plant species together with environmental data may facilitate the planning of future research in north Africa and arranging methods of biodiversity protection."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058056200","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e2fc622467f035b526a783","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"194","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"037ef233-4c01-497a-98b7-1ac0e38816f9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"194","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09707-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e2fc622467f035b526a781","name":"Asma","lastName":"Taib","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9216-5045","documentHash":"4f87f432-6c40-4f15-b8b4-eeb9b9c56df5"},{"objectId":"609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Walas","uuid":"E1487E209BFE1859BC19AE81536E570F7441462D7640828646C2A178167548E2FAB950B628D6E3175BF4B9F287E730921BE7B613AC07554C874A38EDD7300CA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4060-9801","documentHash":"3b7fa0ae-0321-4b2a-ad87-b43027d64501"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10661-021-09707-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Atomization","Spray drying","Microencapsulation","Powder"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7f5a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Innovations in spray drying process for food and pharma industries","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454786f0","mniswId":"11139","title":"Journal of Food Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"0260-8774","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2dc7778f-c07c-42d5-93fc-4f4365c62ef7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fa61732467f013ba91fe77","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7f5a","6735a5c6fdbe83034962277f","6735a5c6fdbe830349622780","6735a5c6fdbe830349622781","6735a5c6fdbe830349622782","6735a5c6fdbe830349622783","6735a5c6fdbe830349622784","6735a5c6fdbe830349622785"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents a literature review on modifications and the latest achievements in the field of spray drying (SD). Although the history of this method of drying dates back to more than a hundred years ago, and in the case of many products, the process is widely recognized and does not create problems, many others are still looking for new design and technological solutions to reduce energy expenditure, improve the process flow and improve properties of received products. Since early development SD system has evolved in its construction, and currently there are numerous system modifications already available in the market, apart from other being on early implementation or laboratory stage. This paper begins with a brief background of SD and existing technologies. The main part of the paper is devoted for the description of less developed approaches. As was presented, the particular drawbacks of conventional SD system can be overcome by innovative approaches. It is hoped that these added-value features/technologies will find their place in industrial systems to boost the process performance and/or powders properties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058056228","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa61732467f013ba91fe82","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"321","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b4af2613-e548-4613-927a-9f66ce9d3a83"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"321","pagesFromTo":"110960","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735a5c6fdbe830349622785","name":"Seid Mahdi","lastName":"Jafari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b12bd80d-b8e0-4f84-a2ba-1e70c8ca9d36"},{"objectId":"6735a5c6fdbe830349622784","name":"Narjes","lastName":"Malekjani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56ed33a0-049b-412e-9d63-fd7c9513035e"},{"objectId":"6735a5c6fdbe830349622783","name":"Cordin","lastName":"Arpagaus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"427cad13-6394-4bfc-a319-4377e06bea2e"},{"objectId":"6735a5c6fdbe830349622782","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Jedlińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0014b9a-38c0-4781-851e-fab7d7f5201c"},{"objectId":"6735a5c6fdbe830349622781","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Barańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4b8e30eb-33c0-464e-a73f-887eb53d544b"},{"objectId":"6735a5c6fdbe830349622780","name":"Sadegh","lastName":"Poozesh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76174f66-d212-43bd-991c-e6431882206a"},{"objectId":"6735a5c6fdbe83034962277f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Samborska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"80d4b7fd-fdbd-4799-8e89-7bef208e82d1"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7f5a","name":"Mariia","lastName":"Sobulska","uuid":"E8BB654F768AD237C1697E27741CE6B429A6628C61E8AE35591662041452ECA60E73E36A21D5379B2AFFF2DD87EA0B6EE1EF9CBBCE7EF8A8AA7CF4DA9B4847AE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4802-8315","documentHash":"1712f6b8-83d2-46bf-932e-b4bc6e927f4b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2022.110960"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Association Agreement","European Union","Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement","Foreign Direct Investment","World Trade Organization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5efdacfcad49b30c585f269d","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Daugavpils University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61fac7b12467f013ba96e87a"]},{"id":"6114df532467f0124f243eb8","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61fac7b12467f013ba96e87b"]},{"id":"5e709198878c28a04737ff3a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Rīgas Stradiņa universitāte (Riga Stradins University)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61fac7b12467f013ba96e878"]},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737fa36","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Великотърновски университет \"Св. св.

The authors focus on Georgia’s recent economic performance, including Association Agreement (AA) with the European Union that contributed powerfully to stabilising Georgia's trade legislation and reinforcing domestic economic reform. The Association Agreement between Georgia and the European Union and its member States aims at Georgia's gradual economic integration into the EU Internal Market, through the establishment of the DCFTA, which should provide for far-reaching market access based on sustained and regulatory approximation.\nThe study reveals the importance of the World Trade Organization, main trade agreements and arrangements with Georgia as a developing country. It demonstrates that effective trade stabilization in the WTO can be achieved by the implementation of specific WTO’s regulations on trade, economic and legal spheres.\nOne of the reasons for the special success of the WTO is systemic exceptions for developed countries and states with special needs (country like Georgia) that contributes to the development of international trade through progressive liberalization and the comparative advantage of the states when carrying out trade. \nThe example of Georgia shows very well that so far the country has not been able to actively apply all the advantages that can be used within the framework of international or regional organizations, at least for the simple reason that the country does not possess the appropriate infrastructure for bringing innovative products to foreign markets, and thus accumulate more economic wealth. \nThis case study evidences and confirms that while the accession process to the WTO is challenging per se, it is part of a process of domestic reforms that triggers growth and economic benefits."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058056259","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa60082467f013ba91ef32","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"1","doi":"10.46656/access.2022.3.1","documentHash":"a6044670-a20b-44e0-838d-dce520ed45f1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"43-52","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journal.access-bg.org/journalfiles/journal/issue-3-1-2022/4-transformation_of_georgia’s_trade_policy_strategy-from_frailty_to_sustainability%20.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61fac7b12467f013ba96e87b","name":"Vladas","lastName":"Tumalavicius","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0811-0074","documentHash":"b5dc0676-650b-46e7-90d0-dca1b3d8c4f0"},{"objectId":"61fac7b12467f013ba96e87a","name":"Vitolds","lastName":"Zahars","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1100-0519","documentHash":"7dafc55c-0f34-44b4-9bab-c2bef9878cfe"},{"objectId":"61fac7b12467f013ba96e879","name":"Mariana","lastName":"Petrova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1531-4312","documentHash":"e21122f2-dabe-4330-8cb0-d056fdc08c48"},{"objectId":"61fac7b12467f013ba96e878","name":"Giga","lastName":"Abuseridze","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2868-8719","documentHash":"f862c906-6c64-4d8f-be37-49a66bd37ed2"}],"doi":"10.46656/access.2022.3.1(4)"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Large Facilities and Cultural Heritage","Archaeometry & Portable Instruments","Conservation and Restoration","Monitoring of Cultural Heritage","Natural & Anthropogenic Hazards","3D survey, models & GIS","Applied Geophysics","Linking Sciences and Humanities"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-3-030-60015-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Handbook of Cultural Heritage Analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":2256,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fadea02467f013ba974eeb","editors":[{"objectId":"61fadea02467f013ba974eed","name":"Valentina","lastName":"Venuti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d6d91fca-ab83-4845-8651-3eb2bcd25d9a"},{"objectId":"61fadea02467f013ba974eec","name":"Sebastiano","lastName":"D'Amico","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3392859-faf3-4b70-ad27-4a1dd211ecfe"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["61fadea02467f013ba974eec","61fadea02467f013ba974eed"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This Handbook covers non-invase techniques as well as digital technologies to study cultural heritage.

We generalize the previous results and propose a quantum circuit for simulation of a general two qubit X-state, implement it on the same quantum device, and study its entanglement for several values of the extended parameter space. We also show that their X-shape is approximately robust against noisy quantum gates. To further physically motivate this study, we invoke the two-spin Heisenberg XYZ system and show that for a wide class of initial states, it leads to dynamical density matrices which are X-states. Due to the symmetries of this Hamiltonian, we show that by only two qubits, one can simulate the dynamics of this system on the IBM quantum

main issue in the presented research is the United Arab Emirates’ foreign aid commitment, the development of its brand, and its position in international relations. The study’s purpose is to find an answer to a research question, specifically, what is the UAE foreign aid role and significance for the Soft Power Strategy implementation and the Sustainable Development Goals? The author adopted appropriate theories and research methods. Role theory has been applied, allowing for the combination of different tools. Moreover, there is a close connection between the state adapting tochanges in its political environment and its position and role in international relations. Therefore, the theory of adaptation has also been included. To verify the theoretical assumptions, the author implemented a comparative analysis using empirical research and case studies. In addition, the author’s ten-year participation in many UAE international policy processes was useful. The paper shows United Arab Emirates foreign aid as a fundamental element of supporting branding, filling the Sustainable Development Goals, and influencing international relations. In the twenty-first century, UAE foreign aid became a pillar of state foreign policy, making it possible to shape the international environment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058056419","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"48","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/11/2/48/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac86d","name":"Adam","lastName":"Krzymowski","uuid":"101EA69F03A977E963D372D5384F0716CE380DA8359A7E3089E4AA57632B2CE03B8EF8E85C6A19A0AC13FD148D14920499941829DA270379EEB7BA2DFC7DF84E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9296-6387","documentHash":"18b5cc14-a6ed-4eb8-a283-74394d27ae67"}],"doi":"10.3390/socsci11020048"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika

The limitations of these methods were also indicated in unpredictable situations, such as the outbreak of an economic crisis, e.g., caused by a humanitarian crisis—the COVID-19 pandemic. Another aim chosen in the article is a methodological critical assessment of the phenomenon of widespread use of foreign models (including the common Altman method) in the study of the risk of bankruptcy of Polish enterprises. Models developed on a sample of foreign enterprises without prior adaptation to domestic conditions are used all over the world, so the conclusions of the article are applicable internationally. The research was based on a query of Polish and foreign literature in the field of economic and legal aspects of bankruptcy and financial analysis, including, in particular, bankruptcy forecasting. The empirical research analyzes the financial data of 50 Polish enterprises from 2017 to 2018. The effectiveness of the selected bankruptcy forecasting models in identifying enterprises from section C of the Polish economy (industrial processing) that filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and 2019 was tested. The time frame fully allows for the identification and the assessment of the effectiveness of early warning models a year before bankruptcy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058056563","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fb93ff2467f07d34e5186a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"d3d4148c-c0e7-4539-8595-b86123c9d1ed"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1416","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/su14031416","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709466878c28a0473bc24a","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"LICHOTA","uuid":"D96132E819FC4669FC41B3D53F9D67C95564FA3B80D910A7CBBD8B4290ED736D5D1FFEF2A75D4E7E25D29FA46D27833555E0A2829A3533BFBEC36DC60220F2DC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5059-3439","documentHash":"d5872287-713b-4f2a-bdb3-93ebaa909376"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c40a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kowal-Pawul","uuid":"E5356834D3FD03D4B6ACECA38B617BC5523EE4EAD451E81059FF4C508791DC935E03E61CBC17F0F6DFFEF458C1FA234FA90CB6632F47FC783CABE54C241F8DC8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3303-0348","documentHash":"549b7e40-c771-4ecb-ba8f-d8dc77feb395"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa58","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Kitowski","uuid":"7C65A2419B2BBC61D963DDEC2E3815A371F3461E3F10B9A59E489E30C05167B52AD7C5D8DA1F80977DBE0CA786AB8D1B4B7130E92E8B68FF39BEEC61132FE9A2","orcidId":"0000-0001-9881-1271","documentHash":"23db2f92-92d4-4b9a-b58d-66a176f7f967"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14031416"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Stenichnini","Far East","taxonomy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391497"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Euconnus Thomson of Japan: redescriptions of species established by Reitter, Sharp and Franz, new synonyms, and summary of current state of knowledge (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Scydmaeninae)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b53","mniswId":"20563","title":"Zootaxa","doi":null,"issn":"1175-5326","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f5d28097-0095-4a2f-bf8d-8a5134ccde22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fa6b292467f066d6555e99","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922e878c28a047391497"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To date, twenty-seven valid species names in the Stenichnini genus Euconnus Thomson have been recognized in the fauna of Japan.

though electric vehicles (EV) were invented over a century ago, their popularity has grown significantly within the last 10 years due to the development of Li-ion battery technology. This evolution created an increase in the fire risk and hazards associated with this type of high-energy battery. This review focuses on lessons learned from electric vehicle fires and fire risk mitigation measures for passenger road vehicles partially or fully powered by Li-ion batteries. The paper presents EV fire risks, as well as historical car fires, published large-scale fire tests, and some proposed fire protection strategies in the aspect of electromobility safety for the future. Technical solutions for EV fire hazard mitigation are discussed, and methods of performance-based analysis and simulations for fire safety in car park evaluation are demonstrated. The Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) was used for the CFD simulations for the prediction of smoke dispersion and temperature distribution during an EV fire. The presented case study demonstrates how fire simulations could predict conditions for the safe evacuation of people and Fire Brigade intervention conditions in the case of an EV fire in a car park."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058056694","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dfbab92467f034397808da","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"ac825b9d-29dd-4f3b-b5d6-69c6fe40156f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"[1-18]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735a66efdbe830349629067","name":"Paul","lastName":"Bryant","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c209805e-d8a9-4476-bcaa-a8c1fcb722cf"},{"objectId":"5e709334878c28a0473a4e4d","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Brzezińska","uuid":"8C1F4E64C0137EEBCB9DB2D0C1B3A53AC24D18BA3F11D8D4F58097F21FC19F77A0420B08B452EFC6B8156159FB18415DB3DB4FC287A0667E3EECA2A06AAF2726","orcidId":"0000-0003-4615-4454","documentHash":"9b7b11e6-409d-4be6-b0d9-588fa3ce057d"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15020649"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tourism","innovation","research model","innovation activity","small and medium sized enterprises"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5efda1d8ad49b30c585f2643","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Information Systems Management Institute (ISMA), Riga, Latvia","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61fab7bb2467f013ba969580"]},{"id":"61fab7bb2467f013ba96957e","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Sh.

However, it is not only the innovation activity of enterprises that is relevant, but also the research models of such activity. This article deals with innovation activity model and its implementation in practice. We can consider a research model as a program or plan of research. It can be represented both in a diagram based and a descriptive form. It offers the possibility to link theory and empirical data obtained in the course of scientific research, and also enables their subsequent interpretation. \nIn order to develop a model for innovation activity research in small and medium sized enterprises, analysis of theoretical and empirical methods of scientific research in tourism was carried out. A number of theoretical methods, such as formulation of a hypothesis, assimilation, analysis and others were used as the basis for the model. However, the model is basically built on the empirical method, namely, the method of sociological survey. The model under discussion was tested in 2019 and later applied again in 2020. The number of respondents taking part in the survey were 69 tourism companies (56.9%) in 2019, and 71 (58.5%) in 2020. The geography of the use of the research model can also be expanded.

The single crystal X-ray crystallography validated the bidentate mode of coordination of the benzhydrazone ligand and pseudo-octahedral geometry around ruthenium ion. MTT assay has been performed to assess the in vitro growth of cancer cell inhibition ability of all the complexes against MCF-7(breast carcinoma), HuH-7 (hepatocellular carcinoma), and HeLa (cervical cancer), along with non-cancerous L132 (human lung epithelium) cell lines. It has been found that all the six complexes exhibit good to excellent cytotoxicity toward the cancer cell lines tested with low IC50 values compared to cisplatin. Among the synthesized complexes, complex 6 shows potential cytotoxicity against all the cancer cell lines. The observed higher cytotoxicity of the complex 6 may be due to the electron donating methoxy group of the ligand and hydrophobic character of arene moiety. Eventually, the staining techniques such as AO-EB, HOECHST 33342, RH-123, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) establish that all the complexes bring about cell death via apoptosis. The present research results emphasize the more possibility to promote potential arene ruthenium anticancer agents."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058056748","journalIssue":{"objectId":"634914804097072ef287c6f4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"70610531-0025-4963-ba83-1f6d067efd4d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"36","pagesFromTo":"e6512","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/aoc.6512","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61fb9fc42467f07d34e55317","name":"Antony

methodology of analysis and evaluation of the selected indices of the helicopter readiness used in the Polish Navy is presented in this paper. These objects are the multi-purpose helicopters of the Polish and Russian production, performing mainly the rescue tasks. A mathematical model was based on the source databases covering a period of 2 years, which were developed in the form of the multi-format MS Excel spreadsheets. While considering the operating environment and a specificity of the performed tasks, an event-based model of the operation process was proposed in this paper, which enables to evaluate selected indices of readiness. Due to the specificity of the individual types of renovations and repairs, the calculated measures of the readiness were enabled in a multi-faceted manner, that is, they were referred to three separate operating periods covering the current operating period, the entire (i.e. two-year) studying period including extended renovations and the entire studying period including extended renovations and repairs. A broader approach enabled to calculate the functional and technical indices of the readiness of the helicopter."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058056898","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09544100211069180","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6160fea975234017e050de03","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Konwerski","uuid":"8BF91A940C2315F0637868F3C3636DA9BA1A1A55DAA582F5F873A93490B761DAD74018373975839B70536BEF92B6FCB94D1ED1F6B92FF0C53CB3687AC47AD35B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"69baa4c7-56f1-4f91-8796-4b934fa25a2f"},{"objectId":"604214109543c711bc6ea93e","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Oszczypała","uuid":"9A232F4C32D57C535AFE11C80FD495995E0272193FC7136EBCF2A896C14BCDF8B89C8E792BC82D43468A998836CA8418FFF97371E92906E376A86F6A36963BBE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1194-6913","documentHash":"108866e1-7b17-411d-a40a-9f40eb4b866f"},{"objectId":"604213699543c711bc6ea93d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szkutnik-Rogoż","uuid":"6AC2636430F3C09DDF8616D4B56996D9F44D1677DB7C4039CCD4FE062548B1BBEB0D4CDBC19FE3DB9BF4764DEB5626E6DC0211299DCB34064E2B28759DB83760","orcidId":"0000-0001-9568-2291","documentHash":"71d095ab-bfdf-4a53-ab07-3932db9a009f"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473994ad","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Małachowski","uuid":"3E941695DC452C902F05F04536C9F22A559B4EAA42A7F60E8216A3F4163C5AD5FEBE65D0B11D6290B37BD440458745982BA3E18BEBF4F90B058CBF96A19A8F5F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1300-8020","documentHash":"a691bdd4-e5e6-4d8a-8b79-096a648005d5"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398ed8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Ziółkowski","uuid":"E5DAA1AD6DDED8D2209DB93108F9403DA9E0FED6CCF60FA8703424347F42346A4D8D7A28C136C69397E8E0F589B739037417F387027C896B4C78F6398D687E84","orcidId":"0000-0001-8880-5142","documentHash":"51f1d2b2-7100-4550-b123-9c96e92ab1e5"}],"doi":"10.1177/09544100211069180"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alpine","biodiversity

turnover is ubiquitous. However, it remains unknown whether certain types of species are consistently gained or lost across different habitats. Here, we analysed the trajectories of 1827 plant species over time intervals of up to 78 years at 141 sites across mountain summits, forests, and lowland grasslands in Europe. We found, albeit with relatively small effect sizes, displacements of smaller- by larger-ranged species across habitats. Communities shifted in parallel towards more nutrient-demanding species, with species from nutrient-rich habitats having larger ranges. Because these species are typically strong competitors, declines of smaller-ranged species could reflect not only abiotic drivers of global change, but also biotic pressure from increased competition. The ubiquitous component of turnover based on species range size we found here may partially reconcile findings of no net loss in local diversity with global species loss, and link community-scale turnover to macroecological processes such as biotic homogenisation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058058900","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6220d6ec2467f004a5a88438","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"25","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"4fbe0ad4-69b3-4ac7-a430-de17a25ec6d2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"466-482","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.13937","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61de9c872467f0772e42705a","name":"Lander","lastName":"Baeten","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4262-9221","documentHash":"b604ab2b-9771-4ca2-bbe0-c27f18d8f5c3"},{"objectId":"61de9c872467f0772e427059","name":"Manuela","lastName":"Winkler","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8655-9555","documentHash":"57e0a5d1-3f0c-41c4-b336-ea5b4cd5f5a6"},{"objectId":"61de9c872467f0772e427058","name":"Pascal","lastName":"Vittoz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73215b4d-ab1f-4148-a8ea-cb6aa8d920f2"},{"objectId":"61de9c872467f0772e427057","name":"Luis","lastName":"Villar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a295d265-3768-46b9-9bcd-b3816933512b"},{"objectId":"61de9c872467f0772e427056","name":"Ondřej","lastName":"Vild","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0728-2392","documentHash":"810f347d-d022-42df-b3dd-a2b37496f463"},{"objectId":"61de9c872467f0772e427055","name":"Philippine","lastName":"Vergeer","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3978-2313","documentHash":"08570791-93e8-4652-8a2e-39d3b7b05b82"},{"objectId":"61de9c872467f0772e427054","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Vanneste","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5296-917X","documentHash":"1efb6312-dbd0-48a9-8b7e-48e58a3a57ac"},{"objectId":"61de9c872467f0772e427053","name":"Tudor‐Mihai","lastName":"Ursu","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4898-6345","documentHash":"7b1e3d75-f32b-4e67-b57e-9e2c91ca9672"},{"objectId":"61de9c872467f0772e427051","name":"Pavel

demand for dairy products has changed significantly in recent years. Globalization, urbanization, and changing lifestyles with increasing number of consumers with higher incomes in developing countries keep pushing demand for innovative dairy products. The current trend observed on the dairy market regarding healthy products forces producers to increase the variety of premium and specialty products. Consumers are more aware nowadays of health benefits of dairy products and require controlled quality, convenience (e.g., on-the-go dairy), extended shelf life, and eco-friendly products. To meet these growing requirements, manufacturers are introducing product innovations to the market, as well as modern packaging. Beside the typical packaging functions like protection, containment, communication, marketing, and ergonomics novel packaging should also have an active role. As dairy products are highly perishable, they require proper packaging in order to protect and prolong shelf life of the product inside. Among different types of packaging, active and intelligent packaging is a powerful tool, alongside with novel packaging materials (e.g., paper-based, bioplastics). Moreover, novel packaging can be a tool for detecting food fraud, but also facilitates traceability. This review will cover potential use of smart packaging with indicators (e.g., gas/integrity, freshness, time-temperature), antimicrobial coatings, data carriers, sensors in dairy packaging."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058058921","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"127-164","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-7196-8_6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e5ee","name":"Marta","lastName":"Biegańska","uuid":"B0456A0D147157C5E63C44CF0D994E9D04F9750754B46965EE80AEC805CE46F071E7EDA6A60884F37878B49EDA84F15BFC0DCF5F633FC7BB51927892BD32EBB8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3001-4879","documentHash":"5e018796-d607-451a-8368-2a1000c82998"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-981-16-7196-8_6"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Teorie rynku pracy","Osoby z niepełnosprawnoącią"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"9788362336678","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6c","uid":"bNIma-c7hgSlWoEQ6HZkccg","uuid":"ce192410-f971-477b-8451-69e8d63b5f18","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6c","parentUuid":"ce192410-f971-477b-8451-69e8d63b5f18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6c","rootUuid":"ce192410-f971-477b-8451-69e8d63b5f18","name":"Akademia Nauk Stosowanych w Elblągu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f89340c085dcb410a25f06c"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Zatrudnienie wspomagane : teoria i praktyka","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":217,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fd186d2467f02a1f8ae731","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f89340c085dcb410a25f06c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058058997","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5e71072946e0fb0001b922b6","mniswId":null,"name":"Państwowa Wyższa Szkoła Zawodowa w Elblągu","documentHash":"b8725cb3-817f-41f3-9b32-4d1f3f7b5f90"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://bu.pwsz.elblag.pl/sowacgi.php?KatID=0&typ=repl&plnk=q__grablewski&sort=bytitle&view=1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f89340c085dcb410a25f06c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grablewski","uuid":"2505823C16F79A5D966F37FC86BC4F8BBD76AE1728875FE44A14BEA572C4115A74A8AE57172EE278BB49EF2822011B5763EA4DB71878A81DF5D5FAF69C8C5B4E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b524ebe-66ec-425c-86ff-529a71073769"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Existence analysis","Dynamic analysis","Regular equations","Periodic solutions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709214878c28a04738fab5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Existence results for damped regular equations under periodic or Neumann boundary conditions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478857","mniswId":"11769","title":"Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications","doi":null,"issn":"0022-247X","eissn":"1096-0813","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"84d3d88d-1443-4885-ae45-8a6d81d9a876"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fbd5832467f07d34e8b81f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61fbd5832467f07d34e8b821","61fbd5832467f07d34e8b822","61fbd5832467f07d34e8b823","5e709214878c28a04738fab5"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a version of the averaging and a method to construct lower and upper solutions in the reversed order that are suitable for both the periodic and the Neumann boundary conditions.

study established the relationship between macroeconomic policy coordination and business cycle synchronization, considering a dynamic panel framework that accounts for model uncertainty and reverse

The results show that uncoordinated fiscal policy is a source of idiosyncratic shocks, but coordinated monetary policy leads to business cycle divergence. Furthermore, ongoing monetary integration is going to be associated with lower business cycle synchronization. Establishing fiscal union can mitigate this effect by eliminating a source of asymmetric shocks associated with fiscal policy differences, and provide a substitute for independent monetary policy in the form of interregional transfers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059064","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1-20","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/boer.12334","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bf878c28a0473b01de","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Beck","uuid":"94A4FCF0D2EC5209227F0678193CBDB075F4E469793180547AADBEC7951B255FD22527E9600BA0F5467AEFD99AF9BB589E9C00E04ED3A5A86E92BD3ED4308349","orcidId":"0000-0003-3679-2962","documentHash":"07aebf2f-61f5-4cd6-b332-07218af2efbd"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709228878c28a047390d30"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Parents' Knowledge and Attitude towards HPV and HPV Vaccination in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d596","mniswId":"20030","title":"Vaccines","doi":null,"issn":"2076-393X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"926968ce-701e-4099-afd9-d226880c5415"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fd2b4f2467f02a1f8bbb9a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709419878c28a0473b63e5","5e70923a878c28a04739211a","5e709228878c28a047390d30","5e70925f878c28a047394903"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"HPV is one of the diseases of civilization that causes cervical cancer, among other diseases. For this reason, a vaccination program has been introduced worldwide for preadolescent, sexually inactive seronegative girls. However, the decision to vaccinate young girls must be made by the parents. In Poland, vaccinations are recommended but not financed by the government, which affects their choices, and there is insufficient knowledge of the diseases caused by genital HPV types. In addition, there are cultural, social, and even religious factors to be considered. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyze the state of knowledge about HPV and HPV vaccines among parents. Two hundred and eighty-eight parents participated in the study, but only 180 of them declared that they had ever heard of HPV (62.5%). Therefore, only these parents completed the entire questionnaire consisting of 34 questions. The parents’ answers were analyzed with the Fisher’s and chi-squared tests. The study showed that parents’ knowledge of HPV and HPV vaccination in Poland is low (49.4% of correct answers). Parents’ attitudes were only influenced by knowledge and education and not by other parameters such as age, gender, place of residence, and the number of children. This study indicates that parents need to be educated about the threats of HPV and the possibilities of prophylactic vaccination."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059077","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fd2b4f2467f02a1f8bbba1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"24eef60d-60d0-40ac-8c37-cf8d22e5d329"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"228","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/2/228","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b63e5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Smolarczyk","uuid":"5D39419B482E2E8A5031AA6A3795828106621AC20B3D67D4A8C6A8DE2C4BEF91B940CC8CB1344048C9FB6CAFB5A5482A8D6E6DE4B8E429F19ABC69304F0EBEDF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46ac6ac8-6ef9-4b95-90c2-5f9e187a2aa8"},{"objectId":"5e70925f878c28a047394903","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Majewski","uuid":"C569C44CE2C3CD1217DCA1473B5A8D4ED9A331265BE61DC9E87B073C0D89B7F31D940235E207FE4A614F1329C5B92BC279EE590B7BDD33060D52BEBB04AC1C80","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f543cb7e-1509-467e-8ce9-c101d96307c7"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a04739211a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Duszewska","uuid":"97C4F555DFD02A8D6B64521F249293C5DC50DF85777C777708A12320712FF70BE5ABD1269201AD1F7DCCC4702AD1B957FACF4263CF81D94218F6F4634E8D2268","orcidId":"0000-0003-3336-9667","documentHash":"7bae74cc-e76e-44e3-98db-ab626b0fe481"},{"objectId":"5e709228878c28a047390d30","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Drozd","uuid":"07AB0D56A841DBC1FACE210A2DA4FE3D308B09F30759FF15D499207A56F40A9F31A26E6DCDA7480251A2C21AF3219C71EAD682846523BF57EE368B4465BB94D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3939-8194","documentHash":"78e1dbcd-9863-47ec-bc08-86a3208cdf09"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["folic acid","Monosaccharides","Hydrogen bonded associates","Supramolecular chemistry"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709420878c28a0473b6c1a","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b3878c28a04739afe8"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f6ea29543c7410626f49a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hydrogen-bonded supramolecular assemblies of folic acid with simple hexoses","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788b4","mniswId":"11918","title":"Journal of Molecular Structure","doi":null,"issn":"0022-2860","eissn":"1872-8014","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-molecular-structure/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"4bff2014-656e-441f-955f-ddef373955b2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-11-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61de9d872467f0772e42e2bd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b3878c28a04739afe8","5e709420878c28a0473b6c1a","602f6ea29543c7410626f49a","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Simple D-hexoses such as D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-galactose were found to form supramolecular complexes with folic acid (FA) in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS, pH 7.4) and in the gas phase.

It also includes connective tissue disorders, like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) or systemic sclerosis (SSc). This highly heterogeneous group of conditions has multifactorial and not fully understood etiology. It is characterized by the presence of persistent inflammation affecting primarily the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue. Disease progression ultimately leads to organ damage, functional disability, premature mortality, as well as economic and social burdens. Rheumatoid arthritis and SpA represent the most common IRD. The management of RA, and other forms of IRD, has dramatically changed in the last 20 years with the development of targeted therapeutic agents, namely biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD) and targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tsDMARD). However, a substantial proportion of patients still exhibits an inadequate response, does not achieve remission, or develop undesirable side effects (1).

At the same time, it highlights the issues and prospects for linking the laboratory research to the market. In addition to typical packaging requirements such as food quality, shelf life, protection, communication, and marketing, the book emphasizes the need for novel packaging materials, including biodegradable packaging for a variety of food products. A wide range of food products has been kept in focus and includes animal-based food products such as dairy products and sea foods.\r\nThe book presents the next level of packaging solutions i.e., smart packaging with the applications of potential tools such as intelligent and active packaging, and includes the latest research on emerging digital technologies for packaging development, assessment, and acceptability. It further highlights the strategies including blends, reinforcing agents, cold plasma, UV light applications, chemical, and enzymatic methods and explores the new opportunities leading to improvement in the packaging performance.

Oil-in-water dispersions with alkaline pH were prepared by a two-step homogenization procedure containing paraffin wax, with various characteristics, the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis product or beeswax. The size of the dispersed particles determined by dynamic light scattering depended on the type of hydrophobic base used and was in the range of 350–440 nm. The ability of dispersion particles in aggregation driven by electrostatic attraction, evaluated by Zeta potential analysis by electrophoretic light scattering, was from −26 to −50 mV. Static multiply light scattering was used for 30 days of stability assessment and helped to select the dispersion with a Sarawax SX70 wax base as the most stable. Dispersions were further used for coating the backing of kraft paper by the Meyer rod method. Coated paper with an applied coating of 6 g/m2 had very good hydrophobic properties (Cobb60 &lt; 4 g/m2), sufficient strength properties, and air permeation, which enabled its application as a packaging material. The dispersions based on Sarawax SX70 wax were evaluated as the best coating for Mondi ProVantage Kraftliner 125 g/m2 backing paper. Good hydrophobic properties and strength properties indicate the possibility of using the SX70-based wax dispersion coating as a replacement for PFAS coatings in some applications.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059178","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f3da412467f061bc10e18c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"a0dda249-25df-4f6c-bb49-6666d6edee45"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/3/930","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61fce8db2467f02a1f897f6e","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Przybysz","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2044-6790","documentHash":"8914c73e-8575-482f-8156-a0c7e3df89da"},{"objectId":"61fce8db2467f02a1f897f6d","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Iłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"355f5d16-8b9e-4f8b-abc7-5fb0ff91d57f"},{"objectId":"61fce8db2467f02a1f897f6c","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Chrobak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0baa762e-5a5e-44e9-bc41-8067fbce2702"},{"objectId":"61fce8db2467f02a1f897f6b","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dubowik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a010613-0309-49f1-9fd8-b85e93ffed7e"},{"objectId":"61fce8db2467f02a1f897f6a","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Lipkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5bc455b-7557-42e3-bfce-fdd4f08941e0"},{"objectId":"61fce8db2467f02a1f897f69","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Korasiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6058-279X","documentHash":"7351c9f0-81af-42be-8c7f-32716e77f016"},{"objectId":"61fce8db2467f02a1f897f68","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Małachowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0068c00-5272-4d29-9322-1b19e9898877"},{"objectId":"61fce8db2467f02a1f897f67","name":"Julia","lastName":"Woch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6929ce16-2e05-432d-a909-103822a3eac8"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27030930"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Komentarz prawny","Obowiązek rejestracji dzienników i czasopism","Media społecznościowe","Media publiczne","Cenzura","Środki masowego przekazu","Prawo autorskie","Prawo prasowe","Wolność mediów","Wolność słowa","Polska","Reklama"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-8235-523-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709429878c28a0473b771b","5e709239878c28a047391e9b"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Prawo mediów","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":250,"publicationPlace":"Warszawa, Polska","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fcd4222467f0429791889f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709429878c28a0473b771b","5e709239878c28a047391e9b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Najważniejsze zagadnienia związane z funkcjonowaniem szeroko rozumianych mediów: prasy, telewizji, radia i Internetu.\r\nW podręczniku omówiono:\r\n\r\nzasadę wolności wypowiedzi,\r\nregulacje dotyczące funkcjonowania nadawców radiowych i telewizyjnych, w tym dostawców audiowizualnych usług medialnych na żądanie,\r\nprzekaz medialny w mediach,\r\nochronę dóbr osobistych w działalności mediów oraz\r\nodpowiedzialności za treści medialne.\r\nPoruszono także takie zagadnienia jak ochrona dzieci przed szkodliwymi dla nich treściami dostępnymi w mediach czy nowe zjawiska związane z mediami: trolling, postprawdę, fake news, deepfakes.\r\n\r\nRozwój nowych technologii powoduje powstawanie nowych zjawisk, a otoczenie technologiczne podlega ciągłym i dynamicznym zmianom.

These symptoms are strongly linked to social norms and roles traditionally assigned to men. The aim of this study was to assess the interrelationship of early maladaptive schemas that affect the formation of self-image as a man with indicators of male depression. Materials and methods: The Gender-Sensitive Depression Screening (GSDS-26) by A.M. Möller-Leimkühler and the Early Maladaptive Schema Questionnaire by J. Young (YSQ-S3-PL) were used. A group of 75 men (aged 18 to 50) were qualified to take part in the research. Results: The total score of the GSDS-26 scale and individual indicators of male depression are strongly positively correlated with the severity of all five domains of the YSQ-S3-PL questionnaire. The highest correlation coefficient value was obtained in the following areas: “Disconnection and rejection” (0.741), “Other-directedness” (0.711), and “Overvigilance and inhibition” (0.711). In case of the GSDS-26 total score and the following indicators—Elevated stress, Aggressiveness, Emotional control, Risky behavior, and Classic symptoms of depression—positive statistically significant associations were confirmed with each of the 18 schemas from the YSQ-S3-PL questionnaire. Multiple regression results revealed that the following domains were significant for symptoms typical of male depression: “Disconnection and rejection” and “Impaired autonomy and performance”. The “Impaired limits” area was found to be statistically significant only for symptoms of classic depression. Conclusions: (1) The GSDS-26 scale scores show positive associations with each domain of the YSQ-S3-PL questionnaire. (2) The following areas seem to be more important for atypical depressive symptoms in men: “Disconnection and rejection” and “Impaired autonomy and performance”, while for classic depression: “Impaired limits” was more important. (3) In therapeutic work with male depressive symptoms, it is useful to focus on dominant maladaptive schemas alongside beliefs about stereotypical male roles"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059266","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/12/2/167","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656da87d40970749a862d110","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Wydrzyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a82a993-a01d-4d2c-9405-0dfa7fc43da5"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e96d","name":"Monika","lastName":"Talarowska","uuid":"A86456D892F2D67C7B2CE404B164DFAE334D1A254549C9D7F28A18FAB52EC06850403ABF004E9DFFB920D08488FBE3EE4BB3795AAE0815D62D170A9160663AF6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3451-1250","documentHash":"be4eac36-53ae-4f70-8783-667c920f79c3"},{"objectId":"5e70920f878c28a04738f40e","name":"Jan","lastName":"Chodkiewicz","uuid":"683B28CE4ABFAE26C30A3944EB79DB9F8B18E669320A568946041259485A397B6268EEA372A842217935ABE82FE5774524DEFF93506E9E98E8769FB4F6D9A7DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-5613-3473","documentHash":"54e891c8-b40c-4859-8baf-777f2a8a02a1"}],"doi":"10.3390/life12020167"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["split Hopkinson pressure bar","high strain-rate shearing","ballistic resistance","armor","steels"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e178","uid":"bNsOc8LWMO-rYhuDMGKqClg","uuid":"b276c277-c4c6-4376-befd-8461236490bd","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Mechatroniki, Uzbrojenia i Lotnictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b338f","5e7092a4878c28a047399c77"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"ESTIMATION OF BALLISTIC PERFORMANCE OF ARMOR STEELS BASED ON THE SPLIT HOPKINSON SHEAR BAR DATA","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b82","mniswId":"13032","title":"Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics","doi":null,"issn":"1429-2955","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"e547bbb9-6d22-4cbc-ad3a-32913c6f0b66"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-01-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fccb2d2467f02a1f881950","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ef878c28a0473c73f6","5e7092a4878c28a047399c77","5e7093ea878c28a0473b338f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents a method of assessing of ballistic resistance of four armor steels based on the results of shear tests under dynamic load conditions.

The SSED parameter takes the highest average value for the armor steel with the highest ballistic resistance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059275","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"60","pagesFromTo":"129-140","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://jtam.pl/Estimation-of-ballistic-performance-of-armor-steels-based-on-the-split-Hopkinson,144793,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ef878c28a0473c73f6","name":"Marek","lastName":"Walicki","uuid":"E682A71634552C7AA55D93B05C0D23536381EAEEC96FC2D30B2BFFF5DE6A94FAA732341C5DD1297B53A938DFB5FD5A81E7B6DB5B52220C8DAE598848D83F5DDD","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e93cbd9-bc64-4f77-8f54-a2ff4e777006"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b338f","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Cieplak","uuid":"CE4B5BCDFD6825F340A89B7D01D11AEC17A64B76204271006C9BAE9BA01CE86E77356A02145A979A66BF5E9DE8BFE898E237E1D986CF4A8C97B6F1E008BC4A42","orcidId":"0000-0002-0825-2689","documentHash":"e9a7c6ed-6f95-4cba-90b8-f78e9ca578ed"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c77","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Janiszewski","uuid":"8FD740D533C583F36AC424EC3868CC5426EA97B245CCAB60F43B78334CE9A3E91F55D8C0961ADF0190BC35919FE0CD2ACC078A9E688623B2097C2FB068BD70B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3783-8774","documentHash":"5a2c5974-d598-4fd5-9cdb-f81e45fbca9f"}],"doi":"10.15632/jtam-pl/144793"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e0","uid":"bEduVytcT2Cl4PNhsg9nvnQ","uuid":"3ac086e7-a605-4834-b1d7-4a9de566885f","parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e0","parentUuid":"3ac086e7-a605-4834-b1d7-4a9de566885f","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e0","rootUuid":"3ac086e7-a605-4834-b1d7-4a9de566885f","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Techniki Inżynieryjnej im. profesora Józefa Kosackiego","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b6878c28a04739b3b4","5e7094ba878c28a0473c2b52"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Solarny Magazyn Energii – rozwiązanie oparte na komercyjnych krzemowych ogniwach słonecznych i superkondensatorach","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a366","mniswId":"16681","title":"Przegląd Elektrotechniczny","doi":null,"issn":"0033-2097","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e0e94260-eb57-4929-9e8b-deee993cb9a0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fbe0a02467f07d34e8fb4f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ba878c28a0473c2b52","5e7092b6878c28a04739b3b4"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W ostatnich latach systemy magazynujące energie uzyskiwaną z odnawialnych źródeł energii budzą coraz większe zainteresowanie. \nPodstawowym rozwiązaniem jest układ, w którym jako magazyn energii wykorzystywany jest zespół akumulatorów.

Firstly, ultrasonic-assisted solvent extraction (UAE) and protein precipitation step were used for the analyte isolation. Then, the supernatant was evaporated to dryness and redissolved in distilled water (100 mL). The obtained solution was alkalized to pH 11 (with 1 M NaOH) and used directly as donor phase in SLM (supported liquid membrane) extraction. The SLM extraction was performed using 2 M NaCl (5 mL) as an acceptor phase. The flow rate of both phases (donor and acceptor) was set at 0.2 mL/min. The membrane extraction took 24 h but did not require any additional workload. Finally, the SLM extracts were analyzed using the HPLC technique with photo-diode array detector (PDA) and an application of pre-column derivatization with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride. Glyphosate residues were determined in food samples of walnuts, soybeans, barley and lentil samples. The LOD values obtained for the studied food were 0.002 μg g−1 and 0.021 μg g−1 for NPG and AMPA, respectively. Recoveries values ranged from 32% to 69% for NPG, 29% to 56% for AMPA and depended on the type of sample matrix.

Important problems resulting from the necessity to meet general guidelines standardising processes of risk management, formulated in international law regulations [2], as well as in advisory materials of the International Civil Aviation Organisation [6-8], and others [3, 4], including national ones [11], in confrontation with the need for their practical application, were described. Concerning the general rule of risk evaluation described there, inconsistencies in interpretation of the scale of probability and frequency indices and their influence on the evaluation context were pointed out. A model, considering the time aspect in Event Tree Analysis - ETA procedures based on [5, 9], was proposed. Perceived threats to the results of change risk evaluation caused by applying the ``the worst foreseeable situation`` principle were described. A different approach in the evaluation of change risk based on a comprehensive assessment of the impact of all identified risks on the defined effect was also proposed.

The efficient movement of both people and freight largely influences the attractiveness of countries, regions and cities. At the same time transport imposes costs on society: greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions, noise, road accidents and congestion. Currently, transport emissions account for around a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. The changes taking place in the market, the growing environmental awareness and requirements of service users and the increasing restrictions on environmental protection are forcing the need to change the current model of development of urban transport systems to a more ecological one. The aim of this article is to analyse the conditions forcing changes in the functioning of public transport systems and to indicate possibilities of their financing. In the first part of the article, EU and national documents are presented, which define the actions to be taken within the framework of sustainable urban mobility, taking into account the aspect of environmental protection, competitiveness and satisfaction of social needs. The second part presents the possibilities of supporting pro-ecological activities from various sources in terms of innovativeness and competitiveness of transport systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059484","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"167-185","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-93370-8_12","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b86","name":"Renata","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":"49AD994FD18BC011F3B3D0030F17B0046A31FC592A882AA7E9423BE7DFE78D1FDD3309C62DBFE722EF481B26A69C884C670F4297A684465F6B236BBC2970FD21","orcidId":"0000-0001-6520-4512","documentHash":"c7d76882-d0d5-47cf-a826-5f629c40e99f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":null,"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cathepsin D","array SPRi","Ag/Au chip","blood serum","adhesive separating foil","glioblastoma"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Comparison of Various Chips Used for the Manufacture of Biosensors Applied in Non-Fluidic Array SPRi, Based on the Example of Determination of Cathepsin D","mainLanguage":"ang","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb7d","mniswId":"2541","title":"Biosensors","doi":null,"issn":"2079-6374","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1da85720-236d-41e9-99ce-15959e684d5b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fbcb292467f07d34e82046","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709253878c28a047393c63","5e70924c878c28a04739346c","6565f18f40970749a8b2506b","6565f18f40970749a8b2506c","6565f18f40970749a8b2506d"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Non-fluidic array SPR imaging (SPRi) with appropriate biosensors is a new tool for the determination of various biomarkers in body fluids. Numerous biomarkers can be determined without signal enhancement or preliminarily preconcentration. The introduction of a new material solution of the chip may increase the scope of the application of this technique. Solutions with adhesive separating foil and an Ag/Au chip were compared with the previously used two-paint separating polymer and pure gold chip. These solutions were tested using the example of a biosensor for cathepsin D (Cath D), which consisted of pepstatin A (a Cath D inhibitor) immobilized via a cysteamine linker using the NHS/EDC protocol. Four material versions of the Cath D biosensor proved adequate in terms of range of linearity, LOQ, precision and recovery. All four versions of the biosensor were used for the determination of Cath D in the blood serum patients with glioblastoma and control samples, producing very similar results and showing an elevated biomarker concentration in the case of cancer. Therefore, the problem of determining the correct level of Cath D in the serum of healthy individuals has been resolved, correcting literature data which ranged over three orders of magnitude."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059520","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/12/1/21","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6565f18f40970749a8b2506d","name":"Ewa ","lastName":"Gorodkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14fd0f0c-d31c-4cc7-a634-8e25bd966185"},{"objectId":"6565f18f40970749a8b2506c","name":"Zenon","lastName":"Łukaszewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c38d7d1-3711-4ed8-a6b6-300d6bdd5488"},{"objectId":"6565f18f40970749a8b2506b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Falkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41ec9e3f-d701-43e2-9585-4ecbb1ddf200"},{"objectId":"5e709253878c28a047393c63","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Mrozek","uuid":"219F3D24C6101EAE562AD96B8782B9A4458AED662C5047EEE3581AB091352639082DA0037266F1963C82200BEB68508F0DBCDAB791D700A650CA7CA1D2FA6418","orcidId":"0000-0002-9788-6957","documentHash":"a06af16e-4d68-4a6b-9cc1-07bf63f24cfc"},{"objectId":"5e70924c878c28a04739346c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Miluski","uuid":"7C66C78899183AF8E8DA2E815173F7E1D41A36ED2A18C97F9BC819843576C444AEF1C17356706CF89F877C1B516F5F1FD3FAF90E92C84F408205B645967D70C4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4327-7176","documentHash":"a1f47816-3c0b-4e34-ba84-ad2c2d0201d1"}],"doi":"10.3390/bios12010021"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac2a1","5e70949c878c28a0473c0688"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Materials, assemblies and reaction systems under rotation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5b878c28514547cd66","mniswId":"14844","title":"Nature Reviews Materials","doi":null,"issn":"2058-8437","eissn":"2058-8437","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"16d2096f-cdc3-4879-97eb-11b23d790ccf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620030c72467f07c234981f1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70949c878c28a0473c0688","620030c72467f07c234981f4","620030c72467f07c234981f5","5e709388878c28a0473ac2a1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"When liquids or solid materials rotate, they impart centrifugal and/or shear forces. This Review surveys rotary devices and systems in which such forces control small-scale flows, self-organization phenomena, materials synthesis or chemical reactivity at molecular and macromolecular levels. Centrifugal forces directed away from the rotation axis enable various separations or lab-on-a-disc systems and can shape interfaces or deposit thin films of functional materials. When these forces act on particles lighter than the rotating fluid, they can provide the basis for colloidal crystallization or trapping; when the direction of rotation changes, they can simulate microgravity conditions and affect motility patterns of living organisms. Shear forces, by contrast, can promote crystallization, couple to molecular-scale assembly and affect its chiral outcomes. Combining centrifugal and shear forces is useful in establishing rotating reactors to accelerate reaction kinetics, modulate chemical reactivity, enable multistep syntheses or support complex extractions. Through these and other examples, we illustrate that rotating reaction vessels can enable new types of chemical experimentation, with outcomes that are not always understood. We argue that rotating systems for studying such processes will become more common given advances in remotely controlled sensors and spectrometers that can monitor the contents of rotating vessels."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059567","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620030c72467f07c234981f8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d2c89b87-5ab5-4121-9e49-351692234425"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-021-00404-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620030c72467f07c234981f5","name":"Olgierd","lastName":"Cybulski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6610cd9f-8c9a-4e78-81df-589c19be2ffe"},{"objectId":"620030c72467f07c234981f4","name":"Yaroslav I.","lastName":"Sobolev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44a4328d-3226-4919-9000-51465c297bc0"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c0688","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Grzybowski","uuid":"3221A3D348805FFE2A3ADD83933478873CB0903ADF945458D69DBFDD4251BF25D46CD0CE3764F9D3816FE71AB62D941442C9E1C6A3A5068EF90ECCA93F088257","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0bbf19b4-3d2a-4ce2-9c2f-675fa4dbec75"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac2a1","name":"BARBARA","lastName":"MIKULAK-KLUCZNIK","uuid":"3505E12FADF5F8B521D2A6C7FE48B3E0D5328E9B02B8FF35D71FC558E0081B73AFEFAED9A14AF005039A9FE6C773978B2C1EF99A460A9AB6CFC879B674E0517C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5263-0731","documentHash":"9e4a159c-0f96-4e1c-a921-11749ab9bee2"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41578-021-00404-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["virtual reality","virtual tourism","augmented reality","space tourism","health","COVID-19 pandemic","tourism trends"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e087","uid":"bb1eAT2BMBTGkk695wKT43A","uuid":"7c53f923-c0ac-4e2d-82db-2c93b9fd6578","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Rolniczo-Ekonomiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709260878c28a04739497b","5e70930a878c28a0473a1a21"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093af878c28a0473af277"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Virtual and Space Tourism as New Trends in Travelling at the Time of the COVID-19 Pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"0d97aa0b-ce19-4064-80cf-687f82708b68"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61de93cb2467f0772e3e5b9d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093af878c28a0473af277","61de93cb2467f0772e3e5ba4","61de93cb2467f0772e3e5ba8","5e709260878c28a04739497b","5e70930a878c28a0473a1a21"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p> The first European COVID-19 infection was recorded in February 2020, and Poland followed in mid-March. Restrictions were imposed on traveling between states and using public space. These movement restrictions forced a search for new, often innovative, forms of tourism. Google Earth virtual reality (VR), Google Street View, and the Chernobyl VR Project are just some of the selected opportunities to create virtual tours. Different activities using VR mean that people can experience the illusion of travelling in time and space, outside of their everyday surroundings, in a digitally constructed three-dimensional (3D) environment, for cognition or entertainment. Therefore, this study aimed to present virtual and space tourism as new traveling trends during various crise,s such as health, economic, etc. A diagnostic survey with a developed questionnaire was conducted in June and July 2021 in Poland. A total of 564 fully answered responses were collected from randomly selected respondents. We found that around 82% of Polish people were aware of VR technology, and 70% believed that new technologies determine VR tourism development. VR presents the possibility of travelling to places that no longer exist in their original form, but have been reconstructed only in VR. Around 75% of the respondents agreed that VR tourism plays an essential role in tourism promotion in Poland and throughout the world. Moreover, VR and augmented tourism lets us visit fictitious and dangerous, politically restricted, and geographically as well as economically difficult destinations. For example, our results revealed that many people want to experience North Korea, the USA, Antarctica, Syria, etc. At the same time, people recommended the NASA space station as a visiting destination using VR and augmented reality. VR offers an alternative form of tourism during crises and pandemics such as COVID-19. We found over 26% of the respondents were satisfied with contemporary tourists’ cognitional needs during VR sightseeing. More than 87% of the respondents believed that VR tourism cannot substitute real-world tourism in the long run. However, VR tourism will be more beneficial for developing countries facing difficulties in economic aspects, and easier than attaining visas to enter developed countries. Furthermore, virtual sightseeing may also constitute an alternative for people who are disabled or sick, and who cannot undertake the effort of active tourism and explore tourist resources of the world on their own.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059600","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/2/628","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61de93cb2467f0772e3e5ba8","name":"Kumar","lastName":"Bhatta","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2140-4170","documentHash":"c47ccc36-0776-41f4-8cd0-4bfd7d3b5565"},{"objectId":"61de93cb2467f0772e3e5ba4","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kosiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9879-7094","documentHash":"a09b9d19-d79d-4612-b4dc-220493c16a9f"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af277","name":"Michał","lastName":"Roman","uuid":"11652658CD066F273B5914213D0176E11738B5DCF61F9DA90832F0EDE653AF3B243BA3E20581BDE2DE61BF99ADAD8612B7EC8DD5C6844C7D0EE9289D2841D302","orcidId":"0000-0003-3596-2587","documentHash":"8dae8c1f-23a8-47d6-bded-dfc17703ff07"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1a21","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Krasnodębski","uuid":"FF8DDB9DFFDDA0C629B28799609C06B4DBEB09A9F06396EBEE4D15AF343CFAB1A1D64AEBD7E545F7AC6E36AD0A1DEAF8C369FEF7A9813417DC45950371DEC93E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8970-0916","documentHash":"7e4fa12b-3ca0-483c-b00f-f9fd95ea17e2"},{"objectId":"5e709260878c28a04739497b","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Niedziółka","uuid":"B330B8DDCD5500E3398F19E810A33FB3BBEA0F8879F362CCDFAF7C2DA9FEB952C637F3A99FA22B18475C92BF7106E0A017A9070F9A652406A1B93874C6EB4AF9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2546-4154","documentHash":"cd9bfc3c-17d7-4bd4-b1b1-530b4a25466b"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14020628"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["duck meat","turmeric","burgers","quality","lipid oxidation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709228878c28a047390cd7","5e709228878c28a047390d0a","5e7093a2878c28a0473ae1f2","5e709228878c28a047390ce2","5e709227878c28a047390cbd","5e709227878c28a047390cbb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Effect of the Addition Turmeric on Selected Quality Characteristics of Duck Burgers Stored under Refrigeration","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fce1d92467f02a1f892116","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709228878c28a047390ce2","5e709228878c28a047390cd7","5e709228878c28a047390d0a","5e7093a2878c28a0473ae1f2","5e709227878c28a047390cbd","5e709227878c28a047390cbb"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of turmeric supplementation on selected quality features, oxidative stability, and the safety of duck meat burgers. Four burger variants, namely I–control, no additive, II–with turmeric powder, III–with turmeric extract, and IV–with turmeric paste, were tested. The pH, WHC, colour parameters on the CIE L*a*b* scale, finished products’ shear force, TBARS index, and the total number of microorganisms were determined while performing sensory evaluations. Tests were carried out after 24 h, 6, 12, and 18 days of refrigerated storage (4 ± 2 °C). The addition of turmeric powder and paste significantly limited lipid oxidation processes in vacuum-packed duck meat burgers over an 18-day period. Although lipid oxidation processes accelerated after 6 days in all burger variants, burgers with powdered turmeric powder showed the lowest TBARS index values and limited total microorganism increases. Turmeric paste and powder additions resulted in decreased pH, increased water retention, and lighter colouration in refrigerated products. These additives were deemed acceptable during sensory evaluation.

Niniejsze opracowanie porusza tematykę etycznych aspektów wykorzystania sztucznej inteligencji w sektorze finansowym, która staje się coraz bardziej powszechna, a przez to niekiedy „niewidoczna” dla odbiorcy końcowego. Przykłady jej wykorzystania znajdziemy m.in. w modelach oceny ryzyka czy systemach wykrywania transakcji oszukańczych (fraudowych) oraz przeciwdziałania praniu pieniędzy i finansowaniu terroryzmu. Coraz częściej sztuczna inteligencja jest wykorzystywana także do oceny zdolności kredytowej potencjalnego kredytobiorcy czy w doradztwie inwestycyjnym. W tych ostatnich przypadkach przejrzystość i etyka nabierają szczególnego znaczenia, „dotykają” bowiem bezpośrednio sfery człowieka i mogą w istotny sposób wpływać na przestrzeganie praw podstawowych. Jednocześnie znalezienie „złotego środka”, który nie tylko będzie wyważał różne interesy, ale także będzie realny do wdrożenia, jest zadaniem niełatwym. Nierzadko w literaturze podkreśla się, że już dzisiaj widoczny jest brak pozytywnego (jakiegokolwiek?) efektu, jeśli chodzi o realizację postulatów w zakresie etycznego SI (Dubber i in., 2020), w związku ze stosowaniem różnej maści kodeksów etycznych czy dobrych praktyk, które bardziej opierają się na tzw. self-regulation czy self-governance, czyli samostanowieniu praktyk, które następnie są audytowane przez ustanawiającego. Jednocześnie dynamiczny rozwój algorytmów, szczególnie tych podejmujących (w jakimś stopniu) autonomiczne decyzje, powoduje, że nadzór — również etyczny — nie może być chwilowy, ale powinien odbywać się w trybie ciągłym (Lo Piano, 2020), co tylko potęguje już istniejące problemy związane z algorytmizacją."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The application of artificial intelligence in finance is one of the new issues which, in addition to regulatory challenges of hard law nature, raise ethical questions. This study deals with the subject of ethical aspects of the use of artificial intelligence in the financial sector, which is becoming more and more common, and therefore sometimes \"invisible\" to the end user. Examples of its use can be found, among others in risk assessment models or systems for detecting fraudulent transactions and counteracting money laundering and terrorist financing. Increasingly, they are also used to assess the creditworthiness of a potential borrower or provide investment advice. In the latter cases, transparency and ethics take on a special meaning, because they directly \"touch\" the human sphere and can significantly affect the observance of fundamental rights. At the same time, finding the \"happy medium\" that will not only balance various interests, but also be realistic to implement, is not an easy task. It is often emphasized in the literature that today there is no positive (any?) Effect on the implementation of many postulates in the field of ethical AI (Dubber et al., 2020), in connection with the use of various codes of ethics or good practices, which are more based on the so-called self-regulation or self-governance, that is, self-determination practices that are then audited by the settler. At the same time, the dynamic development of algorithms, especially those that make (to some extent) autonomous decisions, means that supervision — also ethical — cannot be temporary, but should be carried out continuously (Lo Piano, 2020), which only exacerbates the already existing problems related to algorithmisation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058059654","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"2-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.pwe.com.pl/czasopisma/przeglad-ustawodawstwa-gospodarczego/ethics-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-financial-sector,a844479054","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61fbc89f2467f04297874c90","name":"Michał","lastName":"Nowakowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71a0072d-4b1a-4b85-a11e-c9fddd2572fd"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a0473938c1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Waliszewski","uuid":"E98BA832F6DF0F97B0BD64D634E2722807D34E5289EB742641CBA8FECE091491878BD02B07EED848CEA0142704BF13DD69D747E5661E532B3D244204783B81AF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4239-5875","documentHash":"76ce3e07-7ad0-463e-bf92-26a3227c45ac"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["laterality","validity","IRT","bi-factor model","handedness questionnaire"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"New data on the validity of the Fazio Laterality Inventory","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","doi":null,"issn":"1932-6203","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"45cf93d6-1d2d-4b95-93ed-f1e3f136e1c7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fd356d2467f02a1f8bf26a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70939e878c28a0473ade24","656da8b840970749a862d1f3","656da8b840970749a862d1f4"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Fazio Laterality Inventory (FLI) is a recent measure of handedness.

The main objective of the paper is to assess the properties of a natural resource such as straw as an eco-friendly material in various variants for use in low-energy demand construction. The research results will fill the knowledge gap in the field of numerical analyses of the energy demand of straw material buildings based on the results of the conducted laboratory tests. A test of a heat transfer coefficient was conducted with different orientation of straw stalks. Then, samples were subject to a fire resistance test to determine material behavior at 1000 °C. During the fire resistance test, the clay-based plaster was ‘burnt out’, which hardened its structure, effectively preventing flames from reaching the insulation layers in the form of straw stalks. As a result of shrinkage (no plaster mesh), the plaster cracked and turned brick-red in color. The insulation layer of straw under the plaster was charred to a depth of 3.0 mm due to the high temperature. However, when the torch was turned off, no fire spread was observed in any layer of the sample. The 3D models of the buildings were created for different eco-friendly materials applied to make external walls. The results of numerical simulation allowed determining the amount of final energy needed to heat the designed building at the level of 26.38 (kWh/m2·year). Conclusions of the above-mentioned tests indicate very good thermal insulating properties determined using the lambda coefficient of 0.069 (W/m·K) and the possible application of straw bales as an alternative for conventional construction. Research has proven that it is possible to construct a building with low energy requirements using natural, easily available waste and completely biodegradable material."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058061835","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6eab52467f030e8c433a6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f6ef340-c61f-44fb-8d93-a045bc59a21f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/1155","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"646360004097076e9cb11a1a","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Pałubski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83e642de-08a5-46de-b4cc-dac1999be66c"},{"objectId":"5ebf83ae752340336647221f","name":"Igor","lastName":"Klementowski","uuid":"E96ACEC0E477F16ACA88F1B00DE4DA0112AC9DCF28A31B7855E1F1FD4E06C340FB4AB17CFB1D99562B0F65C6F67E14212D915AE41F73971E877434B109027833","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5bdfd4aa-53d8-44d7-8ba8-972c36e0b667"},{"objectId":"5e7093ec878c28a0473b3665","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Pochwała","uuid":"38C636DA9BA3F2DB6DB5F3F7E9ACCCA6AB1F505ED1744C8258A40ED10857E328DFD5122C8E81E507E95AD12C253AC2CDBEC8EA971F4720F914619E8558354E2B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8128-5495","documentHash":"1f564b79-e73d-4de0-8fd4-a5f271219e8b"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d37","name":"ANNA","lastName":"KRÓL","uuid":"AE69774218FEBC3E6CF73A5724A7A8C342AC726E9202ED2ABEF0C73ACBB7193E50CD2D1F1CD3C41592AF2C82B3F7ABE586AC27B3BF4BD2553ED0171A4F520C24","orcidId":"0000-0002-3674-850X","documentHash":"fd94017a-525d-4198-a5e9-e10ce7c2855e"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dcd8","name":"ELŻBIETA","lastName":"JANOWSKA-RENKAS","uuid":"001A3A79891B177EEFDA8A63A2622180B7E28CB0B6235EE0CF471BF8B7B7BEC7B1F3C04F4B8AB6C29BCE811268ABEA9AC366E5489D52CD98B47A18288AC87E15","orcidId":"0000-0002-1877-6216","documentHash":"745bbb31-e2c9-4214-ba96-43e3ee9e7c2f"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d9b7","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"ADAMSKA","uuid":"573CF9CCCE922D7A7F3B64C447A19DE0B80618862CEEAA272B7183B9C0986388A8F1FF2425939D24F55FD0F67353375D42C1BA53A9338F774FAB0F8789000876","orcidId":"0000-0001-5227-3519","documentHash":"8c359002-c218-4288-a3c0-8faa5e9b4fc6"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15031155"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61f7a8d72467f01b5a15a2a0","doi":null,"title":"Religious policy.

In the present work, the results of the presence of stem rot, assessed by PICUS Sonic Tomography, and the fungal biota on trees and stumps in eight plots in the Puszcza Borecka Forest are described. The plots were located in stands on original forest soil (4) and on post-agricultural soil (4), where around a stump with H. parviporum symptoms (signs of internal rot and basidiocarps), 30 trees were selected and examined for internal rot. Wood samples were collected from two selected trees for fungal molecular analysis. A total of 79 fungal taxa were found, including 57 taxa in plots on post-agricultural soil and 45 on forest soil. There were 395 fungal records on stumps and 22 records on trees, therein, from the inner parts of felled trunks. Significant differences in the Chao-1 diversity index indicate that the origin of the soil—post-agricultural or forest soil—influenced the alpha diversity of the fungal communities in the forests studied. The values of the Shannon and Simpson indices show that the two communities were similar in terms of species numbers. The presence of basidiomata of H. parviporum and two species of Armillaria (mainly A. cepistipes) in samples on all plots is striking, although Armillaria spp. was detected more frequently. Most of the species identified were typical saprotrophs, although rare species were also found, such as Entoloma byssisedum, Onnia tomentosa, Physisporinus vitreus, Postia ptychogaster, and Ramaria apiculata.

Reference was made to the „Our Common Future” UN document, the Pope's ecological Encyclical, and to the CPR-EU 305 Basic Requirements, as well as to the consequences of the principles of thermodynamics. It has been shown that thermodynamic laws, as natural laws, act regardless of one’s awareness of their existence or the laws of their formulation. In building construction there is a lot less awareness pertaining to the laws of thermodynamics than there is surrounding the laws of mechanics. Throughout history the Basic Requirements have evolved and now are closely related to the principles of thermodynamics. In the paper the thermodynamic barrier and the profit-to-energy ratio, EROI, were defined, and the postulate of the Promethean transformation in technology was presented. An analysis was carried out of how these conditions determine the necessity and limitations of construction building innovation. In the paper there is emphasis on the hope of the further development of circular economy and the use of the synergy of interaction between the components of building composites in

sound insulation of lightweight frame façades and the acoustic effect of additional thermal insulation were examined. The research aimed to investigate the contribution of different insulating layers to the acoustic performance of an external wall. In particular, the use of ETICS (external thermal insulation composite systems) was considered. This usually reduces the sound insulation of traditional massive partitions substantially whereas for lightweight frame structures the effect was not precisely identified. The study is based on laboratory measurements, and several full-scale models were tested. Wood and metal frame walls with various claddings were considered. The application of ETICS caused the reduction of sound insulation in a certain frequency range. The effect, however, seems not as harmful as for massive partitions. Another type of thermal insulation with a venting cavity demonstrated much better acoustic performance. Conversely, internal installation cladding, when rigidly fastened to the basic structure had practically no effect on the wall properties. Significant improvement was observed when resilient spacers or separate supporting structures were applied."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058061960","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"190","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003682X22000196","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d34f","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Nurzyński","uuid":"2AB4F0DC89C144FAE52A43CCFF3F42489422B2DECEAB71AE2A11417EB746E37AC89FA2430E96B7B34064241FC6144D1E8333CC91D0646DB8E2A028CC6CED3816","orcidId":"0000-0001-7889-4997","documentHash":"fb5afddf-6bae-4d39-aa56-aac4ba0ba19d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apacoust.2022.108645"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climbing plants","fruit and seed size","invasive alien species","morphological variability"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df62","uid":"bsq32O8WjxMhkpQii6EvcZw","uuid":"6700d816-d124-4a54-9d44-4f1b7f01494b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","name":"Wydział Biologii i Ochrony Środowiska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70939e878c28a0473ade28","5e70939e878c28a0473adbb7"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397cba"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949e878c28a0473c0840","5e709291878c28a0473981b3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Relationships of Habitat Conditions, Height Level, and Geographical Position with Fruit and Seed Traits in Populations of Invasive Vine Echinocystis lobata (Cucurbitaceae) in Central and Eastern Europe","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","doi":null,"issn":"1999-4907","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"42a3ad4f-b110-4a47-9a0c-7c0eb98ed81c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620117472467f042970fb333","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65671a8d40970749a8443625","65671a8d40970749a8443626","5e709291878c28a0473981b3","5e70939e878c28a0473adbb7","65671a8d40970749a8443628","65671a8d40970749a8443629","65671a8d40970749a844362a","65671a8d40970749a844362b","65671a8d40970749a844362c","5e70949e878c28a0473c0840","5e70928e878c28a047397cba","65671a8d40970749a844362f","5e70939e878c28a0473ade28","65671a8d40970749a8443630","65671a8d40970749a8443631","65671a8d40970749a8443632"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In climbing plants, fruits can be formed at different heights, depending on the height of external support. However, the effect of height on fruit and seed traits in invasive vines of Cucurbitaceae has not been intensively studied so far. In Europe, Echinocystis lobata, a North American member of Cucurbitaceae, is considered one of the most abundant invasive alien plants spreading in natural riparian forests, thickets, and tall herbs, whereas it is a rare species in urban woodlands. In this study, we tested the variability of selected fruit and seed traits of E. lobata in connection with habitat origin (natural, semi-natural, and anthropogenic), habitat type (using the EUNIS habitat classification), height (the distance between the fruit and the ground), and geographical position. The study was conducted in 2018 in 65 sites located in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia. In each study site, a random sample of 10 fresh mature fruits of E. lobata was collected from subsequent 0.50 m intervals of height. The length, the width, and the weight of the fresh fruits, as well as the total number of seeds and number of undeveloped seeds per fruit, were examined. Moreover, the well-developed seeds from selected study sites were weighed. The statistical analysis showed the significant effect of habitat origin, habitat type, and height on most of the studied fruit and seed traits. The largest range of height (from 0.00 to 4.00 m) was observed in two types of habitats (F—heathland, scrub, and tundra; and G—woodland, forest, and other wooded land). The total number of seeds per fruit was positively correlated with the length, width, and weight of the fresh fruits. The fruits were a little heavier and bigger in natural habitats located in the northeast of the study area. The distribution of fruits at different heights may contribute to better dispersal of seeds by animals and wind, and may also better protect the seeds from being eaten by granivorous animals. The defence against seed-eating animals is expected to be stronger in semi-natural habitats, as well as on banks and shores of inland surface waters, where the seed production is the highest. The influence of seed traits on seed germination and seedling survival in various habitats and their importance in the invasiveness of E. lobata require further study."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058061974","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fba4f82467f07d34e57093","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"a9f41833-06ed-489f-b87b-4b4a70269fc6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"[1-26], [poz.] 256","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/2/256","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a8443632","name":"Alina","lastName":"Stachurska-Swakoń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0989c15c-f33e-440f-82a0-686b3ddc9112"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a8443631","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2e70c51-f37a-4423-95ea-1504bb08e755"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a8443630","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Szczęśniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"098ca96d-081f-43e5-8375-bb24f5c3c24e"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a844362f","name":"Mindaugas","lastName":"Rasimavičius","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ded6c9b-df89-4420-bef5-17ee672a99aa"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a844362c","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Majk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77df6428-68b1-4795-8fe6-c43b73076f2d"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a844362b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Maćkowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58dc1415-ea61-4633-b94f-72fcf20f3ea2"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a844362a","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kucharczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92e794a6-ccbf-4b10-9f46-be617f7d0839"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a8443629","name":"Zigmantas","lastName":"Gudžinskas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38717035-b435-44ca-9886-880917383e6b"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a8443628","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Dajdok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88dcaf29-0318-435f-81a7-4b644d62f41a"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a8443626","name":"Artur","lastName":"Pliszko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88c97abc-43bf-4344-863f-03f99c42cd06"},{"objectId":"65671a8d40970749a8443625","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Kostrakiewicz-Gierałt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d5f987a-07d0-4a3e-9ec0-fa4f6da8c95e"},{"objectId":"5e70949e878c28a0473c0840","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Możdżeń","uuid":"286E295C0854C359505D14729E7F858C712FCCDF7DEF993650F6058C64D7FB1AD3C17FF935EB54D2DBA421D4318DA33073E266188D3C1E86536B9C0E651FE426","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cfc4e4c0-f077-4858-9b8f-7a772edcd66a"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473ade28","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Rewicz","uuid":"37BB3BD4A3874F431800A6B20DE6FEE2C8475A1A1FF4EEBD86D67174DE48D33DD39946D7A227AEF863A96BC3FCD337FE91B1699EAA97915B086282AE3F324DA5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8228-6406","documentHash":"35ef0ea2-e252-42d7-a73a-26837d4aa590"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473adbb7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bomanowska","uuid":"C9A33DFAF21842E0551FF3A9AC4B89CC9A41DB058EF0FD95047E9E2829FD8ED87E7B38BFB17F1716644382D86EBCDD2B9B6CD81B3B3BBF9DEDF96102A82DA124","orcidId":"0000-0001-5648-2852","documentHash":"d9c6803e-da67-41ae-949e-795a6fa42875"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a0473981b3","name":"Beata","lastName":"Barabasz-Krasny","uuid":"62B880A224ECF1265EA1ABF744130463903D1DFF72B864958B016AC6F0CD577C3229D7F7084FACAC8B94FE9EAE7CEA6A7A30669DBD224771E6C3A3F933B0D258","orcidId":"0000-0002-5800-6953","documentHash":"ec697a6a-4c65-4f07-84a5-653dc1c45aad"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397cba","name":"Monika","lastName":"Podgórska","uuid":"A32A09AB7CCED5AA1619B325ABEFB0E2B2E215B13064EEFEE416067B12014DDC71918D7F10B37942AE1F69BE573E8196BAA4133C2ED90EC2C66E36FDBB269B39","orcidId":"0000-0003-1777-5534","documentHash":"7854ddde-5f3e-4f01-b347-4149bc8edf06"}],"doi":"10.3390/f13020256"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Logistics","Prediction","Cluster","Tourism","COVID-19"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61e47e0c2467f053b96ac10c","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Cracow University of Technology","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c83bf"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7c","uid":"b4qbOpQNJGA0228Xn5XpmqQ","uuid":"7e1c2a3a-90ae-40af-bd27-bb7d5df82733","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7c","parentUuid":"7e1c2a3a-90ae-40af-bd27-bb7d5df82733","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7c","rootUuid":"7e1c2a3a-90ae-40af-bd27-bb7d5df82733","name":"Państwowa Uczelnia Zawodowa im. prof.

The complex with propylenediamine bridge (C3_core) readily reacts with pyridine and its derivatives to form high-spin (paramagnetic) complexes with octahedral geometry as characterized by X-ray diffraction; electron-donating substituents on the pyridine ring facilitate the coordination of axial ligands. In contrast, the complex with ethylenediamine bridge (C2_core) does not undergo such a reaction because of the high deformation energy of the core required for the formation of C2_Py complex."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058061987","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61ea5d462467f06f09db957c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"168473c4-5f27-4f1e-aaa3-fb0f46925df7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"e202100741","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cphc.202100741","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e52b4c2467f0034f07e386","name":"Miquel","lastName":"Solà","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1917-7450","documentHash":"47d50991-4c4b-4193-a9cf-d6e830d62a94"},{"objectId":"61e52b4c2467f0034f07e384","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zep","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0267-4338","documentHash":"80450e33-184b-4400-bec3-4441c69aab02"},{"objectId":"61e52b4c2467f0034f07e382","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Pruszkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2332-3083","documentHash":"ba77c14d-7b84-4404-b8aa-8fa06e366af7"},{"objectId":"60cdaef19543c7233654459f","name":"Olga","lastName":"Stasyuk","uuid":"5C43EE9D62A4D3F4D8C71659EA4593D6B8AB55A7187306BF87DDB98B9E0F912849DC7E73FAFB2F94B9C37B24AFABAE20E24D359E074BF5E397EE8AB0CB4A3782","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc730ada-c4b1-4e5d-97fd-b14b57d1e9c4"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b180d","name":"Adam","lastName":"Krówczyński","uuid":"C894EAD225A056FCE69BED13EEC815AEECC0A19E29DA73CEC53622C6DF933FB3B345F3EDF1247A2F199B00252BB4779164D369538AF821525EFD3F6BAE4494F2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"740e0327-13b1-4c50-8b2b-9bfa8ec1a103"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a92","name":"Michał","lastName":"Cyrański","uuid":"9AB95089FA09E9C93562F8BB947F36E674AF2B9874D71A85AAA83DD7CF4749F6606D7A0FB32D11E32389791F6AD9B071F54DD29ABB98998BF7EF89B34FF40976","orcidId":"0000-0003-1277-6124","documentHash":"dc26c56b-4754-4106-a022-0f161e138543"},{"objectId":"5e709353878c28a0473a75f6","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Siciński","uuid":"742353777BE38220208232498E8BE0DD3C6A9DF53970B042C42EC989C812A75984C2903B6FB2038A364142A87F91E69D5143D5BC8E4A49D62CDA2869EDF8C8FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-7071-7814","documentHash":"460be751-14d3-41a3-bd9a-87affefd5833"}],"doi":"10.1002/cphc.202100741"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fast PIES;","FMM;","Multi-connected boundary problems;","Curvilinear boundary;"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f833","uid":"bWuzLWCgoKVIVkdNBCpiq-w","uuid":"8c78162e-c6fb-4f40-9f6b-d888ed8ebf69","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Instytut Informatyki (od 1.10.2019 r.)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922d878c28a0473912d1","5e70922d878c28a0473912cf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Solving of multi-connected curvilinear boundary value problems by the fast PIES","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547779c","mniswId":"4236","title":"Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"0045-7825","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"6a5f77f4-ed08-4200-8824-5e4e05b71c61"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620104562467f06fa43455a0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922d878c28a0473912cf","5e70922d878c28a0473912d1"]},"issue":"114618","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the fast parametric integral equations system (PIES) in solving two-dimensional (2D) multi-connected curvilinear potential boundary value problems. The fast PIES is a combination of the fast multipole technique with a modified binary tree and original PIES. It was successfully employed for exploring the efficiency of the method applied in modelling and solving single-connected 2D potential problems. The fast PIES allows reducing the time of numerical computations (CPU time), as well as RAM utilization. However, application to the multi-connected problems requires appropriate changes in the fast multipole computations due to the small distance between some segments in internal parts of the boundary. The method is demonstrated with the examples of curvilinear potential problems dealing with perforated plates (plates with many circular holes)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062006","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620104562467f06fa43455a5","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"391","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"57fa93bf-f02d-4033-94a5-39318e5ccf64"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"391","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782522000342","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922d878c28a0473912d1","name":"Eugeniusz","lastName":"Zieniuk","uuid":"EDEB9D8D6DBD9ADBB8B7884934F4430C18D259817B6242357591DDEBC65611F7E63C7C97BFC80EE7D0C6C7D851C21EDC8DD4427839B1677A65E3F9B63BB103A2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6395-5096","documentHash":"e541cd63-967e-480d-995c-0a5c2257e985"},{"objectId":"5e70922d878c28a0473912cf","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kużelewski","uuid":"7D4D64D51B020A31338CAE16A518466CAA4210A5B3495CF05F43441D0E4F548EE9279DCB0A01BB78FB78C2645A9967BD8CE602C5B33788034B73FD7601FF2DF9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2247-2714","documentHash":"80015587-47f5-457c-b6a3-c4492c159541"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cma.2022.114618"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a0f","5e709498878c28a0473c01fd","5e70934a878c28a0473a69fc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hydraulic fracturing flowback chemical composition diversity as a factor determining possibilities of its management","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research","doi":null,"issn":"0944-1344","eissn":"1614-7499","websiteLink":"https://link.springer.com/journal/11356","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"aea89b39-0bd7-4cbe-8331-c2ce71ba4e4c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6203c40d2467f03b338159e0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70934a878c28a0473a69fc","5e709498878c28a0473c01fd","5e70934a878c28a0473a6a0f"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The chemical characteristic of flowback fluid from hydraulic fracturing for shale gas exploration/production in various localizations is presented.

article, as the fourth in the cycle, presents the conclusions of the research project analysing marketing activities of Polish Catholic opinion-forming weeklies on the chosen social media platforms. This paper aims at presenting the results of the study on the use of Instagram and YouTube as marketing tools by the aforementioned weeklies. The authors focus on such topics as: (1) social media as a way of creating and distributing media products; (2) social media as a way of commercialising the content; (3) social media as carriers of marketing communication (including self-promotion). The empirical research is based on case studies and the content analysis of the social media profiles of the five selected magazines (Gość Niedzielny (GN), Tygodnik Katolicki Niedziela (TKN), Przewodnik Katolicki (PK), Idziemy (I) and Tygodnik Rodzin Katolickich Źródło (TRKŹ)). It can be concluded that some Catholic weeklies manage their accounts in a moderately professional way, using their visual and distribution potential and some functions of the platforms quite efficiently. On the other hand, they do not apply a regular and purposeful self-promotion strategy, do not use important mechanisms of the platforms such as the Shop and IGTV (on Instagram), and do not consistently build a profile or create playlists on YouTube."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062128","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62459b1a2467f0155138bd3c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"2c1e5311-ab33-4d2e-8ccd-0bcdb9ac661b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/13/1/19/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b801","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Piechnik- Czyż","uuid":"282C4E3B481425F692EE6D80342F584D0782AB661DD5529AD26057590874D00BFF8403C59C90C91813CCDCCB5B028CD3F34848C4D83B2869433E20C33B0B86F3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8394-7483","documentHash":"d5131595-a404-4663-b4de-f9fbcad6a3ca"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739afa9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Adamski","uuid":"BAFE56ABDDB07D394AC51C725398619A2B56FFD48A2DD47B0C5DA02268ADA4FC049BB5030485054905AE41AB836CFFC6E77C13AC74768F764D2CEECB8091735E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4075-4224","documentHash":"5c22f035-c383-4e03-81fd-3301548f1654"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a218","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kaczmarek-Śliwińska","uuid":"E719EC460640907EE51FD7A321F740CA11352D728A62135137BEBB884EAE5BE0505DA17039EE3A1911B49047091C17C1DFC1026C68284B8DC4D0D338671B99E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-9096-9338","documentHash":"1de4174b-b95a-4d96-915f-633986ca8e24"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a04739801d","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Leonowicz-Bukała","uuid":"DCC73A43959C1608275D00B5EEEE0258A1708E6FA14CAFA8EC112F5405540FFE994A2A9A3DB91A38948B42FF6313DB04C5F10F8FF9E0B9B48E0B60FCF3B6CD1B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3164-1209","documentHash":"033236bd-00e0-4380-b989-fda714e8e982"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397651","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jupowicz-Ginalska","uuid":"46CC408C6520636B32A63777812FEDDF999E5D9F5AB4C5E80E7175DC72BBCC133BA7AE7117C3983B4FBDC01444FCA388A5758DE8C84910EFECFA1AC639D4BE9C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7016-0427","documentHash":"e987f919-cbe2-40a8-9c27-06ee65f5715a"}],"doi":"10.3390/rel13010019"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","uid":"bPoyZM9sTF7DfGYlClitONQ","uuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","parentUuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","rootUuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","name":"Instytut Techniki Budowlanej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944e878c28a0473ba183"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Identification of Olfactory Nuisance of Floor Products Containing Bitumens with the TD–GC–MS/O Method","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":"10.3390/ma","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8475d9fb-a844-4cfe-87c7-25090cd02fd3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6200f9832467f06fa433c8dd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944e878c28a0473ba183"]},"issue":"3 (959)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The adopted TD–GC–MS/O method helps determine the correlation between the odour signals and compounds separated on the chromatographic column, from the analysed gas mixture. It is possible to compare the retention times at which the odour signals were identified with the retention time of eluting compounds, when the test system and matrix are known. The presented study describes the details of representative samples obtained from (1) indoor air samples from a room where floor materials containing bitumen are present, (2) wooden floor staves placed in an emission chamber, and (3) fragments (chips) of the materials mentioned above, placed in glass tubes, exposed to an elevated desorption temperature. The results, presented in the paper, describe the identified odours and their intensity and assign chemical compounds to each odour, indicating their likely source of origin. The results presented in the manuscript are intended to show what methodology can be adopted to obtain intense odours from the tested samples, without losing the sensitivity derived from GC–MS. The manuscript presents representative results—case studies. The results for various types of samples were not very reproducible, related to the complex matrix of bituminous products. The enormity of compounds present in tar adhesives makes it possible to indicate only the groups of compounds that emit from these systems. They include, primarily, aliphatic, aromatic and heteroaromatic hydrocarbons, particularly Naphthalene and Phenol derivatives."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062132","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"959","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/3/959/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944e878c28a0473ba183","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Kozicki","uuid":"B745727A509F9B20E5B2E74CFDC8CBB15C54C7AAFA97866904684C494BAF92DC6BC6E6C9AFE198D455A146A6C1A7E75B170B55EA197A65872BE8F322C4C61CF4","orcidId":"0000-0001-6053-6550","documentHash":"150c9d52-48e8-4176-85e2-460de539895a"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15030959"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Basal metabolic rate; Housing temperature; Human; Mouse; Spontaneous physical activity; Thermoneutrality;"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f82c","uid":"bW6UmF5uUXnumJ4PLD8QbxQ","uuid":"da53ef4a-4e78-45bf-8b53-36a8ba11acd3","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Wydział Biologii (od 1.10.2019 r.)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390bd1","5e709227878c28a047390bcf","5e709227878c28a047390bd3","5e709227878c28a047390bcd","5e70922d878c28a04739129b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Significance of variation in basal metabolic rate in laboratory mice for translational experiments","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454785a4","mniswId":"10593","title":"Journal of Comparative Physiology B-Biochemical Systems and Environmental Physiology","doi":null,"issn":"0174-1578","eissn":"1432-136X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c14fbb1f-8aeb-49f0-b1da-f6dec395f20e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e554772467f0034f0c4438","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709227878c28a047390bcd","5e709227878c28a047390bcf","61e554772467f0034f0c443c","5e70922d878c28a04739129b","5e709227878c28a047390bd3","5e709227878c28a047390bd1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The basal metabolic rate (BMR) accounts for 60-70% of the daily energy expenditure (DEE) in sedentary humans and at least 50% of the DEE in laboratory mice in the thermoneutral zone. Surprisingly, however, the significance of the variation in the BMR is largely overlooked in translational research using such indices as physical activity level (PAL), i.e., the ratio of DEE/BMR. In particular, it is unclear whether emulation of human PAL in mouse models should be carried out within or below the thermoneutral zone. It is also unclear whether physical activity within the thermoneutral zone is limited by the capacity to dissipate heat generated by exercise and obligatory metabolic processes contributing to BMR. We measured PAL and spontaneous physical activity (SPA) in laboratory mice from two lines, divergently selected towards either high or low level of BMR, and acclimated to 30 degrees C (i.e., the thermoneutral zone), 23 or 4 degrees C. The mean PAL did not differ between both lines in the mice acclimated to 30 degrees C but became significantly higher in the low BMR mouse line at the lower ambient temperatures. Acclimation to 30 degrees C reduced the mean locomotor activity but did not affect the significant difference observed between the selected lines. We conclude that carrying out experiments within the thermoneutral zone can increase the consistency of translational studies aimed at the emulation of human energetics, without affecting the variation in physical activity correlated with BMR."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062178","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"192","pagesFromTo":"161–169","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00360-021-01410-9.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e554772467f0034f0c443c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Selewestruk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4bb80788-bb96-4284-bdf6-88c8a37fdace"},{"objectId":"5e70922d878c28a04739129b","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Książek","uuid":"5187C20476DE263ED4E9A462A14B824B6CE924F80CA1BBAB5DE5F62C79560C49204EC7E3479A79BCD2F718A00FC110D69791AC8890EE1ABE79B208C91B54A3FA","orcidId":"0000-0003-1796-9005","documentHash":"caccc60a-2dd7-4f51-a102-b3a2ec9e27f7"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390bd3","name":"Julita","lastName":"Sadowska","uuid":"94F34984FD0FFA3A80983EAF504AAC1E6D98EE7FF5BBBE418A41C4A27E261AED817ECD7542CD45A98BB2220AECC556C6CD1CA7661BA7EF7E6C42D0A9C61094A5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1457-5254","documentHash":"2b107327-2663-4cdc-be89-208cfa064a90"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390bd1","name":"Marek","lastName":"Konarzewski","uuid":"7AE3933BBF6A50893819221323057CAE956B9D65A0C8C60B33CD552F161D1F95B917981B2FE3074966473FB54AD92AB5C7C915433E4254794D48356F4794C872","orcidId":"0000-0001-7428-6521","documentHash":"04fafbb2-8ddc-4858-bcaa-b754c4cd5576"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390bcf","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Gębczyński","uuid":"6D6477EFA0BF75D5C511B002A096821FA98AAF9894F48C2A5C46B5C384B097605A5F8C0A6B02D4B6D70587FBFCE805793402AF2D832F1BEDA14236F219486383","orcidId":"0000-0003-1711-2175","documentHash":"c3b2cb7f-5ae1-4f13-ac05-2fa5005f9ac8"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390bcd","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Brzęk","uuid":"9C3EC71A21DBD200F68F5B5C9CCBDC772428FE733468D94C24B4C9D42454BC73A0850BDE2735BAEBD165A05B34F88C1C1505117081F97B839AF67AF1CC2672CB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4524-3834","documentHash":"506708a0-abb2-4d32-821b-f12603f45de4"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00360-021-01410-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9781032118901","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet

and finishing elements of buildings are willingly made of architectural aluminum, mainly as window and door profiles, facades or elevations. Corrosion resistance of such building elements can be affected by the external environment and mechanical loads - both static and dynamic. However, to the date, commonly accepted tests of corrosion resistance of aluminum construction elements do not provide mechanical exposures related to the working environment of the final product (eg. vibrations, wind loads) and physical loads (e.g. temperature changes). Having this in mind, the aim of this manuscript was to determine the impact of selected mechanical and physical loads on the corrosion resistance of architectural aluminum. The experimental results revealed that the temperature above 60 °C can greatly affect the properties of EN AW-6063 aluminum alloy. At the same time, we concluded that the mechanical deformation of tested material did not affect anti-corrosion performance of anodized aluminum alloy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062181","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"50","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710222001413?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f8514ed085dcb410a25ed06","name":"ADRIAN","lastName":"CHLANDA","uuid":"1C7F4E6AF106B418AF876543BE2BFDFA770C360EE8CFEA31A149F23C21803B474C794C4BF3733F934BB4D2467FD079BB0FED7BC674E8EDB1B93591BD90FE41CC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8795-7563","documentHash":"042a9f29-a175-4521-9242-ba628e9aa7d9"},{"objectId":"5e7093b1878c28a0473af3c5","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Sudoł","uuid":"4E983E0C4A7C6BD2DB14D221D21A0C0029B3AAF748CB42F1D7170831288A0B156AD86292262A5E6B6C7FA89790B4B054CCA3DDC30945C72F1D37400903935CBA","orcidId":"0000-0003-2902-0497","documentHash":"65e376f7-9a0c-444b-a87b-93771d664769"},{"objectId":"5e7093ac878c28a0473aed75","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Strąk","uuid":"B5BD10DDD253BBB8FD746281330E292CC164B5312DABDD32AE7AEC086C545AF07F94B93621A6E478E3693BD92D7808CFD54726044C8508ED33DCAC30778B5324","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc73658a-718d-415a-bbc3-326873063f0f"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473ace8c","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Małek","uuid":"F1564F77B1B204F94BAFA7E480B3C9372506C65B2CBA389970E6928802462E8496F62DDCD135B93316D4287AA78934848BF04A12A5BDA74A983E70F87F1350F4","orcidId":"0000-0001-5086-3574","documentHash":"3d8057fd-52eb-47b0-83d6-3ad04ce3c3c8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jobe.2022.104128"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ARAMIS SRX","dynamic interactions","dynamic measurements","dynamic vibrations"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dynamic Measurements of Building Structures Based on the ARAMIS SRX Measurement System","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"620102cf2467f06fa4341dd6","mniswId":null,"title":"Construction Technologies and Architecture","doi":null,"issn":"2674-1229","eissn":"2674-1237","websiteLink":"https://www.scientific.net/CTA","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"93192206-42ae-45a5-bcff-cff0be686fb5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620102cf2467f06fa4341dd3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709200878c28a04738e68e","5e709443878c28a0473b92a7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents the possibilities of dynamic measurements of building structures based on the ARAMIS SRX measurement system.

Therefore, it presents the potential and possible applications of IoT in healthcare management, as well as the challenges in its implementation and usage. The first section covers in detail the current use of the IoT in healthcare with the presentation of the architecture of these solutions. This section also discusses the motivation to design modern web-based solutions to support medicine. Current applications were presented both from the point of view of patients and medics. Then potential applications of IoT in healthcare and its management were discussed. Based on the analysis of existing solutions, additional possibilities that can significantly enrich and improve the existing systems are presented. The next section analyzes the challenges faced by IoT in healthcare management. Here, the focus is on identifying the main advantages, implementation, and functional barriers of IoT. Statistical data on the use of the current solutions are also presented in this section, and directions for further development are indicated. The possibilities of interaction between medics and patients via IoT technology are also discussed. Finally, in the form of a case study, two possibilities of using the IoT in healthcare management are presented.

The article aims to study features of the development of the international seaport under digitalization to implement the best achievements in Ukraine. The main research method was a systemic-structural approach used to examine seaport digitalization as a part of a logistics chain, including horizontal and vertical links between its elements. To achieve an effective digital transformation, we also used the above method. It helped to study how the factors determined during the study of international practices and possible innovations influence the object under study. The practices, which are of interest for Ukraine and other developing countries, were identified based on the international experience in seaports development under digitalization. The main strategic directions for the digital transformations of the above infrastructural objects were suggested. They involve increasing seaport competitiveness and their effectiveness in the framework of the international transport system. The directions are of interest for public authorities of the governmental and regional levels (while establishing the digitalization policy in the area of sea transport) and the port administrations (while making justified strategic decisions for their development)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062297","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e476282467f053b96a54c5","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"74e0f9f0-e9b6-49ee-98c0-caf237f67f2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"15-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://esciencepress.net/journals/index.php/IJAE/article/view/3879","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e476282467f053b96a54c3","name":"Oleksii","lastName":"Goretskyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2656-6120","documentHash":"ccfb6c31-fc0a-4dec-94c5-9839888be594"},{"objectId":"61e476282467f053b96a54c2","name":"Olha","lastName":"Petrenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1869-7999","documentHash":"e702ebb2-3e8d-45ee-816a-b08964d9add7"},{"objectId":"61e476282467f053b96a54c1","name":"Zagorodnia","lastName":"Yuliia","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0320-540X","documentHash":"7cee9b2b-0453-45cf-8828-88bbee1a9980"},{"objectId":"61e476282467f053b96a54c0","name":"Elena","lastName":"Chuprina","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9252-8114","documentHash":"20bbe254-d78f-4a16-a3e0-33009c0b66fc"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c131a","name":"Igor","lastName":"Britchenko","uuid":"6FAB28D9E3F09D59E19BF9BB643EDC41844196ADC1AD31ABAB1E673CF04B12FFA9B6CA7112B6D9D784D4A3A38753D3EB226D31B0C8B99047F06A387576149BFB","orcidId":"0000-0002-9196-8740","documentHash":"ca873fdd-6479-4c57-b62f-12ade9b34f0d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","uid":"bPoyZM9sTF7DfGYlClitONQ","uuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","parentUuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","rootUuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","name":"Instytut Techniki Budowlanej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709494878c28a0473bfd99","5e7092d0878c28a04739d354"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wpływ montażu nawiewnika powietrza zewnętrznego na izolacyjność cieplną okna","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abf1ad204581b62ebae5","mniswId":"201101","title":"Materiały Budowlane","doi":null,"issn":"0137-2971","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"16160178-01e4-429f-b2ad-a7893f548af9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6200fd402467f06fa433db15","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d0878c28a04739d354","5e709494878c28a0473bfd99"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W świetle obowiązujących przepisów budowlanych [1], stolarka okienna i drzwiowa powinna być szczelna, a dopływ powietrza zewnętrznego do pomieszczeń, w ilości niezbędnej na potrzeby wentylacyjne, należy zapewnić przez urządzenia nawiewne umieszczane w oknach, drzwiach balkonowych lub w innych częściach przegród zewnętrznych.

most important element in the recent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is intended to reduce the concentration of aid distributed under the direct support system, is the so-called redistributive payment. The redistributive effects of this instrument depend on its specific form implemented at the national level, the level of funding, and the area structure of holdings in a given country. The objective of this paper is to compare the targeting of the support distributed under the redistributive payment in the three new Member States of the European Union – Bulgaria, Lithuania and Poland. In order to achieve this objective, it was established which area groups of holdings benefit from (and which lose out on) the application of the redistributive payment in each country.

cross-contamination is a significant area of food allergen management (FAM) caused by the presence of unintended allergens in food products. In this study, a list of allergen transmission vectors (ATVs) and allergen cross-contact (ACC) control measures were identified, and their prevalence was determined in 36 small food businesses (SFBs). Based on the data and using a T-shaped matrix diagram (T-SMD), a concise ACC control plan was developed and assessed. The utility of the plan, expressed as the Document Usability Index (DUI), was determined and weighted taxation scores for the criteria of DUI ranged from 0.2 to 2.7, while the relative value of DUI was 0.66. Thus, as a user-friendly document, the plan was implemented in four SFBs and operated for nine months. To assess the performance of the ACC control plan, three indicators were established, including the number of complaints concerning food allergens, the number of ACC control measures used, and the number of non-compliances identified during internal audits focused on ACC control. During the trial period, complaints appeared only once in two SFBs.  Before the plan was applied, the number of ACC control measures used was 6-10, while after the application of the T-SMD control plan, the number ranged from 14 to 17. In all SFBS, a decreasing tendency in the number of non-compliances was observed, and the relative number of non-compliances during three-quarters of the control plan operation reached 0.4-0.55, 0.36-0.4 and 0.09-0.2, respectively. The results of this work showed the effectiveness of the ACC control plan in the form of T-SMD to control unintentionally added allergens affecting food safety. The results of the study may be very useful for SFBs in the context of recommendations related to allergen control included in the new version of  General Principles of Food Hygiene (CXC 1-1969, 2020) as well as in the context of amendments to the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Hygiene of Foodstuffs (EC, 2021)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062465","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"135","pagesFromTo":"108777","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.108777","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fd91","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Dzwolak","uuid":"E9EA32AC60608A8024D627C5552D28F46B8CB3CD9AEBE2B066C35C0B6E5EE1AED78515CDAED502C2C1E81A4639966B3745A4155A6749314473D116EB22A18543","orcidId":"0000-0002-8331-3349","documentHash":"7a14b35a-f9dc-4dfc-82e2-1d25ff686849"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.108777"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Magnetic nanoflowers","Magnetic hydrogels","Graphene oxide","Magnetic hyperthermia","3D printing"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","uid":"b6BkjFeIM7Ot5q0lVE0xCWg","uuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","parentId":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","parentUuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","rootId":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","rootUuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Mikroelektroniki i Fotoniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709450878c28a0473ba4d4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Graphene oxide modulates inter-particle interactions in 3D printable soft nanocomposite hydrogels restoring magnetic hyperthermia responses","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547858e","mniswId":"10561","title":"Journal of Colloid and Interface Science","doi":null,"issn":"0021-9797","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"03411993-095f-4585-8676-69d2f52d3c32"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f08486f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61e52dca2467f0034f084870","61e52dca2467f0034f084871","61e52dca2467f0034f084872","61e52dca2467f0034f084873","61e52dca2467f0034f084875","5e709450878c28a0473ba4d4","61e52dca2467f0034f084876","61e52dca2467f0034f084877","61e52dca2467f0034f084878","61e52dca2467f0034f084879","61e52dca2467f0034f08487a","61e52dca2467f0034f08487b","61e52dca2467f0034f08487c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hydrogels loaded with magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles that can be patterned and which controllably induce hyperthermic responses on AC-field stimulation are of interest as functional components of next-generation biomaterials. Formation of nanocomposite hydrogels is known to eliminate any Brownian contribution to hyperthermic response (reducing stimulated heating) while the Néel contribution can also be suppressed by inter-particle dipolar interactions arising from aggregation induced before or during gelation. We describe the ability of graphene oxide (GO) flakes to restore the hyperthermic efficiency of soft printable hydrogels formed using Pluronics F127 and PEGylated magnetic nanoflowers. Here, by varying the amount of GO in mixed nanocomposite suspensions and gels, we demonstrate GO-content dependent recovery of hyperthemic response in gels. This is due to progressively reduced inter-nanoflower interactions mediated by GO, which largely restore the dispersed-state Néel contribution to heating. We suggest that preferential association of GO with the hydrophobic F127 blocks increases the preponderance of cohesive interactions between the hydrophilic blocks and the PEGylated nanoflowers, promoting dispersion of the latter. Finally we demonstrate extrusion-based 3D printing with excellent print fidelity of the magnetically-responsive nanocomposites, for which the inclusion of GO provides significant improvement in the spatially-localized open-coil heating response, rendering the prints viable components for future cell stimulation and delivery applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062477","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f08487e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"611","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"8ab3c4af-4090-4bce-92c3-27215d3ce02f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"611","pagesFromTo":"533-544","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0021979721021792?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f08487c","name":"Jacek K.","lastName":"Wychowaniec","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6597-5242","documentHash":"8dbe18e6-6bff-425a-8142-a63d795b61cb"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f08487b","name":"Dermot F.","lastName":"Brougham","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e50eb9e-7a60-46a3-8c00-1f18dc8f19b8"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f08487a","name":"Brian J.","lastName":"Rodriguez","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9419-2717","documentHash":"2e72f9a8-3e1f-4615-bfa0-4ea77c63d3d4"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f084879","name":"Liam","lastName":"Jowett","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4386-109X","documentHash":"585157f5-e382-4060-922d-d334c2209ad7"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f084878","name":"Katie","lastName":"McGarry","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ae3e264-c017-4c2d-baa4-206d7c7d461f"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f084877","name":"Cara","lastName":"Moloney","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2230-6612","documentHash":"0a91fcf8-135e-489c-ab89-ec8d3b17f2d3"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f084876","name":"Eoin","lastName":"McKiernan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4cf2bf08-2de6-47be-b403-98cb886c3a38"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f084875","name":"Sameer","lastName":"Shingte","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4622-2592","documentHash":"b3b2e2ef-3f4a-456a-b1d3-031a220c7f76"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f084873","name":"Srikanth","lastName":"Kolagatla","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa0d1484-87c1-450c-8b86-c0c0a066754f"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f084872","name":"Krutika","lastName":"Singh","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7016-1542","documentHash":"52827b81-8731-4fcc-97f8-d94a37b11e78"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f084871","name":"Edward","lastName":"Gannon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b431b7bf-4c5b-401d-9f43-bb71484483c5"},{"objectId":"61e52dca2467f0034f084870","name":"Esther","lastName":"Rani Aluri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"040cb18d-05ed-4547-ac8a-f01167dac6de"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba4d4","name":"Krystian","lastName":"Kowiorski","uuid":"39D3B82454FD9FE7A81A0BE570F4443FE32CFF9336CE131E9B97F02E6B05B976C656B968D1052E8D99D4C80A649B54FDC9649CFBE15BB357ED8001DCE11C5AD3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3857-3413","documentHash":"81a58189-02fa-4971-b645-a9ad6865fc8b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jcis.2021.12.048"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9b","uid":"bYCUNhDROBwukUMKDm2MWgQ","uuid":"c21fd2c0-91d1-4bec-849c-ed0cf62231ec","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9b","parentUuid":"c21fd2c0-91d1-4bec-849c-ed0cf62231ec","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9b","rootUuid":"c21fd2c0-91d1-4bec-849c-ed0cf62231ec","name":"Instytut Botaniki im.

The electrolyte came from Polish copper electrorefineries with the content of main components, g/dm3: 49.6 Cu, 160 H2SO4. The electrolyte was enriched in bismuth by Bi2O3 addition. Purification of bismuth contamination was carried out using selected agents with adsorbing effects, such as barium hydroxide octahydrate, strontium carbonate, barium carbonate, barium and lead sulfates. The trials were performed until achieving the Bi level—below 0.1 g/dm3. During the experiments, it was noticed that electrolyte purification degree depends on initial Bi concentration in electrolyte, time and temperature, as well as on the type and amount of the bismuth-lowering agent. The most satisfactory results of Bi impurity removal were with additions of barium hydroxide octahydrate, strontium carbonate and barium carbonate to electrolyte at 60 °C for 1 h. These parameters revealed the highest electrolyte purification degree. Bismuth is not removed effectively from electrolytes by barium sulfate or lead sulfate addition. The efficiency of the purification process is much higher when the agents are added to the solution in the form of carbonates or hydroxides. Extending the electrolyte purification process time may cause dissolution of bismuth from the resulting precipitate and increase of bismuth concentration in

seek various relationships, such as board interlocks, with other firms to reduce resource dependencies. The consistent theoretical expectation and empirical finding that physical proximity is an important driver for board interlock formation is seemingly at odds with the emerging and growing literature on transnational board interlock ties. We argue that the effect of proximity on multinational corporation (MNC) board interlock formation can also be attributed to the firms’ internationalization strategy, namely, when they have co-located subsidiaries in foreign markets. We call this “proximity at a distance”. We test our assumptions on a dataset covering almost 43,000 board interlocks among MNC headquarters and their 12 million subsidiary co-location pairs. We confirm that proximity among headquarters increases the odds of interlocking but also find robust evidence that co-located subsidiaries also increase firms’ propensity to interlock, particularly for transnational board interlocks. Our results help provide an explanation for the “paradox of distance” by showing that the interlock between two distant MNCs may be driven by proximity to their foreign subsidiaries. As such, we illustrate how MNCs’ resource-dependent strategic responses can occur at the headquarters level to address uncertainties experienced at the subsidiary level."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062540","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62989dbd40970757143a1236","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"31","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"b8a29c19-9429-4f15-b885-1ad9c6b372d1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"art. 101971 (1-13)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S096959312100189X?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62023b272467f0694678cf97","name":"Frank W.","lastName":"Takes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05ac76d7-9a71-4ac5-bfae-3211cfb4c17d"},{"objectId":"62023b272467f0694678cf96","name":"Andreja","lastName":"Jaklič","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6ae54752-ce8a-4457-ac93-d3035b293a5a"},{"objectId":"62023b272467f0694678cf95","name":"Eelke M.","lastName":"Heemskerk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b26ae8f2-b46f-4956-ad8d-6853811de45d"},{"objectId":"62023b272467f0694678cf94","name":"Javier","lastName":"Garcia-Bernardo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4dc8a6a5-8b40-4a07-9e69-dbc12fa63770"},{"objectId":"62023b272467f0694678cf93","name":"Stefano","lastName":"Elia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1df3500b-8acf-4abd-befe-ded49ac75c90"},{"objectId":"62023b272467f0694678cf92","name":"Filip","lastName":"De Beule","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"66aeaa37-f9e6-49b4-89a7-b071feffbe23"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a99","name":"Michał","lastName":"Zdziarski","uuid":"A5DB12415197D18B00CDBF93A292589B5BDE5745EFE500F7FB04A4C72019F901014402E9CA140C2602D34DCD8CCEE274549895819CE9108E16A3A235C4DC6235","orcidId":"0000-0002-5911-0090","documentHash":"52e8bf39-d986-45aa-983c-416845865e7c"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101971"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ANCA, ANCA-associated vasculitis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, myeloperoxidase, proteinase-3"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df03","uid":"b4veTbuuCs521MZn4wtBy7g","uuid":"9c6822f9-1756-44d0-b072-c70b22665365","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df03","parentUuid":"9c6822f9-1756-44d0-b072-c70b22665365","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df03","rootUuid":"9c6822f9-1756-44d0-b072-c70b22665365","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medyczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["620374b42467f03b337e07a3"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","uid":"brcyYgRgvEjIItaX3WfS4aA","uuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","parentUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","rootUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","name":"Narodowy Instytut Geriatrii, Reumatologii i Rehabilitacji im. prof. dr hab. med.

In\nover 90% of cases, PR3-ANCA are associated with GPA. However, they are also rarely found\nin MPA and EGPA. On the other hand, MPO-ANCA being characteristic for MPA (>90% of\ncases), are also found in about 40% of EGPA and 5% of GPA patients. On the ground of this\noverlap, clinical importance of ANCA specificity identification has been questioned.\nPatients and methods We conducted a multicenter study AAV patients (417–GPA, 106–\nMPA, 102-EGPA; diagnosed between 1990 and 2016), included in the POLVAS registry.\nData were systematically collected according to a standardized protocol.\nResults In the ANCA positive group (anti-MPO, anti-PR3) male to female ratio was 1:1,\nwhereas in ANCA negative subgroup - 1:2, regardless of the AAV diagnosis. Anti-MPO\nantibodies were present in a significantly older patients. Patients with MPO+ GPA and MPO+\nEGPA were older than those with corresponding ANCA-negative GPA and EGPA as well as\nPR3+ AAV. Moreover, ANCA-negative AAV were characterized by a low risk of ESKD and\ndeath.\nConclusions The presence and specificity of ANCA in AAV patients is related to sex and\nage, determines their organ involvement and influences mortality as previously shown.\nPatients with MPO-ANCA-positive AAV constitute a clinically homogeneous group, whereas\nPR3-ANCA-positive patients are much more clinically heterogeneous. ANCA negative AAV\npatients are characterized by better prognosis. Thus, ANCA identification is an indispensable\nelement and should not be omitted in establishing AAV diagnosis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062544","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f88ccd409707099271b29f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"132","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"03ef385f-d4a7-4ea4-80c0-accbc01283ac"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"132","pagesFromTo":"16187, 1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://pamw.pl/en/node/16187/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620374b42467f03b337e07a3","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kur-Zalewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9efb94ca-2311-4d11-b0bd-01d5e2f73935"},{"objectId":"5f9edb01085dcb3b6122bee0","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Storoniak","uuid":"5EF787AF74C71BA0E7BE21F8510404D0B05FCD1B70DE0A4C8CC8C9671ED8A372991A2DA696F32CF3301A4609A2CDC750607889D60619E549AEB54E021A2B00C8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef6d755c-a823-4100-8709-7d2a9ac20dbf"},{"objectId":"5ebedcfd752340254fc423f3","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wisłowska","uuid":"94EE2C6837F99A39525A7396EAE012B1F845AE87FE66B67B0D3F50C6BA83A58F944EDD2B64A11FB6BE4977FDE944D32B8DE8CABD0C5CD781D609AD7DA20D9562","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a026c76-8e4a-4113-a49f-43e70ff79535"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b54dc","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Jakuszko","uuid":"E8ACF77494898068C1970DEB397AE9FF3D074D129DB3B808C517E1BDB0194E274E984A920E66A2DCD9918F04C35FBD153CCFF28B0C3B01BD0D8CDE87F89A4D40","orcidId":"0000-0002-1693-5201","documentHash":"5b805adc-18fa-4bdf-9e9a-372d15d0a6db"},{"objectId":"5e70937b878c28a0473aac33","name":"Anna","lastName":"Masiak","uuid":"92A1587C526B793798852CDCABE1EC8B92179DBB6D15B3671BAE542F1E24B9227D5B15A8C5BD0A91C1D0D68750841CF5D6896D8DF6443BA3DA21018CAB1E60A0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6687-2408","documentHash":"9c1f3a43-e58f-4af1-b453-cf8f81dce6b0"},{"objectId":"5e709369878c28a0473a9126","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Brzosko","uuid":"3773665881035FE70D4758BF95392327C2A88BEB61F2980CAF2400090E24F49D5F40AA8C171D1BD308820CDD6855E20D44EE3FDE87EBC5AF9CC4716D794BD7FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1646-4147","documentHash":"d3b64521-97b1-42a8-b2ee-422f97bb8fa7"},{"objectId":"5e70931b878c28a0473a2f6a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Hawrot-Kawecka","uuid":"A17D6BCCF54144F515027FD3FBEFA0C7505EAC9B4407E15DB7D2BFC9327BB34A02CFF224641802855B6BBC648813482801D363830B00762368FDA4FEA5B172E5","orcidId":"0000-0001-7771-8721","documentHash":"872def43-a6a9-49dd-a06a-88a0d0cfdafa"},{"objectId":"5e70931a878c28a0473a2df9","name":"Eugeniusz","lastName":"Kucharz","uuid":"1A37FEFF06F727B5DB1ABB958543A792FA60566D7F8988ECA443699F0A940F99EB41F5E6CDAE453F4B1C7AE0A6D861857D5C03A6FA9B11BFA63EA17A3AA00DCD","orcidId":"0000-0001-5571-8114","documentHash":"45545264-a4b6-4ff3-a990-9a40455ddb2d"},{"objectId":"5e709317878c28a0473a2bd7","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"BC274D4B301062665039DC9363EF8C69155FD2D05388E1B59B6F34A59F870AE89B430A1396640242C9D9329EC42DD62DB51A95C9FC99CF09B384BF9A7251B68D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f18dce6e-9063-469b-9655-0379608d45f9"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a13f1","name":"Marta","lastName":"Madej","uuid":"81BA5E5DE4DA7B4C335D7A7CAC284AB39F4FD3E6E247E485D4501AE877083B2C1DBF3076ADE92B0EB87F36D1952EC425AB05FEF487E1131129613B9D9FDB3856","orcidId":"0000-0002-4523-9272","documentHash":"1f6035b6-ac8b-4df8-ba39-6a52ccb9bd19"},{"objectId":"5e7092c7878c28a04739c79f","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Jeleniewicz","uuid":"F36AFFD8CEFD10B59571E59F38AD294FB6F4D287CC0D580604E41C7DF9B4D6F6E491A8922B9EFFC1B0E8D9A49F849F3EE5E54F6097F33F8276D3BB8BB381848F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf3d8a86-c66c-437a-93cd-206ee196e677"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473918cf","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Głuszko","uuid":"3DBD50CDBAEA7CDDD6F3B39AC3B2ED417AB904E005AD4B5DFCB20126A358BA2A1D64ABDD01C091FB1AA8B1882FFE6A0D8DD5BC4410DB4003EC4CCDB3FF423981","orcidId":"0000-0001-5717-4472","documentHash":"732287e0-cc29-4df6-93f6-8a5fe452b638"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"białoruski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Belarusian Studies, Anarchism, Anarchist Studies, History of Communism, Russian Revolution 1905, History of Belarus, Russian Revolution 1917"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deab","uid":"bsFXqcMUEmm0C4RhCx2RNvg","uuid":"0160a6a0-6886-44b8-bbf8-4296df6c35ec","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deab","parentUuid":"0160a6a0-6886-44b8-bbf8-4296df6c35ec","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deab","rootUuid":"0160a6a0-6886-44b8-bbf8-4296df6c35ec","name":"Instytut Historii im.

The authors’ conversion method can be applied with the aim of maintaining a balance between households, producers, and public administration services in line with the principles of sustainable development of the information society in Poland. To achieve this goal, the authors identified the differences between the results obtained using the conversion method and the results produced by other methods such as TOPSIS, Promethee II, and PROSA involving the same group of respondents. A hypothesis was made about the existence of significant differences in the results obtained as part of the studies. The research was carried out on a sample of nearly 830 ratings concerning the 27 most popular electronic banks in Poland. As part of the survey, the respondents assessed 18 characteristics (attributes) of the selected banks using a simplified Likert scale. The study was conducted during the pandemic in Poland in 2020. The authors compared the results achieved in the case of the TOPSIS, Promethee II, and PROSA methods and the ones obtained with the application of the conversion method. Then, the ratings of the e-banking websites were arranged in descending order, and the distances between the positions in the rankings obtained by the conversion method and other methods were calculated. In addition, the R2 correlation coefficients were calculated for all combinations of the results received using individual methods. The results showed the greatest differences both in the absolute distances between the positions obtained in the ranking and the lowest value of the R2 correlation coefficient in the case of the conversion method in relation to the other methods. The limitation of the present research resulted from the fact that the study sample included respondents who were all members of the academic environment. The students analyzed in the study were part of a group supporting globalization processes where e-business solutions are widely used. However, the purchases of goods and services both local and foreign made by this group were often limited in scope and value due to a lack of funds. The research results indicate a potential need for improvement of the conversion method."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062554","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c2dfca2467f057531dd187","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"35d7af3b-28f3-4dc0-94a1-73c4071fb0ad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/378/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b5720","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zborowski","uuid":"D4A765E09571B53E620F6CC8998C7E6569CC0F39A8CBB110D306271F75F2C45CA653142888DB311069F3584348CB79375B48F1F9A05B062FE3DFC47D807DEA93","orcidId":"0000-0003-4762-127X","documentHash":"3f463cec-c734-4918-aab8-c74f5c9cd1d9"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397dee","name":"Witold","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"4172C6FE20E1A73994A7DD4D5C925304F13832BB5B7BC8F08A9A5E5D1EAFCF161C48AD6533901322CF3E62277EC66C29A427749B09425E82D89D3FDD949FE121","orcidId":"0000-0002-9189-1675","documentHash":"114202ab-fd6d-4de5-9801-f21c6440e901"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010378"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["concrete","environmental management","fired clay brick","PET bottles","waste recycling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Recycling of PET Bottles Into Different Types of Building Materials: a Review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771a4","mniswId":"1678","title":"Archives of Metallurgy and Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1733-3490","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"www.imim.pl/wydawnictwo","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"690eb37e-8fda-4efb-8ca9-27eaab890cb9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2021-11-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620112ab2467f06fa435054f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["620112ab2467f06fa4350550","620112ab2467f06fa4350551","620112ab2467f06fa4350552","620112ab2467f06fa4350553","620112ab2467f06fa4350554","620112ab2467f06fa4350555","620112ab2467f06fa4350556","5e709202878c28a04738e819","5e7093da878c28a0473b1e8b"]},"issue":"Iss.1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this globalized era, building materials play an essential role in the civil engineering field. Nowadays, with the increase in population, the demand for construction activities is also increasing. Polyethylene (PET) bottles are among the most widely used materials and cause an abundance of non-degradable waste, at about 0.94 million tonnes in Malaysia. One of the alternatives to reduce this waste's environmental impact is to incorporate it inside building materials such as brick and concrete. As PET bottles' recycling is highly promoted, the physical and mechanical properties of building materials made from PET bottles have also been reviewed. The data analysis shows that the compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength and density of building materials decreases as the percentage of PET waste increases. However, other properties such as water absorption, initial absorption rate, and firing shrinkage increase proportionally with the PET waste. Besides, heavy metals in these building materials comply with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards. It can be concluded that the percentage of PET waste incorporated into brick and concrete must be less than 5% and 2%, respectively, to produce suitable materials to provide alternatives in reducing and recycling PET waste."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058062585","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.67","pagesFromTo":"189-196","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.imim.pl/files/archiwum/Vol1_2022/23.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620112ab2467f06fa4350556","name":"Mohd
