This extensive bidirectional English-Polish corpus of original parliamentary contributions paired with professional simultaneous interpretations includes 11 European Parliament debates held between January 2016 and February 2020. The main topic of these debates is the rule of law crisis triggered by the Law and Justice government in Poland. The corpus contains over 157,000 tokens and about 20 h 45 min of recordings, counting both source and target texts. The two interpreting directions (English-Polish and Polish-English) are represented almost evenly. The annotation of the corpus completed so far includes mark-up information, POS tagging, labelling disfluency phenomena, and all forms of explicitating shifts. Manual annotation for personal deixis is in progress. An additional interesting feature is the speaker identification performed employing the X-vector method, which allowed us to identify 36 interpreters. We begin with an overview of the existing interpreting corpora. Then we proceed to explain the design features of the EP-Poland and report on two completed empirical studies analysing idiosyncratic interpreting behaviour. We conclude by outlining future development pathways and offering some remarks on corpus significance and its limitations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938e878c28a0473acb91"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f2ae","5e709274878c28a04739605e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"110-126","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f2ae","5e709274878c28a04739605e","5e70938e878c28a0473acb91"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1ec","mniswId":"6990","title":"Gema Online Journal of Language Studies","issn":"1675-8021","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"746c9cee-1cbb-44d5-9bc5-194c9a3db699"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62737b8a409707200058fd0d","year":"2022","volume":"22","number":"1","documentHash":"ce471e57-5ef3-4141-b2dd-05aebf2c40b4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["interpreting corpus","parallel corpus","simultaneous interpreting","political discourse","parliamentary interpreting"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108593"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61e67b772467f030e8b9321c","name":"Yanchun","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"c4cc7759-6916-4f25-87b5-8f93464d4780"},{"objectId":"61e67b772467f030e8b9321b","name":"Hua","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"7854c8fd-d76d-456d-8362-c9862ff14746"},{"objectId":"61e67b772467f030e8b9321a","name":"Jinli","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"3c28f1b1-6157-42f2-b508-576b9d7052c3"},{"objectId":"61e67b772467f030e8b93219","name":"Yong-Feng","lastName":"Ge","orcidId":"0000-0002-5955-6295","documentHash":"50b08975-c12d-45ad-a91f-83f77c368c44"},{"objectId":"5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca","name":"Maria","lastName":"Orłowska","uuid":"519D1C0859CDAF43088E1B927500ECFA0C80C433FE2DB88C6A0260CE88DA85C78A3E16FE02020B42034E9342568C4E346F6DF0547B240983432610969C2C0F12","orcidId":"0000-0002-5234-7925","documentHash":"a661f1c1-9398-4352-a3ba-08b15a0464cb"}],"objectId":"61e67b772467f030e8b93217","doi":"10.1007/s00778-021-00718-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00778-021-00718-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"MDDE: multitasking distributed differential evolution for privacy-preserving database fragmentation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Database fragmentation has been used as a protection mechanism of database’s privacy by allocating attributes with sensitive associations into separate data fragments. A typical relational database consists of multiple relations. Thus, fragmentation process is applied to each relation separately in a sequential manner. In other words, the existing database fragmentation approaches regard each relation fragmentation problem as an independent task. When solving a sequence of fragmentation problems, redundant computational resources are consumed when extracting the same fragmentation information and limit the performance of those algorithms. In this paper, a multitasking database fragmentation problem for privacy preservation requirements is formally defined. A multitasking distributed differential evolution algorithm is introduced, including a multitasking distributed framework enriched by two new operators. The introduced framework can help exchange generic and effective allocation information among different database fragmentation problems. A similarity-based alignment operator is proposed to adjust the fragment orders in different database fragmentation solutions. A perturbation-based mutation operator with adaptive mutation strategy selection is designed to sufficiently exchange evolutionary information in the solutions. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can outperform other competitors in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed, and scalability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61e67b772467f030e8b93219","61e67b772467f030e8b9321a","61e67b772467f030e8b9321b","61e67b772467f030e8b9321c","5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a8b","mniswId":"20183","title":"VLDB JOURNAL","issn":"1066-8888","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e061a227-ed2f-4d04-b9a8-0cdee5b48eaa"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Database fragmentation","Privacy preservation","Distributed differential evolution","Multitasking optimization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058121306"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62b2bf90409707737cefb8e2","name":"Mauricio","lastName":"Martinez","orcidId":"0000-0002-2859-5371","documentHash":"91c055f4-a866-4289-97b4-56d4d4f8f3f0"},{"objectId":"613971a99543c7051ff01bac","name":"Syo","lastName":"Kamata","uuid":"F17E23D5CE73DE108892A77F391E66CCC7669C4B9A9D1CF2AFFD4E8BAEC68DB49D308FD6C006BFE20825D6897F7625B801DD7EB6D09CBEA9DAD0B268B58E6640","orcidId":"0000-0001-6338-0395","documentHash":"d63c408f-54e9-444b-aced-eb3ffa2b17ae"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7e80","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Jankowski","uuid":"A1D0DEA27DBAD3AB0101B32C257953FDACECB9ECE5404A4170ABC05BA5C4B79B222AAF76D6B988C38C6BBEDD0CE67F6C748211FD60AAEF8877796A7F547F470D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8805-9282","documentHash":"c2ca41cf-fc50-4a08-a478-f80fd429d50f"}],"objectId":"62b2bf90409707737cefb8de","publicUri":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00653","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Novel features of attractors and transseries in non-conformal Bjorken flows","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this work we investigate the impact of conformal symmetry breaking on hydrodynamization of a far-from-equilibrium fluid. We find a new kind of transseries solutions for the non-conformal hydrodynamic equations of a longitudinal boost invariant expanding plasma. The new transseries solutions unveil a rich physical structure which arises due to the interplay of different physical scales. In the perfect fluid case the non-conformal speed of sound slows down the cooling of the temperature due to the emergence of logarithmic corrections that depends on the mass of the particle. These terms propagate into the perturbative and non-perturbative sectors of the transseries once viscous corrections are included. The logarithmic mass contributions increase the asymptotic value of the Knudsen number while decreasing the damping rate of the transient non-hydrodynamic modes. Consequently, hydrodynamization and the merging of the flows to the forward attractor take place at extremely long times. The early time free streaming expansion is modified and receives logarithmic mass corrections induced by the shear-bulk couplings. The global flow structure and numerical analyses carried out in our work demonstrate the existence of the early and late-time attractors for the shear viscous tensor and bulk pressure while providing a complete description of the non-linear hydrodynamization process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7e80"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["613971a99543c7051ff01bac","5e70935b878c28a0473a7e80","62b2bf90409707737cefb8e2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e729822467f01e930dca3a","title":"arXiv.org","issn":"2331-8422","websiteLink":"https://arxiv.org","documentHash":"dc347d92-8e2b-4200-a6ec-619a56ab8af8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058182556"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6275449e4097075854fa4cac","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Stankiewicz","documentHash":"3a8b406f-d446-4226-a35f-8f21babdafb9"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad026","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Baraniak","uuid":"0814D79B8470FAD42B6A301050EE934FEEDAB2F369AB541147482D5373C7552BC2E9FD7FC5606DBA193AE61E071DE1D4E4B5119AD7F8E0F1DA1611925C1164DA","documentHash":"69167e57-6dba-462d-a04f-10663fb09b92"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56d4","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Sydow","uuid":"84A190EA73DC7C5D0158FDAD16AB073B35A0592851243A9FDC361D24B7FAE779F06245038039787431F0BB8B6710D9D48DE99610F8754FA9233D0AD90B61F9AF","documentHash":"a70b122d-0b8a-4f01-816d-e9bfa6729a21"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-04-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6275449e4097075854fa4ca1","doi":"10.1145/3486622.3494007","publicUri":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3486622.3494007","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Bias detection in Wikipedia articles.

The chapter also briefly presents custom-built tools used in the making of the corpus, especially for transcription, text-audio alignment at word level and interpreter identification. To showcase PINC’s potential for analysing various aspects of simultaneous interpreting, we examined fluency parameters, such as speaking rate and pauses, in the Polish-English subcorpus. We found that interpreting speed was modulated by the source text speaking and articulation rate and the target text compression rate. Target texts had fewer but longer silent pauses and more numerous and longer filled pauses. Together with shorter runs, understood as utterances un-interrupted by pauses, this suggests more fragmented delivery of interpretations. We also found interesting individual differences in compression rate with the ma- jority of interpreters producing interpretations longer than the source texts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e147","uid":"bWR-Y98e3nELzxWWkq5oJLQ","uuid":"885ea93a-e275-40d0-ae52-203ce3630014","name":"Wydział

the larynx, has a profound influence on a patient’s quality of life. The procedure results in a loss of natural voice, which in effect constitutes a significant socio-psychological problem for the patient. The main aim of the study was to develop a statistical parametric speech synthesis system for a patient with laryngeal cancer, on the basis of the patient’s speech samples recorded shortly before the surgery and to check if it was possible to generate speech quality close to that of the original recordings. The recording made use of a representative corpus of the Polish language, consisting of 2150 sentences. The recorded voice proved to indicate dysphonia, which was confirmed by the auditory-perceptual RBH scale (roughness, breathiness, hoarseness) and by acoustical analysis using AVQI (The Acoustic Voice Quality Index). The speech synthesis model was trained using the Merlin repository. Twenty-five experts participated in the MUSHRA listening tests, rating the synthetic voice at 69.4 in terms of the professional voice-over talent recording, on a 0–100 scale, which is a very good result. The authors compared the quality of the synthetic voice to another model of synthetic speech trained with the same corpus, but where a voice-over talent provided the recorded speech samples. The same experts rated the voice at 63.63, which means the patient’s synthetic voice with laryngeal cancer obtained a higher score than that of the talent-voice recordings. As such, the method enabled for the creation of a statistical parametric speech synthesizer for patients awaiting total laryngectomy. As a result, the solution would improve the quality of life as well as better mental wellbeing of the patient."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"3188","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["637cceb24097073b7db5428c","5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-8220","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"91062cb9-24b0-4df6-9558-eaa12e105cea"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"626667df4097071c15d92751","year":"2022","volume":"22","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"4fb7e670-804f-4094-9952-685e9d1d9a06"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058313417"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70933c878c28a0473a56cf","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Przybyszewski","uuid":"CCAB89DAC555525CE789C6F19B59C08652D998E8FF86DE9EAB29620C52E123C243860CBEEA5162CCB9A5D7C15307299C6E6C3EC66288070211A2C6A06D009400","documentHash":"e782b3ff-f049-4da8-ab40-9f79780f7d59"}],"objectId":"637c93c14097073b7db165c7","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-08757-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-08757-8.pdf","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2022,"title":"Computational Science – ICCS 2022: 22nd International Conference, London, UK, June 21–23, 2022, Proceedings, Part III","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933c878c28a0473a56cf"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["637c93c14097073b7db165c8","637c93c14097073b7db165c9","637c93c14097073b7db165ca","637c93c14097073b7db165cb","637c93c14097073b7db165cc","637c93c14097073b7db165cd"],"AUTHOR":["5e70933c878c28a0473a56cf"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"9783031087561","issn":"0302-9743","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5e710c8046e0fb0001bafbe8","name":"Springer International Publishing","documentHash":"7da6ad07-afdb-476a-b74c-760b6a4b7135"},"editors":[{"objectId":"637c93c14097073b7db165cd","name":"Peter M.

One application is that of art authentication which assures that a piece of art is created by an artist. A certificate of authenticity created from proper art authentication significantly increases the value of a piece of art which impacts all parties in an art transaction. The models produced by machine learning algorithms provide an objective measure to authenticate an artist to their artwork collection. In the past ten years numerous machine learning algorithms have been used to address art authentication on a variety of datasets. Our work extends art authentication with residual neural networks and the Rijksmuseum data set. Our results show contributions is four key areas: A performance increase of 21% over the baseline for 958 artists; A new baseline for 1,199 artists; A standard methods for recreating the Rijksmuseum data set; and A standard method for measuring results from imbalanced data for the Rijksmuseum data set."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fe878c28a0473a0aad"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"200","pagesFromTo":"116933","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["637ccbfe4097073b7db501b4","5e7092fe878c28a0473a0aad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c8b","mniswId":"6463","title":"Expert Systems With Applications","issn":"0957-4174","documentHash":"86318bff-5ce7-4ae2-9671-96ea6abd2d57"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637ccbfe4097073b7db501b3","year":"2022","volume":"200","documentHash":"2986f580-5b46-42ed-83ad-b1ef444088c8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058321275"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"634580104097077ad4df63c7","name":"Agata","lastName":"Konarska","documentHash":"d92b594c-eef0-4c24-a605-c5b50659175e"},{"objectId":"634580104097077ad4df63c6","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kurasiński","documentHash":"2caf9793-0933-431c-8c8c-73d82d42440e"},{"objectId":"634580104097077ad4df63c5","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Piotrowska-Weryszko","documentHash":"540bfac2-64fd-444e-8151-48efdb03f374"},{"objectId":"634580104097077ad4df63c4","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kubik-Komar","documentHash":"4db913f7-c874-4b31-b40e-0ee7624bf3b0"},{"objectId":"634580104097077ad4df63c3","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Kubera","documentHash":"9234e13e-e3f5-46ff-99de-37ab8f74e937"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56dc","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Wieczorkowska","uuid":"46600514BED4E6C82715C2029D75BEF3C7DDD89FC89A0203B2F4679DC238BD5D11615665CE35053AADE03307F25EA17CD5E2AC5260E07A7542910599150CD8AC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2033-6372","documentHash":"dabddac0-46b5-4ec2-b3f0-cca192eccb56"}],"objectId":"634580104097077ad4df63c2","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-16564-1_21","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-16564-1_21","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Towards Automation of Pollen Monitoring: Image-Based Tree Pollen Recognition","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pollen monitoring helps predict the risk of pollen-induced allergies.

Besides introducing some of the basic principles of the ontology, we expound axiomatic fragments of its formalization and present ontological models of several use cases. GFO is a top-level ontology that integrates objects and processes into a unified framework, in a way that differs significantly from other ontologies. Another unique selling feature of GFO is its meta-ontological architecture, which includes set theory into ontology and which accounts for its specific role in common representation approaches. The second level of that architecture starts from the distinction of categories and individuals, which forms the backbone of the world’s structure. Furthermore, GFO comprises several kinds of categories, among them universals and concepts, and it considers several ontological regions and levels. In the context of this special issue paper, we study five pre-determined use cases from the perspective of GFO. The results of these analyses yield insights into how the ontology treats several important notions. Very abridged, this covers material objects and their composition; roles and social entities; properties with their relations to objects and processes, and their changing; changes of processes, including a functional perspective; and, eventually, the nature and changing of concepts as well as terminology. A final part summarizes application projects that use GFO in various contexts.

We propose a Semantic-aided Customer Attrition Management System (SaCAMS), in which we use reducts for feature engineering, apply hierarchical clustering to build the semantic similarity relationship among clients, run action rule mining to discover the actionable patterns, and extract meta-actions to get the final recommendations. The experimental results show that SaCAMS can discover high quality action rules. Moreover, based on the improved action rules, SaCAMS can extract effective meta-actions to generate recommendations.

The catalogue raisonné as a tangible asset suffers from the challenges of art authentication and impermanence. As the catalogue raisonné is born digital, the impermanence challenge abates, but the authentication challenge persists. With the popularity of artificial intelligence and its deep learning architectures of computer vision, we propose to address the authentication challenge by creating a new artefact for the digital catalogue raisonné: a digital classification model. This digital classification model will help art scholars with new artwork claims via a tool that authenticates a proposed artwork with an artist. We create this tool by training a machine learning model with 90 artists having at least 150 artworks and achieve an accuracy of 87.31%. We use the ResNet Convolutional Neural Network to improve accuracy and number of artist classes over state-of-the-art artist classification experiments using the WikiArt database.

Here, we compare for Saccharomyces cerevisiae an IFIT1-based mRNA pull-down with yeast targeted rRNA depletion by the RiboMinus method. IFIT1-based RNA capture depletes rRNA more effectively, producing high quality RNA-seq data with an excellent coverage of the protein coding transcriptome, while depleting cap-less transcripts such as mitochondrial or some non-coding RNAs.

As a result, many studies addressed up-to-day-ahead wind power forecasting. Taking into account the abilities of Machine Learning (ML) Models and their combinations, in this paper, the Authors would like to present the framework for 60-hour wind power forecasting in Poland. Possession of longer than one-day ahead of accurate wind power forecasts gives an ability to the Transmission System Operator (TSO) and Distribution System Operator (DSO) the to improve the control of grid traffic and assimilate more efficiently the Renewable Energy Sources (RES) generated power. The presented method uses the geographical coordinates of wind farms in the area of interest with their wind-power curves. It combines it with weather parameters such as wind speed and direction, wind gust, air temperature, and pressure for improved accuracy. The novelty of the proposed method is that model can adapt autonomously according to achieved past accuracy. A back-score accuracy has been tracked based on past predictions and measured wind power generation. Furthermore, the model combines different ML models that can be adapted or retrained if prediction performance drops below an acceptable level. In this paper, we would like to present a method and performance analysis of the adaptive ensemble-model method, whose accuracy has been calculated compared with actual data measured in the National Power System of Poland. Furthermore, the paper’s novelty is that the proposed method/framework can use only an approximate model of large wind generation at the beginning, and the model can be fine-tuned in the proposed method’s operation as a function of back-accuracy measurement triggering ensemble-model adaptation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a01ee"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"214–225","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709295878c28a0473985e7","5e7093de878c28a0473b22b4","5e709295878c28a04739859c","5e7092f7878c28a0473a01ee"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479bc1","mniswId":"540","title":"Advances in Science and Technology-Research Journal","issn":"2080-4075","eissn":"2299-8624","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d231421f-b42b-42c2-879b-aa7186856cf8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6385e91e40970769ab6c7b9a","year":"2022","volume":"16","number":"6","documentHash":"70685998-7f44-4eed-a3f7-e1e1fdb61f0b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["numerical weather prediction","forecasting","wind power","neural networks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058460848"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63e237a0409707409b7fc4b1","name":"Michał","lastName":"Srokosz","documentHash":"5f5daf43-cec6-4161-94d5-901cedd44c1a"},{"objectId":"63e23681409707409b7f9144","name":"Michal","lastName":"Wydra","documentHash":"c92321f6-4a77-45da-a6c3-cb1c7a967ad7"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a01ee","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Księżopolski","uuid":"BA6C821999D0FF9730DB175BAB46EC1E3ED7728C8877B3A9F9D388BD3C3D360F72AE1269F6D53BC7F44F35F59D7844B823C179E2638031E39957A04199D06FEB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1904-3222","documentHash":"517fbe44-b717-49e2-9f67-27a14cccc3ea"},{"objectId":"5e709277878c28a047396343","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bobyk","uuid":"06018EC011BA8362D87080296A9E514F88EF93DA1BF7BE36973475618A8A07DE54170D89D9FAEFDA9EFCD86AFE5418F7CCD807460214BE66C45C68966A417735","orcidId":"0000-0002-0854-3312","documentHash":"3873e588-d12b-4054-b344-c80d3f29c3d9"}],"objectId":"63e23681409707409b7f913f","doi":"10.3390/electronics12010251","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/1/251/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Machine-Learning-Based Scoring System for Antifraud CISIRTs in Banking Environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The number of fraud occurrences in electronic banking is rising each year. Experts in the field of cybercrime are continuously monitoring and verifying network infrastructure and transaction systems. Dedicated threat response teams (CSIRTs) are used by organizations to ensure security and stop cyber attacks. Financial institutions are well aware of this and have increased funding for CSIRTs and antifraud software. If the company has a rule-based antifraud system, the CSIRT can examine fraud cases and create rules to counter the threat. If not, they can attempt to analyze Internet traffic down to the packet level and look for anomalies before adding network rules to proxy or firewall servers to mitigate the threat. However, this does not always solve the issues, because transactions occasionally receive a “gray” rating. Nevertheless, the bank is unable to approve every gray transaction because the number of call center employees is insufficient to make this possible. In this study, we designed a machine-learning-based rating system that provides early warnings against financial fraud. We present the system architecture together with the new ML-based scoring extension, which examines customer logins from the banking transaction system.

We call this harmful effect self-induced bias, to emphasize that the bias is driven directly by the user’s past choices. In order to better understand the nature of self-induced bias of recommendation algorithms that are used by older adults with cognitive limitations, we have used agent-based simulation. Based on state-of-the-art results in psychology of aging and cognitive science, as well as our own empirical results, we have developed a cognitive model of an e-commerce client that incorporates cognitive decision-making abilities. We have evaluated the magnitude of self-induced bias by comparing results achieved by simulated\nagents with and without cognitive limitations due to age. We have also proposed new recommendation algorithms designed to counteract self-induced bias. The algorithms take into account user preferences and cognitive abilities relevant to decision making. To evaluate the algorithms, we have introduced 3 benchmarks: a simple product filtering method and two types of widely used recommendation algorithms: Content-Based and Collaborative filtering. Results indicate that the new algorithms outperform benchmarks both in terms of increasing the utility of simulated agents (both old and young), and in reducing self-induced bias."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933d878c28a0473a56dd"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be371"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"73-94","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6411661940970706bbc34712","5e70933d878c28a0473a56dd","5e70947c878c28a0473be371"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479fe7","mniswId":"10220","title":"Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing Research","issn":"2083-2567","eissn":"2449-6499","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"f3f4ef1b-902a-4d39-ba42-3de096751531"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Recommender systems","Cognitive limitations","Aging","E-commerce"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058539984"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56db","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Turska","uuid":"C03C99EBA4C9608E83ED198DC2F4BEA1C606AE55CAAC79669C6D25CCE32F48365F1E397BBD23CF5694609ABA0A33B43EF489E2D175ED6791B068E2CDF94F756A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8468-6470","documentHash":"74a3923e-cc23-4a84-b62a-cf06cd78c9aa"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396c09","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wiśniewski","uuid":"3CB23BACFCFE2579B84F6FF26C0CD6B9BAAEBDC0A0F64733930F6696FDD550BC02ED90CD57E54FDA331A436E2720AEA55FF857D4793A56986E52148921972331","documentHash":"67604eed-9a26-4af4-ad6f-0f4cc0fc23da"}],"objectId":"64084ef84097070bdc8112e6","doi":"10.1007/s00466-023-02275-1","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00466-023-02275-1.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Reduced representations of assumed fields for Hu–Washizu solid-shell element","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mixed eight-node (hexahedron) solid-shell elements based on the standard or partial version of the three-field Hu–Washizu (HW) functionals are developed for Green strain. Three reduced representations of the assumed stress/strain fields are selected. They improve effectiveness, yet retaining good accuracy and convergence properties. At the outset, the standard HW functional and the assumed stress/strain representations of the 3D solid element B8-15P (Weissman in Int J Numer Methods Eng 39:2337–2361, 1996) are used to derive a solid-shell element with 51 parameters. To eliminate locking, the ANS method is applied to the thickness strain (Betsch and Stein in Commun Numer Methods Eng 11:899–909, 1995) and to the transverse shear strain (Dvorkin and Bathe in Eng Comput 1:77–88, 1984). It is a correct element which, however, yields too large displacements for coarse meshes and trapezoidal through-thickness shapes. To improve the above formulation, the ζ-independent reduced representations of the assumed stress/ strain fields are selected and the transformations to Cartesian components are modified. The thickness strain is enhanced by the EAS method. The element with 35 parameters is derived from the standard/enhanced HW functional, but, to further reduce the assumed fields, partial/enhanced HW functionals are constructed from the 3D potential energy by applying the Lagrange multiplier method only to selected strain components. In the element with 27 parameters, this is applied to the constant in-plane strain and to the transverse shear strain while in the element with 19 parameters, to the constant in-plane strain only.Two other modifications are implemented to enhance the behavior of these elements: (A) the skew coordinates are used in the reduced representations of the in-plane stress/strain (Wisniewski and Turska in Int J Numer Methods Eng 90:506–536, 2012), and (B) the Residual Bending Flexibility correction of the transverse shear stiffness (MacNeal in Comput Struct 8(2):175–183, 1978) is adapted. Finally, the performance of the proposed solid-shell HW elements is demonstrated on several linear and non-linear examples for the linear elastic material and the hyper-elastic material. The proposed elements are compared to each other and to the best existing elements of this class."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik

Despite years of research, its detection still poses many challenges. This is partly because some individuals are perceived as truthful and reliable, even when lying. However, relatively little is known about these effective liars. In our study, we focused on the cognitive functioning of effective liars. We tested 400 participants who completed tasks measuring executive functions, verbal fluency, and fluid intelligence, and also made four statements (two true and two false, half of them written and half oral). The reliability of the statements was then assessed. Only fluid intelligence was found to be relevant for reliable lying. This relationship was only evident for oral statements, suggesting that the importance of intelligence is highlighted when statements are made spontaneously without prior preparation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec0","uid":"bxMU6aiRxamfjMzZfUkIOcA","uuid":"edaca7e9-18a0-430c-ac2f-bf3c373853cb","name":"Instytut Psychologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709470878c28a0473bd01a","5e709415878c28a0473b5ec0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec0","parentUuid":"edaca7e9-18a0-430c-ac2f-bf3c373853cb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec0","rootUuid":"edaca7e9-18a0-430c-ac2f-bf3c373853cb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","affiliatedPersonIDs":["643fd8d84097073cb69d30f1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["643fd8d84097073cb69d30f0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","uid":"bIPOz_WiDWR0kK88nqXox3A","uuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","name":"Instytut Podstaw Informatyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709344878c28a0473a5fb9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","parentUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","rootUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"69: 1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709415878c28a0473b5ec0","5e709470878c28a0473bd01a","643fd8d84097073cb69d30f0","643fd8d84097073cb69d30f1","5e709344878c28a0473a5fb9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f543","mniswId":"490560","title":"Journal of Intelligence","eissn":"2079-3200","metadataSource":"ERIH","documentHash":"312b6774-0c99-4bc9-aedb-e3265f81a014"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"643fd8d84097073cb69d30ef","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"4","documentHash":"d4c6bacf-fd63-4242-a61d-d03d0b33c5ab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["deception","deception detection","cognitive functions","intelligence"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058643155"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4e15","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Borkowski","uuid":"02CBACFFF5350B3B77841BF2ABB945AA953FFFC2C4C02A587029F65F18244E559F87820EF418E6E11220DE2697827A3F7489C6FDBB11D907A0068439B66B5F47","documentHash":"7298a86c-f65d-4289-ba98-0dbac960f162"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56d4","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Sydow","uuid":"84A190EA73DC7C5D0158FDAD16AB073B35A0592851243A9FDC361D24B7FAE779F06245038039787431F0BB8B6710D9D48DE99610F8754FA9233D0AD90B61F9AF","documentHash":"a70b122d-0b8a-4f01-816d-e9bfa6729a21"},{"objectId":"5e70933c878c28a0473a56d1","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Starosta","uuid":"9486EC06A1FBAA068B0B0A9E38404DEDF3281D83B58D7A96EC1CEE564C246FA1C4261EE10924F44040277D272B79265EDF7B15DE0EC5145D6375B6D565523C16","orcidId":"0000-0002-5554-4596","documentHash":"044eeb8a-df46-487e-9329-f356076d0fbb"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a047398476","name":"Mieczysław","lastName":"Kłopotek","uuid":"5C5ADFA1B79A710194D080C3D65B7A9A67F277995AADD9CE61E15528DBBF688AB5399453125A8BEBBE40E36941A0EBA94D49068903AD8560EBDB606FC4FA7EF0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4685-7045","documentHash":"1cad5b5b-84c1-4387-89d8-e590d0507475"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739383d","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Wierzchoń","uuid":"1761B33DFAA65C786359333D17105F0BEAC6C97337D262F8FB5008B7902BD2E1C2D7D55EEC840CBAB7AE61B1BCC05E68540E3855A52D03A9CDC7C0105A8DFC2B","orcidId":"0000-0001-8860-392X","documentHash":"446449d3-6b6f-4fd4-874e-bdd760b01ff9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64353e2c4097074edd5fdc77","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0283413","publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0283413","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Eigenvalue based spectral classification","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper describes a new method of classification based on spectral analysis.

Can VR space help remote teams connect: A seven-week study with Horizon Workrooms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In 2020, office life switched abruptly towards a remote work model. Office meetings have since moved to virtual spaces. Unfortunately, remote video meetings have become associated with declines in engagement, collaboration, and learning, as well as ‘Zoom fatigue’. In this article, we study the potential of virtual reality (VR) technology as a solution to these problems and as a medium to enrich remote work environments. For seven weeks, we collected data on the meetings of a team of eighteen knowledge workers. For five of those weeks, the meetings were organized in VR. We used a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to gather feedback on those sessions and to compare them with a regular video conferencing baseline. Our results demonstrate that both technologies have applications in the work environment—albeit in different situations. We provide best-practice guidelines for the use of VR by remote teams and present design implications for VR collaborative spaces."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5f5c1eac752340073806a9b7","uid":"bQguJlY7YSAbsff0rfgVzVQ","uuid":"89dfd9c7-5576-465d-8936-c50bea28c963","name":"Wydział Socjologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aecc2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","uid":"bV7b5PxMzYcN_S0F-CKP4Ow","uuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","name":"Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji — Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be297","5e7094b7878c28a0473c24b6"],"parentId":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","parentUuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","rootId":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","rootUuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a047398776"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"179","issue":"November 2023","pagesFromTo":"103104","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aecc2","5e7094b7878c28a0473c24b6","5e709295878c28a047398776","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","5e70947c878c28a0473be297"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478219","mniswId":"8995","title":"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES","issn":"1071-5819","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"52bb8b9f-7a1f-486a-88b9-6c7ffc0e9627"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64bfa7a040970714e086a91e","year":"2023","volume":"179","documentHash":"6aeeb21d-6963-4a37-b9f6-5dfffe0d4802"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Digital transformation","Remote teams","Remote work","VR collaborative space","VR meetings","Zoom fatigue"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058746573"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"649da48d40970720a863720f","name":"Julia","lastName":"Szymanowska","documentHash":"06aa66d1-ff19-4935-a231-1ef3ac4a8f84"},{"objectId":"649da48d40970720a863720e","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Pawlak","documentHash":"f4189bd0-0495-4b8f-92ea-be74f28d4a8d"},{"objectId":"5e709470878c28a0473bd01a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Hanusz","uuid":"3D825FC6626B0EBD74E4CC0C7047FFDFFA0F1CDB3DB542FAE0AA90CA67734078F2B01D4D6C88A5CB9FE4CA78DE2F1B6FD458881ED13A75CC6B5FA43B15992255","orcidId":"0000-0001-9258-8953","documentHash":"4c1a9b48-1fc0-4914-905a-b8cfcc252356"},{"objectId":"5e709415878c28a0473b5ec0","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Sarzyńska-Wawer","uuid":"3E4FE07EFF3C47E6D9429B28284A43CE9C214E46C6A514E08F611956C0429F7B461A3FE7FDF15EB5F36E1837D02DC95E3C2B02E87F840ED358762279837A8CB0","documentHash":"423cc0b4-b2b8-4fdc-ab3b-bbeb74591ad3"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5fb9","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Wawer","uuid":"71E76AB4F917658FF6F5B2009EE56155188A4AB2D5F664F8EB0D45751B29E9A39E6807F7CCEAB7C5E71D0EFD357AED6C7822BFDD8059D5F2EABBB0EFE10BD503","documentHash":"a719d2da-a0f3-4dc9-9e1e-1b34fe678e12"}],"objectId":"649da48d40970720a863720d","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0281179","publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0281179","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Truth or lie: Exploring the language of deception","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lying appears in everyday oral and written communication. As a consequence, detecting it on the basis of linguistic analysis is particularly important. Our study aimed to verify whether the differences between true and false statements in terms of complexity and sentiment that were reported in previous studies can be confirmed using tools dedicated to measuring those factors. Further, we investigated whether linguistic features that differentiate true and false utterances in English—namely utterance length, concreteness, and particular parts-of-speech—are also present in the Polish language. We analyzed nearly 1,500 true and false statements, half of which were transcripts while the other half were written statements. Our results show that false statements are less complex in terms of vocabulary, are more concise and concrete, and have more positive words and fewer negative words. We found no significant differences between spoken and written lies. Using this data, we built classifiers to automatically distinguish true from false utterances, achieving an accuracy of 60%. Our results provide a significant contribution to previous conclusions regarding linguistic deception indicators."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["649da48d40970720a863720e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","affiliatedPersonIDs":["649da48d40970720a863720f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec0","uid":"bxMU6aiRxamfjMzZfUkIOcA","uuid":"edaca7e9-18a0-430c-ac2f-bf3c373853cb","name":"Instytut Psychologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709470878c28a0473bd01a","5e709415878c28a0473b5ec0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec0","parentUuid":"edaca7e9-18a0-430c-ac2f-bf3c373853cb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec0","rootUuid":"edaca7e9-18a0-430c-ac2f-bf3c373853cb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","uid":"bIPOz_WiDWR0kK88nqXox3A","uuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","name":"Instytut Podstaw Informatyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709344878c28a0473a5fb9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","parentUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","rootUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"e0281179: 1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709415878c28a0473b5ec0","649da48d40970720a863720e","649da48d40970720a863720f","5e709470878c28a0473bd01a","5e709344878c28a0473a5fb9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","eissn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"fcfcc06e-e7b2-4412-a89f-df94326b9f49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e2292e409707409b7e0e9e","year":"2023","volume":"18","number":"2","documentHash":"dbb487dd-eff6-49e2-9cca-71a18d5fdd24"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058753775"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56da","name":"Marek","lastName":"Tudruj","uuid":"2E6CB275AC9F230C60A39E311D95A9AE515365C050A314CF28F6AD79B3C842DDA243D1B7E1CCB6903E9C90D8B08A235A100638409C873B7C7407DECECB89FF65","documentHash":"044f8339-9068-4783-8fb6-202d9bcbc801"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0236","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sasak-Okoń","uuid":"FFA9301888F7C27D0DBD01E55452B5E85FA022ED763804B78A793650EAB29A3ABF678A30EF40931624019BB8D64708D2FFA329A6BEDD5F2C7CC0EDB9150DAC5B","orcidId":"0000-0002-4593-120X","documentHash":"e8f413ab-08ec-47a7-a16a-29379b738ac7"}],"objectId":"64775ddc4097071bcb5e995e","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-30442-2_8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30442-2_8","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"RDBMS Speculative Support Improvement by the Use of the Query Hypergraph Representation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper concerns the methodology for speculative support for query execution in Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMSs). It discusses and develops our proposal of supporting the RDBMS query execution based on a graph-based analytic approach. This approach assumes using the results of speculative queries defined by analyzing a multigraph representation of a stream of input queries arriving to a RDBMS. The queries from the RDBMS input stream are permanently analysed using a Speculation Window moving on the query stream to define the optimized speculative queries for execution. More specifically, the current paper develops the basic idea of the speculative query support and shows how the use of the speculative query results by the awaiting input user queries can be improved by the analysis of a query hypergraph representation. The analysis of a joint hypergraph representation of the speculative and user input queries has been employed to better organize the use of the speculative query results in the stream of input user queries of a RDBMS. The advantages of the proposed approach are positively assessed based on the experiments with the simulated execution of the testbed sets of queries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933d878c28a0473a56da"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","uid":"bIPOz_WiDWR0kK88nqXox3A","uuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","name":"Instytut Podstaw Informatyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933d878c28a0473a56da"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","parentUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","rootUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0236"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"95–109","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741987","mniswId":"1168","fullName":"International Conference on Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics","shortName":"PPAM","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"b161d35a-1f22-404a-bd7c-2e6669c843eb"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"646899f64097075795a0a496","startDate":"2022-09-11","endDate":"2022-09-14","fullName":"14th International Conference Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics","shortName":"PPAM 2022","city":"Gdańsk","country":"PL","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"0254d114-62db-43fc-bb57-0119fe71272d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0236","5e70933d878c28a0473a56da"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"64689c6c4097075795a0b6cc","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-30442-2","title":"Parallel Processing and Applied Mathematics 2022.

online sphere, new event paradigms must be explored and developed to better utilise the unique multimedia opportunities offered by the virtual world. With this in mind, we conducted in-depth interviews with researchers, performed a SWOT analysis of remote conferences, and developed experimental conference functionalities. We implemented these during the 9th edition of a two-day international scientific IT conference, which was attended by over 277 participants on the first day and 199 on the second. In this article, we describe how these innovative functionalities met the participants’ needs based on qualitative and quantitative data. We present how the experiences of remote and in-person events differ, and offer recommendations on organising remote conferences that encourage participants to exchange knowledge and engage in activities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","uid":"bV7b5PxMzYcN_S0F-CKP4Ow","uuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","name":"Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji — Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3ce9","5e709370878c28a0473a99f0","5e709494878c28a0473bfd61","5e709494878c28a0473bfd62","5e7094b7878c28a0473c24b6"],"parentId":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","parentUuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","rootId":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","rootUuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a047398776"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-7","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574191c","mniswId":"1053","fullName":"International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","shortName":"CHI","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"3478a610-b4a5-4749-a7ad-b85f9c9b1471"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"64549cd64097076a7ad6de07","startDate":"2023-04-23","endDate":"2023-04-28","fullName":"2023 CHI International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems [CHI]","shortName":"CHI","city":"Hamburg","country":"DE","website":"https://chi2023.acm.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"bdda9272-c865-4227-828c-31f91bc0fa3e"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709494878c28a0473bfd61","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","5e709494878c28a0473bfd62","5e709295878c28a047398776","5e7094b7878c28a0473c24b6","5e709370878c28a0473a99f0","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3ce9","5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"6512a42740970729413d8875","title":"CHI '23: Proceedings of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","year":2023,"isbn":"978-1-4503-9421-5","url":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3544548","translation":false,"documentHash":"3d6c9c67-4778-462d-b27d-2eb4fde6c646"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["applied computing","education","interactive learning environments","human-centered computing","collaborative and social computing","computing methodologies","machine learning","learning settings","online learning settings","social and professional topics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058988147"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"657ff40a4097073e4d1b6617","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Puzniakowski","documentHash":"6f026784-c4d6-444c-98aa-3a6a71dc611f"},{"objectId":"657ff3304097073e4d1b5f62","name":"Pawel","lastName":"Pisarski","documentHash":"6befc7aa-fbe8-41e7-9313-a5bb553fe4ab"},{"objectId":"657ff3304097073e4d1b5f61","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Marcinkowski","documentHash":"7cb6ab96-e268-4ec4-98d4-a3b6c953c901"},{"objectId":"657ff3304097073e4d1b5f5f","name":"Adam","lastName":"Aszyk","documentHash":"705ff555-6b76-4707-a886-8a8824847993"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a5748","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bednarczyk","uuid":"BEE85DD1EFE6F097E26E29C1B6C40813ABB850421C4D84A57CBE6251A4E97E833A235E02EBE608369DEC404AF3BDA06B51BDF6DD4688A8449879CA34762CECEF","documentHash":"23439ba1-02a6-4a11-ac3d-937ac93e76fa"}],"objectId":"657ff3304097073e4d1b5f5e","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2023.10.006","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S187705092301164X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Towards Optimal Freight Selection Strategies in Transport Planning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The problem of inland freight planning from the perspective of a medium size transport company operating in the EU market is studied.

Following the Design Science Research approach, the Proof of Concept of IT-enabled decision support solution for logistics companies is delivered and validated. Several strategies for choosing an offer among many for a truck with a given spatio-temporal location are investigated and compared."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933d878c28a0473a5748","657ff40a4097073e4d1b6617","657ff3304097073e4d1b5f61"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"225","pagesFromTo":"218-227","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["657ff3304097073e4d1b5f5f","657ff3304097073e4d1b5f61","657ff3304097073e4d1b5f62","5e70933d878c28a0473a5748","657ff40a4097073e4d1b6617"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e710e5046e0fb0001bb6a1d","title":"Procedia Computer Science","eissn":"1877-0509","documentHash":"aea484ff-28d8-44b8-8af7-3329638209a9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6575454e4097075d9874d6af","year":"2023","volume":"225","documentHash":"f302aa28-1249-4958-8781-ccd675e39352"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059207860"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6597c04640970755be5a65f7","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kornacka","documentHash":"78c88207-2578-44cc-81f2-21b70c5f8190"},{"objectId":"6597c04640970755be5a65f6","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Pochwatko","documentHash":"bd3e8087-a17e-40fb-91f3-764f0288d7b4"},{"objectId":"6597c04640970755be5a65f5","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Karpowicz","documentHash":"bf54889e-ad24-43e0-9c55-eecae4a3b8ff"},{"objectId":"6597c04640970755be5a65f4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jaskulska","documentHash":"50a3f6bd-be16-4524-b139-ebdcd8414731"},{"objectId":"5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Skorupska","uuid":"355DF489B50BC4F518253B4901C16B40936FF55B17766261952CE6AC46536D9D15D6CFAB13C3A40D2693A823031FF3D82D699411E59A5AA77DB73ECD6D84F299","orcidId":"0000-0002-9005-0348","documentHash":"4944f7bd-39b4-4922-b8ee-513e05711790"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kopeć","uuid":"4562B2C75A90DF6C1B3F5CD0AF0896B88C0CE15227715745A16F4ECB1C97B660412FE35EC0E86E6A13AF43B2B1EB36B13834983A945FAD0AB4A16AE65E77BCE3","orcidId":"0000-0001-9132-4171","documentHash":"64387f76-fdaf-4793-93c7-ed4819d07fe6"}],"objectId":"6597c04640970755be5a65f2","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8_18","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8_18","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"A Method for Co-designing Immersive VR Environments with Users Excluded from the Main Technological Discourse","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Air quality affects health and, unfortunately, has been deteriorating rapidly recently. The problem is significant in smaller towns where the important source of pollution is the heating of households and water from individual sources. Therefore, the inhabitants have an influence on a significant reduction of pollution in their area, but at the same time, they are very often not aware of it. Raising awareness about household-related air pollution plays a vital role as systemic solutions proposed by state and local authorities require the support of local communities. The situation has recently become even more serious as we are facing a crisis caused by the Russian war in Ukraine, which has led to an increase in energy and fuel prices and has postponed restrictions on the use of solid fuels or even incentives to use inferior fuels. Pathologies, such as burning garbage in old-style furnaces, have still not been eliminated. One of the ways of raising citizens’ awareness was to be public, easily accessible information about air quality. Many portals, services, and applications currently provide local air quality data, but few people use them. One reason may be that the figures and graphs can be confusing or unattractive to audiences who are not used to reading scientific reports. Visualizing air quality with augmented reality overcomes these obstacles. A mobile application that can use local elements as triggers and a symbolic representation of air quality based on data read in real-time from sensors is simple, attractive for non-experts, and has an additional educational value. We present the experience of creating such an application and prototype tests with the participation of potential users. Unfortunately, the collected results confirm the low awareness of excessive pollution in a given area and its negative impact on health. However, the interest of potential users and positive opinions about the tested prototype fill with optimism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"176-190","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","6597c04640970755be5a65f4","6597c04640970755be5a65f5","6597c04640970755be5a65f6","6597c04640970755be5a65f7","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"651e6c9d4097073f99755598","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8","title":"Digital Interaction and Machine Intelligence: Proceedings of MIDI’2022 – 10th Machine Intelligence and Digital Interaction – Conference, December 12-15, 2022, Warsaw, Poland (Online)","year":2023,"isbn":"978-3-031-37648-1","issn":"2367-3370","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"35996390-aeed-4bb1-848a-ac09d2ee558a","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-07-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE"}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059217490"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6597ebd240970755be6065e9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jaskulska","documentHash":"21337922-6b5c-48fd-9072-25decc7eded6"},{"objectId":"6597ebd240970755be6065e8","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Makowska","documentHash":"7295157e-1f23-47b9-a350-a5833b35d6f2"},{"objectId":"5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Skorupska","uuid":"355DF489B50BC4F518253B4901C16B40936FF55B17766261952CE6AC46536D9D15D6CFAB13C3A40D2693A823031FF3D82D699411E59A5AA77DB73ECD6D84F299","orcidId":"0000-0002-9005-0348","documentHash":"4944f7bd-39b4-4922-b8ee-513e05711790"}],"objectId":"6597ebd240970755be6065e6","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-11432-8_16","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-11432-8_16","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Interdisciplinary Research with Older Adults in the Area of ICT: Selected Ethical Considerations and Challenges","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper we analyse, classify and discuss some ethical considerations and challenges related to pursuing exploratory and interdisciplinary research projects in the area of ICT, especially those involving older adults.

Despite many years of development, already established methods of influencing behaviour remain ineffective. The effect of such interventions is very often a declaration of behaviour change that is not followed by actual action. Moreover, despite intensive information campaigns, many people still do not have adequate knowledge on the subject, are not aware of the problem or, worse, deny its existence. Previous attempts to introduce real change were based on providing information, persuasion or visualisation. We propose the use of multi-sensory virtual reality to investigate the problem more thoroughly and then design appropriate solutions. In this paper, we introduce a new immersive virtual environment that combines free exploration with a high level of experimental control, physiological and behavioural measures. It was created on the basis of transdisciplinary scientific cooperation, participatory design and research. We used the unique features of virtual environments to reverse and expand the idea of pollution pods by Pinsky. Instead of closing participants in small domes filled with chemical substances imitating pollution, we made it possible for them to freely explore an open environment - admiring the panorama of a small town from the observation deck located on a nearby hill. Virtual reality technology enables the manipulation of representations of air pollution, the sensory modalities with which they are transmitted (visual, auditory, tactile and smell stimuli) and their intensity. Participants’ reactions from the initial tests of the application showed that it is a promising solution. We present the possibilities of applying the new solution in psychological research and its further design and development opportunities in collaboration with communities and other stakeholders in the spirit of citizen science."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"239-247","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65980af040970755be645e2e","65980af040970755be645e2f","5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","65980af040970755be645e31","65980af040970755be645e32","65980af040970755be645e33","65980af040970755be645e34","65980af040970755be645e35"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"63076b734097076e98eb86bc","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-11432-8","title":"Digital Interaction and Machine Intelligence","year":2022,"isbn":"9783031114311","translation":false,"documentHash":"f2e15f8d-c449-4c18-bda4-bd6575b15f2c","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059221418"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6597b5a740970755be58bf27","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Świdrak","documentHash":"ef5544ce-20f6-4140-828d-0fce409e60bf"},{"objectId":"6597b5a740970755be58bf26","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jaskulska","documentHash":"564df5bf-4de2-4e81-98d8-935718650cf0"},{"objectId":"6597b5a740970755be58bf25","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Masłyk","documentHash":"bbd3a910-775c-4d26-89ee-5e12619fa835"},{"objectId":"6597b5a740970755be58bf22","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Jędrzejewski","documentHash":"b84b7962-59b5-44ea-9091-7a59f6a99d3d"},{"objectId":"6597b5a740970755be58bf21","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Pochwatko","documentHash":"0cd4ce28-43bc-45d6-ae8d-9297bc3dbe99"},{"objectId":"5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Skorupska","uuid":"355DF489B50BC4F518253B4901C16B40936FF55B17766261952CE6AC46536D9D15D6CFAB13C3A40D2693A823031FF3D82D699411E59A5AA77DB73ECD6D84F299","orcidId":"0000-0002-9005-0348","documentHash":"4944f7bd-39b4-4922-b8ee-513e05711790"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kopeć","uuid":"4562B2C75A90DF6C1B3F5CD0AF0896B88C0CE15227715745A16F4ECB1C97B660412FE35EC0E86E6A13AF43B2B1EB36B13834983A945FAD0AB4A16AE65E77BCE3","orcidId":"0000-0001-9132-4171","documentHash":"64387f76-fdaf-4793-93c7-ed4819d07fe6"}],"objectId":"6597b5a740970755be58bf20","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8_15","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8_15","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Representation of Air Pollution in Augmented Reality: Tools for Population–Wide Behavioral Change","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Air quality affects health and, unfortunately, has been deteriorating rapidly recently. The problem is significant in smaller towns where the important source of pollution is the heating of households and water from individual sources. Therefore, the inhabitants have an influence on a significant reduction of pollution in their area, but at the same time, they are very often not aware of it. Raising awareness about household-related air pollution plays a vital role as systemic solutions proposed by state and local authorities require the support of local communities. The situation has recently become even more serious as we are facing a crisis caused by the Russian war in Ukraine, which has led to an increase in energy and fuel prices and has postponed restrictions on the use of solid fuels or even incentives to use inferior fuels. Pathologies, such as burning garbage in old-style furnaces, have still not been eliminated. One of the ways of raising citizens’ awareness was to be public, easily accessible information about air quality. Many portals, services, and applications currently provide local air quality data, but few people use them. One reason may be that the figures and graphs can be confusing or unattractive to audiences who are not used to reading scientific reports. Visualizing air quality with augmented reality overcomes these obstacles. A mobile application that can use local elements as triggers and a symbolic representation of air quality based on data read in real-time from sensors is simple, attractive for non-experts, and has an additional educational value. We present the experience of creating such an application and prototype tests with the participation of potential users. Unfortunately, the collected results confirm the low awareness of excessive pollution in a given area and its negative impact on health. However, the interest of potential users and positive opinions about the tested prototype fill with optimism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"150-158","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6597b5a740970755be58bf21","6597b5a740970755be58bf22","5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","6597b5a740970755be58bf25","6597b5a740970755be58bf26","6597b5a740970755be58bf27"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"651e6c9d4097073f99755598","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8","title":"Digital Interaction and Machine Intelligence: Proceedings of MIDI’2022 – 10th Machine Intelligence and Digital Interaction – Conference, December 12-15, 2022, Warsaw, Poland (Online)","year":2023,"isbn":"978-3-031-37648-1","issn":"2367-3370","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"35996390-aeed-4bb1-848a-ac09d2ee558a","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-07-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE"}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059224581"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6597ec8740970755be60770e","name":"Olof","lastName":"Lindman","documentHash":"a915aee1-dffd-4948-bd00-6d70e6e3873b"},{"objectId":"6597ec8740970755be60770d","name":"Julia","lastName":"Lindberg","documentHash":"259ecd76-6f79-4c94-94bf-3d27102893d1"},{"objectId":"6597ec8740970755be60770c","name":"Annika","lastName":"Bidner","documentHash":"6c1c50b7-9450-46d7-99a7-61d48c9c62b7"},{"objectId":"5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Skorupska","uuid":"355DF489B50BC4F518253B4901C16B40936FF55B17766261952CE6AC46536D9D15D6CFAB13C3A40D2693A823031FF3D82D699411E59A5AA77DB73ECD6D84F299","orcidId":"0000-0002-9005-0348","documentHash":"4944f7bd-39b4-4922-b8ee-513e05711790"}],"objectId":"6597ec8740970755be60770b","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-11432-8_28","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-11432-8_28","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Deploying Enhanced Speech Feature Decreased Audio Complaints at SVT Play VOD Service","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"At Public Service Broadcaster SVT in Sweden, background music and sounds in programs have for many years been one of the most common complaints from the viewers.

In this experiential study conducted in an analog space habitat we evaluated challenges and opportunities of using 3D printing. Our study revealed barriers such as: 1) setting up and maintaining the 3D printing equipment while minding different kinds of pollution, that is air, temperature and sound, 2) design skill and familiarity with specialized software as well as materials and 3) the awareness of what can be achieved to meet community needs. We observed that in-community experience and know-how are reliable sources of 3D print ideas, that improve quality of life of community members if they are encouraged and supported by participatory design. Co-design of 3D prints in small, specialized communities is a promising area of study, that can bring new applications of 3D print technology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574191c","mniswId":"1053","fullName":"International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","shortName":"CHI","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"3478a610-b4a5-4749-a7ad-b85f9c9b1471"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"64549cd64097076a7ad6de07","startDate":"2023-04-23","endDate":"2023-04-28","fullName":"International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems [CHI]","shortName":"CHI","city":"Hamburg","country":"DE","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"e99e2779-7008-43d9-bb7e-307ec4c52655"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659531f040970740be8b4ff4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"655b48a040970749a829bfe3","doi":"10.1145/3544549","title":"CHI EA '23 : extended abstracts of the 2023 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","year":2023,"isbn":"978-1-4503-9422-2","url":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/312037","translation":false,"documentHash":"f6fcbf0d-47cb-4aa1-a094-4ef421f9454f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059252383"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6597c14840970755be5ab462","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Pochwatko","documentHash":"7cb64f9a-1342-4d05-95eb-c2975ae45cef"},{"objectId":"6597c14840970755be5ab461","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kornacka","documentHash":"1deb27d1-5150-4d0c-b6e2-e105030122f4"},{"objectId":"6597c14840970755be5ab460","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jaskulska","documentHash":"b57af72c-d53f-4ebc-88a1-7871a093802a"},{"objectId":"6597c14840970755be5ab45f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Grzeszczuk","documentHash":"b6e2e659-a5ba-4788-9377-6c25ca1f862a"},{"objectId":"5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Skorupska","uuid":"355DF489B50BC4F518253B4901C16B40936FF55B17766261952CE6AC46536D9D15D6CFAB13C3A40D2693A823031FF3D82D699411E59A5AA77DB73ECD6D84F299","orcidId":"0000-0002-9005-0348","documentHash":"4944f7bd-39b4-4922-b8ee-513e05711790"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kopeć","uuid":"4562B2C75A90DF6C1B3F5CD0AF0896B88C0CE15227715745A16F4ECB1C97B660412FE35EC0E86E6A13AF43B2B1EB36B13834983A945FAD0AB4A16AE65E77BCE3","orcidId":"0000-0001-9132-4171","documentHash":"64387f76-fdaf-4793-93c7-ed4819d07fe6"}],"objectId":"6597c14840970755be5ab45d","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8_29","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8_29","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"A Case for VR Briefings: Comparing Communication in Daily Audio and VR Mission Control in a Simulated Lunar Mission","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Alpha-XR Mission conducted by XR Lab PJAIT focused on research related to individual and crew well-being and participatory team collaboration in ICE (isolated, confined and extreme) conditions.

The mission commander and first officer, both experienced with virtual reality, took part in daily briefings with mission control. In the first week the briefings were voice-only conducted via a channel on Discord. During the following week last briefings were conducted in VR, using Horizon Workrooms. This qualitative pilot study employing participatory observation revealed that VR facilitates communication, especially on complex problems and experiences, providing the sense of emotional connection and shared understanding, that may be lacking in audio calls. The study points to the need to further explore VR-facilitated communication in high-stake environments as it may improve relationships, well-being, and communication outcomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"287-297","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","6597c14840970755be5ab45f","6597c14840970755be5ab460","6597c14840970755be5ab461","6597c14840970755be5ab462","5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"651e6c9d4097073f99755598","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8","title":"Digital Interaction and Machine Intelligence: Proceedings of MIDI’2022 – 10th Machine Intelligence and Digital Interaction – Conference, December 12-15, 2022, Warsaw, Poland (Online)","year":2023,"isbn":"978-3-031-37648-1","issn":"2367-3370","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-37649-8.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"35996390-aeed-4bb1-848a-ac09d2ee558a","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-07-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE"}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059266297"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szklanny","uuid":"11EF34F834CA8B4185402E38B3029BE6C2177C3C181D3FFF3AF0504EC76FFA68C5C7301340EE817FA1D5EADDBDD8C38E6CC2F6EBC0D57019CF362BA565A9BA91","orcidId":"0000-0001-6540-1671","documentHash":"9a7bb3b2-a6c9-43e1-9876-1e71e16aba23"}],"objectId":"662b62734097075aa60d3520","doi":"10.21008/j.0860-6897.2024.1.12","publicUri":"https://vibsys.put.poznan.pl/early-view/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Cloning the voice and speech of Piotr Fronczewski for Polish speech synthesis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The quality of synthetically generated speech has improved significantly in recent years, largely\ndue to the technological development of speech synthesis systems, in particular those based on deep neural\nnetworks (DNN).

The subject of this article is multi-attribute decisions made using product comparison, a widely used functionality of many e-commerce stores. Studies on cognitive aging have established a negative relationship between age and accuracy in multi-attribute choice tasks; however, works in informatics (Human-Computer Interaction, UX research) have not accounted for how individual user differences affect the optimality of users’ product comparison decisions. Our work attempts to bridge this gap between the disciplines of psychology of aging and informatics. We predicted and confirmed, in an online study simulating e-commerce shopping, the strong limitations of older adults in product comparison tasks. In subsequent modeling, other individual characteristics, such as visual working memory, were predicted and shown to be a reliable mediator of the relationship between age and decision accuracy. Popular product comparison tables are not sufficient for older consumers. Despite following UX guidelines for designing product comparison tables, overall correctness of consumer decisions in our study ranged from 90% to as little as 30%, depending on the difficulty of the task and the age of the consumer. These findings have important practical implications for UX design of e-commerce

and influence societal actions, distinguishing between truthful and misleading narratives has become a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the EU DisinfoTest, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the efficacy of Language Models in identifying disinformation narratives. Developed through a Human-in-the-Loop methodology and grounded in research from EU DisinfoLab, the EU DisinfoTest comprises more than 1,300 narratives. Our benchmark includes persuasive elements under Logos, Pathos, and Ethos rhetorical dimensions. We assessed state-of-the-art LLMs, including the newly released GPT-4o, on their capability to perform zero-shot classification of disinformation narratives versus credible narratives. Our findings reveal that LLMs tend to regard narratives with authoritative appeals as trustworthy, while those with emotional appeals are frequently incorrectly classified as disinformative. These findings highlight the challenges LLMs face in nuanced content interpretation and suggest the need for tailored adjustments in LLM training to better handle diverse narrative structures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik

one-day transdisciplinary workshop in the broad area of HCI focused on co-designing immersive virtual reality (IVR) for remote and unsupervised interaction, intervention, training and research. The development and deployment of such systems is a significant and important challenge. While remote and unsupervised systems are more accessible to a wider user-base, their design, implementation and deployment poses unique challenges, related to the need to involve truly transdisciplinary design teams, co-designing solutions with users, providing step-by-step interaction scenarios, and retaining user motivation and engagement over longer periods of time. Moreover, there are multiple ethical considerations related to both the inclusivity and accessibility of such systems and the security of data collected. Therefore, to facilitate the use of IVR systems in various contexts, ranging from unique interactions and research, through psychological interventions, to education and training, we propose to formulate a set of best practices. Taking into account the diverse aspects involved, we will formulate actionable guidelines for co-designing such solutions with users based on review of extant literature, expert knowledge, case studies and insights from the workshop."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c7878c28a0473c3936"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","uid":"bV7b5PxMzYcN_S0F-CKP4Ow","uuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","name":"Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji — Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3ce9"],"parentId":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","parentUuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","rootId":"5e709193878c28a04737eec4","rootUuid":"3467ab3b-6b6a-4c58-84bc-d41a4af88b72","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"610-615","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574183c","mniswId":"807","fullName":"IFIP TC13 Conference on Human-Computer Interaction","shortName":"Interact","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"1dd06a7d-f4b1-4bec-985e-7bc731796ab1"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65aa78734097071977e4dd85","startDate":"2023-08-28","endDate":"2023-09-01","fullName":" Human-Computer Interaction – INTERACT 2023","shortName":"INTERACT 2023","city":"York","country":"GB","website":"https://interact2023.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"59d61bdf-1874-4444-b95a-2c2ebbe9ece7"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5e7094c7878c28a0473c3936","5e709244878c28a047392b0c","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3ce9","5f6b0661752340073806aa5a","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","6511440e409707211632f5e2","633f8f297523402e340fee5a","6511440e409707211632f5e3","6511440e409707211632f5e4","6511440e409707211632f5e5","5e7092de878c28a04739e5cd","6511440e409707211632f5e6","6704df8ffdbe831eab8e3f22","6704df8ffdbe831eab8e3f23","6704df8ffdbe831eab8e3f24"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"655b48e040970749a829dc17","title":"Human-Computer Interaction – INTERACT 2023 19th IFIP TC13 International Conference, York, UK, August 28 – September 1, 2023, Proceedings, Part IV","year":2023,"volume":"IV","isbn":"9783031422928","url":"https://share.swps.edu.pl/handle/swps/202","translation":false,"documentHash":"413ae965-e021-4610-a165-3f6a8f641be4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["immersive virtual and extended reality systems","human-computer interaction","remote and unsupervised interaction","co-design","transdisciplinary collaboration","participatory design"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060639130"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szklanny","uuid":"11EF34F834CA8B4185402E38B3029BE6C2177C3C181D3FFF3AF0504EC76FFA68C5C7301340EE817FA1D5EADDBDD8C38E6CC2F6EBC0D57019CF362BA565A9BA91","orcidId":"0000-0001-6540-1671","documentHash":"9a7bb3b2-a6c9-43e1-9876-1e71e16aba23"}],"objectId":"67972ed1fdbe8349c07ccc12","doi":"10.53024/7.4.56.2024","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.53024/7.4.56.2024","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Perspektywy zastosowania sztucznej inteligencji i potencjał technik multimedialnych w kształceniu kadr wymiaru sprawiedliwości","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article described practical applications of multimedia techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Their scope includes generative technologies, i.e. creating text, images, and 360-degree panoramas.

The European Judicial Training Network organized the first-ever training using VR (Virtual Reality in Judicial Training) technology. The training involved creating a presentation using 360° panoramas with artificial intelligence. The article also describes an example of cooperation between two universities – the National School of Judiciary and Public Prosecution and the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology – in which students of the Faculty of New Media Arts prepared virtual tours. The prepared materials can be used in the education of judicial personnel. The advantages and disadvantages of existing solutions are discussed using specific examples.

The evaluation was carried out using several acoustic parameters including COVAREP (collaborative voice analysis repository for speech technologies), the auditory-perceptual RBH (roughness, breathiness, hoarseness) scale, and AVQI (acoustic voice quality index). Finally, a classifier is trained using machine learning algorithms from the WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) platform. The study group comprised 75 voice recordings of individuals affected by vocal fold paralysis. The control group consisted of 49 voice recordings of healthy individuals. The results indicate that the voice quality of the study group is significantly different than the voice quality of the control group. Acoustic parameters implemented in COVAREP and the RBH scale have proven to be reliable methods assessing voice quality. In addition, data classification achieved over 90 % accuracy for every classifier."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67972dc5fdbe8349c07cc759","5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6","67972dc5fdbe8349c07cc75b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477186","mniswId":"1641","title":"Archives Of Acoustics","issn":"0137-5075","documentHash":"0cfd8a53-6f00-41a2-906b-eda9d002d4bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67972dc5fdbe8349c07cc758","year":"2025","documentHash":"5deda5d3-6d95-4183-a41b-65fe20027ed3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060715731"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63cfab2a4097075010f127d9","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Strus","documentHash":"28813e45-0e67-4b6d-a12b-328ca6333f7c"},{"objectId":"5e70938e878c28a0473acb97","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Kleć","uuid":"8B5E41D8F1779F337D65F2C4944A4F47512CC4CA1569C0E9E51D320105FA7A29ABDA7719C11F99EFE7EDB321F8096403A9BCE4A7502D4F198D287BB82802B7DE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4103-2597","documentHash":"c7825d62-9a63-4a97-9f5a-76dc3d9ed411"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56dc","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Wieczorkowska","uuid":"46600514BED4E6C82715C2029D75BEF3C7DDD89FC89A0203B2F4679DC238BD5D11615665CE35053AADE03307F25EA17CD5E2AC5260E07A7542910599150CD8AC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2033-6372","documentHash":"dabddac0-46b5-4ec2-b3f0-cca192eccb56"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szklanny","uuid":"11EF34F834CA8B4185402E38B3029BE6C2177C3C181D3FFF3AF0504EC76FFA68C5C7301340EE817FA1D5EADDBDD8C38E6CC2F6EBC0D57019CF362BA565A9BA91","orcidId":"0000-0001-6540-1671","documentHash":"9a7bb3b2-a6c9-43e1-9876-1e71e16aba23"}],"objectId":"63cfab2a4097075010f127d4","doi":"10.1186/s13636-022-00269-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13636-022-00269-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Beyond the Big Five personality traits for music recommendation systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of personality traits, characterized by the BFI (Big Five Inventory) and its significant revision called BFI-2, on music recommendation error. The BFI-2 describes the lower-order facets of the Big Five personality traits. We performed experiments with 279 participants, using an application (called Music Master) we developed for music listening and ranking, and for collecting personality profiles of the users. Additionally, 29-dimensional vectors of audio features were extracted to describe the music files. The data obtained from our experiments were used to test several hypotheses about the influence of personality traits and the audio features on music recommendation error. The performed analyses take into account three types of ratings that refer to the cognitive-emotional, motivational, and social components of the attitude towards the song. The experiments showed that every combination of Big Five personality traits produces worse results than using lower-order personality facets. Additionally, we found a small subset of personality facets that yielded the lowest recommendation error. This finding can condense the personality questionnaire to only the most essential questions. The collected data set is publicly available and ready to be used by other researchers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6","5e70938e878c28a0473acb97","5e70933d878c28a0473a56dc"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2023","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63cfab2a4097075010f127d9","5e70938e878c28a0473acb97","5e70933d878c28a0473a56dc","5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b6b","mniswId":"6070","title":"EURASIP Journal on Audio Speech and Music Processing","issn":"1687-4722","eissn":"1687-4722","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"25501121-f8f1-40b0-a8f7-2b6a431e08e6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cfab2a4097075010f127d5","year":"2023","volume":"2023","number":"1","documentHash":"f3e09926-e69d-4bac-ac77-3b8af80b8092"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060787923"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"651d25ac40970737b843150d","name":"Andrzej W.","lastName":"Przybyszewski","documentHash":"eddc4a31-16d9-49be-b6ce-f066572a25bb"}],"objectId":"651d25ac40970737b843150c","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-08757-8_14","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-08757-8_14","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"AI Classifications Applied to Neuropsychological Trials in Normal Individuals that Predict Progression to Cognitive Decline","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The processes of neurodegeneration related to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begin several decades before the first symptoms.

Patients were evaluated every year by team of neuropsychologists and neurologists and classified as normal, with MCI (mild cognitive impairments), or with dementia. As the decision attribute we have used CDRSUM (Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes) as more quantitative measure than above classification. Based on 150 stable subjects with different stages of AD we have found rules (granules) that classify cognitive attributes with disease stages (CDRSUM). By applying these rules to normal (CDRSUM = 0) 21 subjects we have predicted that one subject might get mild dementia (CDRSUM > 4.5), one very mild dementia (CDRSUM > 2.25), and five other might get questionable impairment (CDRSUM > 0.75).

In this paper, we study the problem of spatiotemporal entity linking using effective and concise signatures extracted from their trajectories. This linking problem is formalized as a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) query on the signatures. Four representation strategies (sequential, temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal) and two quantitative criteria (commonality and unicity) are investigated for signature construction. A simple yet effective dimension reduction strategy is developed together with a novel indexing structure called the WR-tree to speed up the search. A number of optimization methods are proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of the linking. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets verify the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of both accuracy and efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fdb53202467f02ea18a5e82","5fdb53202467f02ea18a5e83","5fdb53202467f02ea18a5e84","5fdb53202467f02ea18a5e85","5fdb53202467f02ea18a5e86","5fdb53202467f02ea18a5e87","5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478003","mniswId":"7990","title":"IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","issn":"1041-4347","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"febb011e-59f0-4d1a-a72b-56e3164f2945"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"5fdb52322467f02ea18a5e6a","year":"2020","volume":"32","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"cf047a90-8c94-4552-b298-0b595a04ca6b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["spatiotemporal entity linking","moving objects","signature","dimension reduction","k-NN search","weighted R-tree"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654331934"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6285f249409707249f86b659","name":"Xiaofang","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"0a54c1cc-cd56-4655-a350-c332cdf7bcd6"},{"objectId":"6285f249409707249f86b657","name":"Pingfu","lastName":"Chao","documentHash":"bba93b14-5560-40cd-ad22-3c4603c50e5b"},{"objectId":"6285f249409707249f86b656","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Francia","documentHash":"67b684fb-2cbb-468c-ab54-6034cfec9ee6"},{"objectId":"6285f249409707249f86b655","name":"Wen","lastName":"Hua","documentHash":"e9fb471a-50e9-470a-b6d2-2f2a39f46f30"},{"objectId":"6285f249409707249f86b654","name":"Fengmei","lastName":"Jin","documentHash":"6dc548c9-235d-4ecb-8d02-2ad484e6b1c1"},{"objectId":"5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca","name":"Maria","lastName":"Orłowska","uuid":"519D1C0859CDAF43088E1B927500ECFA0C80C433FE2DB88C6A0260CE88DA85C78A3E16FE02020B42034E9342568C4E346F6DF0547B240983432610969C2C0F12","orcidId":"0000-0002-5234-7925","documentHash":"a661f1c1-9398-4352-a3ba-08b15a0464cb"}],"objectId":"6285f249409707249f86b652","doi":"10.1109/tkde.2022.3174204","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/69/4358933/09772978.pdf?arnumber=9772978","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A Survey and Experimental Study on Privacy-Preserving Trajectory Data Publishing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Trajectory data has become ubiquitous nowadays, which can benefit various real-world applications such as traffic management and location-based services. However, trajectories may disclose highly sensitive information of an individual including mobility patterns, personal profiles and gazetteers, social relationships, etc, making it indispensable to consider privacy protection when releasing trajectory data. Ensuring privacy on trajectories demands more than hiding single locations, since trajectories are intrinsically sparse and high-dimensional, and require to protect multi-scale correlations. To this end, extensive research has been conducted to design effective techniques for privacy-preserving trajectory data publishing. Furthermore, protecting privacy requires carefully balance two metrics: privacy and utility. In other words, it needs to protect as much privacy as possible and meanwhile guarantee the usefulness of the released trajectories for data analysis. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study and systematic summarization of existing protection models, privacy and utility metrics for trajectories developed in the literature. We also conduct extensive experiments on a real-life public trajectory dataset to evaluate the performance of several representative privacy protection models, demonstrate the trade-off between privacy and utility, and guide the choice of the right privacy model for trajectory publishing given certain privacy and utility desiderata."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"5577 - 5596","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6285f249409707249f86b654","6285f249409707249f86b655","6285f249409707249f86b656","6285f249409707249f86b657","6285f249409707249f86b659","5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478003","mniswId":"7990","title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING","issn":"1041-4347","eissn":"1558-2191","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"bd5654b0-27a9-404e-ac14-b2417c9e892a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Trajectory data publishing","utility metrics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654628838"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"637cd0e14097073b7db56a5b","name":"Yuehua","lastName":"Duan","documentHash":"25fce83d-ac8a-4606-a047-b540fe0aa976"},{"objectId":"5e7092fe878c28a0473a0aad","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Raś","uuid":"F81ADD88038DAB2738B0175AB835A1E94D8667F7AA2E0E14DDC7CD542CC0BFE3D7EAC82C171E95BD0D5D51F6AB3AE1E6F28C8BFAA07BCC6BF274AAB698D5243E","documentHash":"d58b8111-c601-45f1-b21c-51100056b109"}],"objectId":"637cd0e14097073b7db56a59","doi":"10.1504/ijdmmm.2022.126665","publicUri":"http://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/full/10.1504/IJDMMM.2022.126665","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Recommendation system for improving churn rate based on action rules and sentiment mining","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It is well recognised that customers are one of the most valuable assets to a company.

To this end, we designed and implemented a recommender system that can provide actionable recommendations to improve customer churn rate. We used both transaction and survey data from heavy equipment repair and service sector from 2011 to 2017. This data was collected by a consulting company based in Charlotte, North Carolina. In the survey data, customers give their thoughts, feelings, expectations and complaints by freeform text.

However, the process of digital transformation (DT) can be the cause of digital transformation stress (DTS), when the work demands caused by fast implementation of ICT are elevated and employees’ resources are limited. Based on the Job Demand-Resources (JD-R) Model we claim that DT, rapidly accelerating in the COVID-19 pandemic, can increase the level of DTS and general stress at work. To reduce these negative effects of DTS, we propose the online intervention aimed to strengthen employees’ resources, such as self-efficacy. In this article we evaluate the effectiveness of the blended intervention,\nbased on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and social cognitive therapy, composed of a prototyped online training (e-stressless) and series of interactive online workshops. In a longitudinal study, we examined the change in DTS, perceived stress at work, attitudes toward DT, self-efficacy and burnout in two time points, before and after the intervention.We compared five groups of participants (558 in total), three groups not qualified (n = 417), and two groups qualified to intervention (n = 141). Our results revealed that the designed blended intervention decreased DTS and one of the dimensions of burnout,\nnamely disengagement. More specifically, the results showed that in the group of active participants of the blended intervention DTS significantly decreased [MT 1 = 3.23, MT 2 = 3.00, t(432) = 1.96, p = 0.051], and in the group of ineligible participants DTS significantly increased [MT1 = 1.76, MT2 = 2.02, t(432) = 4.17, p < 0.001]. This research paves way for the creation of blended online intervention which could help in addressing employee digital transformation stress before it starts having adverse effects on employee performance and well-being."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a060f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-16","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a060f","63aeaca5409707109b9f989a","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","63aeaca5409707109b9f989c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d6b","mniswId":"6865","title":"Frontiers in Psychology","issn":"1664-1078","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"48ed8c8d-edf5-4b32-b9d9-98a5dc1f0b03"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["burnout","COVID-19","self-efficacy ","Online intervention","Digital transformation stress","Digital transformation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654768189"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6540f216409707677d005472","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Makowska-Tłomak","documentHash":"5203fc65-c7d0-451e-8638-c85433e957bd"},{"objectId":"5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Skorupska","uuid":"355DF489B50BC4F518253B4901C16B40936FF55B17766261952CE6AC46536D9D15D6CFAB13C3A40D2693A823031FF3D82D699411E59A5AA77DB73ECD6D84F299","orcidId":"0000-0002-9005-0348","documentHash":"4944f7bd-39b4-4922-b8ee-513e05711790"},{"objectId":"5e7094c7878c28a0473c3936","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kornacka","uuid":"CC9013D49424923040ED45662A5AC0B13C1E931F8D3C492C92EC8A0EF2A76D1FF846E6A02436B66AB25F5E2E079C78F4F7B16D9A6F61888B9645E20C46B1A33F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2737-9236","documentHash":"7c5e5f36-90cf-45c4-a0f1-eae74ef85f83"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kopeć","uuid":"4562B2C75A90DF6C1B3F5CD0AF0896B88C0CE15227715745A16F4ECB1C97B660412FE35EC0E86E6A13AF43B2B1EB36B13834983A945FAD0AB4A16AE65E77BCE3","orcidId":"0000-0001-9132-4171","documentHash":"64387f76-fdaf-4793-93c7-ed4819d07fe6"},{"objectId":"5e70938e878c28a0473acba5","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Nielek","uuid":"871533640355C70246AACB0E6BA19078DF9C831FF16A094B0D30B5D396CB39ACF1BE3BABACB53D2B5E72AC51D88B1F773AE37714D932A86BCB21DED44DC96BE6","orcidId":"0000-0002-5794-7532","documentHash":"6726ff1d-fd47-4aca-a02d-5ad9ff088d68"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a060f","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Bedyńska","uuid":"DF23F59F22025FE326231D8CA76D91808A29CBA5B230DCC0B2A17A8363BA26D2FBF0671D857361128B9A79E48BDC42B3B47A288148E1C0FEB572601E5E473065","orcidId":"0000-0001-8255-1946","documentHash":"3c002115-7dde-42b7-bcd5-0a16e0788743"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6540f216409707677d005471","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0287223","publicUri":"https://share.swps.edu.pl/handle/swps/96","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Measuring digital transformation stress at the workplace–Development and validation of the digital transformation stress scale","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Despite the unquestionable advantages of digital transformation (DT) in organizations, the very process of DT could have an impact on the level of stress of the employees. The negative effects of the digital transformation process can be observed during the implementation of information and communication technologies (ICT) solutions. They are further enhanced by the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, as digital transformation has accelerated to allow for remote work. Herein we distinguish between general stress at the workplace and the very specific type of stress, namely digital transformation stress (DTS). We assumed that this type of stress appears when rapid implementation of ICT solutions is introduced with time pressure and incertitude of further results. To quantify this phenomenon, we developed a new self-report scale—the Digital Transformation Stress Scale (DTSS), measuring employees’ stress stemming from the process of digital transformation in organizations. The psychometric validity of the scale was evaluated in two studies: Study1 conducted at the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (N = 229) and Study 2 in 2021 (N = 558), after a year of mostly remote work. The results confirmed good reliability with Cronbach’s Alpha α = .91 in Study 1 and α = .90 in Study 2 and assumed unidimensional factorial validity of the scale in both studies. All items of the scale had good difficulty and discrimination values evaluated in Item Response Theory, i.e., IRT approach. The scale showed predicted convergent validity as the indicator of the digital transformation stress moderately correlated with general stress at work. Moreover, the assumption that even employees with high ICT skills could be affected by DTS was confirmed. Additionally, the results indicated that digital transformation stress was significantly higher among employees who reported both issues: ongoing digital solutions projects at the workplace and high impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their work. The scale could be used in future work on measuring and counteracting digital transformation stress at the workplace."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a060f","5e7094c7878c28a0473c3936"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938e878c28a0473acba5","5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-28","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6540f216409707677d005472","5e7092fb878c28a0473a060f","5e7094c7878c28a0473c3936","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","5e70938e878c28a0473acba5","5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"45cf93d6-1d2d-4b95-93ed-f1e3f136e1c7"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654878029"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938e878c28a0473acb97","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Kleć","uuid":"8B5E41D8F1779F337D65F2C4944A4F47512CC4CA1569C0E9E51D320105FA7A29ABDA7719C11F99EFE7EDB321F8096403A9BCE4A7502D4F198D287BB82802B7DE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4103-2597","documentHash":"c7825d62-9a63-4a97-9f5a-76dc3d9ed411"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56dc","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Wieczorkowska","uuid":"46600514BED4E6C82715C2029D75BEF3C7DDD89FC89A0203B2F4679DC238BD5D11615665CE35053AADE03307F25EA17CD5E2AC5260E07A7542910599150CD8AC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2033-6372","documentHash":"dabddac0-46b5-4ec2-b3f0-cca192eccb56"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56d6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szklanny","uuid":"11EF34F834CA8B4185402E38B3029BE6C2177C3C181D3FFF3AF0504EC76FFA68C5C7301340EE817FA1D5EADDBDD8C38E6CC2F6EBC0D57019CF362BA565A9BA91","orcidId":"0000-0001-6540-1671","documentHash":"9a7bb3b2-a6c9-43e1-9876-1e71e16aba23"}],"objectId":"66e297cefdbe83163aacdd61","doi":"10.62036/isd.2024.37","publicUri":"https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1601&amp;context=isd2014&amp;unstamped=1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Developing a Corpus for Polish Speech Enhancement by Reducing Noise, Reverberation, and Disruptions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a solution for generating corpora of simulated Polish speech recordings in complex acoustic environments.

Whilst Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) has been employed to facilitate self-help interventions to mitigate challenges caused by isolated environments in several domains, its applicability in support of future space expeditions remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we administered the use of distinct IVR environments to crew members (n=5) partaking in a simulated lunar habitat study. Utilizing a Bayesian approach to scrutinize small group data, we discovered a significant relationship between IVR usage and a reduction in perceived stress-related symptoms, particularly those associated with asthenia (syndrome often linked to chronic fatigue and weakness; a condition characterized by feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion that can be amplified in ICE conditions). The reductions were most prominent with the use of interactive virtual environments. The ’Aesthetic Realities’ - virtual environments conceived as art exhibits - received exceptional praise from our participants. These environments mark a fascinating convergence of art and science, holding promise to mitigate effects related to isolation in spaceflight training and beyond"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741827","mniswId":"785","fullName":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","shortName":"ISMAR","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"c69500fc-9edc-4322-958b-ca4746728781"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6572e9b44097071b8e6e143f","startDate":"2023-10-16","endDate":"2023-10-20","fullName":"IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Adjunct (ISMAR-Adjunct)","shortName":"ISMAR","city":"Sydney","country":"AU","website":"https://sin.put.poznan.pl/conferences/details/conference/ieee-international-symposium-on-mixed-and-augmented-reality-adjunct-(ismar-adjunct)","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"0ea0d5fe-38e9-4a16-b20d-fd14d3240a89"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6595293b40970740be8aaa56","6595293b40970740be8aaa57","5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","6595293b40970740be8aaa59","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","6595293b40970740be8aaa5b","6595293b40970740be8aaa5c"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"6572e9b44097071b8e6e143e","doi":"10.1109/ismar-adjunct60411.2023","title":"IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Adjunct (ISMAR-Adjunct)","year":2023,"isbn":"979-8-3503-0582-1","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10322104/proceeding?isnumber=10322117&sortType=vol-only-seq&pageNumber=8","translation":false,"documentHash":"062c2344-0d85-40cb-8c86-15aae1c88d31"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654910055"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65951dcc40970740be89dd4e","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Nadziejko","documentHash":"5c86f79c-1fe8-4de7-911e-abe4cd8cca96"},{"objectId":"65951dcc40970740be89dd4b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jaskulska","documentHash":"78fc9487-110a-4475-a603-6dcde01ab934"},{"objectId":"5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Skorupska","uuid":"355DF489B50BC4F518253B4901C16B40936FF55B17766261952CE6AC46536D9D15D6CFAB13C3A40D2693A823031FF3D82D699411E59A5AA77DB73ECD6D84F299","orcidId":"0000-0002-9005-0348","documentHash":"4944f7bd-39b4-4922-b8ee-513e05711790"},{"objectId":"5e7094c7878c28a0473c3936","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kornacka","uuid":"CC9013D49424923040ED45662A5AC0B13C1E931F8D3C492C92EC8A0EF2A76D1FF846E6A02436B66AB25F5E2E079C78F4F7B16D9A6F61888B9645E20C46B1A33F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2737-9236","documentHash":"7c5e5f36-90cf-45c4-a0f1-eae74ef85f83"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kopeć","uuid":"4562B2C75A90DF6C1B3F5CD0AF0896B88C0CE15227715745A16F4ECB1C97B660412FE35EC0E86E6A13AF43B2B1EB36B13834983A945FAD0AB4A16AE65E77BCE3","orcidId":"0000-0001-9132-4171","documentHash":"64387f76-fdaf-4793-93c7-ed4819d07fe6"},{"objectId":"5e709470878c28a0473bd031","name":"Marta","lastName":"Szastok","uuid":"9D5CE9C72CD71DD518E55626D1F4B51DA220B7524E943B2144C047E42D8D17CB855F9C757CD668AF0D1CB6F6DE08E1185C84D60F89CA639AEB1F027FA493AE02","orcidId":"0000-0001-7674-7651","documentHash":"55b3ac7a-d184-43da-81e1-92b835f6c0cb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":8,"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65951dcc40970740be89dd48","doi":"10.1108/mhsi-01-2023-0015","publicUri":"https://share.swps.edu.pl/handle/swps/309","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A solution for creating dynamic networks of symptoms in cognitive-behavioral functional analysis and therapy – participatory design protocol","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\nOne of the recommendations in process-based cognitive therapies suggests that functional analysis created by the clinician should be supported by empirical data collected through daily sampling. It enables the computing of a dynamic network of psychological processes and symptoms supporting clinical decisions but also therapeutic progress monitoring. However, the experience sampling solutions available in the market do not enable the automatic creation of this kind of network; thus, the use of this approach in clinical practice is practically impossible without advanced statistical skills and significant time investment. The purpose of the present paper is to describes a protocol of a research project based on a participatory approach aiming to create a solution enabling therapists not only to set up a personalized daily sampling for their patients and collect the data but also providing a fully automated visualization of the network adapted for therapeutic purposes.\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThe project will require creating a platform for therapists where they can set up monitoring and receive dynamic networks visualization, creating an experience sampling application for patients connected to the platform and creating an optimal data visualization system that will enable therapists to accurately and quickly interpret the network. A series of participatory workshops, qualitative and quantitative studies are described.\nFindings\nThe presented studies will enable us to evaluate the ergonomy of use of both platform and app in laboratory and ecological settings along with the evaluation of network interpretation accuracy.\nOriginality/value\nTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first participatory design protocol for creating a solution that might enable clinicians to use a dynamic network approach in their everyday clinical practice.

Virtual reality-based interventions can become a powerful tool for studying and inducing pro-environmental change. In this paper, we describe the development and effects of a virtual air pollution experience in which a within-group design was combined with high experimental control and semi-free exploration. We manipulated the realism and valence of the visualised particle matter (PM). During the VR experience, we measured the physiological arousal, walked distance and self-reported affective reactions to each PM visualisation. Moreover, we tested (pre-post VR) whether the overall experience of virtual air pollution changed users’ environmental attitudes and the quality of user experience, including presence. We present the results of study with 43 (27 female) participants, (M=35, SD=12), 37 of whom had no/very little prior experience with VR. Compared to the other three conditions, a realistic representation of air pollution (magnified PM) led to self-reported aversion. Importantly, the overall experience increased pro-environmental attitudes. Participants experienced a strong sense of presence and engagement in the simulation. The study highlighted the usefulness of semi-restricted and spontaneous exploration in VR research for unrestrained exposure to stimuli. It also corroborated recent evidence of how VR-based interventions can promote pro-environmental change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65b3273c40e3ff6b12a08a70"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741827","mniswId":"785","fullName":"IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality","shortName":"ISMAR","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"c69500fc-9edc-4322-958b-ca4746728781"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6572e9b44097071b8e6e143f","startDate":"2023-10-16","endDate":"2023-10-20","fullName":"IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality Adjunct (ISMAR-Adjunct) 2023","shortName":"ISMAR","city":"Sydney","country":"AU","website":"https://sin.put.poznan.pl/conferences/details/conference/ieee-international-symposium-on-mixed-and-augmented-reality-adjunct-(ismar-adjunct)","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"e831f8f7-1017-4609-886b-a37ece067ade"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65952b0c40970740be8ad1ef","65952b0c40970740be8ad1f1","65952b0c40970740be8ad1f2","65952b0c40970740be8ad1f4","65952b0c40970740be8ad1f5","65b3273c40e3ff6b12a08a70","65952b0c40970740be8ad1f7","65952b0c40970740be8ad1f8","65952b0c40970740be8ad1f9","5e709479878c28a0473bdfb4","5fb3dd60085dcb64f926a050"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654923473"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66aa1faefdbe8339bd9c6d1c","name":"Xuemin","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"2061b0b4-4953-4091-812f-a7b518b541fe"},{"objectId":"66aa1faefdbe8339bd9c6d1b","name":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"b653455d-f0d2-44ce-9be4-2875c04e2226"},{"objectId":"66aa1faefdbe8339bd9c6d1a","name":"Wenjie","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"5975c381-edd4-49a4-ac0f-c5ff92490fc6"},{"objectId":"66aa1faefdbe8339bd9c6d19","name":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"9d88efcd-cb65-40d1-bbca-80da075d2c62"},{"objectId":"5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca","name":"Maria","lastName":"Orłowska","uuid":"519D1C0859CDAF43088E1B927500ECFA0C80C433FE2DB88C6A0260CE88DA85C78A3E16FE02020B42034E9342568C4E346F6DF0547B240983432610969C2C0F12","orcidId":"0000-0002-5234-7925","documentHash":"a661f1c1-9398-4352-a3ba-08b15a0464cb"}],"objectId":"66aa1faefdbe8339bd9c6d18","doi":"10.1109/icde60146.2024.00255","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/10597630/10597390/10597745.pdf?arnumber=10597745","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"TimeSGN: Scalable and Effective Temporal Graph Neural Network","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Temporal graph neural networks (T-GNNs) have emerged as leading approaches for representation learning over dynamic graphs. However, existing solutions typically suffer from exponential time complexity with model depth and excessive GPU memory usage due to acceleration techniques, and cannot handle large dynamic graphs. Furthermore, the core component of T-G NNs, temporal message passing, still predominantly derives from static GNNs. This neglects the distinct characteristics of two types of features, timestamps and edge features, and results in sub-optimal embedding quality. Consequently, existing T-GNNs fail to scale to large dynamic graphs and generalize well in unseen or complex scenarios, limiting their applicability. To bridge the gap, this paper first proposes a simple yet effective temporal message passing paradigm for T-GNNs, called the divided temporal message passing (DT-MP) paradigm, which enables effective feature learning for each feature type. We theoretically demonstrate that the DT-MP paradigm can reduce GPU memory usage compared to existing T-GNNs. Building on this foundation, we propose TimeSGN, a scalable and effective temporal graph neural network, which can handle billion-scale dynamic graphs. Specifically, we design a linear state updater to effectively capture node dynamic evolution and instantiate the DT-MP paradigm using two 1-layer self-attention mechanisms for temporal message passing to generate temporal embeddings. As a result, TimeSGN fundamentally avoids exponential time complexity and significantly reduces GPU memory usage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeSGN achieves an average 10.56% improvement in accuracy, up to 42.48% reduction in training GPU memory, and up to 5 x speedup in per-epoch training time compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, while being one order of magnitude faster than vanilla T-GNNs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157418e1","mniswId":"986","fullName":"International Conference on Data Engineering","shortName":"ICDE","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"4fc95aeb-3aa0-4ebc-be23-22e1d52785ac"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"66aa1de1fdbe8339bd9c526b","startDate":"2024-05-13","endDate":"2024-07-16","fullName":"2024 IEEE 40th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","shortName":"2024 IEEE 40th International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","city":"Utrecht","country":"NL","website":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10597630/proceeding","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"f5d53382-c3f5-49b6-ad9b-d674ccad2863"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66aa1faefdbe8339bd9c6d19","66aa1faefdbe8339bd9c6d1a","66aa1faefdbe8339bd9c6d1b","66aa1faefdbe8339bd9c6d1c","5e70933c878c28a0473a56ca"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"66aa1f56fdbe8339bd9c69f4","doi":"10.1109/icde60146.2024","title":"International Conference on Data Engineering","year":2024,"url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10597630/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"02ed403c-dd75-4b19-9691-78b399fe1d48"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654991250"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66e29909fdbe83163aacee56","name":"Agata","lastName":"Konarska","documentHash":"4f188329-3f68-4029-b5ed-b01acbf337db"},{"objectId":"66e29909fdbe83163aacee55","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Piotrowska-Weryszko","documentHash":"fceccbab-d8bf-4768-973b-82be46d05b4f"},{"objectId":"66e29909fdbe83163aacee54","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kubik-Komar","documentHash":"1a549894-310e-4c89-ad8b-b5ba897551c8"},{"objectId":"66e29909fdbe83163aacee52","name":"Elzbieta","lastName":"Kubera","documentHash":"3e9700f9-c95d-49cd-a48f-389bd2854f88"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a56dc","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Wieczorkowska","uuid":"46600514BED4E6C82715C2029D75BEF3C7DDD89FC89A0203B2F4679DC238BD5D11615665CE35053AADE03307F25EA17CD5E2AC5260E07A7542910599150CD8AC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2033-6372","documentHash":"dabddac0-46b5-4ec2-b3f0-cca192eccb56"}],"objectId":"66e29909fdbe83163aacee51","doi":"10.62036/isd.2024.61","publicUri":"https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1609&amp;context=isd2014&amp;unstamped=1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Image Processing for Improving Detection of Pollen Grains in Light Microscopy Images","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we address the problem of preparing data for training detectors to identify transparent objects in light microscopy images. To this end, we propose using blends of reference images and monitoring background, instead of time-consuming labelling of monitoring data. This approach allowed us to avoid the need to involve a palynologist in the preparation of the training data while also ensuring 100% correct ground-truth labels. The statistical analysis of the deep learning results confirms that the results obtained for blends only are more stable, and in some cases surpass the results obtained for the training set with some labelled monitoring data added to reference images and monitoring background."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","uid":"bWeBck5Y6s9ly49nvE8-NPA","uuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","name":"Polsko-Japońska Akademia Technik Komputerowych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933d878c28a0473a56dc"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","parentUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcaa","rootUuid":"9d1eca9c-696f-4908-b65b-8c54eadeb76e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741937","mniswId":"1080","fullName":"International Conference on Information Systems Development","shortName":"ISD","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"60406b62-d15d-4757-aabd-60c83fed2114"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"66e29564fdbe83163aacbf89","startDate":"2024-08-26","endDate":"2024-08-28","fullName":"32st International Conference on Information Systems Development [ISD2024]","shortName":"ISD2024","city":"Gdańsk","country":"PL","website":"https://aisel.aisnet.org/isd2014/proceedings2024/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"eb4bed0a-ecce-4767-a262-04b696f15310"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66e29909fdbe83163aacee52","5e70933d878c28a0473a56dc","66e29909fdbe83163aacee54","66e29909fdbe83163aacee55","66e29909fdbe83163aacee56"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"66e2972dfdbe83163aaccc96","title":"Proceedings of 32ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT","year":2024,"translation":false,"documentHash":"e7baef4e-ae3e-4b4d-8d79-78bbc998c913"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655011918"}]
