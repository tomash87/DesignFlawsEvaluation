Environmental qualities of those lakes belonging to the NATURA2000 network dictate efforts aimed at their conservation through the maintenance of the barriers. The use of recently elaborated high resolution geological surveys demonstrated previously underestimated severe sand scarcity and indicated high threats of enhanced erosion, breaching and overtopping of the barriers. Next, the investigation of alongshore variation of nearshore wave energy dissipation, basing on the available bathymetric records and the concept of ordinary and empirical equilibrium profiles, identified potential erosion hot spots along the barriers. Finally, the XBeach model was applied to simulate the effects of rare, heavy storms with the recurrence period of 20 years with and without climate change induced sea level rise. Overall, the results demonstrated high susceptibility of the barriers to frequent fragmentation and allowed for recommendations of protection measures minimizing interference into the natural landscapes. The novelty of the paper consists in the assessment of aftermaths of extreme events by combining recent advances in coastal geology and climate change effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae","5e7092d3878c28a04739d788"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d788","5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":" FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE","eissn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"57e7b9cc-ffe0-45b0-8d0d-9a60df59321d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a523b2467f06a1edbdb2f","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"17b56cb2-5e8f-41ce-a89d-d4b387701e78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058064903"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d792","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Szmytkiewicz","uuid":"E596E2CA38F68576509EA5B24470A03381CEBE676ABA9CBCE3F46C53A18619EDBCB8A3A02FA49C179BD65CE2CBCAC85FEE795A5FEE166EDDAC62E1145FC48A51","documentHash":"7bf58447-d1b0-42f0-a5ed-74db564a23ab"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d77f","name":"RAFAŁ","lastName":"OSTROWSKI","uuid":"E16ED4971A8BD2E2AAC87A2091650D8096C330ED0C4A5E39178038504086C19A9917426F5E0737C631289096A078E2DFAD99714937A299FB6B968F23A1A05C8E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0149-6744","documentHash":"47ec5e8c-a19a-4936-a487-69891305d26e"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Cerkowniak","uuid":"59961B05C254534949F8FCBEF00C04E41CC4F1008E72D31B3B91BDFEEA3BBF05EC156793EBF2D77C0ABAB0FC29DAA04E5EA33F38F4C32F30875BD31DB4389284","orcidId":"0000-0001-6743-6640","documentHash":"dbc9fb45-930d-4ca9-bf50-89743743d9f7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-01-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62177f622467f05a132faae8","doi":"10.3390/app12020668","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/2/668/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Impact of the Revetment on the Seashore in the Region of Babie Doły (KM 93.6–93.9), Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present paper addresses the litho-dynamic and morpho-dynamic processes in the coastal zone of Babie Doły (KM 93.6–93.9), Poland.

The phenomena governing pore water generation, which leads to liquefaction in fully saturated soils, are already quite well described. However, much less is known of these phenomena occurring in partially saturated porous media, although this, too, is an important issue in geotechnics. This study presents the application of a semi-empirical model to predict the response of partially saturated soils under undrained conditions. The model proposed is based on an incremental equation describing the pre-failure undrained response of partially saturated non-cohesive soils during monotonic shearing in a standard triaxial test. Improved differential equations taking into account pore fluid compressibility were implemented together with empirical coefficients describing soil skeleton compressibility during the unloading phase. Model coefficients were determined in triaxial compression tests. The influence of the saturation level represented by Skempton’s parameter B on the full spectrum of predicted stress paths was shown. For the analyzed saturation range, the maximum stress deviator normalized by initial mean effective stress varied from 0.38 to 1.67 for B values between 0.93 and 0.29, respectively. Model predictions were confronted with the results of triaxial tests for two types of non-cohesive soils (quartz medium sand and copper ore post-flotation industrial tailings). Good agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions was achieved."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac106","5e7092d3878c28a04739d793"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"2076","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d793","5e709388878c28a0473ac106"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff812ad49b31ccec57c8a","title":"MDPI Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"4610cc44-2259-40ac-837e-8a49cf019854"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["incremental equations; non-cohesive soil; partial saturation; liquefaction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058117809"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6305de3140970740ad1a535c","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Zounemat-Kermani","documentHash":"0195322a-e9c2-48bf-ac50-004cd051ebb4"},{"objectId":"60c343479543c7233654429d","name":"AMIN","lastName":"MAHDAVI-MEYMAND","uuid":"167AFD4914270F58E0F8950DDFB3E553813B0B52C5B0649475CB678B544BCB067469BCB66A5ACF3CC13394D75AC51BE56D077BEDED4FF06E5E14B36F17DF8F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9125-5214","documentHash":"b3a7f947-108f-4df4-83ce-230ded372266"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"SULISZ","uuid":"EBCF1A5E7B3B8E6BEF61B514E57C14FDF54F4F6360CCA403B68C48AF0ECE38756687859448333EAF147A615DB29B28B8FF916144FC58914E334F3AEBE45FFD66","documentHash":"37ccd788-9e8d-411a-92c4-797d82e1aa80"}],"objectId":"6305de3140970740ad1a5359","doi":"10.17531/ein.2022.2.2","publicUri":"http://ein.org.pl/sites/default/files/2022-02-02.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A comprehensive study on the application of firefly algorithm in prediction of energy dissipation on block ramps","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study novel integrative machine learning models embedded with the firefly algorithm\n(FA) were developed and employed to predict energy dissipation on block ramps.

Initially, the fast sea-level rise (up to 9.0 mm/yr) slowed down about 6000 yr b2k to ca. 1.0 mm/yr. In the last 5000 years, the sea level rose at a rate of 0.5 mm/yr in both sites. Analysed data allow distinguishing an extreme event (or events) that disturbed a rather regular course of sea-level rise, which occurred between 7314 and 7022 yr b2k. The history of sea-level changes was similar in the eastern part of Pomeranian Bay and the Szczecin Lagoon despite differences in the geological structure of the pre-Quaternary bedrock and potential various trends in vertical crustal movements. Similarities to some other regions of the southern Baltic and the world ocean allow assuming that sea-level changes in the study area in the last 9000 years in general were eustatic in nature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709498878c28a0473c0245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"351-368","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709498878c28a0473c0245","5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f35","mniswId":"7689","title":"Holocene","issn":"0959-6836","documentHash":"a5c59508-6f16-42f8-a17b-0c2cc227fa1c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Holocene, Pomeranian Bay, radiocarbon dating, sea-level changes, southern Baltic Sea, Szczecin Lagoon"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058189295"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d76a","name":"MAREK","lastName":"KULCZYKOWSKI","uuid":"BA0F4DD4018E2490110AB19B6F8C1A6D3CA6808F3EF93EE8C37555821BCFC6B436F2A2823B8EB1ADEC5014D8D52930950105064EEBEC5505D956BC51DB3B216B","documentHash":"817fe584-ca6b-45b3-a8c0-9a4e2c208c8d"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4bc","name":"KRYSTYNA","lastName":"KAZIMIEROWICZ-FRANKOWSKA","uuid":"A30427D82C2895EB2BA3552D42A391443523DB2256D92AF2CFADAB6B2F936984396B29236F8110BD29D05A402FD4397AE114204EEB20D8858904FC2D6BFEBC1F","documentHash":"3acf3d89-be0c-402f-b36f-e215072e136c"}],"objectId":"6305f23040970740ad1b17e4","doi":"10.3390/app12146895","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/14/6895/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Laboratory Testing and Theoretical Modeling of Deformations of Reinforced Soil Wall","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of a vertical reinforced soil (RS) wall.

Horizontal displacements on the surface of the model wall were monitored at the end of construction and during surcharge application (as post-construction displacements). The experimental results were compared with their theoretical predictions. The accuracy of the selected analytical approach was examined to predict deformations of the RS structure under external loading. It was shown that the proposed original and relatively simple analytical method for estimating structural deformation can be successfully used in practice (the average difference between the recorded and calculated values of deformation did not exceed 25%). From a scientific point of view, an important element of this work was the analysis of the effect of friction between the backfill and the side walls of the test box on the measured displacements. For the investigated case, it was shown that the impact of this element caused a reduction in the value of external loading of more than 60%. The final results may be particularly useful in the design process of structures used in transportation engineering (bridge abutments), where deformation limit values cannot be exceeded."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d76a","5e7092c4878c28a04739c4bc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"6895","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c4bc","5e7092d3878c28a04739d76a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff33dad49b31ccec0104f","title":"Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"96f827ef-c2c8-4b76-ab17-c7357fffee4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d51b254097074b28a776f3","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"14","documentHash":"54302db1-366b-439e-acc7-3f0ab1f47b4a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["reinforced soil walls; experimental tests; facing displacements; analytical methods"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058221348"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a8e","name":"MAŁGORZATA ","lastName":"BIELECKA","uuid":"7806D3F4C3F1B1498C7D9AA9FC8426019585770B98834CD06323820C802D5F25676DB251888905D0C32D085C9DE140C006F6634B6E598ACEC074209AF4BB3E75","orcidId":"0000-0003-4911-5071","documentHash":"1172b418-7887-4f7d-a35b-07e8192039fa"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d788","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"RÓŻYŃSKI","uuid":"1A2E1D08420262EA31BBB75945DDD4BC9BC182679758D171C1952081AC88F6CCB5F8F90140400923DF7FAAF7409CE4E3CA481F107E580269BB558289D3DDB5AE","orcidId":"0000-0001-9822-9847","documentHash":"f3d94f10-4403-4e16-8f0f-d897433bade0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-09-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"633d4578409707220fbc7f10","doi":"10.1016/j.marpol.2022.105288","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0308597X22003359?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sediment quality in the Polish part of the trans-boundary Vistula Lagoon: implications for deposition management","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Vistula Lagoon is located in Europe and is the second largest lagoon in the Baltic Sea, after Curonian Lagoon. It is a transboundary water basin shared by Poland and Russia. The entire Polish part is a NATURA 2000 area. The whole lagoon area requires economic rehabilitation comprising integrated management involving ecological, social and economic interactions and couplings. Currently most of the actions and investments are devoted to development of local tourism and stimulation of local economy by construction of new marinas and small harbors. In Polish part this is enhanced by the Vistula Spit cross-cut construction. Such activities result in a need for expansion of navigational channels leading to their dredging and necessity of safe management of the dredged deposit. Investigations of sediment quality thus became indispensable. To assess its quality, sediment samples were collected in the Polish and Russian part of the Vistula Lagoon to evaluate and compare soil strength parameters and the concentrations of harmful substances in both parts. Due to the current political situation and interruption of scientific contacts between the Russian and Polish researchers only the results obtained for the Polish part are reported herein. The analysis revealed that the studied sediments are generally very weak in terms of strength parameters but safe as regards the presence of dangerous substances according to EU regulations. This allows for deposition in the form of artificial islands that will ultimately fulfill important ecosystem services and provide long term solution for the excess sediment management."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a8e","5e7092d3878c28a04739d788"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"146","pagesFromTo":"105288","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d788","5e709410878c28a0473b5a8e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d72","mniswId":"13922","title":"Marine Policy","issn":"0308-597X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5230c437-323b-44d0-9e98-12f3e0ee2fc2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633d4578409707220fbc7f11","year":"2022","volume":"146","documentHash":"04c955bf-436b-4a2f-ba36-2eac50c5cf6f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Coastal lagoonsTrans-boundary basinsEcosystem servicesMuddy sedimentsDredgingSediment management"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058246845"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6375feb440970765d4636333","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Zounemat-Kermani","documentHash":"2c1a4f57-42dd-4f19-b756-6135b43b649b"},{"objectId":"60c343479543c7233654429d","name":"AMIN","lastName":"MAHDAVI-MEYMAND","uuid":"167AFD4914270F58E0F8950DDFB3E553813B0B52C5B0649475CB678B544BCB067469BCB66A5ACF3CC13394D75AC51BE56D077BEDED4FF06E5E14B36F17DF8F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9125-5214","documentHash":"b3a7f947-108f-4df4-83ce-230ded372266"}],"objectId":"6375feb440970765d4636330","doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2022.110032","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S095070512201125X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Homonuclear Molecules Optimization (HMO) meta-heuristic algorithm","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study introduces a novel meta-heuristic algorithm known as Homonuclear Molecules Optimization (HMO) for optimizing complex and nonlinear problems.

This algorithm is based on creating the initial population of a set of atoms in the search space and the electrons associated with each atom (searching agents) given the quantum numbers. In each iteration, the best electron of each atom is selected as the new location of the nucleus, and a number of atoms move toward the atom with the best solution to form a homonuclear molecule. The results of applying the MHO algorithm were evaluated in comparison with three classical optimization algorithms of PSO, GA, and DE along with a novel algorithm called Equilibrium Optimizer (EO). The HMO was able to precisely solve unimodal functions and find global and local solutions for multimodal functions. The outcomes of Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test demonstrated that there is a significant difference between the final results of HMO and those of the other algorithms (.05%).

Evaluation of results demonstrated that the HGSO and EO algorithms could enhance the accuracy of the GMDH model (up to 26% and 22% in terms of RMSE), respectively. According to statistical criteria, the SVR-EO and SVR-HGSO provided the highest accuracy in both training (R2 = 0.98) and validation phases (R2 = 0.96). Moreover, among the developed models, the GMDH-HGSO algorithm provided excellent fitness to the observed data (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 22.37, MAE = 15.65, and MARE = 0.26). The results indicated the high efficiency of the HGSO and EO algorithms in improving the accuracy of the GMDH and SVR models. However, among the developed models, the GMDH-HGSO is the most accurate model and is recommended for sediment transport modelling."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c343479543c7233654429d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a418cc40970710a6d9b4cd","63a418cc40970710a6d9b4ce","63a418cc40970710a6d9b4cf","63a418cc40970710a6d9b4d0","63a418cc40970710a6d9b4d1","60c343479543c7233654429d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","documentHash":"b6d73d02-ec27-4baa-91e9-d28a7a700218"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058364778"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63a426b240970710a6dae32a","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Zounemat-Kermani","documentHash":"44fecdaf-ff94-4519-ad1f-089e5c1a066c"},{"objectId":"63a426b240970710a6dae329","name":"Ammar","lastName":"Aldallal","documentHash":"792c31b9-45ef-4c50-8eed-7d24df388ba9"},{"objectId":"63a426b240970710a6dae327","name":"Sareh","lastName":"Sayari","documentHash":"918cf794-bad0-44fc-b9bc-cdf7c4dda3d9"},{"objectId":"60c343479543c7233654429d","name":"AMIN","lastName":"MAHDAVI-MEYMAND","uuid":"167AFD4914270F58E0F8950DDFB3E553813B0B52C5B0649475CB678B544BCB067469BCB66A5ACF3CC13394D75AC51BE56D077BEDED4FF06E5E14B36F17DF8F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9125-5214","documentHash":"b3a7f947-108f-4df4-83ce-230ded372266"}],"objectId":"63a426b240970710a6dae325","doi":"10.1007/s12517-022-10274-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12517-022-10274-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Meta-learner methods in forecasting regulated and natural river flow","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Monthly river flow forecasting has a vital role in many water resource management activities, especially in extreme events such as flood and drought. Therefore, experts need a reliable and precise model for forecasting. The ensemble machine learning (EML) models can provide more accurate results by combining coupled models. To this end, the chief aim of this study is to present multiple individual and integrated approaches to achieve more precise predictions. This study investigates the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and group method of data handling (GMDH) models along with EML models including stacking and averaging techniques for forecasting regulated and natural river flow. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR) strategies are applied as meta-learner EMLs as well as simple and weighted averaging. Monthly river flow datasets were collected from the Nashua River and the St. John River in the USA evaluating all models. The models’ performances are compared using five standard evaluation indices such as the root mean square error, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, mean absolute error, mean index of agreement, and coefficient of determination (R2). In both modeling scenarios, the predicative stacking-SVR model followed by the simple averaging, weighted averaging, GMDH, and stacking-MLR acted appropriately with R2 of 0.996 in the Nashua River (regulated) and 0.909 in the St. John River (natural flow). The prediction results of the MLPNN and ANFIS models were almost similar. Overall, the EMLs produce more precise and reliable predictions, demonstrating the superiority of EML methodologies over individual models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c343479543c7233654429d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a426b240970710a6dae327","60c343479543c7233654429d","63a426b240970710a6dae329","63a426b240970710a6dae32a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477171","mniswId":"1567","title":"Arabian Journal of Geosciences","issn":"1866-7511","eissn":"1866-7538","documentHash":"a1de70d1-fa49-4890-af03-623e44e070c0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a426b240970710a6dae326","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"11","documentHash":"cb127af5-29d5-4e8d-a71a-4eca345664c4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Artificial intelligence Soft computing Stacking ensemble modeling River flow Prediction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058379151"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63a41da040970710a6da2772","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Zounemat-Kermani","documentHash":"36e40ed7-29d4-4812-8e7a-19fd4df506b0"},{"objectId":"60c343479543c7233654429d","name":"AMIN","lastName":"MAHDAVI-MEYMAND","uuid":"167AFD4914270F58E0F8950DDFB3E553813B0B52C5B0649475CB678B544BCB067469BCB66A5ACF3CC13394D75AC51BE56D077BEDED4FF06E5E14B36F17DF8F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9125-5214","documentHash":"b3a7f947-108f-4df4-83ce-230ded372266"}],"objectId":"63a41da040970710a6da276f","doi":"10.1080/17445302.2022.2140528","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17445302.2022.2140528","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Application of mayfly algorithm for prediction of removed sediment in hydro-suction dredging systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The sedimentation in coastlines, waterways, and reservoirs is an environmental problem that can be coped with sediment removal systems such as hydro-suction.

The proposed equivalent mechanical system may be applied to a class of problems covering irrotational flow of an inviscid and incompressible fluid inside partially-filled rectangular containers exposed to translatory oscillations. An analytical solution to the problem is provided under the assumption of a small-amplitude monochromatic forcing for a classical linear wavemaker in a closed flume and two- and three-dimensional twin wavemaker problems. The model is extended to cover an arbitrary horizontal motion using a semi-analytical approach based on a difference time-marching schemes applied to linearised evolution equations in a spectral domain. This relatively simple conceptual model may be used to design a novel experimental framework for studying water wave mechanics at smaller scales relying on elongated sloshing tanks substituting typical wave flumes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d784"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"272","pagesFromTo":"113919","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d784"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c2","mniswId":"15344","title":"OCEAN ENGINEERING","issn":"0029-8018","documentHash":"516179a8-a9a7-44c4-a357-9eed3680be10"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f87da34097070992704a73","year":"2023","volume":"272","documentHash":"b39863ce-1524-48cd-86ac-6196fa2b9be4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Water waves Wavemaker problem Sloshing Analytical solution Spectral method Wave flume"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526388"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399422","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"STELLA-BOGUSZ","uuid":"7CDD73C5425A2CAF36CD2C7AA60E7854FA5038E99064A7D6DCEC4CE63D269599A7E64F9CE8253C811E8B1A15B0C58CEBC8B6517DC3144476E50CF63D97A21673","orcidId":"0000-0002-1641-4027","documentHash":"ce2f144f-ae27-49bb-99ba-73609a303fc4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2023-04-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6465f9984097074d0a917f5a","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2023.03.001","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S007832342300026X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Bed forms under the combined action of waves and wind-driven currents in the remote foreshore of the non-tidal sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents a prediction of bed form parameters (length and height) in the remote foreshore of the non-tidal sea.

Barriers are the most common landform type in the southern part of the Baltic Sea area. Despite the long history of research, the issue of barrier coast evolution remains unresolved. The topic of this research is to determine the conditions under which the barrier coast evolved in the Holocene and to explain the local, different histories of its development. A 35 km long stretch of the coastal zone in the eastern Pomeranian Bay (southern Baltic) was explored using boreholes, seismoacoustic and GPR profiling, as well as radiocarbon and OSL dating, biostratigraphic studies and lithological analysis. Three main groups of deposits were identified: barrier subsoil deposits, barrier deposits (marine and aeolian sand, as well as interdune peat) and Rega River delta deposits. In the early Northgrippian (~8000 yr b2k), the coastline was located from about 2 to 12 km north of its present position. In the period 8000–6000 yr b2k, the coastline migrated southwards (landwards), initially at a rate of up to 22 m/yr and later up to 2 m/yr. The main driving forces at that time were climate warming and rapid sea level rise. When the Holocene transgression ceased, there were three different histories of the barrier coast development in the study area: a barrier that was still transgressive, a barrier that evolved from transgressive to progradational, and a barrier that evolved from transgressive trough progradational to transgressive again. The main determinants of these different histories were the lithology and relief of the barrier subsoil (accommodation space) and the time-varying amount of sand available for barrier formation, which varied in different parts of the study area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709498878c28a0473c0245"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"759–780","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709498878c28a0473c0245","5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f35","mniswId":"7689","title":"Holocene","issn":"0959-6836","eissn":"1477-0911","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"396f5934-d85e-4cab-9c54-4d5d23d7f932"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Baltic Sea, barrier development determinants, grain-size analysis, Middle&Late-Holocene, OSL dating, radiocarbon dating"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058636188"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6465eb094097074d0a906e26","name":"Muzafar A.","lastName":"Kalwar","documentHash":"a9a962ed-5609-49ba-b834-1976cb7e5350"}],"objectId":"6465eb094097074d0a906e25","doi":"10.2478/ama-2023-0017","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/ama-2023-0017","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Geological and Geotechnical Assessment of Aggregates Used in Nagar Parker District Tharparkar Sindh Pakistan","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aims to determine the geology of granite and evaluate the engineering properties of the samples to make recommendations for the construction industry. The study area is situated in the Nagar Parker complex in Pakistan, which is located in the extreme south-east of the Thar District and the desert of the Sindh Province, near the Run of Kutch (24 15–35 30 N, 70 40–58 07 E), and it covers ca. 500–1,000 km2. In this region, several Quaternary deposits, subordinate and dispersed Jurassic–Tertiary sandstones and clays are overlying the Nagar Igneous Complex basement. According to international standards, there are various possible aggregate sources. However, only a few of them have been reviewed for suitability reasons. Six quarries in Nagar Parker, Pakistan, were selected for evaluation as coarse aggregate in concrete construction and civil engineering works in this research. Although the aggregates from the six quarries are specified and already widely used in the Sindh Province, there is a lack of studies on their geological properties. The results of the presented research revealed that samples from Dhedvero, Karai, Nagarparkar, Mokrio, Dinsi and Wadlai meet all of the international standard requirements for aggregates. Geotechnical, petrographic and geochemistry laboratory tests were conducted in this research and included bulk density, water absorption, specific gravity test, index of flakiness and elongation, soundness aggregate test, crushing value aggregate, impact value aggregate and abrasion value of Los Angeles. Furthermore, chemical alkali-silica reaction potential test and petrographic examination were tested. As a result, we evaluated the properties of granite, which is a crystalline igneous rock with a visibly crystalline structure and texture, made up of feldspar, i.e., potash feldspar and oligoclase. The evaluated minerals are compatible with the standards of civil engineering works and can be used as a concrete aggregate. The evaluated three types of minerals included Dhedvero simple intrusion, Nagar pink granite and grey granite."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6465eb094097074d0a906e26"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"160-165","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6465eb094097074d0a906e26"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b74","mniswId":"241","title":"Acta Mechanica et Automatica","issn":"2300-5319","documentHash":"875c5491-f6f7-4f79-9108-ca18a01b5d2e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64462b8e4097076e1e860faa","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"17","number":"2","documentHash":"69d74860-a66f-4d20-8120-b310a72b65e3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["geotechnical engineering   granite   aggregate   construction   Nagar Parker"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058694259"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64a402fc40970738ce7a9068","name":"Wei","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"b209f59f-76ee-449c-a58c-7d972acbcce1"},{"objectId":"64a402fc40970738ce7a9067","name":"Enrico","lastName":"Soranzo","documentHash":"4a0d6444-c4c6-4b1e-9204-3e20aa1fab24"},{"objectId":"64a402fc40970738ce7a9066","name":"Carlotta","lastName":"Guardiani","documentHash":"383853d0-8756-4e9a-8e08-d4c1c1a696c0"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac104","name":"BARBARA","lastName":"ŚWITAŁA","uuid":"7230C976E90C9882B99814612800B866533BD4049D96E6A6AEAD3417319AE58F82117F541677470D23CE5ECAC403C480BE982851795A5D4D6AF480BF0A6E2DA6","orcidId":"0000-0001-8548-4689","documentHash":"29125e29-3495-4ca6-ada3-71176e486de4"}],"objectId":"64a402fc40970738ce7a9063","doi":"10.1139/cgj-2022-0696","publicUri":"https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/cgj-2022-0696","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Machine Learning-aided reliability analysis of rainfall-induced landslide of root-reinforced slopes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Estimating the failure probability of rainfall-induced landslides is often challenging as the triggering mechanism is influenced by a number of parameters whose uncertainty is difficult to quantify and, in practice, is neglected.

In this study, we present the application of a coupled hydro-mechanical model for the effect of plant roots on soil shear strength. First, a deterministic approach is adopted. Then, a reliability analysis of a root-reinforced slope subjected to rainfall is performed by considering the inherent variability of the soil and root properties. The probability of failure is estimated with machine learning surrogate models, which approximate the nonlinear relationship between constitutive parameters and slope displacements at different time steps. The machine learning algorithms are trained on a small dataset. The extreme gradient boosting is the best-performing algorithm with R² ≥ 0.975 and is then employed to estimate the probability of failure on a larger dataset of one million datapoints with higher accuracy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac104"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac104","64a402fc40970738ce7a9066","64a402fc40970738ce7a9067","64a402fc40970738ce7a9068"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454774e3","mniswId":"3096","title":"CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL","issn":"0008-3674","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"cdf713d4-1ad3-4c51-a426-3389006c0336"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64a402fc40970738ce7a9064","year":"2023","documentHash":"03181f14-05c0-4033-8c2e-34b19870342c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058760184"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d77f","name":"RAFAŁ","lastName":"OSTROWSKI","uuid":"E16ED4971A8BD2E2AAC87A2091650D8096C330ED0C4A5E39178038504086C19A9917426F5E0737C631289096A078E2DFAD99714937A299FB6B968F23A1A05C8E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0149-6744","documentHash":"47ec5e8c-a19a-4936-a487-69891305d26e"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399422","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"STELLA-BOGUSZ","uuid":"7CDD73C5425A2CAF36CD2C7AA60E7854FA5038E99064A7D6DCEC4CE63D269599A7E64F9CE8253C811E8B1A15B0C58CEBC8B6517DC3144476E50CF63D97A21673","orcidId":"0000-0002-1641-4027","documentHash":"ce2f144f-ae27-49bb-99ba-73609a303fc4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2023-06-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64a401c740970738ce7a7b21","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2023.06.003","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0078323423000611?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Modified logarithmic distribution of wind-driven flow velocity in remote foreshore of the non-tidal sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the results of the novel modelling of the wind-driven current in the southern Baltic Sea.

This is an original and surprising outcome of significant practical importance as the large nonlinear pressure and plate deflection components may spark a resonance. The problem is serious because plate natural vibration frequencies are often lower than the frequency of fundamental waves or their nonlinear components and the vibration of a plate may be amplified by incoming waves or their nonlinear products. The occurrence of a resonance amplified by incoming waves may lead to the failure of a structure.

These emerged after a series of almost overlapping storms in January and February 2022, causing massive dune retreat at locations where hitherto relatively stable beaches demonstrated sediment deficits under long periods of more energetic wave climate and especially elevated sea levels. On the other hand, sand-saturated areas showed greater resilience. The potential sediment scarcity is expected to be linked to a possible interaction between local geological makeup and climate change-induced increases in storminess. Sandy beaches with pronounced organic intrusions become no longer sufficiently resilient. The culprit seems to be peat outcrops on the emerged beaches and its lenses inside dune massifs. Under such circumstances, it can be expected that in the future, initially isolated erosion hotspots will gradually transform into large erosion embayments. Consequently, future coastal protection and management will no longer be able to rely solely on pure nature-based solutions, but, respecting the building with nature paradigm, will involve more complex schemes with unnatural materials kept at the minimum volume to avoid disruption of seascape/landscape and discontinuity and disconnectivity of ecosystem services. However, it is important to realize that such more advanced protection measures will come at a higher cost, and coastal segments without vital economic or ecological value will have to be abandoned."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d788"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"266","pagesFromTo":"105080","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d788"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777e6","mniswId":"4393","title":"Continental Shelf Research","issn":"0278-4343","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"75ab7b08-e6eb-4397-86ad-544a8e0c0feb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64dc92934097071887071524","year":"2023","volume":"266","documentHash":"ccf32cfb-3805-42b9-bc59-041c6263bad4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["storms"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058801768"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c343479543c7233654429d","name":"AMIN","lastName":"MAHDAVI-MEYMAND","uuid":"167AFD4914270F58E0F8950DDFB3E553813B0B52C5B0649475CB678B544BCB067469BCB66A5ACF3CC13394D75AC51BE56D077BEDED4FF06E5E14B36F17DF8F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9125-5214","documentHash":"b3a7f947-108f-4df4-83ce-230ded372266"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"SULISZ","uuid":"EBCF1A5E7B3B8E6BEF61B514E57C14FDF54F4F6360CCA403B68C48AF0ECE38756687859448333EAF147A615DB29B28B8FF916144FC58914E334F3AEBE45FFD66","documentHash":"37ccd788-9e8d-411a-92c4-797d82e1aa80"}],"objectId":"64dc8dee409707188706b542","doi":"10.1016/j.renene.2023.03.118","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0960148123004214?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Application of nested artificial neural network for the prediction of significant wave height","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Significant wave height is the most important parameter in feasibility studies and the design of wave energy converters.

This is a complex problem due to the many aspects of vegetation presence that must betaken into account. The numerical model should be able to consider mechanical root reinforcement and root water uptake,which can lead to soil desaturation. This paper presents the application of the strength reduction method to the ModifiedCam-Clay model for unsaturated, root-reinforced soils, which allows for the quantitative estimation of slope stability. Thetechnique is implemented in finite element software and tested using several numerical examples.

The ARIA algorithms, similar to a random forest (RF) technique, combine a set of models trained on different subsets of data in an ensemble structure. Five ARIA-type models were developed based on shallow neural network (SNN), deep neural network (DNN), support vector regression (SVR), classification and regression decision tree (CART), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Synthesis index (SI) and visual graphs were used to rank models. Results show that the developed ARIA models are far more accurate than their regular counterparts. The ARIAs increase the prediction efficiency of regular modes by up to 25.04 %. The ARIA-ANFIS with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.027 °C outperformed other models and regression equations. The developed ARIA-ANFIS decreases the error of corresponding RF prediction by 69.66 % (RMSE = 0.089 °C), which is a significant achievement because RF is a widely recognized model and numerous studies underline the high accuracies of RF applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","60c343479543c7233654429d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"567","pagesFromTo":"116990","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c343479543c7233654429d","5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477919","mniswId":"4957","title":"Desalination","issn":"0011-9164","eissn":"1873-4464","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"246f8064-2e4f-4056-929b-6398b52cb46c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655731c74097077c678effb0","year":"2023","volume":"567","documentHash":"7d550f87-6d41-4114-a635-615d6af7f7c3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DesalinationDeep neural networkPSCORandom forest"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059021607"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"653b7ef14097072fe522c8d8","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Sorek","documentHash":"62302351-35de-4b20-acb5-66005f54ea01"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"SULISZ","uuid":"EBCF1A5E7B3B8E6BEF61B514E57C14FDF54F4F6360CCA403B68C48AF0ECE38756687859448333EAF147A615DB29B28B8FF916144FC58914E334F3AEBE45FFD66","documentHash":"37ccd788-9e8d-411a-92c4-797d82e1aa80"}],"objectId":"653b7ef14097072fe522c8d7","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-39337-6","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-39337-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A serpent-type wave energy converter","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The problem of the interaction of waves with a serpent-type wave energy converter was investigated, and a novel 3D analytical solution was derived.

However, one of the key obstacles to applying these approaches in the field of hydrology is the degradation of estimation error in ML models. The application of integrative MLs (a.k.a. hybrid MLs)—by embedding meta-heuristic algorithms (MHAs) with the base learner-would increase the accuracy of simple MLs. This review analyzes the cons and pros of the last decade's publications on the application of evolutionary-embedded ML models in three distinguished realms of hydrological systems, including (i) modeling of surface hydrology (river flow, river water quality, and sediment transport), (ii) hydrometeorology (drought modeling, precipitation, evaporation, and evapotranspiration), and (iii) groundwater hydrology. The overall conclusion of this study reveals that the use of evolutionary MHAs has the ability to improve the accuracy of normal MLs by up to 31.27% on average. Neural networks, neuro-fuzzy inference systems, and support vector machines are the most commonly employed base learners that have been fine-tuned using evolutionary MHAs. It should be highlighted that one of the main disadvantages of using MHAs is their high computing cost in comparison to typical optimization techniques. Among the several MHAs investigated, the genetic algorithm (GA) is the most widely utilized evolutionary algorithm for tuning and optimizing ML models. Nonetheless, particle swarm optimization, which is a swarm-based algorithm, produced significantly more accurate findings than the GA and is recommended as a preliminary proposal for hydrological application."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","60c343479543c7233654429d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c343479543c7233654429d","5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","658041114097073e4d217f5a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477190","mniswId":"1658","title":"ARCHIVES OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING","issn":"1134-3060","eissn":"1886-1784","documentHash":"f55bd9e5-50cb-4b68-892e-05ce8ef738e9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658041114097073e4d217f57","year":"2023","documentHash":"8173522d-7cbb-4340-88a6-2ccfb13a4592"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059153307"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"SULISZ","uuid":"EBCF1A5E7B3B8E6BEF61B514E57C14FDF54F4F6360CCA403B68C48AF0ECE38756687859448333EAF147A615DB29B28B8FF916144FC58914E334F3AEBE45FFD66","documentHash":"37ccd788-9e8d-411a-92c4-797d82e1aa80"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4b3","name":"ANETA","lastName":"ZDOLSKA","uuid":"B7A98D602ACFABF243E74977711073D2BE43798EF2550365561535D35FFDCA0244C5FEA5D6BC6DA3C58115019A1F1E5E4A3A208CB0217F7FBF000C9F9498A4AC","orcidId":"0000-0001-8887-6960","documentHash":"ae1186b3-8f76-4d06-8eb5-1e6edc72dcb3"}],"objectId":"65a116164097071121a4b85f","doi":"10.24423/aom.4144","publicUri":"https://am.ippt.pan.pl/am/article/view/v75p213","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A side-hinged paddle wavemaker","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Theoretical investigations were conducted to study the generation of transient nonlinear water waves by a novel side-hinged paddle wavemaker. A 3D nonlinear solution was derived in a semi-analytical form by applying eigenfunction expansions and FFT. The solution was applied to study the features of nonlinear\nwaves generated by a side-hinged paddle wavemaker. The results show that nonlinear terms in the free-surface boundary conditions and in the kinematic wavemaker\nboundary condition imply the modification of wave profiles so that wave troughs\nare flattered and crests are getting steeper and interaction effects between waves\nin a wave train increase. Moreover, these terms imply the modification of a wave\nspectrum. A train of originally very narrow-banded waves changes its one-peak spectrum to a multi-peak one. Theoretical results are in a fairly good agreement with\nexperimental data.

The main focus was on the effect of the wave-induced vertical forces on the global response of the structure. The physical model of the deck was installed above a still water level in front of a vertical barrier. The model was supported by a system of strings and springs. The mechanical system had one degree of freedom corresponding to a small rotational displacement around rear deck edge. Among other physical parameters, the impact pressure generated under the structure due to wave impact was measured. The high sampling frequency of the data acquisition system allowed to capture momentary slamming pressure. The systems of accelerometers and displacement gauges were installed to measure induced vibrations. Thorough analysis of the influence of wave parameters and the deck clearance on the structure response was performed based on the measurements. The rapid slamming force increase, recorded at the moment of impact is not revealed in the dynamic response of the plate."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","5e7092d3878c28a04739d77c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"204","pagesFromTo":"110732","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d77c","5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478de0","mniswId":"14093","title":"MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING","issn":"0888-3270","documentHash":"5e14b9dd-8dae-4dbf-9cb2-083d02d80257"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65954f7640970740be8f299d","year":"2023","volume":"204","documentHash":"10d0a299-36f0-4319-8d33-320f6762456a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Water wavesImpactWave flumeLaboratory study"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059255366"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"SULISZ","uuid":"EBCF1A5E7B3B8E6BEF61B514E57C14FDF54F4F6360CCA403B68C48AF0ECE38756687859448333EAF147A615DB29B28B8FF916144FC58914E334F3AEBE45FFD66","documentHash":"37ccd788-9e8d-411a-92c4-797d82e1aa80"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d784","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"PAPROTA","uuid":"37FFEE0C3130F428F8DBF348A689F9A56C9257982FB11B22E54BDC8A0D58860A171A0CA6B164734CC7A740565824912193BE6B680B23E8141EE5744016F99332","orcidId":"0000-0001-6642-2589","documentHash":"7de06888-ef52-4b28-ba0d-cef2984bfb7b"}],"objectId":"65a112b94097071121a41a38","doi":"10.5194/esd-14-1261-2023","publicUri":"https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/14/1261/2023/esd-14-1261-2023.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The effect of strong nonlinearity on  wave-induced vertical mixing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A semi-analytical solution to an advection–diffusion equation is coupled with a nonlinear wavemaker model to investigate the effect of strong nonlinearity on wave-induced mixing.

Two locations were investigated: one situated on the Wolin island, and the second near the town of Ustka. The cliffs will be suffering enhanced erosion for a number of reasons. First, the adopted sea level rise of 0.7 m results in a direct attack on cliff foot, leading to enhanced erosion with rates being roughly twice as high as that occurring without the rise. A high rate of erosion can persist because the cliff cannot reconfigure itself by moving landward and will permanently remain exposed to wave attack even under milder regimes. Second, the wave climates in the Baltic Sea release most energy in close shoreline proximity. Third, longer storm event durations can lead to ‘erosion saturation’, but this result requires further investigations, which will include alongshore effects induced by local bathymetry and longshore currents, ignored in 1-D simulations. Finally, the granulometry was found less important; finer grains offer less resistance to depletion, leading to greater erosion. The results demonstrate the need for vast follow-up research: (1) detailed mapping of the bathymetry near cliffs in order to properly reproduce alongshore redistribution of sediment during storms and achieve better estimates of cliff erosion, (2) detailed mapping of cliff lithology in order to properly reproduce their sediment composition and thus achieve better estimates of built-in susceptibility to erosion, (3) preparation of 2-D modeling suites for improved assessment of the rates of erosion of cliffs subjected to sea level rise."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae","5e7092d3878c28a04739d788"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d788","5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c5ee9c4097077130326026","year":"2024","documentHash":"b4974e0a-540a-4aab-a369-1431857015e1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Baltic SeaSea level riseSoft cliffsMixed sedimentsExtreme events"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059357267"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c343479543c7233654429d","name":"AMIN","lastName":"MAHDAVI-MEYMAND","uuid":"167AFD4914270F58E0F8950DDFB3E553813B0B52C5B0649475CB678B544BCB067469BCB66A5ACF3CC13394D75AC51BE56D077BEDED4FF06E5E14B36F17DF8F7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9125-5214","documentHash":"b3a7f947-108f-4df4-83ce-230ded372266"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d78e","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"SULISZ","uuid":"EBCF1A5E7B3B8E6BEF61B514E57C14FDF54F4F6360CCA403B68C48AF0ECE38756687859448333EAF147A615DB29B28B8FF916144FC58914E334F3AEBE45FFD66","documentHash":"37ccd788-9e8d-411a-92c4-797d82e1aa80"}],"objectId":"65ba40ba4097075661c71566","doi":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2023.115915","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0029801823022990?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Development of clustered machine learning technique for the modeling of scour profile induced by propeller jets","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study novel clustered machine learning (CML) models were developed by applying different base learners including multi linear regression (MLR), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), classification and regression trees (CART), least-squares boosting (LSBoost), and random forest (RF) to predict scour profile induced by the jet of a propeller.

The control system of the nonlinear autonomous object employed two controllers: a linear matrix inequality controller and an overriding trajectory controller. We assess the impact of nonlinearities in the measured waves. It is shown that the maximum entropy probability distribution conforms more closely to the empirical frequency histogram than the Gaussian distribution. The wave height probability distributions diverge from Rayleigh distributions, indicating slight nonlinear effects. These results enhance the mathematical model of Silm Lake’s wave dynamics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393760"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65c0c07f409707280ba083cb","5e70924f878c28a047393760"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547971b","mniswId":"18433","title":"Ships and Offshore Structures","issn":"1744-5302","eissn":"1754-212X","documentHash":"a4ec0757-f65b-4f02-b27f-a2dc12b8e261"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c0c07f409707280ba083ca","year":"2024","documentHash":"1e0e9454-9c22-4739-b292-c8db99e14db5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Multivariable controllake wave measurementGaussianRayleigh"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059379962"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00da","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kolerski","documentHash":"519c2e6f-190d-4074-857b-5bf1d5ba9a4c"},{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d9","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Biegowski","documentHash":"0a5221a3-31ec-4953-9a6a-74c0a087c127"},{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Łoboda","documentHash":"96a47e92-a457-4859-93b1-d49850d8e9d4"},{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d6","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Cuban","documentHash":"8771f38b-2b07-4ae5-9e94-30ceaf86e445"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abd8e","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Przyborowski","uuid":"2754E03EAD5086898936AFDB02E83F74F31AA479A3A647F230576A77C356868291C406E4B4F1977EFC59E5DA0B0FD46185D3ED89EFF54B8037D1A0522F3DF534","orcidId":"0000-0003-0900-1387","documentHash":"64d0a52f-ee6e-4c33-8fa6-d63704db387b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d787","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Robakiewicz","uuid":"6DE434FFEDD594D9BAE71BBB1AFAECC7D88A155B2D011DED06C94F025FE13DDCC2C419296BF743BFF2218CBE56346165A4584860B38D25E8C50D634FC8B1F9E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-9936-3527","documentHash":"1a48960e-f68c-454e-93ab-73bee94e1a3a"}],"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d4","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171184","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969724013238?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The effect of groyne field on trapping macroplastic.

However, the physical processes of macroplastic transport and deposition in rivers are poorly understood, which makes the decisions of where to locate macroplastic trapping infrastructure difficult. In this research, we conducted a series of experiments in a laboratory channel, exploring the impact of groynes and flexible artificial vegetation on the floating macroplastic litter. The goal was to investigate the litter paths with different obstruction arrangements, which was done by implementing a particle tracking technique on video recordings from each experimental run. We found that increasing discharge correlated with the number of plastic litter floating into the recirculation zone within the groyne fields, especially if the upstream groyne had an extended length. This produced a strong mixing interface between the main flow and the groyne field, while a vegetation patch added in the same groyne field changed the paths of plastic litter by deflecting the flow. We noticed that during a moderate discharge rate, the litter pieces flowing into the groyne field with the vegetation circulated there for the longest period, and some of them got entangled between floating stems when discharge was at its lowest. This phenomenon points to the conclusion that low flow velocity paired with the presence of vegetation can be a primer for plastic deposition and consequently, its degradation. The insights from the experiment allowed us to recommend a place downstream of an extended groyne as the desirable (efficient) area for installing a plastic trapping infrastructure or conducting plastic cleaning actions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abd8e","65df3a4e4097070d575e00d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d787"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"921","pagesFromTo":"171184","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709386878c28a0473abd8e","65df3a4e4097070d575e00d6","65df3a4e4097070d575e00d7","5e7092d3878c28a04739d787","65df3a4e4097070d575e00d9","65df3a4e4097070d575e00da"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0048-9697","documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65df3a4e4097070d575e00d5","year":"2024","volume":"921","documentHash":"df33228c-4350-4adb-8a21-421d621b4930"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059411655"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a0878c28a0473c088e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szarafin","uuid":"3B0AB1CDA69731002238F024BC196C4449EE7637073ED8052B8F7453B88A2E8C421C43F35880E961B61722E3030A2330F8BDA1C0DFDA2A19F1CB69F30F30FB05","orcidId":"0000-0003-1851-2840","documentHash":"0c289d71-b445-4b6f-9bc9-85711cc20a7d"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c0252","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Uścinowicz","uuid":"FC558BB20EB758D67D1341F2B7E19865E5B36A29AB9D31BE01FB1A3316ED4313F9ADFE54FAA4690D201B6133E9B9B68BDF7D263A96B6D636B7787420A88AAFDC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5185-4979","documentHash":"c327e9b3-939d-4c7e-ba8a-e916dac5a883"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2e09","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Maszloch","uuid":"B57BD2B6B463566328A8220D6AE9C1AF05D71662CF7C7443E400E7E9C9485C5ECB2ADE0DDA9CEB502BBD06A70553792AE680BFC3413BDB0983206253AF8DCD99","documentHash":"b1946c2c-e6e9-4f13-b50a-cc745c79d556"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46","name":"SZYMON","lastName":"UŚCINOWICZ","uuid":"72D019B1BBAE0747F27EB246107240C51E125CBC39331DB8A49826A2EE3AB71A2A192643FC2295242B81CA26A995D28C4DCC85FE8E25794D4B8DC45A7FDB4815","orcidId":"0000-0001-6332-8546","documentHash":"fc0409a9-a003-46a0-87ef-963801a347df"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399428","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Wirkus","uuid":"78CC77C6BFB5ADF62AAB8780F4A3A8C66A6F98C1FC73DDACC190D8AC5C41046C4DD6999BA8663C74F312638284728896B41943D78D87D862EBE442C7BAA6827D","documentHash":"54b4b2cd-6b91-4ed5-905e-38f500177240"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65d32dbc4097072e0d1ccd4d","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2023.12.002","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S007832342300091X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Rapid coastal erosion, its dynamics and cause – an erosional hot spot on the southern Baltic Sea coast","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Coastal erosion is one of the major problems in coastal management. To adapt to it, and prevent it where possible and needed, it is important to recognize the temporal and spatial scale of the phenomenon as well as its causes. This paper describes the rapid erosion rate along an approximately 2.25 km stretch of the southern Baltic coast. The erosion occurs within a nature reserve, which is not subject to direct anthropogenic impact. Historical maps and modern remote sensing were used to trace changes in the shoreline position from 1875 to the present, and detailed DTMs derived from airborne LiDAR were used to trace elevation changes of the beach and dunes over the past years. The weighted maximum annual erosion rate since 1875 averages 2.3 m. An increase in this annual erosion rate has been observed since the turn of the millennium. The maximum average erosion rate from 2001 to 2005 was 15 m/year. The erosion has caused serious changes in elevation within the inland part of the coastal zone, manifested by a reduction in the width of the beach and a decrease in the height of the beach and dunes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2e09","5e70929e878c28a047399428","5e709499878c28a0473c0252","5e7094a0878c28a0473c088e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"250-266","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709499878c28a0473c0252","5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46","5e7094a0878c28a0473c088e","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2e09","5e70929e878c28a047399428"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6465f9984097074d0a917f5b","year":"2023","documentHash":"1e3dd8cf-23ab-401f-afc5-28874f718b6c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nontidal Sea ice Barrier coast Storminess"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059431521"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a0878c28a0473c088e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szarafin","uuid":"3B0AB1CDA69731002238F024BC196C4449EE7637073ED8052B8F7453B88A2E8C421C43F35880E961B61722E3030A2330F8BDA1C0DFDA2A19F1CB69F30F30FB05","orcidId":"0000-0003-1851-2840","documentHash":"0c289d71-b445-4b6f-9bc9-85711cc20a7d"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c0545","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Pączek","uuid":"B51F567346D3A0E9675B8E0FCF3818998236349540CAA971C79844CB727B3B00425A9EA140BDA20B001F8F730C6A27798F40DF5BCA9B1400A9C88F2E398FE2A4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1949-1236","documentHash":"9dc2612d-23f6-470e-b6b8-db69a6c5d723"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c0252","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Uścinowicz","uuid":"FC558BB20EB758D67D1341F2B7E19865E5B36A29AB9D31BE01FB1A3316ED4313F9ADFE54FAA4690D201B6133E9B9B68BDF7D263A96B6D636B7787420A88AAFDC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5185-4979","documentHash":"c327e9b3-939d-4c7e-ba8a-e916dac5a883"},{"objectId":"5e709385878c28a0473abcc0","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Jegliński","uuid":"6789ECF0DC22EF7920BA0483C7E01035147D0A5798E3F4EBB8D6BBDC9398B376B92453CB401FE5FDF2C98B17F932A79252C4FC9C731BD6C0F20CEB3EB93DB744","orcidId":"0000-0002-4684-6736","documentHash":"fd812d4e-eef3-4f31-b26c-3a4b1bd1257b"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46","name":"SZYMON","lastName":"UŚCINOWICZ","uuid":"72D019B1BBAE0747F27EB246107240C51E125CBC39331DB8A49826A2EE3AB71A2A192643FC2295242B81CA26A995D28C4DCC85FE8E25794D4B8DC45A7FDB4815","orcidId":"0000-0001-6332-8546","documentHash":"fc0409a9-a003-46a0-87ef-963801a347df"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d792","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Szmytkiewicz","uuid":"E596E2CA38F68576509EA5B24470A03381CEBE676ABA9CBCE3F46C53A18619EDBCB8A3A02FA49C179BD65CE2CBCAC85FEE795A5FEE166EDDAC62E1145FC48A51","documentHash":"7bf58447-d1b0-42f0-a5ed-74db564a23ab"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6620de744097076323666ca0","doi":"10.7306/gq.1737","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.7306/gq.1737","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"New insights into coastal processes in the southern Baltic Sea:  relevance to modelling and future scenarios","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Un der stand ing  the  re la tion ships  be tween  shore line  changes  and  morpho-geo log i cal  fea tures  of  the  sea bed  and  hy dro dy -nam ics is im por tant for pre dict ing coastal dy nam ics.

This paper presents an advanced calculation procedure for estimating flushing flows in channels. This procedure is based on innovative predictive models developed for non-cohesive and granulometrically heterogeneous sediment transport with additional cohesive fraction content to estimate the magnitude of increased flow necessary to ensure self-cleansing of channels.

The horizontal velocities of plastic debris are analyzed over the rippled bottom for different wave conditions and plastic elements with different properties. Laboratory investigations determined the characteristic transport patterns of wave-induced plastic debris with a density of \n moving along the rippled bottom. In the first, swing-type motion, the grains move only in the ripple trough with velocities lower than 0.10 m/s. For sliding-type movement, the grains move along the entire rippled surface with velocities in the range of 0.10–0.13 m/s. For higher velocities in the range of 0.15–0.20 m/s, a saltation-type motion becomes dominant. The results show that plastic grains may move up to 2–3 cm above the ripple crest depending on hydrodynamic conditions. The analysis shows that for velocity-skewed flows, sliding-type motion and onshore transport dominate. For acceleration-skewed flows, saltation-type motion and offshore transport dominate, which is attributed to higher boundary layer thickness and phase lag effects. The analysis of the relationship between the particle Reynolds number and the thickness of the turbulent boundary layer reveals that for values of \n and a boundary layer thickness\n mm saltation-type motion becomes dominant.

The PNN models predict Hs with high accuracy. The results predicted by PNN, with SRMSE of 0.256 and R2 of 0.873, are more accurate than the corresponding results obtained by the deep neural network (DNN) model, which show that PNNs with their far simpler structures and lower number of parameters are attractive alternatives for complex and time-consuming DNN models.

The results also show that the applied state-of-the-art algorithms including MLR, SNN, DNN, ANFIS, and SVR models predict non-physical negative values of Hs. The PNNs developed in this study predict Hs with positive values. Moreover, the analysis shows that the scatter of the results obtained by the derived nonlinear models is less pronounced than the scatter of corresponding results obtained by other methods.

Therefore, a suitable design of the associated wind turbine is required to enhance the performance, longevity, and cost efficiency. Thus, in this work, we consider multiple horizontal porous rings attached to a bottom-mounted impermeable cylinder that resembles a wind turbine and study the wave diffraction problem. The wave action on the cylinder is studied by using linear water wave theory and solved by using the matched eigenfunction expansion method in the cylindrical coordinate system. The fluid domain is divided into multiple subregions with different vertical eigenfunctions in the respective regions. The eigenvalues obtained in the porous regions are complex numbers which satisfy the complicated dissipative-dispersion relation. The solution to this relation corresponds to locating the wavenumbers for which a non-trivial solution exists for a homogeneous system of equations, the order of which depends on the number of porous rings considered in the problem. For an incoming wave, the diffraction problem is then solved by using these eigenvalues and their associated eigenfunctions. The wave forces acting on the impermeable cylinder and the porous rings are evaluated by integrating the pressure difference. Finally, after validation of the considered model, numerical results are presented to observe the effect of the porosity, radii and draft of the rings and also of the water depth on different hydrodynamic coefficients. For numerical computation, three rings are considered. The key finding of this analysis is that a suitable choice of porosity distribution pattern to reduce the wave impact mainly depends on the radii of the porous rings and also of the impermeable cylinder.

The measurements of SSD are susceptible to the failure of instruments and equipment, data losses, and other unpredictable events. In this study, we developed an innovative nonlinear regression trees (NRT) technique to retrieve the missing data of SSD. The model was used on the record of SDD for the ADCPs deployed in the Gdansk Gulf along the Vistula Lagoon. The NRT suggests using a nonlinear machine learning algorithm instead of linear regression at the end nodes of a tree. Two different NRT models were developed. One of them is based on the support vector regression (SVR) and the other on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The performance of both models was validated by comparing their results with the state-of-the-art algorithms. The models were trained using four input parameters, including the pressure and SDD of two other ADCPs, which recorded complete time series data. The analysis shows that NRT methods, with an average RMSE of 0.019 m, provide about 71.13% more accurate prediction than random forest (RF). Among all models, the NRT-SVR, with the lowest RMSE of 0.009 m and MAE of 0.002 m, and the highest R2 of 0.997, NSE of 0.997, and IA of 0.999, is ranked as the most accurate model.

Given the impending investments in offshore infrastructure within the Baltic Sea, it becomes imperative to devise artificial intelligence strategies that can accurately predict wave parameters under the unique conditions of a shallow, tideless sea. This study presents an extensive evaluation of established machine learning techniques tailored to site specific wave spectra. We explore the effectiveness of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the short-term prediction of SWH. Rigorous optimization of neural network\nhyperparameters is applied to improve forecast accuracy, with models validated on real-world datasets, proving their ability to predict SWH accurately across various forecast horizons. In addition, the performance of ANNs models is compared to optimized traditional forecasting methods, noting significant improvements in both accuracy and reliability. The results underscore the critical role of careful optimization in achieving precise short-term forecasts at targeted locations. They also suggest that even relatively simple models, when finetuned,\ncan surpass the performance of more complex approaches commonly found in the literature. Building upon the foundational advancements in ANNs from the early 2000s, this research adopts a direct forecasting\nmethodology utilizing data from marine observational platforms. Significantly, the networks are trained and validated with data directly obtained from a measurement buoy positioned in a deep water zone, devoid of seabed wave interactions. This aspect is particularly crucial for the strategic placement of future floating offshore farms, where these algorithms will be directly applied for short-term SWH predictions. Our findings underscore the importance of selecting optimal methods to ensure the utmost accuracy of short-term forecasts at targeted locations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af75e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393762"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"315","pagesFromTo":"1-17","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677e6917fdbe831a3837919e","5e7093b5878c28a0473af75e","5e70924f878c28a047393762"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c2","mniswId":"15344","title":"Ocean Engineering","issn":"0029-8018","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1769a8a1-e28e-487a-8470-bf6196654271"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["LSTM","ocean renewable energy","neural networks","offshore floating structures","digital twin","time-series forecasting","artificial intelligence"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060463108"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6800c7fafdbe830a5fbf2ccc","name":"Wei","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"8bf9a444-9241-40ac-961e-c27dde6a3c12"},{"objectId":"6800c7fafdbe830a5fbf2ccb","name":"Dian‐qing","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"4e0f9afa-d250-4070-a90e-c4f1abd01aab"},{"objectId":"6800c7fafdbe830a5fbf2cca","name":"Xuan","lastName":"Kang","documentHash":"c2034ba5-4edd-4076-b9fd-79d50ac5481e"},{"objectId":"6800c7fafdbe830a5fbf2cc9","name":"Shun","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"bdc3b925-9726-4155-a24a-1bedd6641c12"},{"objectId":"6800c7fafdbe830a5fbf2cc8","name":"Hong‐jie","lastName":"Fang","documentHash":"d0ccc0f6-bd2e-41ef-9cba-622f2cf10f40"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac104","name":"BARBARA","lastName":"ŚWITAŁA","uuid":"7230C976E90C9882B99814612800B866533BD4049D96E6A6AEAD3417319AE58F82117F541677470D23CE5ECAC403C480BE982851795A5D4D6AF480BF0A6E2DA6","orcidId":"0000-0001-8548-4689","documentHash":"29125e29-3495-4ca6-ada3-71176e486de4"}],"objectId":"6800c7fafdbe830a5fbf2cc6","doi":"10.1002/nag.3984","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/nag.3984","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"SPH Implementation of a Dynamic Hypoplastic Model for Seismic Large Deformation Analysis in Slopes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Accurate modeling of soil behavior under seismic conditions is critical for understanding and mitigating earthquake‐induced hazards.

The limits of Froude similarity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We apply Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate mass detachments in an overtopped and breached earth dam. SPH is able to model free surface flows at prototype and laboratory model scales. The flow over the overtopped dam is gravity-driven. Froude similarity is thus employed to scale results from models to prototypes, even if there are fluid-wall interactions. In particular, the processes that govern the interaction between a detached solid from the dam body and the breach flow may not obey Froude similarity. In this paper, we discuss how the geometric scale conditions the effects of mass detachments on the flow field of a breached dam and how SPH simulation tools express these scaling issues. The Navier–Stokes equations for weakly compressible and Newtonian fluids in isothermal flows were used for the water flow. Flow-dam interaction was resolved with dynamic boundary conditions. All simulations were conducted with DualSPHysics, employing the Weakly Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) scheme. The detached soil mass was modelled as a rigid block. The interaction between the detached block and the fluid flow through the breach was attained by coupling DualSPHysics with the non-smooth multi-body dynamics model (Chrono-Engine). The surface velocity field, determined with Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) during the mass detachment, was used to assess the quality of the SPH solution. The numerical and the observed velocity fields show a reasonable agreement in the time-lapse that encompasses the detachment of the block. However, there are differences in the curvature of streamlines as the flow approaches the breach, suggesting a closer look at the hypotheis of the SPH simulation tool. The impact of the falling block on the flow field varies significantly with the size of the modelled dam. The block is not entirely transported out of the breach in the reduced model. This configures a breakdown of Froude similarity in the sense that hydrodynamic actions on the model are disproportionately smaller in the model relative to the prototype. While there may be physical reasons at play, we note that ensuring mass conservation in the model led to a smaller initial resolution that may have affected how forces are transmitted between the SPH and Chrono simulation tools."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["64cc62a840e3ff494b57015c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"202","pagesFromTo":"104987","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68271087fdbe834e1a92b421","68271087fdbe834e1a92b422","64cc62a840e3ff494b57015c","68271087fdbe834e1a92b424","68271087fdbe834e1a92b425","68271087fdbe834e1a92b426"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476ee5","mniswId":"549","title":"ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES","issn":"0309-1708","eissn":"1872-9657","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8ec207ad-b424-4eec-a27e-12d5382ac8c4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68271087fdbe834e1a92b420","year":"2025","volume":"202","documentHash":"e10bb023-6962-43c3-acde-e92f6c7c05d5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Earth damsMass detachmentsFree surface flowSPHFroude similarity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747433579641"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61a98f3975234066bac87178","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sobczak","documentHash":"6af68ae3-4d38-4bae-af01-0d2c77189d0b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4a8","name":"JAROSŁAW","lastName":"BIEGOWSKI","uuid":"24A63DF41E48313458587609AABC98FB26EDD33F70512028A18AEC8FD41FBC390874260B44A26540DA3095D4FD9600D09FB5B659D598FA2266A6DFA4FF66B983","orcidId":"0000-0002-7480-041X","documentHash":"af3b921b-c08b-4c2d-9787-a39a392c9cc0"},{"objectId":"5e709219878c28a04738feee","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"08FC39A8F07B75EAD851B6981AAABEF5987B1A32C0A33723724AEE7B5BDE82C217A8E923213B5BB0EE9C1DD8028A3A07AB2A5583B2365BD7EC547A9040709301","orcidId":"0000-0003-4557-2195","documentHash":"cd4cf7f5-1a0b-44ef-9104-fecb85d66c67"}],"objectId":"61d402d02467f0627df13d5f","doi":"10.1061/(asce)hy.1943-7900.0001957","publicUri":"http://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/%28ASCE%29HY.1943-7900.0001957","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Modeling of Sediment Transport with a Mobile Mixed-Sand Bed in Wave Motion","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A multilayer model is proposed to calculate time-dependent sediment velocity and concentration profiles with the resulting sediment transport.

This paper describes the morpho-geological structure of the barriers and its substrate along a 90-km section of the middle part of the Polish southern Baltic coast. The main goal of the study is a better insight into the evolution of the barriers in case of sand scarcity and relations to sea level changes. The study area was examined by analysis of the published and historical data from 120 borehole profiles supplemented by new 18 core drillings. In addition to lithological and biostratigraphical data, a large set of radiocarbon ages was acquired and analysed. The barriers during its whole middle and late Holocene history were retrogradational despite of varied geological and morphological features of its substrate. The average rate of barrier's retreat has shown considerable variation in a close relation to the rates of sea-level rise. During the period 8500-7500 yr b2k when the sea level rose by 6–5 mm/yr, the coast retreated ca. 4.6–3.5 m/yr. Between 7500 and 6000 yr b2k, the sea-level rise slowed down to ca. 1.7 mm/yr and the rate of coastline retreat fell to ca. 1.0 m/yr. During the last 6000 years, coastal retreat slowed down to ca. 0.3 m/yr as the average sea level rise was ca. 0.5 mm/yr. The permanent retrogradational history of the barrier coast, even in the case of sand availability in the barrier's substrate, is explained by the existence of a divergence zone of longshore currents and a related source zone for the alongshore sandy streams. The divergence zone is present within the study area not only today, but it has existed most probably also at least since the beginning of the late Holocene. As a result, the erosional trend (sand scarcity) dominates here, which contributes to the presence of retrogradational barriers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"324","pagesFromTo":"108459","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a119af4097071121a56d3d","5e70934a878c28a0473a6a46"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454794a0","mniswId":"16947","title":"QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS","issn":"0277-3791","eissn":"0277-3791","documentHash":"0bf31882-aca7-4b59-9c93-dd68715dcab6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6595485640970740be8e721d","year":"2024","volume":"324","documentHash":"aa0fee03-5efd-4e7b-a564-7f400635b9d7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654912895"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047393052","name":"ROMUALD","lastName":"SZYMKIEWICZ","uuid":"C3BC0B3EC2ABD359B3EF16014EE1F74CB9143C58957B7AE9BE23E60D82B19802BB62CF1907A71A9C90FF1E4C6776E589C68D3CDDEDB333D81BF133851F68127E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6232-9790","documentHash":"809c63af-3c23-4236-8975-d9fb175a7d03"}],"objectId":"66559cda40970762c87aada9","doi":"10.1061/jhend8.hyeng-13836","publicUri":"https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/JHEND8.HYENG-13836","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Impact of Interpolation on Numerical Properties of the Method of Characteristics Used for Solution of the Transient Pipe Flow Equations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a comparison of numerical properties of the fixed-grid method of characteristics resulting from space and time linear interpolation used for the solution of transient flow in pipe equations.

The paper presents a method based on spatial and spectral analysis of changes in the coastline position based on data obtained from aerial photographs interpretation and Fourier analysis, on the example of the Hel Peninsula. The Hel Peninsula is one of the most interesting accumulation forms of the Polish Baltic coast, where dynamic changes of the seashore cause the occurrence of time-varying sections of accumulation-abrasion of the coastline. For the purpose of detecting the coastline changes, historical aerial photographs from the years 1947, 1957, 1963, 1991 were used. It was assumed that the over-40-year research period, which includes the obtained series of aerial photographs, would allow for a sufficient study of the long-term shoreline changes, which allow for distinguishing the length of characteristic coastline undulations. The quasi-wave signal of the shoreline changes obtained from the aerial photographs interpretation, after using Fourier analysis, enabled an effective and precise identification of the coastline undulation. The spatial analyses, showed that the Hel Peninsula is clearly divided into a part subjected to accumulation processes and an abraded one. Furthermore, the dynamics of coastline changes was determined, showing that the abrasive processes were intensifying. Moreover, spectral Fourier analysis allowed for the precise identification of coastline undulations with dominant lengths. The obtained results of spatial and spectral analysis indicate that abrasive-accumulation sections with a length of about 0.3–4.5 km dominate on the Hel Peninsula shoreline."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d78c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"3","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d78c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ed5bd6fdbe83567c6f3720","year":"2024","volume":"66","number":"3","documentHash":"4eae9340-ab0f-4666-9675-5676997ea108"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aerial photography, Fourier analysis, Hel Peninsula, Coastline changes, Spatial analysis, Spectral analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655018877"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"670f93cbfdbe8317edd1284b","name":"Sílvia","lastName":"Amaral","documentHash":"9b0c7dfa-c936-4868-8204-5c93d8856272"},{"objectId":"670f93cbfdbe8317edd1284a","name":"Michele","lastName":"Larcher","documentHash":"cde46dba-48a0-45bb-a547-d7dd111589b6"},{"objectId":"670f93cbfdbe8317edd12848","name":"Rui M.

We ensemble-average velocities, determined with Particle Tracking Velocimetry, and its fluctuations, to compute mean flow and granular temperature fields. Full chute-wide jamming is triggered by the formation of stable arch-like clogging structures in front of the slits. The statistical distribution of the clogging instant is not heavy-tailed, which indicates that clogging occurs only when the flow through the slits is liquid-like. An upstream-progressing jamming wave eventually forms, similar to that observed in fully obstructed chutes. There is no triple point anywhere, since the flow cools down to a granular liquid before jamming. We identified three main stages of jamming wave propagation. The initial buildup is characterized by high values of the upstream Froude number, slow progression, and transformation of kinetic into potential energy. This occurs with significant granular head losses, as particles attempt to flow over the jam. In the second stage, accretion becomes dominant, characterized by smaller head losses and, consequently, higher values of the jamming wave celerity. In the third stage, the jamming wave propagates against a cooler but faster flow that pushes against the jam, slightly increasing the wave strength. Accretion is the main mechanism of jammed mass increase, justifying a further increase of wave acceleration. The macroscopic aspects of the jamming wave dynamics can be described, as a first approximation, by shallow-water theory."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["64cc62a840e3ff494b57015c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"60","issue":"10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["670f93cbfdbe8317edd12847","670f93cbfdbe8317edd12848","64cc62a840e3ff494b57015c","670f93cbfdbe8317edd1284a","670f93cbfdbe8317edd1284b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479aa5","mniswId":"20240","title":"WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH","issn":"0043-1397","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"d6b9b269-5c15-4628-8b96-60acc64ee7d0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"670f93cbfdbe8317edd12846","year":"2024","volume":"60","number":"10","documentHash":"32ed20eb-7be7-483e-a616-629a187afd10"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655022797"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac106","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"SMYCZYŃSKI","uuid":"8950DF2F67E2FFCD73FADE225A866AD5F4D577B9F0BBF9885E685AA97248CCCFC4B95E0462527E92F2FE8C6D448E0F9BFD93E7D7E40EE98627D7DE5BE714F956","orcidId":"0000-0002-1024-4848","documentHash":"0fc2fae0-7899-4780-92b6-da5349bfbcfb"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d77c","name":"DAWID","lastName":"MAJEWSKI","uuid":"3D52AE8EB134C125C2DA5CEDA4DAA13EBCB106B6311B2C8A3FD5F090880691CB6D7D2852E7262C7BE6A8B5033509A99FCCF03E00E1997514633E8097F825F81E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7351-4289","documentHash":"025df5cf-2779-419d-8a2c-a905cdfd71ef"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d76a","name":"MAREK","lastName":"KULCZYKOWSKI","uuid":"BA0F4DD4018E2490110AB19B6F8C1A6D3CA6808F3EF93EE8C37555821BCFC6B436F2A2823B8EB1ADEC5014D8D52930950105064EEBEC5505D956BC51DB3B216B","documentHash":"817fe584-ca6b-45b3-a8c0-9a4e2c208c8d"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4bc","name":"KRYSTYNA","lastName":"KAZIMIEROWICZ-FRANKOWSKA","uuid":"A30427D82C2895EB2BA3552D42A391443523DB2256D92AF2CFADAB6B2F936984396B29236F8110BD29D05A402FD4397AE114204EEB20D8858904FC2D6BFEBC1F","documentHash":"3acf3d89-be0c-402f-b36f-e215072e136c"}],"objectId":"6785133ffdbe833b3183b5ea","doi":"10.1061/jwped5.wweng-2190","publicUri":"https://ascelibrary.org/doi/pdf/10.1061/JWPED5.WWENG-2190","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Liquefaction of Seabeds under Progressive Waves Excitation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the results of an experimental study on seabed liquefaction under progressive waves. To analyze the potential of the soil to liquefy, the position of the critical state line (CSL) was determined in a series of monotonic triaxial shear tests that were carried out on soil samples, which were characterized by different initial states that correspond to contractive and dilative behavior. Based on these results, the main experiments in the wave flume were designed. They were performed to investigate the effect of wave height and wave period on the possibility of soil liquefaction. Pore water pressures were measured at different depths of the subsoil. The correlation between the wave parameters and the susceptibility of the soil subgrade to liquefaction was analyzed. A three-dimensional (3D) analysis of the effect of the wave height and period on the variation in the maximum excess pore pressure and the sequences in the liquefaction process was performed. The experimental results show that the level of the maximum excess pore pressure and sequence of the liquefaction process are strongly affected by the wave height and period."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac106","5e7092d3878c28a04739d77c","5e7092d3878c28a04739d76a","5e7092c4878c28a04739c4bc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"151","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c4bc","5e7092d3878c28a04739d76a","5e709388878c28a0473ac106","5e7092d3878c28a04739d77c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bf4","mniswId":"13192","title":"Journal of Waterway, Port, Coastal and Ocean Engineering","issn":"0733-950X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c44c39cd-8d14-4492-948e-6d82ab07e765"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6785133ffdbe833b3183b5eb","year":"2025","volume":"151","number":"2","documentHash":"82b8655d-b548-4c4c-ae49-55fa7aa4800f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655038432"}]
