We examined the effects of post-exercise sauna bathing on hematological adaptations and exercise capacity in healthy men. Methods: Thirteen physical education students participated in randomized cross-over study: two, 4-week interventions, with 10-week washout. The interventions involved 3 times per week 60-min stationary cycling either with 30-min of post-exercise sauna bathing (89 ± 3°C, 10 ± 2% RH) or without; no fluid was ingested during both exercise and sauna sessions. Before and after both interventions, participants were tested for total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass), intravascular volumes, erythropoietin, ferritin, red blood cell parameters with reticulocyte fractions, along with maximal/peak and submaximal variables in a graded exercise test (GXT). Results: Regardless of intervention type, tHb-mass increased (p = .014) whereas ferritin concentration decreased (p = .027); however, changes in tHb-mass were within the range of typical error (<1.8%). Absolute and relative values of maximal power and power at gas exchange threshold, as well as peak oxygen uptake (all p < .010), also increased irrespective of intervention type. Conclusions: The use of post-exercise sauna bathing with fluid intake restrictions does not provide any additional benefits in tested variables over endurance training alone. Thus, further evidence is required before recommendations to utilize this post-exercise conditioning strategy are deemed valid."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["618bcc032467f01cc0cb9f2c","5e709447878c28a0473b97eb","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"93","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"795-803","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","618bcc032467f01cc0cb9f29","5e70928b878c28a0473979a8","5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","5e709447878c28a0473b97eb","618bcc032467f01cc0cb9f2c","5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547952f","mniswId":"17266","title":"Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport","issn":"0270-1367","eissn":"0364-9857","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"86d43a2d-489f-4aa3-bf47-a790d54a6518"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Exercise capacity","intravascular volumes","red blood cell parameters","total hemoglobin mass"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747056743956"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d5932d2467f04573f4c8af","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Czarny","documentHash":"6814ef3e-d1c2-4e65-9083-02afc928d978"},{"objectId":"6034ddf49543c7410626fb51","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Mardyła","uuid":"045903364144F3A4782468B1EDCE1DDB2FD4783E630FC501AE1DB9B50DFC4E59DAA6C79E4A63944D9729213CBBDE40CB8E25CC5E04D0EBB8065B999016D7FF67","documentHash":"6929f48e-fedb-4d15-b807-e6f95756e0d6"},{"objectId":"602f38b29543c7410626f214","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rydzik","uuid":"7BC83EC239014B976A213F19148CF6C5F85A2B1C40FA62D319D85D46088D1BD14009AF92F8705865303A93F80F9D369252B2FC56337AE25CC0FC5026D5E60874","documentHash":"f4ca4844-2678-4673-b7b6-88faffce0f21"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b9796","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Obmiński","uuid":"069777A5D335D17B200D969B274FB0D8A15AFAD2BF9338D11C75619E33591EFAF899F813463D849AED07A39E3E65A55D6877C3FB9E67C9123B39E272377EBDA2","documentHash":"e401102a-8c76-47d6-8c2f-62384c794899"},{"objectId":"5e70925b878c28a0473944ed","name":"TADEUSZ","lastName":"AMBROŻY","uuid":"B4D2982C5A50E6C95A7D48137E743EA9E41C3361F3700C705F2A5B5C0301AFC0040F75003E0EC8CB8DC072B632C844CD81D06BBA332C53666E658B5AE9046341","orcidId":"0000-0001-7361-9478","documentHash":"05ff181a-e409-44f0-bd9e-0210d7d6fef7"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473924b9","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"MACIEJCZYK","uuid":"E0A224080BCD7374AFB4F40DD8BF9AD7C9DC00CD3E19C1265BF98D64BCB4FD7A191CF96A4DD7A69EE6F156B6910BBB8AEAF01078C880E9C103DA0327E011F6F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9505-4081","documentHash":"bbf43f67-2f2c-42e7-8b1c-b0e1d582a980"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f661","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Jaszczur-Nowicki","uuid":"A26E8F20AB7C592427EE23627B901A33084D342C85AA2AB87FCC46645C15DEE3A3B48D59D82E5B07EA2486689759F2A705704A162A98A52F0094C394ADC45EF9","orcidId":"0000-0001-5256-1406","documentHash":"566ce0e4-927d-4eae-b64e-53d3876fc86a"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e620","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"WIĘCEK","uuid":"44B3E979DD5089EBED9AE03419692895A253454600B04780B9D7F190B2FF4B8305C1D72519C19C57C3395626076937E5AD4DB86CA39802ADD6E352C6E0AB1712","orcidId":"0000-0002-5390-3049","documentHash":"26b3746d-f258-4357-8891-46ea477f0e32"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61d5932d2467f04573f4c8ad","doi":"10.3390/biology11010065","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/11/1/65","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Acid-Base Balance, Blood Gases Saturation, and Technical Tactical Skills in Kickboxing Bouts According to K1 Rules","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Simple Summary: The aim of our study was to analyze the changes in ABB after a three-round\nkickboxing fight and the level of technical and tactical skills presented during the fight. Fighting in\nkickboxing under K1 rules takes place with a high presence of anaerobic metabolism. Kickboxing\nathletes must have a good tolerance for metabolic acidosis and the ability to conduct an effective\nduel despite ABB disorders. Properly developed post-workout regeneration also plays an extremely\nimportant role.\nAbstract: Background: Acid–base balance (ABB) is a major component of homeostasis, which is\ndetermined by the efficient functioning of many organs, including the lungs, kidneys, and liver, and\nthe proper water and electrolyte exchange between these components. The efforts made during\ncompetitions by combat sports athletes such as kickboxers require a very good anaerobic capacity,\nwhich, as research has shown, can be improved by administering sodium bicarbonate. Combat sports\nare also characterized by an open task structure, which means that cognitive and executive functions\nmust be maintained at an appropriate level during a fight. The aim of our study was to analyze the\nchanges in ABB in capillary blood, measuring levels of H+, pCO2, pO2, HCO3\n􀀀, BE and total molar\nCO2 concentration (TCO2), which were recorded 3 and 20 min after a three-round kickboxing bout,\nand the level of technical and tactical skills presented during the fight. Methods: The study involved\n14 kickboxers with the highest skill level (champion level). Statistical comparison of mentioned\nvariables recorded prior to and after a bout was done with the use of Friedman’s ANOVA. Results:\n3 min after a bout, H+ and pO2 were higher by 41% and 11.9%, respectively, while pCO2, HCO3\n􀀀,\nBE and TO2 were lower by 14.5%, 39.4%, 45.4% and 34.4%, respectively. Furthermore, 20 min after\nthe bout all variables tended to normalization and they did not differ significantly compared to the\nbaseline values. Scores in activeness of the attack significantly correlated (r = 0.64) with pre–post\nchanges in TCO2. Conclusions: The disturbances in ABB and changes in blood oxygen and carbon\ndioxide saturation observed immediately after a bout indicate that anaerobic metabolism plays a\nlarge part in kickboxing fights. Anaerobic training should be included in strength and conditioning\nprograms for kickboxers to prepare the athletes for the physiological requirements of sports combat."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709210878c28a04738f661"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b9796"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f38b29543c7410626f214","6034ddf49543c7410626fb51","5e709447878c28a0473b9796","5e709200878c28a04738e620","5e70923e878c28a0473924b9","61d5932d2467f04573f4c8af","5e709210878c28a04738f661","5e70925b878c28a0473944ed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5d878c28514547d873","mniswId":"21252","title":"Biology","eissn":"2079-7737","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b1374be2-6fd9-4375-9a5c-b6e6f192f090"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d5932d2467f04573f4c8b7","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"25dc342f-86c3-4071-a47b-b80359c1ef5c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["acid–base balance","kickboxing","metabolic acidosis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057829522"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62bad151409707490d7cddeb","name":"Mirosława","lastName":"Gałęcka","documentHash":"3cc3cc8c-3127-46af-a815-4bc6a8bc59e4"},{"objectId":"62bad151409707490d7cddea","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szurkowska","documentHash":"051dec68-f39c-4bc7-add6-45f2a81853e8"},{"objectId":"62bad151409707490d7cdde9","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cisoń","documentHash":"e3c34b3c-51a8-46de-9cb4-3c8032f76fd1"},{"objectId":"62bad151409707490d7cdde8","name":"David C.","lastName":"Nieman","documentHash":"ccdf8840-75d9-4f14-abe0-2a2b717f607a"},{"objectId":"62bad151409707490d7cdde7","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Karolkiewicz","documentHash":"45b611b3-44d9-463a-9e75-2523ee8872ab"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Sitkowski","uuid":"CA8381D5763FD93B46A4D4F27D5BF0B5171809C2441CE33160E53F7F1E5CF1567242ADAA256E6AFE1A33611FDFE3D56290402A31516AE9D89934241D34DFAF7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7144-8182","documentHash":"5d5d2256-58ee-4dee-a1cc-4b2def5e5b2f"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979a8","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Szyguła","uuid":"5FE2CF5AA1EFA44C17853403E1A62E1B9B519269A4D7953F34C109B17DD1AF3A6DD863794E399749895F77FA740C142C12FCB81EF24AE3105FA33185E332AA33","orcidId":"0000-0002-6685-6579","documentHash":"c12def02-1c7c-4c5c-9b92-62d3989bc288"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62bad151409707490d7cdde6","doi":"10.1186/s13102-022-00497-z","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13102-022-00497-z.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"No effects of a 4-week post-exercise sauna bathing on targeted gut microbiota and intestinal barrier function, and hsCRP in healthy men: a pilot randomized controlled trial","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Body temperature fluctuations induced by acute exercise bouts may influence the intestinal barrier\nwith related effects on epithelial permeability, immune responses, and release of metabolites produced by the gut\nmicrobiota. This study evaluated the effects of post-exercise sauna bathing in young men undergoing endurance\ntraining on gut bacteria inflammation and intestinal barrier function.\nMethods: Fifteen (15) untrained males aged 22 ± 1.5 years were randomly assigned to exercise training (ET) with\nor without post-exercise sauna treatments (S). Participants in the group ET + S (n = 8) exercised 60 min, 3 times per\nweek, on a bicycle ergometer followed by a 30-min dry Finish sauna treatment. The control group (ET, n = 7) engaged\nin the same exercise training program without the sauna treatments. Blood and stool samples were collected before\nand after the 4-week training program. Blood samples were analysed for the concentration of high-sensitivity C-reac-\ntive protein (hsCRP) and complete blood counts. Stool samples were analysed for pH, quantitative and qualitative\nmeasures of targeted bacteria, zonulin, and secretory immunoglobulin A.\nResults: Interaction effects revealed no differences in the pattern of change over time between groups for the abun-\ndance of selected gut microbiome bacteria and stool pH, zonulin, sIgA, and hsCRP. Pre- and post-study fecal concen-\ntrations of Bifidobacterium spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Akkermansia muciniphila were below reference values\nfor these bacteria in both groups.\nConclusions: The combination of 4-weeks exercise followed by passive heat exposure did not have a measurable\ninfluence on targeted gut microbiota, intestinal barrier function, and hsCRP levels in young males.\nTrial registration: The study was retrospectively registered in the clinical trials registry (Clinicaltrials.gov) under the trial\nregistration number: NCT05277597.

One of the way for rating of the state of demanded physical adaptation is monitoring of biological responses to endurance training units. The aim of the study was to examine psycho-hormonal responses to a 10km cross-country run in male and female boxers. Material and methods: Twenty-four amateur adult boxers, 12 women and 12 men, of various weight categories, excluding heavyweight athletes, performed field a 10km run. Capillary blood was sampled in the morning at 8:00, 5 minutes prior to the run (11:00 am), and within 5 minutes after exercise. Plasma cortisol concentration (C) was determined using a commercial ELISA kit (IBL, GERMANY). Post-exercise blood lactate was determined with a Lactate Scout analyzer. Pre-run anticipatory stress (AS) was estimated on a numerical scale of 1 to 10 points, with the same tool used to measure the rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Results: Morning plasma cortisol levels in females (540±82 nM) and males (520±73 nM) did not differ significantly but the pre-and post-run levels were higher in females. Furthermore, males rather than females showed lower pre-exercise compared to post-exercise C levels, meaning that blood lactate level was significantly higher in males (6.3±1.1 mM) compared to that in females (5.4±0.7 mM). There were no significant differences between the sexes for AS and RPE. However, both perceptual parameters were slightly higher in females. Conclusion: Based on blood cortisol measurements and perceptual parameters it can be concluded that the psychophysiological cost of exercise is higher in female athletes, even in the case of non-competitive exercise."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b9796"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709228878c28a047390d55","5e709229878c28a047390ea1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"99","pagesFromTo":"9-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709229878c28a047390ea1","5e709228878c28a047390d55","5e709447878c28a0473b9796"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c2d","mniswId":"200029","title":"Antropomotoryka","issn":"1731-0652","eissn":"2353-3986","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"fd1c049e-0010-4ee0-88c3-263c58833ffd"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["blood cortisol","lactate","gender","field effort","stress"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058340039"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63f881d54097070992708dc2","name":"Juris","lastName":"Grants","documentHash":"680789e8-3716-428e-a5ea-e99ccd86e5b2"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b9796","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Obmiński","uuid":"069777A5D335D17B200D969B274FB0D8A15AFAD2BF9338D11C75619E33591EFAF899F813463D849AED07A39E3E65A55D6877C3FB9E67C9123B39E272377EBDA2","documentHash":"e401102a-8c76-47d6-8c2f-62384c794899"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391c27","name":"Artur","lastName":"Litwiniuk","uuid":"88A17B4AB8744C975913BED43E684E951CB45C4CE1F74A5B207C1D57F4735FC3BDAD4ED23090E3A6C9C20062ADE0B2DBF039DDC15ADCB3DE228C3137977250BC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1351-740X","documentHash":"b0b5f5cc-231c-46a4-a0d0-996f9f84b12d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63f881d54097070992708dc1","publicUri":"https://archbudo.com/view/abstract/id/15652","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Blood lactate concentrations after losing or winning a boxing match in junior athletes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bacground and Study Aim: A three-round, refereed boxing bout (3 x 3 min.) with one-minute breaks is an exercise with a high proportion of anaerobic metabolism.

In an online survey study, we collected data from 206 trail runners (63 females, 143 males), aged between 18 and 65 (M = 39.15, SD = 9.19), who took part in the European Running Festival (a competitive trail running event). Our results showed that flow was positively associated with PSP and negatively associated with ECP. Furthermore, the results provide seminal evidence in support of the 2 × 2 model in relation to flow in sport.

We previously found that plasma S1P concentration is elevated in response to acute exercise and training. Interestingly, hypoxia, which is commonly utilized in training programs, induces a similar effect. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to determine the effect of normobaric hypoxia on exercise-induced changes in blood sphingolipid metabolism. Fifteen male competitive cyclists performed a graded cycling exercise until exhaustion (GE) and a simulated 30 km individual time trial (TT) in either normoxic or hypoxic (FiO2 = 16.5%) conditions. Blood samples were taken before the exercise, following its cessation, and after 30 min of recovery. We found that TT increased dihydrosphingosine-1-phosphate (dhS1P) concentration in plasma (both HDL- and albuminbound) and blood cells, as well as the rate of dhS1P release from erythrocytes, regardless of oxygen availability. Plasma concentration of S1P was, however, reduced during the recovery phase, and this trend was augmented by hypoxia. On the other hand, GE in normoxia induced a selective increase in HDL-bound S1P. This effect disappeared when the exercise was performed in hypoxia, and it was associated with reduced S1P level in platelets and erythrocytes. We conclude that submaximal exercise elevates total plasma dhS1P concentration via increased availability of dihydrosphingosine resulting in enhanced dhS1P synthesis and release by blood cells. Maximal exercise, on the other hand, induces a selective increase in HDL-bound S1P, which is a consequence of mechanisms not related to blood cells.

These factors have not, however, been examined dynamically in terms of day-to-day, lagged and reciprocal effects during normal training. This study investigated the dynamic interplay between muscle damage and energetics in male boxers during a short training block. Thirteen amateur boxers were monitored over 16 consecutive days during early-season training. The participants were assessed each morning for plasma CK, urea, glucose, and creatinine (days 1 and 16 only) concentrations, before self-reporting muscle soreness (1–10 scale). Within-person contemporaneous (lag-0) and temporal (lag-1) networks were estimated using multilevel vector autoregression. Muscle soreness, CK, urea, and glucose presented different trajectories with training, but with some heterogeneity reflecting within-person variances (47% to 78%). The contemporaneous network yielded a significant positive edge (or correlation) between CK and soreness (r = 0.44), along with negative CK-glucose and glucose-urea edges. More significant edges emerged in the temporal network, with soreness linked to CK (r = 0.19), glucose (r = -0.28) and urea (r = 0.22), whilst the CK-glucose edge sign switched. In summary, daily fluctuations in muscle damage and energetic activity, which presented in a normal physiological range, were highly variable among boxers during early-season training. Within-person networks indicated some interrelatedness between CK, soreness, urea, and glucose, although the nature and presence of these relationships were contingent on temporal ordering. These inconsistences reflect the pleiotropy of energetic biomarkers in training and recovery."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b9796","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709447878c28a0473b9796","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","655f1dac40970733106ef062"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547735c","mniswId":"2464","title":"BIOLOGY OF SPORT","issn":"0860-021X","documentHash":"09716dd9-e291-4418-858a-bdde103918e1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655f1a8c40970733106ea730","year":"2024","documentHash":"3b3db644-b6e0-4c69-9230-31b9e104b2e7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["recovery","competition","combat sport","injuries","glomerular filtration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059011411"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65561e514097077145eee489","name":"Anna","lastName":"Blachowska","documentHash":"7daebd9a-afc8-4988-aed4-ae1f14b36692"},{"objectId":"602e470a9543c7410626f009","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Waleriańczyk","uuid":"8E0AA3503EE9FC3197CDB9DF56820A639148F97C31A81C0C08DE9C4820DA3263015312D5E2B1552230266EA608776268F20C373A1E2506BE65E08635FA38CA25","documentHash":"d88b87c8-006a-4bcb-86d1-99ec4a0da5da"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b5f","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"STOLARSKI","uuid":"6EEB4A539F86226E3BF0AA95A09155E8EBD18B25C19F53CC7C2741D43CBE756DE711D18F408150E7869CE0C8D264AD32E221F46A416109E9804C0671B7EC084F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1490-357X","documentHash":"43d1b8af-5e15-437c-a973-de72e217ba43"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65561e514097077145eee487","doi":"10.1016/j.paid.2023.112278","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2023.112278","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Striving for a perfect flow: Testing the 2 × 2 model of perfectionism in trail runners","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Flow pertains to the state of the total absorption in the present activity, intense focus, concentration, and enjoyment, accompanied by a loss of reflective consciousness. Previous studies pointed out flow as an indissoluble part of physical activity, helpful in fostering and maintaining autonomous motivation in professional and amateur sport. In the present study, within the framework of the 2 × 2 model of perfectionism, we investigated the relationships between two higher-order dimensions of perfectionism - personal standards (PSP) and evaluative concerns (ECP) and dispositional flow. In an online survey study, we collected data from 206 trail runners (63 females, 143 males), aged between 18 and 65 (M = 39.15, SD = 9.19), who took part in the European Running Festival (a competitive trail running event). Our results showed that flow was positively associated with PSP and negatively associated with ECP. Furthermore, the results provide seminal evidence in support of the 2 × 2 model in relation to flow in sport. With H1a and H2–H4 hypotheses of the model all being supported the model indicates that for achieving the most frequent flow pure PSP is the most beneficial, while pure ECP is the least beneficial."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65561e514097077145eee489","602e470a9543c7410626f009"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","name":"Wydział Psychologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b5f","602e470a9543c7410626f009"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"212","pagesFromTo":"112278","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65561e514097077145eee489","602e470a9543c7410626f009","5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b5f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454791f5","mniswId":"15884","title":"Personality and Individual Differences","issn":"0191-8869","documentHash":"06abacc9-b599-4ffa-b1d1-85c14977ca6e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65561e514097077145eee488","year":"2023","volume":"212","documentHash":"fe0c9318-47cd-4ea1-8479-19c9f888d8b5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059017994"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602e470a9543c7410626f009","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Waleriańczyk","uuid":"8E0AA3503EE9FC3197CDB9DF56820A639148F97C31A81C0C08DE9C4820DA3263015312D5E2B1552230266EA608776268F20C373A1E2506BE65E08635FA38CA25","documentHash":"d88b87c8-006a-4bcb-86d1-99ec4a0da5da"}],"objectId":"6556185b4097077145ee699f","doi":"10.1080/02640414.2023.2273090","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02640414.2023.2273090","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Perfectionism and performance in a trail running competition: a prospective study of the interactive effects of perfectionism","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Several studies explored the links between perfectionism and sport performance. However, only a few studies examined this relationship in the context of real sport competition and with a focus on the possible interactive effects of the dimensions of perfectionism. The present study aimed to investigate whether the two higher-order dimensions of perfectionism – perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns – interact in predicting performance in mountain trail running competitions. 167 athletes (54 females, 113 males) aged 19 to 65 (M = 39.32, SD = 9.35) completed measures of perfectionism in the week prior to the competition. Regression analyses revealed that perfectionistic strivings were a positive predictor of the runners’ performance while perfectionistic concerns showed no significant associations with performance. However, a more in-depth exploration within the framework of the 2 × 2 model of perfectionism showed that the beneficial effects of high perfectionistic strivings are no longer significant when accompanied by high levels of perfectionistic concerns. These results support the notion that perfectionistic concerns may be detrimental to sport performance even if their overall, direct effects are not significant, adding first evidence of the existence of standard but also flipped perfectionistic tipping points in the context of sport performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e470a9543c7410626f009"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e470a9543c7410626f009"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72cde2467f01e93115bbf","title":"JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES","issn":"0264-0414","eissn":"0264-0414","documentHash":"a6a73e24-2be4-4ddb-838a-c4ef29ce503d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6556185b4097077145ee69a0","year":"2023","documentHash":"1c182d80-eb03-475f-9d20-25159fea2560"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Perfectionistic strivings","perfectionistic concerns","personality","sport performance","perfectionistic tipping points","2×2 model of perfectionism"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059018093"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65561a6f4097077145eea0ca","name":"Andrew P.","lastName":"Hill","documentHash":"cc26b206-d1bb-4e16-b08f-2e8e8b6308ee"},{"objectId":"602e470a9543c7410626f009","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Waleriańczyk","uuid":"8E0AA3503EE9FC3197CDB9DF56820A639148F97C31A81C0C08DE9C4820DA3263015312D5E2B1552230266EA608776268F20C373A1E2506BE65E08635FA38CA25","documentHash":"d88b87c8-006a-4bcb-86d1-99ec4a0da5da"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b5f","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"STOLARSKI","uuid":"6EEB4A539F86226E3BF0AA95A09155E8EBD18B25C19F53CC7C2741D43CBE756DE711D18F408150E7869CE0C8D264AD32E221F46A416109E9804C0671B7EC084F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1490-357X","documentHash":"43d1b8af-5e15-437c-a973-de72e217ba43"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65561a6f4097077145eea0c8","doi":"10.1016/j.psychsport.2023.102511","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2023.102511","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A conditional process model of perfectionism, goal-realization, and post-competition mood","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Research has recently begun to examine the relationship between multidimensional perfectionism and athletes’ post-competition mood. However, to date, there have been few attempts to examine the interaction between dimensions of perfectionism or model possible explanatory processes. To address these limitations, in the current study we tested a novel conditional process model whereby the relationship between perfectionistic strivings and post-competition affect was mediated by the degree to which goals were considered to have been met (goal-realization) and that this indirect effect was, in turn, moderated by levels of perfectionistic concerns. We tested this model in a sample of 251 athletes who took part in a “Runmageddon” event - a cross-country obstacle race. Athletes completed measures of perfectionism (perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns) before the race and measures of goal-realization and mood (tense arousal, energetic arousal, and hedonic tone) between 24 and 48 h after the race. Analyses revealed that perfectionistic strivings were indirectly linked to a more unpleasant post-competition mood (higher tense arousal and lower hedonic tone) via perceptions of lower goal-realization. In addition, these two indirect effects were statistically significant only when perfectionistic concerns were medium and high. The results support the proposed conditional model and suggest the interplay between dimensions of perfectionism is important for athletes’ post-competition mood, and the level of perfectionistic concerns, especially."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e470a9543c7410626f009"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","name":"Wydział Psychologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b5f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"69","pagesFromTo":"102511","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e470a9543c7410626f009","65561a6f4097077145eea0ca","5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b5f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c285145479440","mniswId":"16780","title":"Psychology of Sport and Exercise","issn":"1469-0292","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0da86e7b-c55a-495c-bf99-64c459c5f93e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65561a6f4097077145eea0c9","year":"2023","volume":"69","documentHash":"9a2a475b-eee7-4a9a-bb5d-5cd3121b6406"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Moderated mediation","Perfectionistic tipping points","Affective state","Performance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059018202"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65673b8440970767abd90611","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Zawadzki","documentHash":"37a0c7cd-952e-417c-8174-f89fae3a74f6"},{"objectId":"5e709448878c28a0473b9a5d","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szczepańska","uuid":"CCE6B24FFBF5490C789E272356E39650E3E0039B118A79C089B0438B4E7F68F8C939DCEED3630C1E44AD59C9EF5E5BBAE92A6CA7BC393C4B34AD355835FD0689","orcidId":"0000-0003-2406-5282","documentHash":"25d95cdc-7e7d-4a7f-837d-4edb8728be2d"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Malczewska-Lenczowska","uuid":"ABA9D020E597063AAD4B0492B70B9C9E9D88DF3BB588E5EAD6D1F4E426F9DA29757758128E7DD4995D35E61288491ED173C9FF8B012EF649A9AC5C95E8AF8BFC","documentHash":"f052a6c0-d07e-47e1-93d6-7e3488b6d13e"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Sitkowski","uuid":"CA8381D5763FD93B46A4D4F27D5BF0B5171809C2441CE33160E53F7F1E5CF1567242ADAA256E6AFE1A33611FDFE3D56290402A31516AE9D89934241D34DFAF7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7144-8182","documentHash":"5d5d2256-58ee-4dee-a1cc-4b2def5e5b2f"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","name":"Olga","lastName":"Surała","uuid":"1BAC89E5E464A3843B36415A03DC80AD81715FAC8BADFCC086F958B60FCF17D6898329F116E4AFF5170C0FB91C5440DFFA5F0B141DDA65322B5BCFA4BE1BA9E8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0419-9435","documentHash":"a697d3a5-686e-4b2c-8ed3-a57f3d908368"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65673b8440970767abd90610","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0287330","publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0287330","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The effect of body size and composition on lumbar spine trabecular bone score in morphologically diverse subjects","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aim\nThe trabecular bone score (TBS) is a tool for assessing bone quality and health. Current\nTBS algorithm corrects for body mass index (BMI), as a proxy of regional tissue thickness.\nHowever, this approach fails to consider BMI inaccuracies due to individual differences in\nbody stature, composition and somatotype. This study investigated the relationship between\nTBS and body size and composition in subjects with a normal BMI, but with large morpho-\nlogical diversity in body fatness and height.\nMethods\nYoung male subjects (n = 97; age 17.2±1.0 years), including ski jumpers (n = 25), volleyball\nplayers (n = 48) and non-athletes (controls n = 39), were recruited. The TBS was determined\nfrom L1-L4 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans using TBSiNsight software.\nResults\nTBS correlated negatively with height and tissue thickness in the L1-L4 area in ski jumpers\n(r = -0.516 and r = -0.529), volleyball players (r = -0.525 and r = -0.436), and the total group\n(r = -0.559 and r = -0.463), respectively. Multiple regression analyses revealed that height,\nL1-L4 soft tissue thickness, fat mass and muscle mass were significant determinants of\nTBS (R2 = 0.587, p<0.001). L1-L4 soft tissue thickness explained 27% and height 14% of\nthe TBS variance.\nConclusion\nThe negative association of TBS and both features suggests that a very low L1-L4 tissue\nthickness may lead to overestimation of the TBS, while tall stature may have the opposite\neffect. It seems that the utility of the TBS as a skeletal assessment tool in lean and/or tall\nyoung male subjects could be improved if tissues thickness in the lumbar spine area and\nstature instead of BMI were considered in the algorithm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709448878c28a0473b9a5d","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"e0287330","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b","5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","5e709448878c28a0473b9a5d","65673b8440970767abd90611"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","eissn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"fcfcc06e-e7b2-4412-a89f-df94326b9f49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64d32ea54097076e9ebba680","year":"2023","volume":"18","number":"7","documentHash":"219abdcd-10b1-4c0b-afac-77d3beb1e87e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059049902"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"654e3ef74097074318080920","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Klusiewicz","documentHash":"da0724c2-b646-4a2e-befc-d70e9a0f32f8"},{"objectId":"62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"904495F361CE89397F8BA6BE829364B4B9336FBD552FEEEBE33D2EC47C2B2616CB87223567A2A4353C661F0C7E7FEDE3B8E405786D51F2E3904DAF6A613E3154","documentHash":"6d120e18-a5ed-49d4-8d7d-8a5a9dda13f8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-09-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"654e3ef7409707431808091f","doi":"10.2478/bhk-2023-0026","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/bhk-2023-0026","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"POWERbreathe® S-Index Test – guidelines and recommendations for practitioners","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Study aim: POWERbreathe® S-Index Test is an accessible and functional evaluation of inspiratory muscle strength.

Athletes provide a suitable model for evaluation here, as T co-expresses traits related to male-to-male competition and fitness with cortisol (C) playing a moderating role. This study investigated associations between the Big Five traits, T, and C in adolescent male athletes. One hundred and twenty male ice hockey players (aged 14–19 years) were assessed for blood total (T, C) and free (FT, FC) hormones, body-size dimensions (i.e., body mass, height, body mass index [BMI]), the Big Five personality traits (i.e., extraversion, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness), and trait anxiety. Correlational and regression (with age and BMI as covariates) analyses identified a positive effect of FT on extraversion, but a negative FT effect on neuroticism and anxiety (p < 0.05). Significant FT × FC interactions emerged for extraversion and agreeableness. Slope testing revealed that FT had a positive effect on extraversion at the FC mean and +1 SD, and a negative effect on agreeableness with FC at +1 SD. In conclusion, adolescent male athletes with a higher serum FT concentration tended to express higher extraversion, but lower neuroticism and anxiety. The FT association with extraversion was moderated by FC concentration, as was agreeableness. Therefore, high-FT athletes presented a behavioural disposition that favours dominance and resiliency, with some dependencies on FC availability. Since all association effect sizes were weak, replicate studies on larger adolescent samples are needed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709494878c28a0473bfcdd","5e709448878c28a0473b9a5d","5e709447878c28a0473b9796","5e709447878c28a0473b97ef","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","5e709447878c28a0473b9796","5e709494878c28a0473bfcdd","5e709448878c28a0473b9a5d","5e709447878c28a0473b97ef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547735c","mniswId":"2464","title":"BIOLOGY OF SPORT","issn":"0860-021X","documentHash":"09716dd9-e291-4418-858a-bdde103918e1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655f1a8c40970733106ea730","year":"2024","documentHash":"3b3db644-b6e0-4c69-9230-31b9e104b2e7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Androgens","Stress","HPA-axis","Psychology","Neuroendocrine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059118206"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655f1a8c40970733106ea737","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Masiak","documentHash":"47cde0d7-6be3-41cc-b569-a1c6e21a69bf"},{"objectId":"655f1a8c40970733106ea734","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Strońska","documentHash":"4e4505f9-191f-4889-a990-8510f79535d4"},{"objectId":"655f1a8c40970733106ea733","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Chmielowiec","documentHash":"ed4be639-1541-44a2-8524-8cbaf3aac294"},{"objectId":"655f1a8c40970733106ea732","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Chmielowiec","documentHash":"0dd7c075-d28a-439a-a694-7815ec1dea46"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd68d","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Humińska-Lisowska","uuid":"368E467865E837CE4A21F30EDA6CD06456A42A84E432F9E7DF0BDA1067C862A1B1C795D7093E92D71C3A5BBB5A73B1639EB6C0AE6347270DCE4F49E72807B4C7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0034-0809","documentHash":"ac990a90-3236-4881-a3de-1d3b127413d2"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","name":"Olga","lastName":"Surała","uuid":"1BAC89E5E464A3843B36415A03DC80AD81715FAC8BADFCC086F958B60FCF17D6898329F116E4AFF5170C0FB91C5440DFFA5F0B141DDA65322B5BCFA4BE1BA9E8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0419-9435","documentHash":"a697d3a5-686e-4b2c-8ed3-a57f3d908368"},{"objectId":"5e70936b878c28a0473a918f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Grzywacz","uuid":"A7D5F46C186FB3D59AD25BC0BD1D14AB778D5E249053794774019551F186831F208E7E93AD7280C33257D6FA04360EB5165F3A43EBA86CA5150A6CB333B4FA3D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2633-520X","documentHash":"f153b6a3-bab7-425a-becd-b69b8fdf7ba7"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e85","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Cięszczyk","uuid":"F88BBFB31BCB351571A6C4D155B1D599979819609DAA19572946F9C3FDEC3E337FB617684965171B241A3DEB609813D8D4FE9413823542A497A71C0983FC144C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7735-7580","documentHash":"cf4e4644-ee40-4723-ae61-4c52401833b0"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397526","name":"Milena","lastName":"Lachowicz","uuid":"5F97FEB909EEB7B6EF892ABFF7600C35D746199A4DA644AAE651C37BB52FEEEBA7265DB5E53A85E8C55194EF64733AC4104C4F6126280618525BEE10691FD1B8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8402-0564","documentHash":"ead26784-fba1-4050-9715-d0a08b369bb5"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047392f18","name":"Michał","lastName":"Spieszny","uuid":"C88B291BD66A7A8FB6D3F52FD809F8AA8D86A629C398E8C4F48DB6717CFF4F6F6483E71B9EDE5971C1B68C3DBD491D849F7E18038CDC71F0C6AFF0CCA5AF340B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9934-6911","documentHash":"625309f1-ee31-4c1a-9de7-27465516a837"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-20","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"655f1a8c40970733106ea72f","doi":"10.5114/biolsport.2024.129478","publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Journal/-78/pdf-51092-10?filename=29_02898_Article_c.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Association between polymorphism rs6295 of HTR1A serotonin receptor  gene and personality traits among athletes of combat sport","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"HTR1A (5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A) and its polymorphic variants are highly important for athletes in different aspects, allowing us to hypothesize their biological influences. Hence, to investigate at least part of the relationship mentioned in the case literature, it was decided to study the association of the selected HTR1A polymorphism with personality traits measured by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). The participants consisted of 250 mixed martial arts (combat sport) athletes and 209 healthy male participants (control group). The personality traits were measured for the Revised Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI-R). Genetic material was isolated from whole blood collected from patients, and then all samples were genotyped using the real-time PCR method. Statistical analysis was performed using a 2×3 factorial ANOVA. The research revealed a statistically significant effect of a complex factor of rs6295 of the HTR1A serotonin receptor gene with combat sport/control and with Novelty Seeking (F2,453 = 6.126; p = 0.0024; η2 = 0.026) and Harm Avoidance (F2,453 = 3.709; p = 0.0252; η2 = 0.016). The presence of the HTR1A GG genotype (rs6295) was found to be associated with higher scores in self-management and lower scores in harm avoidance, indicating genetic predispositions in the strength group towards better results in combat sports."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abf3f"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

However, their effect has been studied primarily in the cortical bone, with vitamin D status being assessed mainly from the total 25(OH)D serum fraction. The study aimed to investigate the impact of vitamin D (total and free fraction) and iron status (i.e., serum ferritin or soluble transferrin receptor) and calcium intake (ADOS-Ca questionnaire) on lumbar cortical and trabecular bone. In a cohort of 113 male subjects (76 athletes, 37 non-athletes) aged 15–19, the lumbar spine status (Z-score, bone mineral apparent density (BMAD), and trabecular bone score (TBS)) was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Relationships between the examined micronutrients and bone health parameters were observed only in athletes. Free 25(OH)D was significantly (p < 0.001) correlated with Z-score and BMAD, while total 25(OH)D (p < 0.001) and iron status (ferritin, Fe stores; p < 0.01) correlated solely with BMAD. Free 25(OH)D and ferritin concentrations were the best determinants of bone status (R2 = 0.330; p < 0.001) and explained 25% and 7% of the BMAD variance, respectively. No relationships were found between the micronutrients and TBS. The results confirmed the positive influence of vitamin D and iron on cortical, but not trabecular, bone status solely in physically active subjects. In athletes, free 25(OH)D seems to be a superior indicator of bone health to a total 25(OH)D fraction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

body’s response to this type of combat is sparse. This study aims to assess the alterations\nin hormone levels and brain activity in elite kickboxers following an actual K1 bout and compare these changes\nwith those observed in a control group engaged in a simulated fight exercise with a punchbag. The study included\n100 male professional kickboxers, randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (K1 fight) and a control\ngroup (simulated fight with a punchbag). Blood samples were obtained before and after exercise to evaluate\ntestosterone (T) and cortisol concentrations (C). Concurrently, brain activity was recorded using quantitative\nelectroencephalography (QEEG). After the activity in the experimental group mean testosterone level slightly,\nnon‑significantly decreased from 13.7 nmol/l to 12.4 nmol/l, while mean cortisol significantly (p < 0.001) increased\nfrom 313 to 570 nmol/l. In the control group after the exertion against a punchbag mean cortisol significantly\n(p < 0.001) increased from 334 to 452 nmol/l and testosterone increased non‑significantly, from 15.1 to 16.3 nmol/l.\nIn both groups, the testosterone/cortisol ratio (T/C ratio) showed significantly lower levels after the intervention\n(p < 0.001 and p < 0.032) in the experimental and control group respectively. The comparison of groups after\nexercise revealed significantly higher cortisol levels (experimental group x = 570 nmol/l; control group x = 452\nnmol/l) and a significantly lower T/C ratio (experimental group x = 2.7; control group x = 3.9), (p = 0.001) in\nthe experimental group. Significantly higher brain activity was found in selected leads after a bout (experimental\ngroup). Furthermore, in the experimental group, significant associations of weak to moderate strength were found\nbetween hormone fluctuations and selected areas of brain activity (p < 0.05). K1-format kickboxing induces a stress\nresponse, evident in the sharp changes in cortisol and testosterone levels. A notable observation was the inverse\ndirection of changes in both hormones. Brain activity analysis indicated the potential influence of raised cortisol\nconcentrations on specific brain areas. This study augments our understanding of the physiological responses\nduring K1 kickboxing bouts and may inform the future evolution of this sport."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709460878c28a0473bbc60"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The aim of this study is knowledge about the express diagnostic program and the possibility of detecting changes in musculoskeletal posture in young athletes practicing various sports disciplines.\n\nMaterial & Methods: The participants were 38 athletes from sports clubs in Riga, Latvia, swimmers (n = 19), and cyclists (n = 19) aged 14-15 years old with experience in National competitions. Body posture was assessed once before the training for visual diagnostics and muscular functional testing. A diagnostic program was developed from these methods, which included measuring the changes of 8 sagittal points from the vertical plane and functional testing of 8 muscle groups. The analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS version 26. The Shapiro-Wilk test, an independent t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyse the data.\n\nResults: The outdoor recreation activity (walking in nature) did not significantly affect the component of mental toughness (confidence t(11) = 0.451 as the p-value 0.837 >0.05, for constancy t(11) = −0.233; as the p-value 0.820 >0.05 and control t(11) = 0.117; as the p-value 0.909 >0.05) at the 5% level.\n\nConclusions: It can be concluded that each sport leads to postural changes in athletes due to specific functional muscle changes, as the results highlighted changes in both groups. Early postural changes in young athletes can be identified by applying express diagnostics. Early detection should lead to the prevention of injury."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b9796"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"141-149","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eee7da40970749973e2f32","65eee7da40970749973e2f33","65eee7da40970749973e2f34","65eee7da40970749973e2f35","65eee7da40970749973e2f36","5e709447878c28a0473b9796","5e709236878c28a047391c27"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c3b","mniswId":"1650","title":"Archives of Budo Science of Martial Arts and Extreme Sports","issn":"2300-8822","websiteLink":"http://smaes.archbudo.com/","documentHash":"bc980874-a8f5-4445-aa6b-a87bdbee55aa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6493f739409707544f5d78f2","year":"2023","volume":"19","number":"1","documentHash":"b4f411ba-8403-4f96-aa5b-6b072f5a2fce"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["body posture","innovative agonology","training loads"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059456089"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65ef15764097074997426654","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Staniak","documentHash":"ddbd1fb9-ba2f-4f39-9518-e8aec7063585"},{"objectId":"65ef15764097074997426653","name":"Christian J","lastName":"Cook","documentHash":"bdaec62d-2838-477b-b8e0-1cc138d31bcf"},{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","name":"Blair","lastName":"Crewther","uuid":"1B92721CD363D94CBA2DE83FE05638C7242F8FA781AD75AFE48220A8E21C71B11E2F98DC4C6A961F163AB35261CBE4A8CF98127F5064E33EEFAE9D0981310983","documentHash":"f3437f39-7c71-4805-871c-40f74ee9d44b"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a047394322","name":"ANNA","lastName":"PASTUSZAK","uuid":"033BC417F2CBD53DEFF4027307E3C1CC8077EAFCB89B1BAB97A389012F3EF8C4A2308E6430E9F7B2107EFDFEC511C48F916A20C9AFD34EB39AF02210A1552264","orcidId":"0000-0003-3786-4833","documentHash":"9abfb2c4-3be4-4c8c-a66e-a652fd4abb2e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-02-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65ef15764097074997426651","doi":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2024.114502","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0031938424000477?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Disaggregating the influence of maturity status on training, anthropometric, performance, skeletal periphery, and hormonal factors in athletic boys","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Maturity offset (i.e., age from peak height velocity [PHV]) is widely used to assess maturational status among youth athletes, but details on the skeletal periphery, hormones and training factors are lacking. More precision is also needed to explicate the timing, tempo, and sequence of growth-related events. These gaps were addressed in a cross-sectional study. One hundred and two athletic boys (aged 14.1 ± 0.5 years) were evaluated for training details, salivary testosterone and cortisol, height, body mass, body mass index, body fat, fat-free mass (FFM), hand and carpal bone area, bone mineral content (BMC) and density (BMD), and countermovement jump performance. Participants were assigned to circa-PHV (N = 56) and post-PHV (N = 46) groups for comparisons, before data pooling and disaggregation using generalized additive and linear regression models. The older post-PHV group had a larger body size, more testosterone, and better performance and skeletal outcomes, whilst weekly training and school-based exercise favored the younger circa-PHV group (all p < 0.001). Smoother plots verified these differences via linear, or weakly non-linear, associations. Maturity offset was predicted (R2 = 0.848) by the linear combination of FFM (42.0 % relative contribution), hand BMD (31.5 %), chronological age (16.0 %), testosterone (6.7 %), and training hours (3.8 %). In conclusion, athletic boys who presented at different stages of maturity (-0.98 to 2.84 years from PHV) also differed on many developmental features. Most variables increased at constant, or near-constant, tempo with a higher maturity offset, with FFM and hand BMD emerging as the strongest linear predictors of maturational status."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925a878c28a047394322","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"278","pagesFromTo":"114502","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","5e70925a878c28a047394322","65ef15764097074997426653","65ef15764097074997426654"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479293","mniswId":"16141","title":"PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR","issn":"0031-9384","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"ce65a97c-0112-46ba-86a1-91914b8a79c9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ef15764097074997426652","year":"2024","number":"278","documentHash":"38a714c6-e66f-4237-9818-f20fde2e8302"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Maturation","Growth","Androgenic","Adolescence","Physical activity","DXA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059495058"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66828a87fdbe832502423d1d","name":"Christian J.","lastName":"Cook","documentHash":"48f6a5d2-71bf-4fca-9b1b-7f0b68997e66"},{"objectId":"66828a87fdbe832502423d1c","name":"Benjamin G.","lastName":"Serpell","documentHash":"52463da8-3990-4fb0-b0a5-c9ae7404da34"},{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","name":"Blair","lastName":"Crewther","uuid":"1B92721CD363D94CBA2DE83FE05638C7242F8FA781AD75AFE48220A8E21C71B11E2F98DC4C6A961F163AB35261CBE4A8CF98127F5064E33EEFAE9D0981310983","documentHash":"f3437f39-7c71-4805-871c-40f74ee9d44b"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b9796","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Obmiński","uuid":"069777A5D335D17B200D969B274FB0D8A15AFAD2BF9338D11C75619E33591EFAF899F813463D849AED07A39E3E65A55D6877C3FB9E67C9123B39E272377EBDA2","documentHash":"e401102a-8c76-47d6-8c2f-62384c794899"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66828a87fdbe832502423d1b","doi":"10.5114/biolsport.2024.135415","publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/doi_ft/10.5114/biolsport.2024.135415","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The influence of light and heavy training weeks on the cortisol\nand testosterone awakening responses of elite male judokas:\nis skeletal muscle damage a mediating factor?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In sport, the awakening responses of cortisol (CAR) and testosterone (TAR) have been used as evaluative tools. Research findings are, however, inconsistent and the mechanisms involved are unclear. This study investigated the CAR and TAR in male athletes across light and heavy training weeks, focusing on skeletal muscle damage as a mediating factor. Twenty elite male judokas were assessed across consecutive weeks of light and heavy training (i.e., 6 days, 9–10 weekly sessions). Plasma cortisol and testosterone concentrations were measured post-awakening (+3, +30, +60 mins), along with creatine kinase (CK) at +3 mins. The CAR and TAR were indexed by baseline-corrected change scores (Δb30, Δb60) and area under the curve (AUCb30, AUCb60). The early-morning surge in plasma cortisol concentration (CARΔb30, CARΔb60, CARAUCb30, CARAUCb60) was significantly larger after light versus heavy training with effect-size differences of 2.14–2.64. The post-awakening decline in plasma testosterone (TARΔb30, TARAUCb30, TARAUCb60) was found to be significantly less pronounced, whilst CK level was elevated, after heavy than light training with effect-size differences of 0.95–1.04 and 4.70, respectively. Causal mediation analysis confirmed that CK mediated, in part, the training effect on the CAR, but not TAR, measures. In summary, male judokas, upon rising after a light training block, displayed a rising CAR (36%, 22%) and declining TAR (-11%, -15%) at +30 and +60 mins. A high-intensity training block suppressed the CAR (21%, 8%) and attenuated the TAR (-7%, -13%) with accompanying muscle damage offering one mechanism to partly explain the CAR differences."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b9796","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"41","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"187-195","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","66828a87fdbe832502423d1c","66828a87fdbe832502423d1d","5e709447878c28a0473b9796"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547735c","mniswId":"2464","title":"BIOLOGY OF SPORT","issn":"0860-021X","documentHash":"09716dd9-e291-4418-858a-bdde103918e1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655f1a8c40970733106ea730","year":"2024","documentHash":"3b3db644-b6e0-4c69-9230-31b9e104b2e7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Stress","Adaptability","Recovery","Combat Sport","Physical Performance","HPG","HPA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059655367"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667eb761fdbe836b519bdaec","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Klusiewicz","documentHash":"5d39f6b2-14aa-4a0c-b66e-e4ec28ac18bb"},{"objectId":"667eb761fdbe836b519bdaeb","name":"Kim-Morgaine","lastName":"Lohse","documentHash":"a8bae446-d5d9-40be-bd85-254c557df736"},{"objectId":"667eb761fdbe836b519bdaea","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Wilk","documentHash":"44e9c505-80da-4878-8d76-0dfffd7ca001"},{"objectId":"62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"904495F361CE89397F8BA6BE829364B4B9336FBD552FEEEBE33D2EC47C2B2616CB87223567A2A4353C661F0C7E7FEDE3B8E405786D51F2E3904DAF6A613E3154","documentHash":"6d120e18-a5ed-49d4-8d7d-8a5a9dda13f8"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba57f","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Rębiś","uuid":"62454E69A88653C728FFED2FF6F96A9532AAD16CE0B60CAF6DD39EE8073C3F730A7DFA09E693D5B8AF52561DFA4E72FFC3CC12B9AAFE6D803347D4A7D05275EF","documentHash":"8fc86408-63cb-428e-bc06-3dc4b3e28543"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d01","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Sadowska","uuid":"3EB31AE3BFA9CEAFF3BD169724FC57EE4F098F67FBA0502947302210E0ED0904C26358195207F0B30E07C766B32A4AEA5905F925AA2D36907EC1361DC89A3216","orcidId":"0000-0002-9823-7991","documentHash":"e928992a-d389-432d-b5d7-09049d7fbc8c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"667eb761fdbe836b519bdae9","doi":"10.1186/s13102-024-00927-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13102-024-00927-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Influence of voluntary isocapnic hyperpnoea on recovery after high-intensity exercise in elite short-track speedskaters – randomized controlled trial","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Respiratory muscle training plays a significant role in reducing blood lactate concentration (bLa) and attenuating\nnegative physiological stress reactions.

Compared to mean-centered\nscores, a significant decline in mood and sleep quality (-0.6 to -2.0 units; -9 to -30%) emerged at all TLs, with\na delayed shift at higher loads. Elevated stress, soreness, and fatigue responses (up to 3.7 units; 76%) emerged\nwith increasing daily TLs, including a biphasic rise in stress and fatigue at higher loads. In conclusion, we gained\ndetailed insight into physical stress and the temporal sequence of well-being during an international rugby\nseries. Different daily TLs predicted adverse well-being responses (i.e., declining mood and sleep quality, rise\nin stress, soreness, fatigue) that varied in lag timing, duration, and magnitude. Explicating these associations\ncan assist weekly planning and strategies to optimize recovery, performance, and team success."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","6682827afdbe83250240f47d","6682827afdbe83250240f47e","6682827afdbe83250240f47f","6682827afdbe83250240f480"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547735c","mniswId":"2464","title":"BIOLOGY OF SPORT","issn":"0860-021X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e71f4779-0f2b-4003-9017-5575de738e5c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6682827afdbe83250240f47c","year":"2025","documentHash":"5894bb38-f7b9-4621-999e-199cb8ec1986"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Contact","Sport","Trainability","Recovery","Adaptation","Stress"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059706623"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6720de84fdbe831a48adca11","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kaminski","documentHash":"0ba2c2ab-2daa-4996-91e2-b19831848435"},{"objectId":"6720de84fdbe831a48adca10","name":"Donka","lastName":"Darpatova-Hruzewicz","documentHash":"de61ac0c-f893-40ca-ba3e-fff8f237a989"},{"objectId":"60c301889543c723365439c8","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Marek","uuid":"D99E50592F3D5C01046B10D995502F7792601BA2CB01E815B8D2D358E62F7F0A7BE0030930D0D4C05CA564F0AA463BCDB6A7800D507B246670529173AB890E7B","documentHash":"a0123c7d-a49c-4399-bf65-41ef828c9cb3"}],"objectId":"6720de84fdbe831a48adca0f","doi":"10.1123/iscj.2023-0109","publicUri":"https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/iscj/aop/article-10.1123-iscj.2023-0109/article-10.1123-iscj.2023-0109.xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"An Ecological Investigation of Polish Olympic Coaches’ Career Pathways and Their Experiences of Career Transition to Olympic Coaching Roles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Most research on coaching adopts a Western, predominantly Anglo-Saxon, vantage point. This study sought to fill the gap in the literature by providing an Eastern European perspective on transition to high-performance coaching. Ten Polish Olympic coaches were interviewed to glean insights into their career pathways, cumulatively spanning the last three decades. First, using abductive analysis, three patterns of nonlinear career pathways were identified: teacher-track, club-coach track and athlete fast-track. Next, contextual and reflective thematic analyses were employed to examine the environmental constraints affecting role transitions. Consequently, drawing on Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological model, the Ecological Model for Coach Development was proposed to offer an alternative perspective on career transitions. The findings provide evidence for the situated and relational nature of career transitions as processes occurring in nested environmental contexts. We claim that advancing knowledge on transitions requires not only zooming into coaches’ lived experiences of transitioning in/out of coaching roles, but also zooming out on macrolevel societal transformation processes, historically rooted values and belief systems, as well as mesolevel institutional constraints that steer career pathways and shape experiences. The study’s ecological orientation has the potential to enhance coaching education and practice by accounting for contextual complexity and temporality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c301889543c723365439c8"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6720de84fdbe831a48adca10","60c301889543c723365439c8","6720de84fdbe831a48adca11"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c5f2","mniswId":"9563","title":"International Sport Coaching Journal","issn":"2328-918X","eissn":"2328-9198","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0e489dae-7100-4e9d-a7dc-6a0ae8340d0e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6617a677409707791fccec3f","year":"2024","documentHash":"7cff6456-6ccb-45a7-82dc-65da4cecf241"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coach education","high performance coaching","ecological approaches","gender studies","cultural values"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059851251"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667e988dfdbe836b519a92e3","name":"Hugo","lastName":"Pereira","documentHash":"91f9be80-0df1-40e0-99a7-61fb2c62a96b"},{"objectId":"667e988dfdbe836b519a92e2","name":"António","lastName":"Palmeira","documentHash":"956249ec-5d31-4d6f-86ab-ee5f6502894d"},{"objectId":"667e988dfdbe836b519a92e1","name":"Marlene","lastName":"Silva","documentHash":"25a8adef-155a-4133-820f-0875d36f65dc"},{"objectId":"667e988dfdbe836b519a92e0","name":"Markus","lastName":"Nyström","documentHash":"0ee662d5-865c-446d-bc53-33370db773f5"},{"objectId":"667e988dfdbe836b519a92df","name":"Marcos","lastName":"López-Flores","documentHash":"c59c458c-6b8b-4e48-9cd8-a11b69e267ad"},{"objectId":"667e988dfdbe836b519a92de","name":"Paul","lastName":"Davis","documentHash":"a8f84ef3-c506-4bfb-a6c8-7a196da36692"},{"objectId":"667e988dfdbe836b519a92dc","name":"Diogo","lastName":"Teixeira","documentHash":"325c498f-ace7-4163-a80a-c9d249190f18"},{"objectId":"667e988dfdbe836b519a92db","name":"Lúcia","lastName":"Gomes","documentHash":"40360f3f-59d7-414c-9e13-3694f39b1d76"},{"objectId":"6023b26c9543c7744e88f33b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Sławińska","uuid":"10A218B6B287D547710C52EA608DC24E9103B471136A12468914242CF09A6D28AB64F1A5E6FF5ED30A6D7E77F481A5ED19C266945CB3C00EDB155232B76DA1A7","orcidId":"0000-0002-3811-4711","documentHash":"8f3b33f4-fc3d-4d62-ab26-67c651cc2082"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-06-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"667e988dfdbe836b519a92da","doi":"10.47197/retos.v56.104357","publicUri":"https://recyt.fecyt.es/index.php/retos/article/download/104357/77905","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Adolescents' Perspectives on Smartphone Applications for Physical Activity Promotion: Insights from Focus Group Discussions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: This study explores how children and adolescents perceive physical activity (PA) and PA apps.

Methods: Participants (N=39) aged 11-15 from five European countries: Netherlands (NL), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Spain (ES), and Sweden (SWE) participated in the study. They provided insight regarding Behaviour Chance Techniques (BCTs) that enhance app engagement. Results: The results offer valuable insights for creating fun and engaging adolescent PA apps that meet diverse user preferences. They also provide invaluable guidance for designing PA apps that boost adolescents' enjoyment, fun, and engagement while considering a broad spectrum of user preferences. Key BCTs identified as significantly impacting app engagement included self-monitoring, rewards, feedback, social support, action planning, and reminders - preferences and suggestions varied by gender, age, and PA levels. Conclusions: Findings in the present study inform the MOVE4FUN project that contributes to understanding how BCTs promote sustained PA in adolescents. It underscores the pivotal role of personalised app design and a supportive climate in fulfilling individual needs and intrinsic goals. These insights contribute significantly to developing educational tools that encourage regular PA and nurture the holistic development of physically educated citizens."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6023b26c9543c7744e88f33b"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"56","pagesFromTo":"85-94","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["667e988dfdbe836b519a92db","667e988dfdbe836b519a92dc","6023b26c9543c7744e88f33b","667e988dfdbe836b519a92de","667e988dfdbe836b519a92df","667e988dfdbe836b519a92e0","667e988dfdbe836b519a92e1","667e988dfdbe836b519a92e2","667e988dfdbe836b519a92e3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d0c2","mniswId":"17302","title":"Retos","issn":"1579-1726","eissn":"1988-2041","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"bbfde247-a02c-4328-9469-1827a6e71e0d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638ae3a4097076e57a72149","year":"2024","volume":"56","documentHash":"deba8eb6-b3fc-443f-ab43-7b62e8b7bdf6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Children and adolescents","Physical Activity","PA Apps","Behaviour Chance Techniques"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059989023"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"675838bbfdbe835dc1693872","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Sarnecki","documentHash":"87282876-0f39-4c78-b824-a2dbac3d6d4d"},{"objectId":"5e709448878c28a0473b9a5d","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szczepańska","uuid":"CCE6B24FFBF5490C789E272356E39650E3E0039B118A79C089B0438B4E7F68F8C939DCEED3630C1E44AD59C9EF5E5BBAE92A6CA7BC393C4B34AD355835FD0689","orcidId":"0000-0003-2406-5282","documentHash":"25d95cdc-7e7d-4a7f-837d-4edb8728be2d"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b7735","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Granda","uuid":"7482BE916BF2017DEF4B92DE14336D0D72E97B0BCDA3F067B351CE4494389C078776A3E5F812EF719E7D0D339247FFFB5439E99EFCF5508E52A1BCE772193B0C","documentHash":"6beb2e25-b473-4a3b-a476-3a8c04cf8dbe"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Malczewska-Lenczowska","uuid":"ABA9D020E597063AAD4B0492B70B9C9E9D88DF3BB588E5EAD6D1F4E426F9DA29757758128E7DD4995D35E61288491ED173C9FF8B012EF649A9AC5C95E8AF8BFC","documentHash":"f052a6c0-d07e-47e1-93d6-7e3488b6d13e"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","name":"Olga","lastName":"Surała","uuid":"1BAC89E5E464A3843B36415A03DC80AD81715FAC8BADFCC086F958B60FCF17D6898329F116E4AFF5170C0FB91C5440DFFA5F0B141DDA65322B5BCFA4BE1BA9E8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0419-9435","documentHash":"a697d3a5-686e-4b2c-8ed3-a57f3d908368"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a047394322","name":"ANNA","lastName":"PASTUSZAK","uuid":"033BC417F2CBD53DEFF4027307E3C1CC8077EAFCB89B1BAB97A389012F3EF8C4A2308E6430E9F7B2107EFDFEC511C48F916A20C9AFD34EB39AF02210A1552264","orcidId":"0000-0003-3786-4833","documentHash":"9abfb2c4-3be4-4c8c-a66e-a652fd4abb2e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"675838bbfdbe835dc1693870","doi":"10.3389/ijph.2024.1606906","publicUri":"https://www.ssph-journal.org/articles/10.3389/ijph.2024.1606906/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Energy Drink Consumption Among Physically Active Polish Adolescents: Gender and Age-Specific Public Health Issue","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives: To analyse the consumption of energy drinks (EDs) and the motives for their consumption among physically active adolescents in Poland.\n\nMethods: A nationwide survey study was conducted in 1,530 adolescents (10–14 years old) participating in extracurricular, organised sports activities.

Methods: This study included 29 untrained students (13 females) and 27 highly trained speed skaters (13 females). A maximal effort GXT was performed on a cycloergometer. The lactate-based aerobic and anaerobic thresholds, and the corresponding thresholds for muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2), were determined. Results: The power values determined for all thresholds were significantly higher in female and male speed skaters compared to male and female college students. SmO2 at anaerobic thresholds was significantly lower in female speed skaters than in female students. Both female and male skaters showed greater changes in SmO2 after the GXT compared to students. The recovery did not significantly differ between groups within gender. There was a significant positive correlation in females between the rate of muscle reoxygenation and VO2max power (r = 0.610). In speed skaters, the rate of muscle reoxygenation was not significantly higher than students and correlated positively with VO2max (r = 0.449). Conclusions: The SmO2 at the exercise thresholds, during and after maximal exercise, depends on the training status of the individual. The participants with a higher physical fitness level showed greater decreases in ΔSmO2 at the AT level, as well as after maximal exercise. SmO2 corresponding to the well-established exercise thresholds may be applied to guide training prescription.

Despite a common belief that testosterone regulates fluctuations in human sexual desire, there is little direct evidence that relates within-person changes in natural testosterone production to within-person changes in sexual desire. Here, we measured daily salivary testosterone concentrations from 41 adult men for one month, along with daily self-reports of sexual desire (n = 759 observations for the main analyses). We analysed concurrent relationships between within-person changes in testosterone and desire, and also lagged relationships that were analysed using a continuous-time modelling framework. We found no evidence for significant, positive relationships between testosterone and desire, which argues against the notion that day-to-day changes in eugonadal men’s baseline testosterone regulates changes in their sexual desire. However, additional analyses provided preliminary evidence for a positive relationship between testosterone and self-reported courtship effort, particularly on days when single participants interacted with potential romantic partners. Our findings add original evidence regarding day-to-day associations between testosterone and desire, and suggest that testosterone above minimum threshold concentrations does not increase sexual desire. We propose that the evolved functions of testosterone in human males are more closely associated with courtship efforts than with sexual desire."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"291","issue":"2035","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67583b67fdbe835dc16975eb","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","67583b67fdbe835dc16975ec","67583b67fdbe835dc16975ed","67583b67fdbe835dc16975ee","67583b67fdbe835dc16975ef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793ab","mniswId":"16564","title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B-Biological Sciences","issn":"0962-8452","eissn":"1471-2954","documentHash":"006b9990-6407-44b2-8639-2b545bdba415"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67583b67fdbe835dc16975ea","year":"2024","volume":"291","number":"2035","documentHash":"99e780dc-3f12-4ae1-a2c2-2a9688320671"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["testosterone","sexual desire","courtship","human mating"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060044387"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67583dfefdbe835dc169bc01","name":"Christian J.","lastName":"Cook","documentHash":"f8ce1f84-8038-4f98-b5fd-ec8976d7d5ce"},{"objectId":"67583dfefdbe835dc169bc00","name":"Phillip J.","lastName":"Fourie","documentHash":"5b90d785-801a-483d-a9e6-7e132fad4b3e"},{"objectId":"67583dfefdbe835dc169bbff","name":"Benjamin G.","lastName":"Serpell","documentHash":"04012b8b-0ea2-4309-b8c0-55fbcbfb8683"},{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","name":"Blair","lastName":"Crewther","uuid":"1B92721CD363D94CBA2DE83FE05638C7242F8FA781AD75AFE48220A8E21C71B11E2F98DC4C6A961F163AB35261CBE4A8CF98127F5064E33EEFAE9D0981310983","documentHash":"f3437f39-7c71-4805-871c-40f74ee9d44b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67583dfefdbe835dc169bbfd","doi":"10.1007/s40750-024-00245-2","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40750-024-00245-2.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Fluctuations in Cortisol and Testosterone Map to Fluctuations in Opinion Strength in Healthy Men","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\n\nOpinions are often linked to emotions and stress. It is well established that testosterone and cortisol are useful biomarkers of stress and can predict human emotion and behavior. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to explore whether changes in testosterone and cortisol concentration map to shifts in opinions.\nMethods\n\nWe present three studies with healthy men, where we (1) monitored diurnal changes in testosterone and cortisol alongside political opinion change using a descriptive longitudinal design, (2) assessed testosterone, cortisol and political opinion change in an experimental trial using a physical exercise intervention designed to decrease cortisol concentration and/or increase testosterone concentration, and (3) monitored testosterone and cortisol change with political opinion in a trial with psychosocial intervention designed to increase cortisol concentration/decrease testosterone concentration.\nResults\n\nTestosterone concentration and opinion changes were observed across the day (p < 0.05). Furthermore, opinions changed similarly to exercise-induced increases in testosterone (8.6–11.5%), but inversely to exercise-induced reductions in cortisol (p < 0.05). Opinion changes also occurred in similar fashion to testosterone changes following psychosocial intervention (-5.6% to -10.0%), and inversely to cortisol changes (p < 0.05). Finally, opinion change and testosterone change correlated at the within person level (r = 0.17 to 0.33; p < 0.05).\nConclusion\n\nWe showed natural fluctuations in testosterone and cortisol covaried in parallel with shifts in opinion. Further, given the emergence of relationships for opinion change with hormone change, we contend that physiological stress response (i.e., testosterone and cortisol change) may predict, or even cause, opinion change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"3-4","pagesFromTo":"247-264","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67583dfefdbe835dc169bbff","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","67583dfefdbe835dc169bc00","67583dfefdbe835dc169bc01"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b840","mniswId":"381","title":"Adaptive Human Behavior and Physiology","issn":"2198-7335","eissn":"2198-7335","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"55ad5773-3aea-448b-855d-5b59980d7f97"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67583dfefdbe835dc169bbfe","year":"2024","volume":"10","number":"3-4","documentHash":"bb2588cb-7bd3-404a-927e-19827bece700"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Testosterone","Cortisol","Bias","Decision-making"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060044761"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67594401fdbe83757db01c0c","name":"Michał","lastName":"Starczewski","documentHash":"353a3bdb-ab51-4852-84ae-0d1207c86b33"},{"objectId":"67594401fdbe83757db01c0b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Klusiewicz","documentHash":"45f59b79-4993-48e2-a411-55874c933e84"},{"objectId":"65b9beba40e3ff5bc1138d90","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":"2006F99FC4BDE7E7D60C7E53A87501417014A806E32A80C62493DD43B0AB103966924CD4F325475774107E39EF189292C6CAA37516201B2B4F5F5352EC946E9D","documentHash":"475ebf04-bf64-4ac0-8c4f-bc01b95d4525"},{"objectId":"62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"904495F361CE89397F8BA6BE829364B4B9336FBD552FEEEBE33D2EC47C2B2616CB87223567A2A4353C661F0C7E7FEDE3B8E405786D51F2E3904DAF6A613E3154","documentHash":"6d120e18-a5ed-49d4-8d7d-8a5a9dda13f8"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba57f","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Rębiś","uuid":"62454E69A88653C728FFED2FF6F96A9532AAD16CE0B60CAF6DD39EE8073C3F730A7DFA09E693D5B8AF52561DFA4E72FFC3CC12B9AAFE6D803347D4A7D05275EF","documentHash":"8fc86408-63cb-428e-bc06-3dc4b3e28543"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67594401fdbe83757db01c0a","doi":"10.3390/life14091159","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/14/9/1159/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Comparative Study of Different Respiratory Muscle Training Methods: Effects on Cardiopulmonary Indices and Athletic Performance in Elite Short-Track Speedskaters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Respiratory muscle training (RMT) improves endurance performance, balance, and ability to repeat high-intensity exercise bouts, providing a rationale to be applied in short-track speedskating. To establish a preferable RMT method for short-track speedskating, the influence of inspiratory pressure threshold loading (IPTL) and voluntary isocapnic hyperpnoea (VIH) on cardiopulmonary indices and athletic performance was investigated. Sixteen elite short-track speedskaters completed 6 weeks of RMT based on IPTL or VIH. Wingate Anaerobic Tests (WAnTs), cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs), spirometry assessments, and on-ice time trials were performed before and after RMT intervention. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to assess the differences between each method’s influence. No statistically significant (p > 0.05) differences between RMT methods were found in performance during the WAnT, CPET, or specific on-ice time trials. Spirometry measures were similar between both methods. Significant effects were found for the interaction between maximum breathing frequency during CPET (BFmax) and method (p = 0.009), as well as for the interaction between BFMax, method, and sex (p = 0.040). BFmax decreased for IPTL and increased for VIH. The interaction between method and sex revealed that BFmax increased only in males performing VIH.

A common method of determining this ability is the Wingate test, but surprisingly, normative data necessary to objectively assessthe performance ofspeed skatersislacking. Therefore, the present study aimed to develop reference levels for peak power (PP) and mean power (MP) on a Wingate\u0002type test for speed skaters using a Monark 874E ergometer with a load equivalent to 7.5% of body mass. Over 15 years, 635 test results were collected from 120 junior and senior athletes (all national representatives); 380 from men and 255 from women. We found that in men and women, personal best in relative PP and MP (W/kg body mass) correlated significantly (all p < 0.001) with altitude-adjusted times over distances of 500 (r = -0.75 to -0.82) and 1000 m (r = -0.67 to -0.71), thus confirming the validity of this test for assessing the on-ice sprinting ability of speed skaters. Moreover, the two-way ANOVA models revealed significant effects of gender (p < 0.001) and age (p < 0.001) on relative MP and PP (W/kg) values, but the interaction effect was not significant (p > 0.05). The 7-stage classification system constructed on the basis of the obtained results enables the assessment of relative MP and PP in Wingate tests, taking into account the age category and gender of the athletes. This system can be used by sports researchers and coaches to assess the sprinting ability of speed skaters from novice to world-class levels."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","67581afbfdbe835dc165c0c3","67581afbfdbe835dc165c0c4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547735c","mniswId":"2464","title":"BIOLOGY OF SPORT","issn":"0860-021X","documentHash":"09716dd9-e291-4418-858a-bdde103918e1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6682827afdbe83250240f47c","year":"2025","documentHash":"5894bb38-f7b9-4621-999e-199cb8ec1986"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Anaerobic capacity","Wingate test","Sprinting ability","Laboratory testing","High-level athletes","Age and gender differences"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060055333"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67595caafdbe83757db1bdf1","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Klusiewicz","documentHash":"70aa3372-5d5e-4553-ac00-12e3cf61f60d"},{"objectId":"62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"904495F361CE89397F8BA6BE829364B4B9336FBD552FEEEBE33D2EC47C2B2616CB87223567A2A4353C661F0C7E7FEDE3B8E405786D51F2E3904DAF6A613E3154","documentHash":"6d120e18-a5ed-49d4-8d7d-8a5a9dda13f8"},{"objectId":"602e470a9543c7410626f009","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Waleriańczyk","uuid":"8E0AA3503EE9FC3197CDB9DF56820A639148F97C31A81C0C08DE9C4820DA3263015312D5E2B1552230266EA608776268F20C373A1E2506BE65E08635FA38CA25","documentHash":"d88b87c8-006a-4bcb-86d1-99ec4a0da5da"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b9796","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Obmiński","uuid":"069777A5D335D17B200D969B274FB0D8A15AFAD2BF9338D11C75619E33591EFAF899F813463D849AED07A39E3E65A55D6877C3FB9E67C9123B39E272377EBDA2","documentHash":"e401102a-8c76-47d6-8c2f-62384c794899"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67595caafdbe83757db1bdf0","doi":"10.1016/j.resp.2024.104353","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1569904824001460?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The acute effect of respiratory muscle training on cortisol, testosterone, and testosterone-to-cortisol ratio in well-trained triathletes - exploratory study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study investigated acute changes in cortisol (C) and testosterone (T) associated with a popular RMT method, voluntary isocapnic hyperpnoea (VIH), in well-trained triathletes. 19 athletes (7 females, 12 males) performed a VIH training session with pre- and post- serum C and T measurements. Repeated measures ANOVA was employed to analyze hormone changes during VIH, with additional time-sex interaction. Pearson correlation coefficient has been computed to identify the relationship between hormonal changes and age, anthropometric indices, respiratory muscle strength, and training experience. There was a statistically significant effect for C changes (F = 13.101, p = 0.002, ηp2 = 0.421, ω2 = 0.08). The C concentration was significantly lower after VIH (Mean Difference = −32.49 ± 39.13 nmol*L−1). No significant effects for T, T/C ratio, and time-sex interactions were observed (p > 0.05). Amongst many, significant correlations between the percentage of body fat and changes in C (r=-0.464, p=0.045), body mass and changes in T (r=0.516, p=0.024), height and changes in T (r=0.509, p=0.026) were found. VIH significantly lowered C concentration. No significant effects for T, T/C ratio, and no between-sex differences were observed. Noteworthy individual variability was observed in all the monitored indices. Significant correlations were found between acute hormone changes associated with VIH and selected anthropometric indices.

Methodological limitations also exist (e.g., cross-sectional sampling) with little knowledge of acute hormone responses and hormone-psychological interactions that regulate training outputs. These issues were addressed in a 12-week training study on highly-trained swimmers. Eighteen swimmers (10 males, 8 females) completed a 12 week training programme, involving a stepwise reduction in TL before a major competition. Testing was conducted from Monday–Friday at week one (T1), week five (T2), and week 12 (T3), including measures of salivary testosterone and cortisol, willingness to train, stress, and sleep quality. Post-session hormones were assessed on Mondays and Fridays. Daily-averaged swimming distance decreased by -21% (T2) and -57% (T3), relative to T1 (p < 0.001). We found no significant training effect on the cortisol and testosterone measures, both baseline and acute exercise response, willingness to train, and sleep quality. Only stress varied with training, decreasing significantly at T2 and T3 from T1 in female swimmers. Among male swimmers, daily changes in baseline cortisol and testosterone were related (r = 0.45) at T1, as was sleep quality and stress (r = 0.39) at T3. In summary, highly-trained swimmers showed little or no adaptive changes prior to a major competition. The one exception was self reported stress among female swimmers, which decreased along with TL. The emergence of daily interrelationships (in male swimmers only) between selected hormonal or psychological outputs could provide a new lens to assess pre-training preparation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709494878c28a0473bfcdd","5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"42","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"279-287","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b","5e709494878c28a0473bfcdd","67c6eadafdbe83570425637e","67c6eadafdbe83570425637f","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547735c","mniswId":"2464","title":"BIOLOGY OF SPORT","issn":"0860-021X","documentHash":"09716dd9-e291-4418-858a-bdde103918e1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6682827afdbe83250240f47c","year":"2025","documentHash":"5894bb38-f7b9-4621-999e-199cb8ec1986"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Recovery","Endocrinology","Anxiety","Overtraining","Tapering"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060600640"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67594088fdbe83757dafd65f","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Śliż","documentHash":"bdcebb38-0a99-40d3-a74a-0a6692b717a7"},{"objectId":"67594088fdbe83757dafd65e","name":"Artur","lastName":"Mamcarz","documentHash":"b55c76a0-2c80-4f2b-ad58-638740beb4ca"},{"objectId":"67594088fdbe83757dafd65c","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ładyga","documentHash":"f64e655b-e3d0-45b0-8832-67411bfe0f51"},{"objectId":"67594088fdbe83757dafd65b","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Zdanowicz","documentHash":"d888f617-4c41-4a85-b854-f8b664710e8f"},{"objectId":"67594088fdbe83757dafd65a","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Klusiewicz","documentHash":"69d72433-8aed-4c5c-98e0-3966fb59aef6"},{"objectId":"67594088fdbe83757dafd659","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kasiak","documentHash":"94aeeada-de2a-41a3-bd1b-717ce6d9f18c"},{"objectId":"62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"904495F361CE89397F8BA6BE829364B4B9336FBD552FEEEBE33D2EC47C2B2616CB87223567A2A4353C661F0C7E7FEDE3B8E405786D51F2E3904DAF6A613E3154","documentHash":"6d120e18-a5ed-49d4-8d7d-8a5a9dda13f8"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8fb9","name":"Szczepan","lastName":"Wiecha","uuid":"D4A8357A63A162230C610EB816A8C530B0D9037D0BE5AAE81B2CFB7151793D989E5C47D3DE0B6C7E57CACC0F688017244F6523678FF8111F173B74D3EAD64BF5","documentHash":"f36b0bb8-3b4b-41a5-8f3c-16cfd7ba497c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67594088fdbe83757dafd658","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-73730-z","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-73730-z.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Recalibrated FRIEND equation for peak oxygen pulse is accurate in endurance athletes: the NOODLE study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Peak oxygen pulse (O2Ppeak) is an important index of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF).

The updated equation was 1.36 + 1.07 (23.2 · 0.09 · age − 6.6 [if female]). The new equation explained 62% of the variance and significantly predicted O2Ppeak (R2 = 0.62, β = 0.78, P < .001). The error of the EA-adjusted model was 0.1 ± 2.9 mL beat−1 (P = .82) and 0.2 ± 2.1 mL beat−1 (P = .65) for males and females respectively. Recalibration of the original FRIEND equation significantly enhances its accuracy among EA. The error of the EA-adjusted model was negligible. A new recalibrated equation should be used to predict O2Ppeak in the population of EA."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","uid":"bXACR4AS_DViRybrT_ocXzA","uuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","name":"Państwowy Instytut Medyczny Ministerstwa Spraw Wewnętrznych i Administracji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709368878c28a0473a8fb9"],"parentId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","parentUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","rootId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","rootUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67594088fdbe83757dafd659","62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","67594088fdbe83757dafd65a","67594088fdbe83757dafd65b","67594088fdbe83757dafd65c","5e709368878c28a0473a8fb9","67594088fdbe83757dafd65e","67594088fdbe83757dafd65f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Peak oxygen pulse","Endurance athletes","Cardiopulmonary exercise test","Cardiorespiratory fitness","Reference values","O2pulse"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060665778"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b9796","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Obmiński","uuid":"069777A5D335D17B200D969B274FB0D8A15AFAD2BF9338D11C75619E33591EFAF899F813463D849AED07A39E3E65A55D6877C3FB9E67C9123B39E272377EBDA2","documentHash":"e401102a-8c76-47d6-8c2f-62384c794899"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aec61","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"KONIECZNY","uuid":"C35F4C3350597CE04E0E5EA38741B7F169516D23BCD6E8DB9482F3462A7F92F601738EAA8B7F458CE2D599A329137721A6241D52EBFE774681E755CFB248ADA2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7995-0882","documentHash":"8db289af-c046-4b0f-8da2-6927f1316173"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fde","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Błach","uuid":"E59939A4DFE964A04AE7306109D198DF8F108C690DC2EC1207B1A0CDC649ED8813F5452B09B1B50148E1680494558887854E0532EE4345C518F0F3DD6056604E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3559-9151","documentHash":"e73a49a4-b415-45d5-bb96-e629cc99a8c1"},{"objectId":"5e709223878c28a047390701","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"BORYSIUK","uuid":"F5EF6AA9E3CD6D722C451114CDCA1E2233F2BC90092C4A634D3586773068CBE1E51C3AF2730EA114DFCB45D68E40806EDD9049BF8E9C15AA196AD797188E756E","documentHash":"9c36bdb0-bb94-4d18-b138-24bfbad6db6c"},{"objectId":"5e70920d878c28a04738f2e3","name":"MONIKA","lastName":"BŁASZCZYSZYN","uuid":"508A89AD76B83694D14AEC762CE1407C1F83B67129D3A58B97AD746888519A421B04BA99DD84510445626899476722AD618AF7E8E3F4926402BD8B36E435F9FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1723-4001","documentHash":"a8f2b018-2403-4757-a156-f2b82b4ae8cb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"662f52444097076263de1c5f","doi":"10.3389/fspor.2024.1387013","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2024.1387013/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The phenomenon of anticipation in fencing.

The analysis focused on the correlations between three phases of a fencing technical action in the context of factors of temporal anticipation.\r\n\r\nMethods: Six female épée fencers from the Polish National Fencing Team participated in the study. The research tools included electromyography (EMG), ground reaction force (GRF) platforms, and the OptiTrack motion capture system. The fencers performed the lunge three times in response to visual cues from the coach. By integrating the testing system, the EMG signal indices of the fencers' upper and lower limbs and the vertical force values of the fencers' front and rear leg muscles were obtained simultaneously.\r\n\r\nResults: The results of the study demonstrated the key role of five muscles: BICEPS BRACHII, LAT TRICEPS, EXTCARP RAD, BICEPS FEMORIS and MED GAS in influencing the speed of lunge execution. In addition, a significant correlation was found between the EMG signal of the gastrocnemius muscle of the rear leg and the movement time (MT) phase of the lunge execution.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: The anticipatory activation of the EMG signal in relation to the vertical force waveforms generated by the ground forces response platform in the 15–30 ms interval was demonstrated. Finally, the importance of the preparatory period for the effectiveness of the fencing lunge was highlighted based on the phenomenon of anticipation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709223878c28a047390701","5e70920d878c28a04738f2e3","5e7093ab878c28a0473aec61"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b9796"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","pagesFromTo":"art. 1387013, s.  1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709223878c28a047390701","5e7093ab878c28a0473aec61","5e70920d878c28a04738f2e3","5e709265878c28a047394fde","5e709447878c28a0473b9796"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb7ad","mniswId":"29982","title":"Frontiers in Sports and Active Living","eissn":"2624-9367","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8ae17ea8-262f-4274-97a6-6d0e7b22b187"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["preparatory period","reaction time","movement time","electromyography","ground reaction forces"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060721967"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c6d5befdbe835704239296","name":"Pascal","lastName":"Kintz","documentHash":"dd61b1ad-ec14-458e-b660-2123aa50f3ff"},{"objectId":"67c6d5befdbe835704239295","name":"Laurie","lastName":"Gheddar","documentHash":"6169fb19-3522-417a-9927-5f685d1c8b24"},{"objectId":"67c6d5befdbe835704239294","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pokrywka","documentHash":"195fb4d6-5bea-4f9b-aedc-9bde6af2a742"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Sitkowski","uuid":"CA8381D5763FD93B46A4D4F27D5BF0B5171809C2441CE33160E53F7F1E5CF1567242ADAA256E6AFE1A33611FDFE3D56290402A31516AE9D89934241D34DFAF7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7144-8182","documentHash":"5d5d2256-58ee-4dee-a1cc-4b2def5e5b2f"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","name":"Olga","lastName":"Surała","uuid":"1BAC89E5E464A3843B36415A03DC80AD81715FAC8BADFCC086F958B60FCF17D6898329F116E4AFF5170C0FB91C5440DFFA5F0B141DDA65322B5BCFA4BE1BA9E8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0419-9435","documentHash":"a697d3a5-686e-4b2c-8ed3-a57f3d908368"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67c6d5befdbe835704239293","doi":"10.3389/fspor.2024.1480373","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2024.1480373/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Case Report: A case study of positive doping control by animal-to-human drug transfer after an athlete administered medicine in spray format, containing clostebol acetate, to a pet dog","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The presence of a doping substance in an athlete's biological sample may not be only related to intentional pharmacological support. The unintended use of a prohibited substance may be due various reasons. This paper describes the case of a Polish canoeist preparing for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris who presented a positive doping test result, as a consequence of administering medication to her injured dog. The athlete used a Trofodermin cutaneous spray (containing clostebol acetate) for pet treatment, which resulted in human transfer during close contact and subsequent detection by doping authorities. To bolster the athlete's defense, it was essential to substantiate the scenario of an unconscious violation of anti-doping rules with scientific evidence. Hence, the decision was made to analyze and compare samples of the athlete's hair and her dog's fur. This investigation confirmed that clostebol absorption occurred through the skin of the hands, transfer during sleeping with the dog on the same bedding and/or inhalation (during the application of the medication, which was dispensed to the animal's paws). This defense was accepted by the Court of Arbitration for the Sport Anti-Doping Division, which subsequently found that the athlete committed an anti-doping rule violation, but under circumstances that amounted to a “no fault” scenario."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","5e709386878c28a0473abf3f"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c6d5befdbe835704239294","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","67c6d5befdbe835704239295","67c6d5befdbe835704239296"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61a75ac72467f03711dcdf76","title":"Frontiers in Sports and Active Living","eissn":"2624-9367","websiteLink":"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sports-and-active-living","documentHash":"15eaa046-e553-4e3a-87f6-4bae0e7f97d7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665ee8da4097073a823fef49","year":"2024","volume":"6","documentHash":"467d16d0-24c1-4b40-896e-59dc1a7b5e68"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["adverse analytical finding","nonintentional doping","clostebol","hair analysis","contamination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060777680"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6720c99efdbe831a48abe859","name":"Raphael","lastName":"Faiss","documentHash":"cabae5bc-8da4-420c-a818-9184a9684d0a"},{"objectId":"6720c99efdbe831a48abe858","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Żmijewski","documentHash":"0d4d961d-19d4-4f10-a4e2-50518a43bca0"},{"objectId":"6720c99efdbe831a48abe857","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pokrywka","documentHash":"5a0c6a31-7cd1-42a1-8931-a56b2c30573b"},{"objectId":"6720c99efdbe831a48abe856","name":"Michał","lastName":"Starczewski","documentHash":"0fdf906c-51eb-453e-a21b-61d14e2f2c39"},{"objectId":"6720c99efdbe831a48abe855","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Zdanowicz","documentHash":"f941eeca-16fd-421c-8cd8-4dd982f2ec37"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Malczewska-Lenczowska","uuid":"ABA9D020E597063AAD4B0492B70B9C9E9D88DF3BB588E5EAD6D1F4E426F9DA29757758128E7DD4995D35E61288491ED173C9FF8B012EF649A9AC5C95E8AF8BFC","documentHash":"f052a6c0-d07e-47e1-93d6-7e3488b6d13e"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4951","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Sitkowski","uuid":"CA8381D5763FD93B46A4D4F27D5BF0B5171809C2441CE33160E53F7F1E5CF1567242ADAA256E6AFE1A33611FDFE3D56290402A31516AE9D89934241D34DFAF7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7144-8182","documentHash":"5d5d2256-58ee-4dee-a1cc-4b2def5e5b2f"}],"objectId":"6720c99efdbe831a48abe853","doi":"10.1123/ijspp.2023-0205","publicUri":"https://journals.humankinetics.com/view/journals/ijspp/19/9/article-p890.xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Predicting Future Athletic Performance in Young Female Road Cyclists Based on Aerobic Fitness and Hematological Variables","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: This study aimed to determine whether the initial levels of aerobic fitness and hematological variables in young female road cyclists are related to their athletic performance development during their careers. Methods: Results of graded exercise tests on a cycle ergometer and total hemoglobin mass (tHb-mass) measurements were analyzed in 34 female road cyclists (age 18.6 [1.9] y). Among them, 2 groups were distinguished based on their competitive performance (Union Cycliste Internationale world ranking) over the following 8 years. Areas under the curve in receiver-operating-characteristic curves were calculated as indicators of elite-performance prediction. Results: Initial graded exercise test variables (peak power, peak oxygen uptake, and power at 4 mmol/L blood lactate) were not significantly different in elite (n = 13) versus nonelite (n = 21) riders. In contrast, elite riders had higher tHb-mass expressed either in absolute measures (664 [75] vs 596 [59] g, P = .006) or normalized to body mass (11.2 [0.8] vs 10.3 [0.7] g/kg, P = .001) and fat-free mass (14.4 [0.9] vs 13.1 [0.9] g/kg, P < .001). Absolute and relative erythrocyte volumes were significantly higher in elite subjects (P ranged from < .001 to .006). Of all the variables analyzed, the relative tHb-mass had the highest predictive ability to reach the elite level (area under the curve ranged from .82 to .85). Conclusion: Measurement of tHb-mass can be a helpful tool in talent detection to identify young female road cyclists with the potential to reach the elite level in the future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu -

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of SMHAT-1 supplemented by a brief, in-person clinical intake interview in evaluating the prevalence of mental health concerns in elite athletes.Methods Sections 1 and 2 from SMHAT-1 were administered in person during the routine biannual medical check-up for Olympic athletes at the National Centre for Sports Medicine in Poland. Immediately after completing the measures, all athletes were interviewed by qualified psychologists who evaluated their mental health and provided recommendations.Results A total of 1121 elite athletes (545 female, 576 male) aged 18-53 (M=24.39, SD=5.09) were evaluated 2-8 months before the 2024 Paris Olympic Games; 72.4% scored above the triage threshold and 51% were positively screened in SMHAT-1's section 2. Based on the subsequent mental health evaluation, only 9.5% showed signs of persistent mental health concerns and required referral to a mental health specialist. In 24.2%, their distress levels/symptoms were assessed as occasional and normal in relation to demands, and they underwent a psychoeducational intervention or were advised to consult a sports psychologist. Female athletes scored significantly higher in most questionnaires.Conclusion SMHAT-1 proved a useful addition to the routine medical check-ups for elite athletes. Extending SMHAT-1 with a brief clinical intake interview substantially elevated the efficacy of the mental health evaluation, with an additional benefit of raising mental health literacy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6023b26c9543c7744e88f33b","5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","602e470a9543c7410626f009"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Special attention is devoted here to the coach training and development system in Poland. The paper aims to indicate the need for strong support for both informal coach education and the important role of coach developers in professional coach development in Poland and worldwide. Methods: We performed an analysis of secondary data on the system of sports training and continued professional development in Poland. Primary research data on Polish Olympic and Paralympic national team coaches (13 sports), their qualifications, competencies, and views on their continued professional development were also used. The study covered 103 coaches in Olympic or Paralympic sports. The national team coaches surveyed also conducted a self-assessment of their professional development needs, opportunities, and challenges. The method of balance of competencies based on data documenting the stock of knowledge, experience, and social competencies acquired in the learning process of the surveyed coaches was applied. Results: It was found that after completing their formal education, the coaches declared participation in various types of continuous professional development courses and training, while the most valued forms of continued professional development included informal learning, and sharing experiences and good practices with other coaches. Conclusions: The data supports the need to educate more sport coach developers and introduce them to the professional coach development system to guide coaches and facilitate their knowledge and competence acquisition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c301889543c723365439c8"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"107","pagesFromTo":"31-39","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c301889543c723365439c8","675841dafdbe835dc16a0cdc","675841dafdbe835dc16a0cdd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"643559824097074edd61975c","title":"Journal of Kinesiology and Exercise Sciences","issn":"2956-4581","websiteLink":"https://jkes.eu/","documentHash":"a93ccaff-c5ca-42de-b019-167b92212bcd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"675841dafdbe835dc16a0cdb","year":"2024","volume":"34","number":"107","documentHash":"f53e710a-d60a-417d-9f00-676ac4ab4c84"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sport coach development","coach education","continuous professional development","informal learning","sport coaching","paralympic sport"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060828901"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667eabb4fdbe836b519b8ba1","name":"Szczepan","lastName":"WIECHA","documentHash":"431d7ac0-c079-4b22-9987-ca8e7f890bf8"},{"objectId":"62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"904495F361CE89397F8BA6BE829364B4B9336FBD552FEEEBE33D2EC47C2B2616CB87223567A2A4353C661F0C7E7FEDE3B8E405786D51F2E3904DAF6A613E3154","documentHash":"6d120e18-a5ed-49d4-8d7d-8a5a9dda13f8"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d01","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Sadowska","uuid":"3EB31AE3BFA9CEAFF3BD169724FC57EE4F098F67FBA0502947302210E0ED0904C26358195207F0B30E07C766B32A4AEA5905F925AA2D36907EC1361DC89A3216","orcidId":"0000-0002-9823-7991","documentHash":"e928992a-d389-432d-b5d7-09049d7fbc8c"}],"objectId":"667eabb4fdbe836b519b8b9f","doi":"10.23736/s0022-4707.24.15921-x","publicUri":"https://www.minervamedica.it/pdf.php?cod=R40Y9999N00A24061806","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Differences between indoor and outdoor field cycling tests in triathletes are associated with training environment history and BMI: analysis and prediction formula","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Patients underwent cyclists and triathletes test, train, and race both indoors and outdoors. However, the differences between indoor and outdoor performance remain understudied. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between indoor and outdoor performance in cycling. We investigated the influence of training environment history (indoor vs. outdoor) and application of e-sport platform on the aforementioned relationship.\nMETHODS: Forty-three well-trained triathletes performed indoor and outdoor field tests to establish maximum sprint power (MSP) and functional threshold power (FTP). The main effects for FTP and MSP were assessed by repeated-measures ANOVA to analyze the differences between power output obtained indoors and outdoors. Multiple covariates, including training environment history and application of ZWIFT e-sport platform, were applied. Multiple linear regression was performed to investigate outdoor FTP prediction based on indoor testing.\nRESULTS: No significant differences were found for MSP and FTP obtained indoors and outdoors. However, the high individual variability in the disparity between indoor and outdoor power output (PO) in triathletes was observed. There was a statistically significant interaction between FTP and training environment history (P<0.001 for FTP expressed in W*kg-1 and W) and FTP and BMI (P=0.042 and P=0.034 for FTP expressed in W*kg-1 and W, respectively). The prediction formulas to establish outdoor FTP based on indoor testing had high accuracy (R2 0.80 and 0.68 for full and simple model, respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: The study underlines the crucial role of the appropriate testing environment, corresponding to the training environment and racing demands. A high individual variability in the disparity between indoor and outdoor PO at FTP are associated with training environment history and BMI.

Prolonged experience of stress can have adverse effects on overall cognitive and physical well-being, making the routine monitoring of everyday stress highly desired for the delivery of personalised health management solutions. Saliva, as a diagnostic fluid, has garnered considerable attention in this regard due to its non-invasiveness, ease of collection and high compliance among diverse populations. Salivary biomarkers, including cortisol, salivary α-amylase, chromogranin A, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and immunoglobulin A, are responsive to acute and/or chronic stressors, and thus, are prerequisite biomarkers in stress-related research. A number of sensing technologies are available for stress biomarker monitoring in saliva and other fluids. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, colorimetric techniques, surface plasmon resonance sensing, and molecular imprinted polymers offer sensitive and selective cortisol detection in saliva. The integration of aptamers with electrochemiluminescence biosensing provides a label-free and cost-effective approach to biomarker detection. Wearable sensors that couple on-body sampling with edge computing for real time analytics open up new avenues for ambulatory monitoring and predictive diagnostics. The development of sensitive and reliable, saliva-based biosensing technologies in form of smart dentures and braces, holds the potential to revolutionize stress research with potential to provide personalized stress management solutions for health management in the future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6682877bfdbe83250241ab75","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","6682877bfdbe83250241ab76","6682877bfdbe83250241ab77","6682877bfdbe83250241ab78"]},"journal":{"objectId":"6001c7f32467f05967b56312","title":"Materials Advances","eissn":"2633-5409","websiteLink":"https://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/materials-advances/","documentHash":"ac8abde2-5cbe-48c3-9179-414a8f796941"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6682877bfdbe83250241ab74","year":"2024","documentHash":"2f3b7481-3c63-4066-a458-e6eca11d64ba"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654962058"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67595686fdbe83757db14ffb","name":"Szczepan","lastName":"Wiecha","documentHash":"4432a0e6-0035-4a34-8a41-c07a6fb0f735"},{"objectId":"67595686fdbe83757db14ffa","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Pawliczek","documentHash":"330adafa-958b-4d9d-95c3-8851b6f67cca"},{"objectId":"67595686fdbe83757db14ff9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Klusiewicz","documentHash":"76fab323-d0bd-4510-a14a-0e8caa6427ed"},{"objectId":"65b9beba40e3ff5bc1138d90","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":"2006F99FC4BDE7E7D60C7E53A87501417014A806E32A80C62493DD43B0AB103966924CD4F325475774107E39EF189292C6CAA37516201B2B4F5F5352EC946E9D","documentHash":"475ebf04-bf64-4ac0-8c4f-bc01b95d4525"},{"objectId":"62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"904495F361CE89397F8BA6BE829364B4B9336FBD552FEEEBE33D2EC47C2B2616CB87223567A2A4353C661F0C7E7FEDE3B8E405786D51F2E3904DAF6A613E3154","documentHash":"6d120e18-a5ed-49d4-8d7d-8a5a9dda13f8"},{"objectId":"5e709448878c28a0473b9a5d","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szczepańska","uuid":"CCE6B24FFBF5490C789E272356E39650E3E0039B118A79C089B0438B4E7F68F8C939DCEED3630C1E44AD59C9EF5E5BBAE92A6CA7BC393C4B34AD355835FD0689","orcidId":"0000-0003-2406-5282","documentHash":"25d95cdc-7e7d-4a7f-837d-4edb8728be2d"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Malczewska-Lenczowska","uuid":"ABA9D020E597063AAD4B0492B70B9C9E9D88DF3BB588E5EAD6D1F4E426F9DA29757758128E7DD4995D35E61288491ED173C9FF8B012EF649A9AC5C95E8AF8BFC","documentHash":"f052a6c0-d07e-47e1-93d6-7e3488b6d13e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67595686fdbe83757db14ff7","doi":"10.1113/ep091938","publicUri":"https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1113/EP091938","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Reference values for respiratory muscle strength measured with the S‐Index Test in well‐trained athletes, e‐sports athletes and age‐matched controls","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Respiratory function assessment is crucial in optimizing athletic performance, safeguarding respiratory health, and ensuring athletes can perform at their peak potential while minimizing the risk of respiratory-related issues. The S-Index Test is a dynamic evaluation of respiratory muscle strength. However, no comprehensive reference values regarding the S-Index Test have been reported yet. A total of 597 participants performed the S-Index Test. They were either well-trained athletes (WTA), or e-sports athletes (ESA), or age-matched controls (AMC) groups. The differences in S-Index Test results between sexes and for group–sex, and performance calibre tier–sex interactions were examined. The relationships between S-Index Test results and age, anthropometric indices and training experience were assessed. Reference values for all the groups were provided. Amongst athletes, the highest values were observed in swimmers and rowers, and the lowest in figure skaters and runners. The S-Index Test results were different for the group–sex interaction (P = 0.004, 151.6 ± 29.0 cmH2O for WTA males and 109.8 ± 21.6 cmH2O for WTA females, 136.7 ± 28.0 cmH2O for ESA males and 101.8 ± 22.0 cmH2O for ESA females, 128.7 ± 28.8 cmH2O for AMC males and 70.3 ± 24.7 cmH2O for AMC females) and higher in males than females (P < 0.001, 145.1 ± 30.5 cmH2O for males and 100.8 ± 27.6 cmH2O for females). The higher athletic level, presented as performance calibre tier, was not linked to higher respiratory muscle strength in the WTA group (P = 0.094). However, the Bonferroni correction revealed that except for the singular tier in females, there was a significant effect for all the other tiers and sexes (P < 0.001). The obtained results confirm that regardless of the level of physical activity, the anthropometric features are positively linked with respiratory muscle strength. Furthermore, age and training experience were positively correlated with the S-Index Test results in the WTA group."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709448878c28a0473b9a5d","65b9beba40e3ff5bc1138d90","62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62bd0aa8752340195a3b3f69","65b9beba40e3ff5bc1138d90","67595686fdbe83757db14ff9","67595686fdbe83757db14ffa","67595686fdbe83757db14ffb","5e709448878c28a0473b9a5d","5e709410878c28a0473b5a2b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c6c","mniswId":"6428","title":"EXPERIMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY","issn":"0958-0670","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a6920af3-86bb-40cf-a03e-54ea7856028d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67595686fdbe83757db14ff8","year":"2024","documentHash":"8afdc521-16f9-4941-91a0-15fcf627bbf4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["powerbreathe","respiratory muscle strength","S-Index Test"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655045698"}]
