The second objective was to assess a potential differences in force-velocity profiles between players from higher and lower sport skill level.\nMaterials and methods: Sixty-six female soccer players (age = 23.1 ± 5.1 years) performed a 30-m sprint to assess sprint performance and mechanical variables. Speed was measured by radar technology for 5, 10, 20, and 30 m and was used to calculate the theoretical maximal velocity (V0), theoretical maximal horizontal force (F0), maximal horizontal power (Pmax), decrease in the ratio of horizontal to resultant force (DRF), and peak ratio of horizontal to resultant force (RFpeak). Results: Different force-velocity (F-V) profile parameters are determinants of sprint performance at various distances. RFpeak (r = -0.99), Pmax (r = -0.93), and F0 (r = 0.92) had the strongest associations with sprint performance at shorter (5-m) distances, while at longer (20-m) distances, V0 (r = -0.73), Pmax (r = -0.94), and RFpeak (r = -0.88) were largely associated with sprint performance. The players from higher sports skill level showed higher levels of F0, RFpeak, Pmax and time to 10 meter distance. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that depending on sprint distance used for testing and training procedures in female soccer players, the most informative parameters are Pmax, RFpeak, F0, and V0. As the skill level in female soccer players increases, an increase in maximal theoretical horizontal force during sprinting can be observed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7d","uid":"b63ApAIPzD5po74qHtQhuRQ","uuid":"df584ad3-5474-4618-812a-2e10b03b48c0","name":"Akademia Tarnowska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["624fec5e2467f0324f7b0f63","5e709459878c28a0473bb130","5e70924c878c28a04739343e","5e70927e878c28a047396aa2","624fec5e2467f0324f7b0f62"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7d","parentUuid":"df584ad3-5474-4618-812a-2e10b03b48c0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7d","rootUuid":"df584ad3-5474-4618-812a-2e10b03b48c0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4a","uid":"bd2ijsvNLxJL9WeRD1AExCw","uuid":"1ed8b72b-128f-41e7-9395-4eb66e500572","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

However, we still have no clear information on the normative values of pelvic girdle tilt and mobility. Objective: The study aimed to (1) evaluate the position and mobility of the pelvic girdle in the sagittal and frontal planes in asymptomatic adults aged 19-30, (2) evaluate the possible variation of results according to gender and to develop a proposal for normative values, and (3) evaluate whether body mass, height and BMI are related to the magnitude of hip girdle position and mobility. Methods: The research was conducted in a sample group consisting of 346 men and women using the scaled form of the anthropometric level of the Duometr® The values of position and mobility of the pelvic girdle in the sagittal and frontal planes were analyzed. Results: Differences were noted in the values of the pelvic tilt (p= 0.033) between the men and women. The women showed slightly higher values of posterior range of motion (p= 0.0002) and total range of motion (p= 0.002). The other parameters did not show any significant variation. There was no clear association between body weight, height and BMI and the study variables, except for a small, significant correlation between BMI and posterior pelvic tilt in women (r= 0.175, p= 0.005). In the frontal plane there were no differences in the analyzed variables in terms of gender or side of the body measured. Conclusions: There was no association between the anthropometric variables and the pelvic girdle tilt and mobility. No size variation by gender was observed in the frontal plane. Slight differences were observed in the sagittal plane.

Some expectations of parents travelling with children are the same independent of the accommodation location. The purpose of this article is to examine at what level city hotels offer services and amenities within family tourism, how they meet parents’ expectations and whether they adapt offers to children of different ages. Two measurement tools were used for this study. The first one was the authors’ questionnaire addressed to hotel managers. A total of 88 hotels located in Krakow were selected for the study. The survey contained questions on the offers of hotels related to various services and amenities for families with children, which were assigned to one of three groups (24 items): general child-friendly hotel services and amenities, in-room amenities and restaurant amenities. In the second phase of the study, parents of children aged 0–10 years were asked to assess the degree to which the amenities offered by hotels were important for them during the selection of a hotel. In total, 90 surveys were taken into consideration. The tool was designed to examine the needs of parents who have children of different ages, in regard to selected hotel services and amenities (24 items). As in the case of the surveys for hoteliers, the same three groups were created. The research demonstrates that children’s age is the key factor that should lead to the differentiation of the accommodation offer. However, hoteliers largely perceive children as a homogeneous group. In all studied age categories (6) and amenities groups (3), parents’ expectations were higher than the services and amenities offered. No significant differences regarding the category of the hotel or hotel chain membership have been found. The results of the study may provide valuable guidance to hoteliers who wish to attract families with children to urban tourism and adapt their offer to them, thus realising the principle of inclusiveness. They may be also a significant contribution to the literature on the subject, as most published work concerns holiday hotels rather than city hotels."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4a","uid":"bd2ijsvNLxJL9WeRD1AExCw","uuid":"1ed8b72b-128f-41e7-9395-4eb66e500572","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The study involved 201 women: 92 aged 60–84 years with hallux valgus of both toes, 78 aged 38–59 with hallux valgus of both toes, and 31 aged 38–57 years with correctly shaped feet. The intensity of pain in the foot, the valgus angle of the big toe and fifth toe, the longitudinal and transverse arches of the foot, the symmetry of foot load with body weight, toe joint mobility and muscle flexibility were analysed. Both groups of women with hallux valgus differed from women with normal feet in the height of the transverse arch, the extent of dorsal extension in the first metatarsophalangeal joint and plantar flexion in the first interphalangeal joint. Older women were additionally characterised by reduced plantar flexion in the metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe, limited flexibility of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles as well as less pain in the toe area than in the foot itself. The most characteristic changes which were observed in older women with hallux valgus are a limited range of motion in the MTP and IP joints of the big toe, a reduced transverse arch and increased restriction of calf muscle flexibility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7d","uid":"b63ApAIPzD5po74qHtQhuRQ","uuid":"df584ad3-5474-4618-812a-2e10b03b48c0","name":"Akademia Tarnowska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a04739675d","5e70924c878c28a047393428","5e709282878c28a047396f6e","5e709284878c28a0473970bf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7d","parentUuid":"df584ad3-5474-4618-812a-2e10b03b48c0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7d","rootUuid":"df584ad3-5474-4618-812a-2e10b03b48c0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4a","uid":"bd2ijsvNLxJL9WeRD1AExCw","uuid":"1ed8b72b-128f-41e7-9395-4eb66e500572","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Recently, the coexistence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and inflammation has been implicated in the etiology and progression of mental and/or neurodegenerative diseases. There are sex differences in the prevalence and outcomes of these disorders. The number of studies reporting the effects of ELS and sex on BBB functioning and neuroinflammatory processes in response to immune challenge is very limited, and the data are inconsistent. In the present study, we examined whether ELS, based on the maternal separation (MS) paradigm in rats, can condition male and female subjects to subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune challenge in juvenility or adulthood. Twenty-four hours after acute LPS injection, serum proinflammatory cytokines were measured, and BBB permeability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HP) was evaluated. Additionally, the mRNA expression of neuroinflammatory markers and BBB-related genes was also studied. We found that a single LPS challenge induced a proinflammatory response both in the periphery and in the mPFC and HP and increased BBB permeability in a sex-dependent fashion. Moreover, MS enhanced the neuroinflammatory response to LPS challenge in males (especially juveniles), whereas MS females showed no difference or a blunted central response to LPS compared with control females, mainly during adulthood. These results suggest that ELS may precondition individuals to subsequent environmental factors later in life in a sex-specific manner and potentially determine their susceptibility or resilience to mental and/or neurodegenerative diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The range of flexion has been the participant of numerous publications, but research into the quality of flexibility is lacking. The aim of the study has been to compare the scores and the quality of the stand and reach test in both overweight girls and boys and girls and boys with normal body weight. We have checked whether the forward bend movement is symmetrically distributed over the hip joints and the lumbar and thoracic spine and how it influences the position of the knee and ankle joints. Material and methods: 100 girls and 100 boys aged 10–14 years were examined. Flexibility was measured using the stand and reach test. The quality of the bend was assessed by examining the range of movement in individual body segments: the range of flexion of the thoracic and lumbar spine (linear measurements), the range of flexion of the hip joint, and the position of the knee and ankle joints at maximum flexion (angular measurements). The results were subjected to statistical analysis. Results: The participants, especially boys, had poor flexibility. A poor stand and reach test result correlated with a lower range of flexion of the thoracic and lumbar spine, greater flexion of the hip and knee joints, and greater plantar flexion at maximum torso bend position. Although the mean stand and reach score was slightly greater for the girls, gender did not significantly differentiate the way in which the stand and reach test was performed. Being overweight also did not affect the quantity or quality of the stand and reach test. Conclusions: Limitation of flexibility is common in 10–14-year-old children and results mainly from limited mobility of the spine. The compensation for this is excessive movement in the joints of the lower extremities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7d","uid":"b63ApAIPzD5po74qHtQhuRQ","uuid":"df584ad3-5474-4618-812a-2e10b03b48c0","name":"Akademia Tarnowska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a04739675d","5e70924c878c28a047393428","5e709282878c28a047396f6e","5e709284878c28a0473970bf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7d","parentUuid":"df584ad3-5474-4618-812a-2e10b03b48c0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7d","rootUuid":"df584ad3-5474-4618-812a-2e10b03b48c0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4a","uid":"bd2ijsvNLxJL9WeRD1AExCw","uuid":"1ed8b72b-128f-41e7-9395-4eb66e500572","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

A typical kickboxing fight consists of 3 rounds lasting from 2 to 3 minutes with a minute break between rounds. Kickboxing is combat sport where two types of fights occur: light-contact (tatami sports) and full contact (ring sports). The aim of this study was knowledge about the available information of body composition, body fat percentage, and aerobic and anaerobic performance indicators of kickboxers based on research from the last 10 years (with one exception, that formed the basis for subsequent research, using a systematic review an meta-analysis).\n\nMaterial and Methods: The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta Analysis (PRISMA). Monitored indicators were somatotype and body fat percentage through skin measurement and bioimpedance analysis, aerobic performance by measuring VO2max, anaerobic performance through Wingate test.\nA systematic search was conducted using Web of Sciences, Scopus. A total of 109 studies were screened and 15 were included in the meta-analysis. The inclusion criteria were: the study was published in 2010-2021, observational studies, the average age of the athletes involved in the study was ±22 years, written in English. Data extracted from studies included 285 male athletes (age: 22 ±5 years; height: 175 ±6.7 cm; weight: 71 ±8.6 kg). The sample size, average and standard deviation of the selected characteristics of kickboxers were extracted from each selected study.\n\nResults: Successful male kickboxers have been shown to have a low body fat percentage. In terms of somatotype, the mesomorphic component predominates in men kickboxers. Studies have shown high levels of maximal anaerobic performance of kickboxers.\n\nConclusions: These results could by an essential objective basis for evaluating some of kickboxers’ physical characteristics and for trainers who could benefit from them when developing optimal training plans and setting training goal."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709216878c28a04738fb97","5e709229878c28a047390dcd"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4a","uid":"bd2ijsvNLxJL9WeRD1AExCw","uuid":"1ed8b72b-128f-41e7-9395-4eb66e500572","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The spatial positioning of the pelvic girdle is crucial to it. Functional and structural asymmetries within the lumbo-pelvic-hip complex can have a significant influence on the structure and functions of many human body organs and systems. The aim of the study was to present the results of inclinometer measurements of selected landmarks of the pelvic girdle in young adults aged 19–29. METHODS: The analysis of occurrence of spatial pelvic asymmetry was based on the authors’ original, clinical classification and the significance of the body mass and height for the analyzed asymmetries. The inclinometer measurements of the selected landmarks of the pelvic girdle were performed in a sample consisting of 300 young individuals. Then, the occurrences of the spatial asymmetry of the pelvis were analyzed based on the authors’ own clinical classification using alignment symmetry of the iliac crests, the anterior superior iliac spines and the trochanters major as a criterion. All study subjects with asymmetry <1 degree were treated as those with a symmetrical pelvis. RESULTS: The significance of gender, body mass and height for the analyzed asymmetries was assessed. Symmetric positioning of the iliac crests was observed in only 32% of the respondents. The iliac crest depression on the left side was more frequently observed – in 41% of the respondents. This occurred more often in women (44%) than in men (38%). In the group of women, the rotated pelvis was the most often observed (39.4%) asymmetry, while for men, it was the oblique pelvis (40%). More detailed analysis by pelvic asymmetry subtypes showed their statistical differentiation between women and men (p<0.0001). Analysis of moderate rotation of the pelvis for men, were reported slightly higher values but these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.253). Women, in turn, showed slightly higher mean values but here too, the differences were not statistically significant (p=0.245). DISCUSSION: Asymmetries in the pelvis area are common; they were observed in less than three-quarters of the examined population. Oblique pelvis was found in less than a quarter of women and in more than one-third men with the predominant structural asymmetries. Rotated pelvis was observed in more than one-third of women and men with dominating functional asymmetries.

These HCWs were physiotherapists (48%), nurses (30%) and physicians (22%), all professionally\nactive during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research was conducted between June and October 2020,\nusing an on-line survey. The COPE, LBQ and ISI questionnaires were used.\nResults: Analysis of occupational burnout (LBQ) and its various aspects showed that the Deterioration of relations with clients (patients) was significantly higher among those with up to five years and between 15 and 24 years of experience than in the group with 25–35 years of experience. Sense of professional ineffectiveness and Disappointment were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the group with the most work experience. 30% of the medical workers surveyed obtained a result indicating subliminal insomnia (ISI) and 28% – clinical insomnia. Comparison of COPE and LBQ scores showed that Psychophysical exhaustion (LBQ) correlated negatively with Religious coping (p = 0.032). Deterioration of relations with clients (patients) (LBQ) correlated negatively with such strategies (COPE) as Active coping (p = 0.048), Planning (p=0.006), Positive reinterpretation and growth (p < 0.001). Sense of professional ineffectiveness (LBQ) correlated negatively with Acceptance strategies (p = 0.017) and Behavioral disengagement (p = 0.021). Disappointment correlated positively with the Positive reinterpretation and growth strategy (p = 0.024).\nConclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on the development of burnout amongst the HCWs surveyed, especially that related to psychophysical exhaustion, a sense of lack of effectiveness and a sense of disappointment. The sleep cycle was affected. Cognitive-behavioral oriented workshops are recommended when facing burnout."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd74","uid":"bwDEKc5ufSD7Nqostv0I4kw","uuid":"336f05cc-b615-4f3c-94b2-65abc7f54264","name":"Uniwersytet Andrzeja Frycza Modrzewskiego w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709392878c28a0473ad3be","5ebed652752340254fc40662"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd74","parentUuid":"336f05cc-b615-4f3c-94b2-65abc7f54264","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd74","rootUuid":"336f05cc-b615-4f3c-94b2-65abc7f54264","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4a","uid":"bd2ijsvNLxJL9WeRD1AExCw","uuid":"1ed8b72b-128f-41e7-9395-4eb66e500572","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Personal trainers present a multifaceted nature into physical activity and become their clients’ guides in achieving sporting goals. Physical trainers also work in sports clubs and supervise the training of people professionally involved in sport. Aim: Given the professional role that they play, this article aimed to analyze the knowledge and attitudes of personal trainers towards using prohibited measures to improve performance in sport, as well as counteraction measures. Methods: The study used a questionnaire created by the authors containing closed, semi-open, and open questions. Results: The results of the presented research indicate that most physical trainers and students educated in this field have a negative attitude towards the use of prohibited measures that increase performance but they noticed that doping was common in sport by 88.51% respondents. In the group of personal trainers, the majority (87.14%) admitted that good results in sport could be achieved without the use of doping. They stated that it was unfair (25%), contrary to the fair play principle—16%, while over 11% indicated this as cheating. Only 6% of people pointed out that it was legally prohibited and 3% that it was harmful. These results show that 10.13% of all respondents believe that the use of doping is a necessity to achieve very good results in sport. Conclusions: The availability of doping substances is statistically correlated with the question of persuading to use doping in both groups of trainers and students and some people justify the use of doping.
