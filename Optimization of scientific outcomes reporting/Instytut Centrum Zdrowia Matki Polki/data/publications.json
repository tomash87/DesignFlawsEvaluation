Nowadays, we are able to distinguish low\ndensity lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) subfractions.\nExcept LDL also HDL small subfractions can increase the risk of CV events.\nTherefore, we aimed to investigate the associations between changes of lipoprotein\nsubfractions and the risk of hypertension development.\nMaterial and methods: In 2-year long study 200 volunteers with normal\nblood pressure at the age of 19–32 years were included. Each volunteer underwent\ndetailed medical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram was taken\nat rest, echocardiogram, lipid subfraction assessment (using Lipoprint®) and\ntwo 24-hour BP measurements.\nResults: Mean total cholesterol concentration was 189 mg/dl (4.89 mmol/l),\nwith mean LDL concentration of 107 mg/dl (2.77 mmol/l), HDL of 63 mg/dl\n(1.63 mmo/l), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) of 40 mg/dl (1.04 mmol/l)\nand triglycerides (TG) of 89 mg/dl (1.00 mmol/l). Subfractions LDL 1–3 were\nmost abundant, LDL 4–5 making up a marginal portion and LDL 6–7 were\nnot observed. Whereas, subfractions HDL 4–6 were most abundant, in lower\nconcentration was present HDL 1–3 and HDL 8–10. We showed that increased\nsystolic blood pressure coreclated significantly with HDL cholesterol\nconcentrations (p = 0.0078), HDL intermediate subgractions (p = 0.0451),\nwith HDL-3 subfraction (p = 0.0229), and intermediate density lipoprotein-A\n(IDL-A) (p = 0.038). A significant correlation between increased diastolic\nblood pressure and HDL lipoprotein levels (p = 0.0454) was only observed.\nConclusions: Obtained results indicating correlation between total HDL levels\nand HDL-3 subfraction concentration (for systolic BP) and the tendency\nto develop hypertension."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"25-36","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771a3","mniswId":"1677","title":"Archives of Medical Science","issn":"1734-1922","eissn":"1896-9151","documentHash":"e2d9d3d3-2704-4dcc-bc9e-0bf8fb26be1a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64a68719409707465803a3d5","year":"2022","volume":"22","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"72550fa0-c0e0-401f-ab01-d3c5aa2e856c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hypertension","high density lipoproteins","low density\nlipoproteins","lipid profile","lipoprotein subfractions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747048387531"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658191fc4097076c14b7ac9b","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Słodki","documentHash":"bd959766-3ff3-49c7-8719-b51ef3a5ce57"},{"objectId":"658191fc4097076c14b7ac9a","name":"Roland","lastName":"Axt-Fliedner","documentHash":"ac4ce649-96d9-49d9-9b5a-e7f2cc6aed53"},{"objectId":"658191fc4097076c14b7ac99","name":"Nathalie Jeanne","lastName":"Bravo-Valenzuela","documentHash":"2e3e1aeb-8549-48af-b520-63997bd4f8f6"},{"objectId":"658191fc4097076c14b7ac98","name":"Edward ","lastName":"Araujo Junior","documentHash":"5c157c07-9ab9-453c-8c8b-5abdaa2472e9"},{"objectId":"658191fc4097076c14b7ac97","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Rizzo","documentHash":"729b86c8-46f8-4c50-9fde-c0ca614269fe"},{"objectId":"658191fc4097076c14b7ac96","name":"Jędrzej","lastName":"Chrzanowski","documentHash":"82ff970c-a8f4-44d7-818d-324fc58b072c"},{"objectId":"658191fc4097076c14b7ac94","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jadczak","documentHash":"7566dd06-f2ee-4ae3-9cf4-420f33a16cdf"},{"objectId":"5ebed58d752340254fc4030e","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"SOKOŁOWSKI","uuid":"9CB548679D0B3FBF268529F1028E59332DF2E7B2C8C3F06BF77B024A999AC95877100FC0DF9693B697A51BE1919259F140E7FAAC41F73458D5ABA735AD3F357C","documentHash":"ed3e46ae-a5f9-44e2-8d75-007a88f571a9"},{"objectId":"5e7092e1878c28a04739e995","name":"MARIA","lastName":"RESPONDEK-LIBERSKA","uuid":"94B91A1B5CABE50A9BD700309AB93021587DFAD8F5F7CA77DC3522ACBFBE051DA93404BFD9310D009B1A1E4D2BBAE5E63D49D1A14A9E8965D4E4C2247D54E32A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0238-2172","documentHash":"455be1ef-661c-40fe-bd1c-2c8964ad265a"}],"objectId":"5f3393492467f0445678206b","doi":"10.1080/14767058.2020.1716717","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14767058.2020.1716717","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome with prenatally diagnosed foramen ovale restriction: diagnosis, management and outcome","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective: Despite advances in prenatal diagnosis and postnatal intervention/surgery methods, patients with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS) and coexisting foramen oval restriction\r\nstill achieve high mortality rates. Our objective was to determine survival predictors and to find answers to, why restriction develops in some, but not others.\r\n\r\nMethods: We performed a retrospective analysis of prenatal history and postnatal sequel of 22 patients with HLHS and foramen ovale restriction between 2008 and 2017.\r\n\r\nResults: There were 11 survivors and 11 nonsurvivors. The most significant difference between the two groups pertained to the average time of foramen ovale restriction diagnosis which was\r\n33 weeks for survivors and 28 weeks for nonsurvivors (p ¼ .0416) and the duration of in-utero restriction (9 versus 5 weeks, p ¼ .0213). Twenty patients (20/22) exhibited possible signs of infection.\r\n\r\nConclusions: (1) Earlier development and longer presence of foramen ovale restriction in the setting of HLHS is associated with higher short-term mortality regardless of the degree of\r\nrestriction.

The aim of this study was to investigate the serum levels of selected chemokines in patients with ovarian cancer or benign ovarian tumors to assess their role in tumorigenesis and their potential use in preoperative diagnosis of an adnexal mass.\n\nMaterial and methods: The study group consisted of 59 women with ovarian cancer: 17 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients and 42 women with benign ovarian tumors. We measured in sera obtained preoperatively the level of CA125 and a panel of 5 chemokines - CX3CL1/fractalkine, CXCL1/GRO-alpha, CXCL12/SDF-1, CCL20/MIP-3 alpha and IL-17F - using the chemiluminescence method with multiplexed bead based immunoassay.\n\nResults: CX3CL1 was significantly elevated in sera of advanced ovarian cancer patients compared to women with benign ovarian tumors. The significant elevation of CXCL1 was also observed (both early and advanced stages). A similar pattern was present with the standard ovarian cancer marker CA125. In our patients with endometriotic cysts CA125 levels were significantly higher than in women with other benign tumors, whereas all analyzed chemokines had similar serum titers in patients with endometriotic vs. other benign ovarian cysts.\n\nConclusions: CX3CL1 and CXCL1 are elevated in sera of EOC patients, which indicates their role in cancer development. Moreover, they might be useful in preoperative differential diagnosis of ovarian tumors, especially as they were not elevated in cases of endometriosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397e5a","5e7092ae878c28a04739a76d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d7a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"682-689","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c467d14097077bbdc0fca9","62c467d14097077bbdc0fcaa","5e70928e878c28a047397d7a","62c467d24097077bbdc0fcad","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f4","5e70928e878c28a047397e5a","5e7092ae878c28a04739a76d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771a3","mniswId":"1677","title":"Archives of Medical Science","issn":"1734-1922","eissn":"1896-9151","documentHash":"027b7fef-377f-4a76-a3f0-aa5647520ec3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cee45d4097070a2ca740db","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"f589b714-4937-49b9-931c-19530c16a664"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ovarian cancer","endometriosis","CX3CL1","CXCL1"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145680"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65855dba4097076c14c3e059","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Grzelecki","documentHash":"50ef6a3e-9f70-4bc1-a518-2a67c0fdcb45"},{"objectId":"65855dba4097076c14c3e058","name":"Paloma","lastName":" Aragonés","documentHash":"3ed56153-c52c-47db-88e1-59ae7b4fe1b8"},{"objectId":"65855dba4097076c14c3e057","name":"Marko","lastName":"Konschake","documentHash":"58d9619f-c062-4a88-906b-7f8b5046c86e"},{"objectId":"65855dba4097076c14c3e055","name":"R.

Their correlation with the bifurcated coracoid process (CP) will be also assessed. On the basis of these observations, a new classification of structures attached to the coracoid process is proposed. Classical anatomical dissection was performed on one hundred forty-five upper limbs. Three types of relationship between the coracobrachialis muscle and the short head of the biceps brachii were observed in the cadavers. In type I (occurring in 54%), the coracobrachialis and the short head of the biceps brachii created a common junction attached to a single CP. Type II was divided into two subtypes (a and b). Subtype IIa (frequency 10%) was represented by independent proximal attachments of the short head of the biceps brachii and the coracobrachialis muscles to the CP. In subtype IIb (frequency 5%), the coracobrachialis muscle was two-headed (the first head located under the second) and not connected to the short head of the biceps brachii; all heads were attached to a single CP. Type III (frequency 31%) was characterized by a two-headed coracobrachialis muscle, the first head originating from a bifurcated CP laterally to the short head of the biceps brachii and the second medially to this structure. Different variations connected with the mentioned structures could be problematic for surgeons during operations, so detailed knowledge of them could contribute to more efficient procedures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092db878c28a04739e49b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"8939359","pagesFromTo":"1-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943b878c28a0473b882d","65855dba4097076c14c3e054","65855dba4097076c14c3e055","5e7092db878c28a04739e49b","65855dba4097076c14c3e057","65855dba4097076c14c3e058","65855dba4097076c14c3e059"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477366","mniswId":"2478","title":"BioMed Research International","issn":"2314-6133","eissn":"2314-6141","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d0a46698-f3a7-4f39-a995-09c97264ed36"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61efc8312467f03122757e9c","year":"2022","volume":"2022","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"2f4e2839-576b-403c-a96e-27579912aa68"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058179028"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"634012b94097074a2ba99fb6","name":"Jacek J.","lastName":"Moll","documentHash":"52e7bfa1-3451-472b-80dc-a7a41938e76e"},{"objectId":"634012b94097074a2ba99fb5","name":"Sara","lastName":"Korabiewska-Pluta","documentHash":"eda9e5ac-4362-4a05-b264-53e896b4dfb5"},{"objectId":"634012b94097074a2ba99fb4","name":"Jadwiga A.","lastName":"Moll","documentHash":"ebc937a0-0b6c-4ceb-9006-61473c3bfe5b"},{"objectId":"634012b94097074a2ba99fb0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sobczak-Budlewska","documentHash":"988dfbc6-f2eb-4793-ae71-820e848aa686"},{"objectId":"62d61728752340480574d8db","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"MOLL","uuid":"046D8C38D27D8A38B21973CA31D06875FEAB07243C8589F3D74A839A05B6B9F62C4BD5438C660B87A7DA5C8D7948667D20E104E419933526CBB2846DC7027549","documentHash":"0fd3d4c8-8c2e-4cc8-a9e1-f6f4cdd34b7a"},{"objectId":"5f2a19e775234011c312174c","name":"MONIKA","lastName":"ŁUBISZ","uuid":"E038156CE0134DE101DD95213170464D845873992E2647ABF0603CFE3735360723EED4D8D3B41CA80FD64445AF71B376C3FCC3CB3375FD8EBFC94C5EE17B0079","orcidId":"0000-0003-0930-3692","documentHash":"163fee05-85a8-4148-8f8c-d788c50b2fdb"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b0984","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Michalak","uuid":"2FDAB0565C491EE35C94A0EAC828128E387EADB92910A1A467DCC39D8E235CBA718FDE0CFE314FB6D8D75DEAF1E2900B11D3067073C066B3DE2A59E20039946E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9156-6648","documentHash":"8b9e78e3-d2b9-4472-a389-d6614457d55b"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e59","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Moszura","uuid":"B926E3EB576F0A30FF5D44C4D375E1458532F03E2300B872FD225E471CFC30F8FBCDC126EC07A2F8021F63789BCAB62F2A54C848234D550FBB1A95877C1FF18F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3876-2791","documentHash":"6ec32b60-9ca0-4d6e-a650-77d327cbfec0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6340114a4097074a2ba99a8c","doi":"10.1017/s1047951122002670","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1047951122002670","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"30 years’ experience with the arterial switch operation: risk of pulmonary stenosis and its impact on post-operative prognosis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pulmonary stenosis is one of the most common complications in patients with transposition of the great arteries after the arterial switch operation. The reason for this is multifactorial and related to the anterior shift of the pulmonary trunk during the LeCompte manoeuvre, the complex suture line required to fill the gaps after harvesting the coronary arteries, and the need for patch implantation to maintain a tensionless anastomosis.We reviewed all patients with transposition of the great arteries operated on at our institute between 1991 and 2020 to establish the frequency of pulmonary stenosis during post-operative follow-up, reinterventions, and reoperations related to pulmonary stenosis and its potential risk factors.During the analysed period, we performed 848 arterial switch operations for simple and complex cases of transposition of the great arteries. The overall early mortality was 6.96%, and the late mortality was 2.53%. Among all study groups, 243 (28.66%) patients developed mild pulmonary stenosis, 43 patients (5.07%) developed moderate, and 45 patients (5.31%) developed severe pulmonary stenosis. During follow-up, 21 patients required interventions related to pulmonary stenosis. Pulmonary reconstruction with patches, aortic arch anomalies, and ventricular septal defects associated with transposition of the great arteries were significant risk factors. Nine patients required reoperation because of pulmonary artery stenosis with patch reconstruction of the pulmonary artery, aortic arch anomalies, and aortic cross-clamping time, increasing the risk of reoperation.Pulmonary stenosis in patients with transposition of the great arteries after the arterial switch operation is a common complication. If significant, it occurs early after surgery and is the most frequent reason for post-operative interventions and reoperations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki

paediatric kidney replacement therapies in Europe: demographic results from the EurAKId Registry","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI), particularly that requiring dialysis, is a severe complication in hospitalized children that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. A prospective European AKI registry (EurAKId registry, NCT02960867) was created to describe the epidemiology and outcomes of paediatric patients treated with acute dialysis.\nMethods: Children were recruited who were between 0 and 18 years of age and were treated both in and outside the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with peritoneal dialysis (PD), haemodialysis (HD) or continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT) for AKI or metabolic derangement, fluid overload (FO), sepsis or respiratory distress. Five age groups and 12 categories of primary diseases were defined.\nResults: Data on 340 patients were analysed, of whom 86% received dialysis for AKI and 14% for reasons other than AKI. Boys accounted for 60% of the patients. Illness severity was greater in children with cardiac and haematologic diseases than those with kidney diseases. Most patients received dialysis in the PICU (84%). The most frequently used dialysis modality was CKRT (64%), followed by PD (14%) and HD (14%). The overall survival rate was 65%. Survival was significantly lower in children with three comorbidities than in children with no comorbidities (41% and 83%; P < 0.001).\nConclusions: The EurAKId registry is the first prospective registry considering paediatric acute kidney replacement therapies (KRTs) in both critical and non-critical care settings, focusing on the three dialysis modalities in Europe. The clinical indications for KRT have expanded; our population was characterized by critically ill patients, primarily boys, who frequently received dialysis in the PICU with CKRT."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d62"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"37","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"770-780","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64a2b8284097073207319e8e","64a2b8284097073207319e8f","64a2b8284097073207319e90","64a2b8284097073207319e91","64a2b8284097073207319e92","64a2b8284097073207319e93","64a2b8284097073207319e94","64a2b8284097073207319e95","64a2b8284097073207319e96","64a2b8284097073207319e97","64a2b8284097073207319e98","64a2b8284097073207319e99","64a2b8284097073207319e9a","5e70928e878c28a047397d62","64a2b8284097073207319e9b","64a2b8284097073207319e9c","64a2b8284097073207319e9d","64a2b8284097073207319e9e","64a2b8284097073207319e9f","64a2b8284097073207319ea0","64a2b8284097073207319ea1","64a2b8284097073207319ea2","64a2b8284097073207319ea3","64a2b8284097073207319ea4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fb0","mniswId":"14892","title":"Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation","issn":"0931-0509","eissn":"1460-2385","documentHash":"7a47f4c9-6b4b-4c8a-bf05-6ab41377cb7e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64a2b9f6409707320731af4d","year":"2022","volume":"37","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"1408ed78-377e-4135-a393-4073713050b3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["acute kidney injury","continuous kidney replacement therapies","intermittent haemodialysis","kidney replacement therapies","peritoneal dialysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058710941"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64a3d9a440970738ce763db7","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Krygier","documentHash":"51f4e172-e4c6-4b82-974f-a2eae87baf8e"},{"objectId":"64a3d9a440970738ce763db6","name":"Marian","lastName":"Kacerovsky","documentHash":"a5edac0b-6723-4634-ad94-61894699dc7e"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d90","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"452EEF9E28C724DA2BCAD7653299E8413D382158CE481419690E60547544B13117A68BE4B9DC510E602EDDF0CE8CEE1975194EC4DDB73177C161A3D0486B3198","orcidId":"0000-0001-8990-2761","documentHash":"dd151921-e4ba-44d6-88f0-87b5d38b6053"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afabf","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Wujcicka","uuid":"3856160AD606A67E46480413D81FCBCF021339891702509751CD3F8FB9EC5436B7FAB1EFEC7E49AAD6FC176D0F473A3BCA2C8C00FFD20BA4EE04B3E60D49D2E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2907-1414","documentHash":"53b44cf6-e85f-4030-84d2-15b7834faf70"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eaa4","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":"A2CF3568D4206E833A93B839E76E32B7FF43E216EF45BE2A0811620733662426F7E26BAD1759C72AC2DF8842B07A6D5A3EBAC2E85013B4130FEC64F497EE471E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6900-4347","documentHash":"d6f5ecdd-1d5e-49d3-afd3-d4adaff79962"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Krekora","uuid":"023602F0CB962981B544DDF9820660CB31E5420EA3295BC5FE50BB51857D21EBACBE932514660FB7F1A55CC1003FFF6E468FFDE8C5F86027CF074EA8BCE4E21B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5496-4556","documentHash":"7d44dde3-148f-4886-bf56-5cebf3e85de2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64a3d9a440970738ce763db5","doi":"10.3390/cimb44070203","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1467-3045/44/7/203/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms from Angiogenesis-Related Genes, ANGPT2, TLR2 and TLR9, with Spontaneous Preterm Labor","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, we hypothesized that the changes localized at angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF2), fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) and toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR6 and TLR9 genes were associated with spontaneous preterm labor (PTL), as well as with possible genetic alterations on PTL-related coagulation.

The study was conducted in 320 patients treated between 2016 and 2020, including 160 women with PTL and 160 term controls in labor. We found that ANGPT2 rs3020221 AA homozygotes were significantly less common in PTL cases than in controls, especially after adjusting for activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and platelet (PLT) parameters. TC heterozygotes for TLR2 rs3804099 were associated with PTL after correcting for anemia, vaginal bleeding, and history of threatened miscarriage or PTL. TC and CC genotypes in TLR9 rs187084 were significantly less common in women with PTL, compared to the controls, after adjusting for bleeding and gestational diabetes.

Atherosclerosis relates not only to an increased level of cholesterol, but involves the development of atherosclerotic plaques, which are formed as a result of processes including inflammation and oxidative stress. Therefore, in addition to the classical risk factors for ASCVD (such as type 2 diabetes, overweight, obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome), residual risk factors such as inflammation and oxidative stress should also be reduced. The most important intervention in ASCVD is prevention, which includes promoting a healthy diet based on products of natural origin. Curcumin, which is often present in the diet, has been demonstrate to confer several benefits to health. It has been shown in numerous clinical trials that curcumin exhibited anti-diabetic, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, as well as promoting weight loss. All this means that curcumin has a comprehensive impact on the most important risk factors of ASCVD and may be a beneficial support in the treatment of these diseases. Recently, it has also been shown that curcumin may have a beneficial effect on the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and might be helpful in the prevention of long-COVID complications.

The incidence of breast cancer is constantly increasing in all regions of the world. For this reason, despite the progress in its detection and treatment, which translates into improved mortality rates, it seems necessary to look for new therapeutic methods, and predictive and prognostic factors. Treatment strategies vary depending on the molecular subtype. Breast cancer treatment is multidisciplinary; it includes approaches to locoregional therapy (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy. Systemic therapies include hormone therapy for hormone-positive disease, chemotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, and quite recently, immunotherapy. Triple negative breast cancer is responsible for more than 15-20% of all breast cancers. It is of particular research interest as it presents a therapeutic challenge, mainly due to its low response to treatment and its highly invasive nature. Future therapeutic concepts for breast cancer aim to individualize therapy and de-escalate and escalate treatment based on cancer biology and early response to therapy.

survive following failure of contemporary radiation-based therapies. Understanding the molecular drivers of medulloblastoma relapse (rMB) will be essential to improve outcomes. Initial genome-wide investigations have suggested significant genetic divergence of the relapsed disease.\n\nMethods: We undertook large-scale integrated characterization of the molecular features of rMB-molecular subgroup, novel subtypes, copy number variation (CNV), and driver gene mutation. 119 rMBs were assessed in comparison with their paired diagnostic samples (n = 107), alongside an independent reference cohort sampled at diagnosis (n = 282). rMB events were investigated for association with outcome post-relapse in clinically annotated patients (n = 54).\n\nResults: Significant genetic evolution occurred over disease-course; 40% of putative rMB drivers emerged at relapse and differed significantly between molecular subgroups. Non-infant MBSHH displayed significantly more chromosomal CNVs at relapse (TP53 mutation-associated). Relapsed MBGroup4 demonstrated the greatest genetic divergence, enriched for targetable (eg, CDK amplifications) and novel (eg, USH2A mutations) events. Importantly, many hallmark features of MB were stable over time; novel subtypes (>90% of tumors) and established genetic drivers (eg, SHH/WNT/P53 mutations; 60% of rMB events) were maintained from diagnosis. Critically, acquired and maintained rMB events converged on targetable pathways which were significantly enriched at relapse (eg, DNA damage signaling) and specific events (eg, 3p loss) predicted survival post-relapse.\n\nConclusions: rMB is characterised by the emergence of novel events and pathways, in concert with selective maintenance of established genetic drivers. Together, these define the actionable genetic landscape of rMB and provide a basis for improved clinical management and development of stratified therapeutics, across disease-course."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d6b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"153-165","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64abbf1e40970762a23e1923","64abbf1e40970762a23e1924","64abbf1e40970762a23e1925","64abbf1e40970762a23e1926","64abbf1e40970762a23e1927","64abbf1e40970762a23e1928","64abbf1e40970762a23e1929","64abbf1e40970762a23e192a","64abbf1e40970762a23e192b","64abbf1e40970762a23e192c","64abbf1e40970762a23e192d","64abbf1e40970762a23e192e","64abbf1e40970762a23e192f","64abbf1e40970762a23e1930","5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","64abbf1e40970762a23e1931","64abbf1e40970762a23e1932","64abbf1e40970762a23e1933","64abbf1e40970762a23e1934","64abbf1e40970762a23e1935","64abbf1e40970762a23e1936","64abbf1e40970762a23e1937","64abbf1e40970762a23e1938","64abbf1e40970762a23e1939","64abbf1e40970762a23e193a","64abbf1e40970762a23e193b","64abbf1e40970762a23e193c","64abbf1e40970762a23e193d","64abbf1e40970762a23e193e","64abbf1e40970762a23e193f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fef","mniswId":"14970","title":"NEURO-ONCOLOGY","issn":"1522-8517","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4517f833-de5c-41a7-b0ed-cc09ab2d0e41"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64abbf1e40970762a23e1922","year":"2021","volume":"24","number":"1","documentHash":"fcf78749-7cec-4113-87da-02734da0dfcc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["drivers","subgroups","relapse","medulloblastoma","genomics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058717503"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6745d06dfdbe832d85ebd522","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Paradowska","documentHash":"9a3cd166-43f8-473e-9dc9-e3995bc76d59"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b7683","name":"Maria","lastName":"Szubert","uuid":"7F40FD5E2DC07ACED1EA4CD6D242B91A6C36B3755A1112D41A20CBD3B65C5D4CBC51AD3C9B8D71F32D8347CE18211FA20D10BC586BBCEDA8FD47E03C4704B3BD","orcidId":"0000-0003-0757-0076","documentHash":"b88e6d41-c96a-4088-ac21-fad29455c3e6"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ec2e","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Wilczyński","uuid":"C294094E93841F2E9D409915D88369A5D6A9D068FAAE97078CAA91DA13D131C1E78F58B701720DBA392ADCE2106236F11CED3BB7A0B7E8AC52E84017C0646738","orcidId":"0000-0002-2072-6533","documentHash":"3dfd96c6-2251-4cdc-878a-ee0ff630c868"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e43e","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Wilczyński","uuid":"BD9EBB9F56F4DFD47648365E8DACB9F8EACDD5CB9C9B3F61C9CABC450973A42175D34735C99DC4D26FF41255C60DEA2CED3A775BEA1D3A49704589A823D03683","orcidId":"0000-0002-5720-427X","documentHash":"d61e47e9-b112-4185-baec-68d8a414e772"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64411702409707555e812a0a","doi":"10.3390/cancers15010111","publicUri":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9817684/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Endometriosis Stem Cells as a Possible Main Target for Carcinogenesis of Endometriosis-Associated Ovarian Cancer (EAOC)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Endometriosis is a serious recurrent disease impairing the quality of life and fertility, and being a risk for some histologic types of ovarian cancer defined as endometriosis-associated ovarian cancers (EAOC).

The similarly disturbed expression of several genes, miRNAs, galectins and chaperones has been observed both in endometriotic lesions and in ovarian or endometrial cancer. The importance of stem cells for nascence and sustain of malignant tumors is commonly appreciated. Although the proposed mechanisms promoting carcinogenesis leading from endometriosis into the EAOC are not completely known, they have been discussed in several articles.

On the other hand, the prevalence of the polygenic form of chylomicronemia syndrome is around 1:600. On the basis of the genetical alterations, other factors, such as obesity, alcohol consumption, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and certain drugs may significantly contribute to the development of the multifactorial form. In this review, we aimed to highlight the recent findings about the clinical and laboratory features, differential diagnosis, as well as the epidemiology of the monogenic and polygenic forms of chylomicronemias.

Furthermore, the attempt to answer the question if there was any relationship between the occurrence of fetal Ebstein's anomaly and environmental risk factors in polish population.\r\n\r\nMethods: Forty-five prenatal diagnoses of Ebstein's anomaly were compiled over the 21-year period (1998‒2018) form our single unit. The analysis included the assessment of maternal parameters (age, past obstetric history, and place of residence) and fetal parameters (sex, gestational age, anatomy, the fetal cardiovascular condition assessed by the CVPS, associated extracardiac anomalies or malformations, prenatal treatment, delivery and follow-up).\r\n\r\nResults: The average age of gravida was 29.5 years (± 5.2 years) and gravidae <35 years of age accounted for 80% . There were 43 singleton pregnancies and 2 cases of multiple pregnancy. Ebstein's anomaly was mostly (averagely) diagnosed at 28th week of gestation. Forty-three fetuses had normal karyotypes and two had trisomy 21. Cardiomegaly was present in 91% (41) of fetuses. The average heart area to chest area ratio was 0.56 (± 0.12). In 21 cases, there was only fetal monitoring - echocardiographic examinations and postnatal mortality was 44.4%. In 5 cases, transplacental digoxin treatment was administered and mortality was: 40%. In another 5 cases, only steroid therapy was applied and postnatal mortality was 100%. Steroids and transplacental digoxin treatment were administered in 11 cases and mortality was 63.6%. In 3 last cases transplacental digoxin treatment, steroids and maternal hyperoxygenation therapy were given and mortality was 0%. Cesarean section rate was 49%. Moreover, due to Ebstein's anomaly regional peak of occurrence benzopyrene was deliberated as environmental risk factor.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Fetal Ebstein's anomaly occurred in our population in healthy young women, expecting their first child and malformation was not related to fetus gender, nor to maternal health condition. Our data can be a new signal for the development of novel treatment strategies in therapy in fetuses with Ebstein's anomaly."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"3297-3304","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658192204097076c14b7acee","658192204097076c14b7acef","5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","658192204097076c14b7acf1","5e7092e1878c28a04739e995"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478856","mniswId":"11767","title":"Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine","issn":"1476-7058","eissn":"1476-4954","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"02a1cd1d-487b-498d-87ec-ff331c8f1199"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658becdb4097070a21eba95f","year":"2022","volume":"35","number":"17","doi":"","documentHash":"49247ff6-b25d-46c4-b6fc-4af9936c9279"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ebstein’s anomaly","Prenatal treatment","fetal echocardiography"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058766759"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64a7e22c4097074cfbc83830","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kałużyński","documentHash":"9ab79b0f-9a96-491e-8b68-fb53f792eb41"},{"objectId":"64a7e22c4097074cfbc8382f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Stawerski","documentHash":"86153fc1-0089-4c77-90ad-9cc376d9e9dd"},{"objectId":"64a7e22c4097074cfbc8382e","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Kolasa-Kicińska","documentHash":"f4375b48-fe0e-4df8-a2ea-e31086abd79d"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ec1a","name":"Renata","lastName":"Stawerska","uuid":"7AF3452E9321DC510B1360885037367DD2C07C1C15331220602730A7E93065EA1C1C709F92F753F90878D89F70DCF1971BEF1F4B0F7434471157647042766FD4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0508-2186","documentHash":"f246d855-1f2a-4b98-9749-0254df8ba960"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e29","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"9AEED36EF6FDD1C7A152FECD18B74C86EE0F5FC6C9ED4C2598D64A50DA2FC2EE937D8A80C049C92E0412EE6ECAB101D78D8BC8974E862491A24AB18E51685148","orcidId":"0000-0002-8748-3337","documentHash":"7d8b26bd-246c-4611-be81-a715727aeec0"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e65a","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Czkwianianc","uuid":"F0432822D3A02BCCF4541B7D36AED96FAFC0A5F39211D727C2FC01584F54A694DE9B30A6CDAECF91E645322A71F2C10239C5094159986C8F56B2C051EE4617D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0384-2049","documentHash":"17db819d-b67d-4c14-83f4-52aec358ea9a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64a7e22c4097074cfbc8382d","doi":"10.3390/jcm11195868","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/19/5868/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effects of Helicobacter pylori Infection on Ghrelin and Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 Secretion in Children with Idiopathic Short Stature","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: A diagnosis of \"idiopathic short stature\" (ISS) in a child means that the cause of the disease has not been established, although there are certainly some unknown factors that contributed to its occurrence. Ghrelin and leptin are important in controlling food intake; ghrelin is also a growth hormone (GH) stimulator. Both enterohormones are produced in the stomach and their secretion may be affected by a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection.\n\nMethods: Our study included a group of 61 children (53 prepubertal and 8 peripubertal) with ISS, without any gastrointestinal tract symptoms but in whom the histopathological evaluation of stomach tissue was made during gastroscopy to diagnose H. pylori infection. In each child, fasting ghrelin, leptin and IGF-1 concentrations, and GH levels in two stimulation tests were assessed.\n\nResults: H. pylori infection was confirmed in 24.6% of the children. Ghrelin and IGF-1 concentrations were significantly lower in H. pylori-positive than H. pylori-negative children (this was more noticeable in prepubertal subgroups), however there was not a discrepancy in regards to GH concentrations in stimulation tests, leptin levels or the nutritional state between groups.\n\nConclusions: Short children, infected by H. pylori seem to have lower ghrelin and IGF-1 concentrations than children without infection, this may be the reason for a worse growth rate in this subgroup."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e3878c28a04739ec1a","5e709200878c28a04738e65a","5e70928e878c28a047397e29"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"5868","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64a7e22c4097074cfbc8382e","5e7092e3878c28a04739ec1a","64a7e22c4097074cfbc8382f","64a7e22c4097074cfbc83830","5e709200878c28a04738e65a","5e70928e878c28a047397e29"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","issn":"2077-0383","eissn":"2077-0383","documentHash":"befa56e5-391b-4865-9035-19691faf400b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6332d91a409707247a20caf6","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"19","documentHash":"8751f783-318c-4a59-afb2-1545120c9bd6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Helicobacter pylori","leptin","idiopathic short stature","ghrelin","children","IGF-1"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058766971"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656db5a340970749a863059c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zadrożna-Nowak","documentHash":"3dd3d9f7-6a80-4632-a253-ef3d0e35dc85"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473ade18","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Forma","uuid":"1137E77B473E963E265A9DB9F7ABEA933899F82E3CFA5A7372BA6D78A9DACFB39FC5EC9FED64E9849026B4CA7C791854F1D63827137D3F3F1A6BADE51707F605","orcidId":"0000-0003-0230-6831","documentHash":"d6364bea-33f4-4e8e-8287-a4e05295ac58"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9c5a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bryś","uuid":"805710C811C07B8C1660B2CE35E0FBE8F32F7D5E05566967DBBEEB4CF912EEEB156A0FFC4CD204223B3B4188A3AEBFC973A9ED434B8D9D965E300B482BE93660","orcidId":"0000-0002-7725-5429","documentHash":"a74179b0-b155-4713-b15f-757dd04d3f0b"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e92","name":"Beata","lastName":"Smolarz","uuid":"F918DFBCDC5C087E494FE75EDFAC77B9086A36276374901F9D0D72B7E4A76C915A8A538AFB9F3D4A590828AB740FD0DD5EA24B94962410825AE1DC9CAD1AB228","orcidId":"0000-0003-3168-062X","documentHash":"30382869-8834-4e69-940f-ea9b0b551f06"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e8e","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Romanowicz","uuid":"CD7A611EC8FE08E21E74AE60097F271769F12F832F27D9C673D5C4EB69985E490F1C6AD4DB044229FE1E81BB9893438F31732CF570FBF54CFF61C9BB02D0C5B3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3898-4861","documentHash":"a9c455a3-86e0-4d6d-a3ac-f2a6709d5f1b"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d69","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zadrożny","uuid":"3D55A5BC433BF72D4CD91001DF0446F8EEE2AAFBA7E2C40682E1B79F1864EC59D7962BDF987A1308F548A5D420DCE181ACA36462B46699E02F47630F77F6CEE0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3078-8698","documentHash":"27ccfdec-674b-4f04-81b2-12366e5b1436"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64a3d15140970738ce758c0b","doi":"10.3390/genes13040608","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/13/4/608","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Analysis of Long Non-Coding RNA (lncRNA) uc.38 and uc.63 Expression in Breast Carcinoma Patients","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background. The role of the transcribed ultra-conserved regions (T-UCRs) has not yet been fully discovered, but the studies showed some indications that impaired expression of T-UCRS were present in malignant tumors, including breast cancer. Aim. The presented work assessed the expression of two transcribed-ultra conserved regions–uc.63 and uc.38–in breast cancer tissue samples. Material and methods. The research was carried out on a group of 100 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and 100 patients (test group) with benign tumors in breast tissue (control group). Results. As a result of the statistical analysis, it was shown that the expression of uc.63 and uc.38 is statistically significant, and, accordingly, higher (p < 0.0001) and lower (p < 0.0001) in the test group than in the control group. Statistical dependency analysis of the expression of uc.63 and uc.38 and the selected clinical and pathological factors showed that the expression of uc.63 statistically drops with the patient’s age (p = 0.04), and is higher in the breast cancer tissue type M1 according to the TNM classification (p = 0.036) and in tissues with overexpressed HER2 (p = 0.035).

The aim of the present meta-analysis was to further investigate the relationship between the serum lipid profile and breast cancer risk. Databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Sciences were searched up to the end of January 2021 using certain MeSH and non-MeSH keywords and combinations to extract related published articles. Twenty-six prospective studies involving 1,628,871 women, of whom 36,590 were diagnosed with breast cancer during the follow-up period met the inclusion criteria. A negative and significant association was found between the HDL-C level and the risk of breast cancer (relative risk (RR): 0.85, 95% CI: 0.72-0.99, I2: 67.6%, p = 0.04). In contrast, TG (RR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.91-1.13, I2: 54.2%, p = 0.79), total cholesterol (TC) (RR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.90-1.06, I2: 67.2%, p = 0.57), apolipoprotein A (ApoA) (RR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.70-1.30, I2: 83.5%, p = 0.78) and LDL-C (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.79-1.09, I2: 0%, p = 0.386) were not associated with breast cancer development. In studies adjusting for hormone use and physical activity, breast cancer risk was positively correlated with TC (RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10).

Consequently, the factors affecting the percentage predicted oxygen uptake at peak exercise (%VO2pred) in patients after COVID-19 with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were assessment. A total of 120 patients recovering from COVID-19 at three to six months after confirmed diagnosis were included. The clinical examinations, laboratory test results, echocardiography, non-invasive body mass analysis, and spiroergometry were evaluated. The subjects were divided into the following groups: study patients’ group with worsen oxygen uptake (%VO2pred < 80%; n = 47) and control group presenting%VO2pred ≥ 80% (n = 73). ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04828629. The male gender and the percent of total body water content (TBW%) were significantly higher in the study group compared to the control group (53 vs. 29%, p = 0.007 and 52.67 (±6.41) vs. 49.89 (±4.59), p = 0.02; respectively).

sequestration (BPS) managed expectantly or using minimally invasive methods. This was a retrospective study of 29 fetuses with suspected BPS managed between 2010 and 2021 in three fetal medicine centers in Poland. Medline was searched to identify cases of BPS managed expectantly or through minimally-invasive methods. In 16 fetuses with BPS, there was no evidence of cardiac compromise. These fetuses were managed expectantly. Thirteen hydropic fetuses with BPS qualified for intrauterine intervention: a thoraco-amniotic shunt (TAS) was inserted in five fetuses, laser coagulation of the feeding vessel was performed in seven cases, and one fetus had combined treatment. In the combined data from the previous and the current study of various percutaneous interventions for BPS associated with hydrops, the survival rate was 91.2% (31/34) for TAS, 98.1% (53/54) for laser coagulation, and 75% (3/4) for intratumor injection of sclerosant. After taking into account cases with available data, the rate of preterm birth before 37 weeks in the group treated with laser coagulation was 14.3% (7/49) compared to 84.6% (22/26) in the group treated with TAS. The need for postnatal sequestrectomy was lower in the group of fetuses treated with laser coagulation 23.5% (12/51) in comparison to fetuses treated with TAS 84% (21/26). In fetuses with BPS without hydrops, progression of the lesion's volume, leading to cardiac compromise, is unlikely. In hydropic fetuses with BPS, intrauterine therapy using minimally invasive methods prevents fetal demise. Both, the rate of preterm birth and the need for postnatal surgery is significantly lower in the group treated with laser coagulation compared to the group treated with TAS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d90"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1724","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["655dfd3040970728e3312600","655dfd3040970728e3312601","655dfd3040970728e3312602","655dfd3040970728e3312603","655dfd3040970728e3312604","655dfd3040970728e3312605","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d90","655dfd3040970728e3312606"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","issn":"2077-0383","eissn":"2077-0383","documentHash":"befa56e5-391b-4865-9035-19691faf400b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62aa4357409707793531231b","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"6","documentHash":"74f23ce3-1222-4bd5-8836-364b8df2b0c1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bronchopulmonary sequestration","fetal therapy","laser coagulation of the feeding vessel","thoraco-amniotic shunt"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059011713"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655f42fe40970733107192d6","name":"Sonu M.

This study sought to determine the prevalence of diabetes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and investigate the association of diabetes severe COVID-19, rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mortality, and need for mechanical ventilation by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis.\nMethods: Individual studies were selected using a defined search strategy, including results up until July 2021 from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to estimate the proportions and level of association of diabetes with clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Forest plots were generated to retrieve the odds ratios (OR), and the quality and risk assessment was performed for all studies included in the meta-analysis.\nResults: The total number of patients included in this study was 10 648, of whom 3112 had diabetes (29.23%). The overall pooled estimate of prevalence of diabetes in the meta-analysis cohort was 31% (95% CI, 0.25-0.38; z = 16.09, P < .0001). Diabetes significantly increased the odds of severe COVID-19 (OR 3.39; 95% CI, 2.14-5.37; P < .0001), ARDS (OR 2.55; 95% CI, 1.74-3.75; P = <.0001), in-hospital mortality (OR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.93-3.09; P < .0001), and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.03; 95% CI, 2.17-4.22; P < .0001).\nConclusions: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that diabetes is significantly associated with increased odds of severe COVID-19, increased ARDS rate, mortality, and need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients.

This entails the need for scrupulous evaluation of the current condition of these patients. The ACHD population is one of the most challenging in contemporary medicine, especially as well-known scales such as the NYHA classification have very limited application. At the moment, there is a lack of universal parameters or scales on the basis of which we can easily capture the moment of deterioration of our ACHD patients' condition. Hence it is crucial to identify factors that are widely available, cheap and easy to use. There are studies showing more and more potential prognostic factors that may be of use in clinical practice: thorough assessment with echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging (e.g., anatomy, ventricular function, longitudinal strain, shunt lesions, valvular defects, pericardial effusion, and pulmonary hypertension), cardiopulmonary exercise testing (e.g., peak oxygen uptake, ventilatory efficiency, chronotropic incompetence, and saturation) and biomarkers (e.g., N-terminal pro-brain type natriuretic peptide, growth-differentiation factor 15, high-sensitivity troponin T, red cell distribution width, galectin-3, angiopoietin-2, asymmetrical dimethylarginine, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein). Some of them are very promising, but more research is needed to create a specific panel on the basis of which we will be able to assess patients with specific congenital heart diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651e94a34097073f99791fb0","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","651e94a34097073f99791fb1","5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1ab","mniswId":"6830","title":"Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine","issn":"2297-055X","eissn":"2297-055X","documentHash":"aed231bf-643d-406c-8bdd-4f9f9101e795"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c412944097077bbdbe72d9","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"8b8da9db-0253-41f6-9fc2-07a0e68364ed"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD)","congenital heart defect (CHD)","congenital heart disease","heart failure","prognostic factor","risk prediction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059015023"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65855d684097076c14c3ded4","name":"Dobromiła ","lastName":"Barańska","documentHash":"4267ed99-97ee-409d-b2ec-65005dd9b554"},{"objectId":"65855d684097076c14c3ded3","name":"Tomasz ","lastName":"Puzio","documentHash":"0234f80b-7322-46d7-bfad-3b3f1f58811c"},{"objectId":"5e70943b878c28a0473b882d","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Olewnik","uuid":"744D654FC6E2B3099186DDE3C6E678D1A4CBCF1F06A7CF45048199E0A83A12CB30A28F0889E52F2084ECB4A64B0B6B03371F2430381B321E26992F986C695B83","orcidId":"0000-0002-6414-9504","documentHash":"6b4cf400-ff28-4436-95fd-fc53f642f53e"},{"objectId":"5e70932d878c28a0473a46ef","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Matera","uuid":"05BA563A58A199C7B1B4DBF5D6A6A9D7A8CBC34BFF91CC442CAED3C4495F46F99AFDF3C84A48B1426D4AF8383BD2D4498838C56CA570344FB16E00474AF0BE4A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5108-369X","documentHash":"a0556fad-c97a-4162-a09a-6c7f1fede87b"},{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e74c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"2D75BB43FD769C8871DCF3722C1DE253B07508F92782B9A2931B4680B14C4B5ED955DCC7E0AF38491A255DF2CC14D7D5ED000E23A5DF1369DD3CF56DCD47529F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0970-2717","documentHash":"bf60ddab-927f-4e7b-85d5-340ab6a99263"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e49b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Podgórski","uuid":"2F2C68C6DF8ED446B1C8A315D4B294D56E70CA4F5EBA21C50DBAF5491763C4624473B2BCBB8D3930903EAF020CC6BA8549722E09D4F434DC1E1FA91D68DC6F54","orcidId":"0000-0003-4513-0602","documentHash":"a2f7d0ee-bbeb-4cad-9b3a-c7717505f593"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"655de54140970728e32e8840","doi":"10.3390/jcm11102929","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=jcm11102929","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Let’s Play the fMRI - Advantages of Gamified Paradigm in Examining the Motor Cortex of Young Children","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Performing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) examination is difficult when a child needs to stay awake and cooperate. Many techniques help to prepare them for the study but without modification of the examination protocol. The objective of this research was to prepare a gamified motor paradigm (“computer game”) that will improve the fMRI examination of young children. Methods: After preparing a dedicated application the fMRI examination was performed on 60 healthy children (10 girls and 10 boys in each age group of 4, 5, and 6 years old). Each child performed the gamified and a standard motor paradigm, both based on squeezing a rubber bulb. The effectiveness of squeezing were compared. Results: With the application of the gamified paradigm children completed significantly more active blocks (3.3 ± 1.4) than for the standard paradigm (2.2 ± 1.6) (p < 0.0001). In mixed-effects Poisson regression, age (IRR = 1.9; 95%CI: 1.5–2.5) and application of gamified paradigm (IRR = 5.6; 95%CI: 1.1–28.0) were significantly associated with more completed blocks. Conclusions: The gamified motor paradigm performed better than a standard paradigm in the fMRI examination of children between 4 and 6 years old. It allowed a significant increase in the number of completed active blocks and also better squeezing effectiveness in each block."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70932d878c28a0473a46ef","5e7092de878c28a04739e74c","5e7092db878c28a04739e49b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"2929","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092db878c28a04739e49b","5e70943b878c28a0473b882d","5e70932d878c28a0473a46ef","65855d684097076c14c3ded3","65855d684097076c14c3ded4","5e7092de878c28a04739e74c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","eissn":"2077-0383","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pediatrics","functional magnetic resonance imaging","gaming","paradigm","neuroimaging"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059031943"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"657067724097072aa095ff19","name":"Zvi","lastName":"Kivilevitch","documentHash":"696fa5b4-1999-42a6-badd-3d97ba4d2746"},{"objectId":"657067724097072aa095ff18","name":"Reuven","lastName":"Achiron","documentHash":"297d139a-0800-497f-8bca-755d1ac11e7f"},{"objectId":"657067724097072aa095ff17","name":"Eran","lastName":"Kassif","documentHash":"85d26696-55a8-416c-813a-503b2839db82"},{"objectId":"657067724097072aa095ff16","name":"Ron","lastName":"Bardin","documentHash":"4d7036a7-5682-4ab4-a1e7-55f1bc8691a5"},{"objectId":"657067724097072aa095ff15","name":"Sharon","lastName":"Perlman","documentHash":"c7cc953e-8520-4dd2-9e19-8a53ae06bc47"},{"objectId":"657067724097072aa095ff14","name":"Yinon","lastName":"Gilboa","documentHash":"23025784-3b3f-460f-873d-bc082ec95eec"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d90","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"452EEF9E28C724DA2BCAD7653299E8413D382158CE481419690E60547544B13117A68BE4B9DC510E602EDDF0CE8CEE1975194EC4DDB73177C161A3D0486B3198","orcidId":"0000-0001-8990-2761","documentHash":"dd151921-e4ba-44d6-88f0-87b5d38b6053"},{"objectId":"5e7094f1878c28a0473c78da","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Zych-Krekora","uuid":"41FB58971C35BBAAF50CF22A44480A0B6DC1B9A70B827F1B001864604F5D60BDE44B13ADCD56B902FFDAA2D705240BDDF618E4DEE7C7935BE96674B2C1A5D32E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4305-8328","documentHash":"9b2fd656-5d14-4858-8120-2d5ef566663f"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eaa4","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":"A2CF3568D4206E833A93B839E76E32B7FF43E216EF45BE2A0811620733662426F7E26BAD1759C72AC2DF8842B07A6D5A3EBAC2E85013B4130FEC64F497EE471E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6900-4347","documentHash":"d6f5ecdd-1d5e-49d3-afd3-d4adaff79962"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Krekora","uuid":"023602F0CB962981B544DDF9820660CB31E5420EA3295BC5FE50BB51857D21EBACBE932514660FB7F1A55CC1003FFF6E468FFDE8C5F86027CF074EA8BCE4E21B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5496-4556","documentHash":"7d44dde3-148f-4886-bf56-5cebf3e85de2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2021-08-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"657067724097072aa095ff13","doi":"10.5114/aoms/140578","publicUri":"https://www.archivesofmedicalscience.com/pdf-140578-68350","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sonographic measurement of the fetal pancreas in women with gestational diabetes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Maternal glycemic state is positively correlated with fetal insulin secretion. Randomized control studies have shown that treatment during pregnancy inhibits to some degree this glycemic effect. Our study aimed to assess fetal pancreas size in a population of treated mothers with gestational diabetes.\nMaterial and methods: A cross-sectional, prospective observational study was conducted. Pregnant women at 19-36 weeks of gestation with pre-gestational diabetes receiving insulin therapy or with gestational diabetes receiving either insulin or oral hypoglycemic therapy were recruited. The fetal pancreas circumference was measured and compared to the normal reference range. The Z score of the difference between measured and normal predicted mean pancreas circumference, the regression analysis throughout pregnancy, and the correlation between estimated fetal weight centile and pancreas circumference were calculated.\n\nResults: Ninety-one women who had gestational diabetes and thirty-four women who had pre-gestational diabetes were included in the study. For both groups, fetal pancreas circumference correlated significantly with abdominal circumference, estimated fetal weight and gestational age. The mean Z score between the predicted pancreas circumference in the group of women diagnosed with gestational diabetes and the predicted pancreas circumference in a normal population peaked at around 24 weeks of gestation (1.1) and decreased gradually afterward to a value of zero at 37 weeks. The mean Z score between the predicted pancreas circumference in the group of women with pre-gestational diabetes and the predicted pancreas circumference in a normal population constantly decreased with duration of pregnancy.

This paper discusses the current knowledge about the possibility of using miRNA as a diagnostic marker and a potential target in modern anticancer therapies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397e92","5e70928f878c28a047397e8e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"2805","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928f878c28a047397e92","655e0b5e40970728e33279d3","5e70928f878c28a047397e8e","655e0b5e40970728e33279d4","655e0b5e40970728e33279d5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"622726342467f06c17648b0c","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"23f3046e-2709-4230-b100-cc3795aafd69"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cancer","miRNA","diagnosis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059118372"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655e095440970728e33247af","name":"Marianna","lastName":"Makowska","documentHash":"1a5f2627-829d-43f5-bf46-64f166c55127"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e92","name":"Beata","lastName":"Smolarz","uuid":"F918DFBCDC5C087E494FE75EDFAC77B9086A36276374901F9D0D72B7E4A76C915A8A538AFB9F3D4A590828AB740FD0DD5EA24B94962410825AE1DC9CAD1AB228","orcidId":"0000-0003-3168-062X","documentHash":"30382869-8834-4e69-940f-ea9b0b551f06"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e8e","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Romanowicz","uuid":"CD7A611EC8FE08E21E74AE60097F271769F12F832F27D9C673D5C4EB69985E490F1C6AD4DB044229FE1E81BB9893438F31732CF570FBF54CFF61C9BB02D0C5B3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3898-4861","documentHash":"a9c455a3-86e0-4d6d-a3ac-f2a6709d5f1b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"655e095440970728e33247ae","doi":"10.3390/jcm11154630","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/15/4630/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"microRNAs in Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (Review of Literature)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recently, many studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) in extracellular bioliquids are strongly associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and its complications.

Their effects on the cardiovascular (CV) risk factors are still controversial. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials (RCTs) as well as a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the links and possible causality between supplementation or serum levels of omega-6 PUFA, CV disease (CVD) and cardiometabolic risk factors.\nMaterial and methods: Selected databases were searched until September 2019 to identify prospective studies investigating the effects of omega-6 PUFA supplementation on CVD events/mortality. Random-effects model meta-analysis was performed for quantitative data synthesis. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to evaluate the optimal sample size to detect a 20% reduction in outcomes after administration of omega-6 PUFAs. The inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, weighted median-based method, MR-Egger and MR-Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) were applied for MR.\n\nResults: The pooled estimate risk ratio (RR) of omega-6 PUFA supplementation was 0.94 for any CVD event (95% CI: 0.77-1.15, I 2 = 66.2%), 1.06 for CVD death (95% CI: 0.73-1.55, I 2 = 66.2%), 0.84 for coronary heart disease (CHD) events (95% CI: 0.61-1.16, I 2 = 79.4%), 0.87 for myocardial infarction (MI) (95% CI: 0.74-1.01, I 2 = 2.3%) and 1.36 for stroke (95% CI: 0.45-4.07, I 2 = 55.3%). In contrast, MR showed that individuals with higher serum omega-6 acid - adrenic acid (AA) levels had a greater risk for CHD events (IVW β = 0.526), MI (IVW β = 0.606) and large artery stroke (IVW β = 1.694), as well as increased levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) (IVW β = 0.417), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (IVW β = 0.806), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (IVW β = 0.820), and lower levels of triglycerides (TG) (IVW β = -1.064) and total cholesterol (TC) (IVW β = -1.064).\nConclusions: Omega-6 PUFA supplementation did not affect the risk for CVD morbidity and mortality. Additionally, based on MR analysis we found that higher AA levels might even significantly increase the risk of CHD, MI and large artery stroke, as well as the levels of FBG and LDL-C, whereas they were negatively associated with TC and TG. Since a considerable chance of heterogeneity was observed for some of the results, further research is needed to elucidate the effects of omega-6 PUFAs on cardiometabolic outcomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"466-479","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["655f36514097073310707d55","655f36514097073310707d56","655f36514097073310707d57","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","655f36514097073310707d58"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e725352467f01e9309075c","title":"Archives of Medical Science","issn":"1734-1922","eissn":"2451-0629","documentHash":"283291bd-ab28-4ee7-8c7b-6493ef2d4278"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655f36514097073310707d54","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"2","documentHash":"c99aa4e5-764d-4a88-a217-d04ee9f92aff"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mendelian randomization; cardiovascular disease","cardiovascular mortality","coronary heart disease","meta-analysis","omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids","stroke"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059118908"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656881fe40970771898e9736","name":"Marian","lastName":"Kacerovsky","documentHash":"3a3b0119-f6f7-45b6-a0a6-b4939924e294"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d90","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"452EEF9E28C724DA2BCAD7653299E8413D382158CE481419690E60547544B13117A68BE4B9DC510E602EDDF0CE8CEE1975194EC4DDB73177C161A3D0486B3198","orcidId":"0000-0001-8990-2761","documentHash":"dd151921-e4ba-44d6-88f0-87b5d38b6053"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afabf","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Wujcicka","uuid":"3856160AD606A67E46480413D81FCBCF021339891702509751CD3F8FB9EC5436B7FAB1EFEC7E49AAD6FC176D0F473A3BCA2C8C00FFD20BA4EE04B3E60D49D2E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2907-1414","documentHash":"53b44cf6-e85f-4030-84d2-15b7834faf70"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eaa4","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":"A2CF3568D4206E833A93B839E76E32B7FF43E216EF45BE2A0811620733662426F7E26BAD1759C72AC2DF8842B07A6D5A3EBAC2E85013B4130FEC64F497EE471E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6900-4347","documentHash":"d6f5ecdd-1d5e-49d3-afd3-d4adaff79962"},{"objectId":"5e7092e1878c28a04739e99b","name":"Beata","lastName":"Leśniczak","uuid":"45B9F82EBA9751494FB1FAE077594AF5F4DCE302120BCC09FF0EA88A11E3C7D643BF7222D2960444803D7BFB4E6D2A394D3136A77D772EF46AE13CF79FDE7338","orcidId":"0000-0001-9519-9259","documentHash":"d4225923-9d26-4096-84c9-65b06ab56c4f"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Krekora","uuid":"023602F0CB962981B544DDF9820660CB31E5420EA3295BC5FE50BB51857D21EBACBE932514660FB7F1A55CC1003FFF6E468FFDE8C5F86027CF074EA8BCE4E21B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5496-4556","documentHash":"7d44dde3-148f-4886-bf56-5cebf3e85de2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"656881fe40970771898e9735","doi":"10.3390/biology11030447","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/11/3/447/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Rs868058 in the Homeobox Gene HLX Contributes to Early-Onset Fetal Growth Restriction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a condition that characterizes fetuses as too small for their gestational age, with an estimated fetal weight (EFW) below the 10th percentile and abnormal Doppler parameters and/or with EFW below the 3rd percentile.

In conclusion, the heterozygous AT genotype in HLX rs868058 can be considered a significant risk factor for the development of early-onset FGR, regardless of adverse pregnancy outcomes in women."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","5e7092e2878c28a04739eaa4","5e7092e1878c28a04739e99b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","5e7092e2878c28a04739eaa4","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d90","5e7093b7878c28a0473afabf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"447","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b7878c28a0473afabf","656881fe40970771898e9736","5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d90","5e7092e2878c28a04739eaa4","5e7092e1878c28a04739e99b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5d878c28514547d873","mniswId":"21252","title":"Biology","eissn":"2079-7737","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b1374be2-6fd9-4375-9a5c-b6e6f192f090"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"621f1a312467f07479812bf2","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"3","documentHash":"297c47f7-0971-442b-9093-b3df786bbe2e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FGR","HLX","SNP","angiogenesis","homeobox genes","pregnancy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059135145"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658c111f4097076c14531d26","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Janikowski","documentHash":"31e2c463-5e2e-4824-ae94-d6d493df5bd9"},{"objectId":"658c111f4097076c14531d25","name":"Marek","lastName":"Rybak","documentHash":"f33b20c9-161b-4c10-b2a6-e4a9f27916d7"},{"objectId":"658c111f4097076c14531d24","name":"Katarzyna ","lastName":"Gryglewska","documentHash":"20b5cb35-5694-4511-ad0e-24b6d0f08abc"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eaaf","name":"Agata","lastName":"Sakowicz","uuid":"D870C866A8208AA363A949D9806D0AC7B8F73CA1075F90D5685BD8D6AEBBDEC4C89409CFDD7488C36C5A41FD8313064F5EEE8D4B1EFC3A9D17D1DD41528B3B8C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5083-2046","documentHash":"e00f208a-4b7c-4234-83ac-e5fc1c483042"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Bielecka-Dąbrowa","uuid":"D0F393DDAB7467C2BC5C8B3D0BF9ACCEA086D9623346F3735F447ECD7D88A2D8523B3602A8617CC9D91F58C615D2A1B36ED821D415D8AE482291C9B05B119E82","orcidId":"0000-0001-6666-3999","documentHash":"6d1fac70-cd18-4685-bbee-f65903d9f1de"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Banach","uuid":"68B01DE963E856688B79EF95809B4608F3108276D6BAC030CC0B692BF60BDC13297F6EFBE2240F624F5681B3DBA155344ECAA8EE50DB71E703B1CD603F94D3C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6690-6874","documentHash":"a27f579b-d7c8-4074-b7d4-265d207dc2a7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"658161004097076c14b69141","doi":"10.3390/jcdd9080238","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2308-3425/9/8/238","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Obesity and Body Mass Components Influence Exercise Tolerance and the Course of Hypertension in Perimenopausal Women","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to identify the potential influence of obesity and body mass components on exercise tolerance assessed in cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), biochemical and echocardiographic parameters and factors correlated with oxygen absorption at the anaerobic threshold in hypertensive women with low levels of physical activity in the perimenopausal period. The study comprised 188 hypertensive women divided, based on body mass index (BMI), into an obesity group and a non-obesity group. Women with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 had significantly higher parameters of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in echocardiography, lower total body water (TBC) in percentage assessed by bioimpedance and significantly worse exercise capacity assessed by CPET. In the study group, VO2 AT (mL/kg/min) correlated positively with TBW (r = 0.4, p < 0.0001) and with the ratio of extracellular water to total body water (ECW/TBW) (r = 0.4, p < 0.00001) and negatively with fat (% and kg) (r = −0.4, p < 0.0001 for both). Obesity negatively affects parameters of diastolic left ventricular function, as well as exercise tolerance in CPET in hypertensive females during the perimenopausal period. The oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold correlates positively with total body water and ECW/TBW and negatively with body fat; this connection is more pronounced in women without obesity.

overlooked in preterm newborns due to immaturity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis in them. The purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence and causes of hypothyroxinemia in preterm newborns, determined by TSH and FT4 serum concentration measurement, performed on the 3-5th day of life. We assessed TSH, FT4 and FT3 serum concentration on the 3-5th day of life in preterm children born at our centre within three consecutive years. We assessed the incidence of hypothyroxinemia, and its cause: primary hypothyroidism, secondary hypothyroidism or low FT4 syndrome - with normal TSH concentration, its dependence - among others - on gestational age (GA), birth body weight (BBW) and being SGA. A total of 525 preterm children were examined. FT4 concentration was decreased in 14.9% of preterm newborns. The most frequent cause of hypothyroxinemia was low FT4 syndrome (79.5%). More than 92% cases of hypothyroxinemia occurred in children born before the 32nd week and/or with BBW below 1500 g. Thus, every fourth child in these groups had a reduced FT4 concentration. Neonates with hypothyroxinemia were significantly lighter than those with normal FT4. In older and heavier neonates with hypothyroxinemia, serious congenital defects were observed. Neither IVH nor SGA nor twin pregnancies predispose children to hypothyroxinemia. Among newborns with untreated hypothyroxinemia in whom TSH and FT4 assessment was repeated within 2-5 weeks, a decreased FT4 concentration was confirmed in 56.1% of cases. As hypothyroxinemia affects 25% of newborns born before the 32nd week of gestation and those in whom BBW is less than 1500g, it seems that in this group of children the newborn screening should be extended to measure serum TSH and FT4 concentration between the 3-5th day of life. In older and heavier neonates, additional serum TSH and FT4 assessment should be limited to children with severe congenital abnormalities but not to all SGA or twins. Despite the fact that the most common form of preterm hypothyroxinemia is low FT4 syndrome, it should be emphasized that FT4 remains lowered on subsequent testing in more them 50% of cases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e3878c28a04739ec1a","5e709478878c28a0473bdd96","5e70928e878c28a047397e29"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a047397620","65940f684097076c148c5b80","5e7092e3878c28a04739ec1a","5e709478878c28a0473bdd96","65940f684097076c148c5b7f","5e70928e878c28a047397e29","65940f684097076c148c5b7e","65940f684097076c148c5b7d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-10","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709478878c28a0473bdd96","65940f684097076c148c5b7d","65940f684097076c148c5b7e","65940f684097076c148c5b7f","65940f684097076c148c5b80","5e709288878c28a047397620","5e70928e878c28a047397e29","5e7092e3878c28a04739ec1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479e6b","mniswId":"6837","title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","eissn":"1664-2392","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0dc23efd-2edf-479e-9da7-911a8f050ab4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["congenital hypothyroidism","hypothyroxinemia","neonatal screening","preterm newborns","small for gestational age","thyroid hormones","thyroid stimulating hormone"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059163498"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658bf5cb4097070a21ec1ed9","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Olczyk","documentHash":"9905fe49-bbda-4d35-98e6-98a0cfb64248"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b8182","name":"Anna","lastName":"Socha-Banasiak","uuid":"89120FCBE084BDD9C8CEE15299236F3524584710D56EFEF4D4F1FDD2F0F30CB97AD57E912D29CF483F3C110C36FC4729E2202E690411C13EEC737480A09384DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3690-6328","documentHash":"d2bdec52-b792-4046-91c2-4b590d4859bd"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e65a","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Czkwianianc","uuid":"F0432822D3A02BCCF4541B7D36AED96FAFC0A5F39211D727C2FC01584F54A694DE9B30A6CDAECF91E645322A71F2C10239C5094159986C8F56B2C051EE4617D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0384-2049","documentHash":"17db819d-b67d-4c14-83f4-52aec358ea9a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"658bf5cb4097070a21ec1ed8","doi":"10.3390/life12030423","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/12/3/423/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Metabolic Bone Disorders in Children with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years, there has been a noticeable increase in the incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases in the pediatric population.

This defect is also accompanied by various types of pulmonary and bronchial hypoplasia and serious anomalies in the pulmonary vascular bed and pulmonary hypertension. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used in extreme cases resistant to standard treatment. There are no reports clearly indicating the optimal time to make a decision about the repair of CDH in paediatric patients on ECMO. In high-risk neonates (with severe hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension), this repair procedure is postponed until the cardiopulmonary parameters are stabilized and pulmonary pressure reduced.\nAim: To present the experience of paediatric surgeons regarding congenital diaphragmatic hernia repair in neonates on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\nMaterial and methods: CDH was surgically repaired in 17 neonates, and of these 7 were on ECMO.\nResults: Surgical problems were encountered intraoperatively: positioning of the patient forced by the cannulae inserted in the carotid vessels, significant generalized oedema, significant capillary bleeding from the surgical wound, difficulties with closing the abdominal cavity. The most common postoperative complications included bleeding from various areas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a0473979ee","5e70928e878c28a047397d1f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"16-21","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658c12594097070a21ee0fba","658c12594097070a21ee0fbb","5e70928b878c28a0473979ee","5e70928e878c28a047397d1f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72ac22467f01e930f1255","title":"Polish Journal of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery","issn":"1731-5530","documentHash":"6117d0cf-5c77-4297-8431-fb48006c980d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658c12594097070a21ee0fb9","year":"2022","volume":"19","number":"1","documentHash":"8068714a-7122-4b5e-8a1a-b0d2be45755d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["congenital diaphragmatic hernia","paediatric surgery","extracorporeal membrane oxygenation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059180569"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658c143c4097070a21ee28fd","name":"Marek","lastName":"Maciejewski","documentHash":"6ac08895-3cfe-45d2-b5ab-8438903573d4"},{"objectId":"658c143c4097070a21ee28fc","name":"Anna","lastName":"Chuda","documentHash":"fb6c75f8-4bf3-4848-9eb8-732c92bf9839"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Bielecka-Dąbrowa","uuid":"D0F393DDAB7467C2BC5C8B3D0BF9ACCEA086D9623346F3735F447ECD7D88A2D8523B3602A8617CC9D91F58C615D2A1B36ED821D415D8AE482291C9B05B119E82","orcidId":"0000-0001-6666-3999","documentHash":"6d1fac70-cd18-4685-bbee-f65903d9f1de"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Banach","uuid":"68B01DE963E856688B79EF95809B4608F3108276D6BAC030CC0B692BF60BDC13297F6EFBE2240F624F5681B3DBA155344ECAA8EE50DB71E703B1CD603F94D3C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6690-6874","documentHash":"a27f579b-d7c8-4074-b7d4-265d207dc2a7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-02-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"658c143c4097070a21ee28fb","doi":"10.1007/s11845-020-02477-z","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11845-020-02477-z.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Role of confirmed and potential predictors of an unfavorable outcome in heart failure in everyday clinical practice","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Heart failure (HF) is the only cardiovascular disease with an ever increasing incidence. HF, through reduced functional capacity, frequent exacerbations of disease, and repeated hospitalizations, results in poorer quality of life, decreased work productivity, and significantly increased costs of the public health system. The main challenge in the treatment of HF is the availability of reliable prognostic models that would allow patients and doctors to develop realistic expectations about the prognosis and to choose the appropriate therapy and monitoring method. At this moment, there is a lack of universal parameters or scales on the basis of which we could easily capture the moment of deterioration of HF patients' condition. Hence, it is crucial to identify such factors which at the same time will be widely available, cheap, and easy to use. We can find many studies showing different predictors of unfavorable outcome in HF patients: thorough assessment with echocardiography imaging, exercise testing (e.g., 6-min walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise testing), and biomarkers (e.g., N-terminal pro-brain type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity troponin T, galectin-3, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein). Some of them are very promising, but more research is needed to create a specific panel on the basis of which we will be able to assess HF patients. At this moment despite identification of many markers of adverse outcomes, clinical decision-making in HF is still predominantly based on a few basic parameters, such as the presence of HF symptoms (NYHA class), left ventricular ejection fraction, and QRS complex duration and morphology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"191","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"213-227","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658c143c4097070a21ee28fc","658c143c4097070a21ee28fd","5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478382","mniswId":"9698","title":"Irish Journal of Medical Science","issn":"0021-1265","eissn":"1863-4362","documentHash":"26b7e693-f387-4063-934d-9304c4788493"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biomarker(s)","Risk prediction","Risk models","Risk factor(s)","Prognosis","Heart failure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059180876"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658c037b4097070a21ed208b","name":"Jadwiga A.","lastName":"Moll","documentHash":"3b04a230-084b-4d4b-a647-c2ba837c2a4d"},{"objectId":"658c037b4097070a21ed208a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kazmierczak","documentHash":"d1a64518-01ab-46c9-b11a-167687cd3992"},{"objectId":"658c037b4097070a21ed2089","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Ostrowska","documentHash":"bc796fd9-cc28-4e1e-9c73-13ea5d721949"},{"objectId":"658c037b4097070a21ed2088","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Goreczny","documentHash":"21d930d1-849d-482c-9ce2-9e471abe0668"},{"objectId":"658c037b4097070a21ed2087","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szaflik","documentHash":"22c79f9d-6c9e-4396-8429-1de3fa92f0d9"},{"objectId":"62d61728752340480574d8db","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"MOLL","uuid":"046D8C38D27D8A38B21973CA31D06875FEAB07243C8589F3D74A839A05B6B9F62C4BD5438C660B87A7DA5C8D7948667D20E104E419933526CBB2846DC7027549","documentHash":"0fd3d4c8-8c2e-4cc8-a9e1-f6f4cdd34b7a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"658c037b4097070a21ed2085","doi":"10.1007/s00246-021-02749-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00246-021-02749-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Predictors of Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction After Conventional Repair for Patients with Interrupted Aortic Arch or Coarctation of the Aorta, Combined with Ventricular Septal Defect: A Single-Center Experience","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) affects survival and reoperation rates after surgical treatment of patients with interruption of the aortic arch (IAA) or coarctation of the aorta (CoA) with ventricular septal defect (VSD). The aim of the study was to determine predictors of LVOTO and to evaluate the relationship between aortic valve (AoV) morphology and the re-intervention rate. Retrospective review of patients, who underwent a conventional repair for IAA/CoA with VSD at a tertiary referral center between 1996 and 2017. The preoperative demographic data as well as pre- and post-operative echocardiographic parameters and re-interventions were reviewed. In the median follow-up of 8.3 years (range of 6.15-10.27) 5 patients (11.9%) from a total of 47 patients included in the study presented with a significant LVOTO. Four of them required reoperation after median period of 2.3 years (range of 0.3-7.9) after the initial surgery. Multivariable logistic regression identified AoV z-score (OR 0.44, p = 0.017) as predictor of LVOTO. The mean AoV z-score before the primary repair was significantly smaller in those with LVOTO as compared to those with unobstructed flow from the LV (- 3.58 ± 1.96 vs. - 1.44 ± 1.55; p = 0.0016). At 1-year follow-up, both groups showed an increase in the AoV z-score (p = 0.98). The re-intervention rate after primary repair (both surgical procedures and percutaneous interventions), either for LVOTO or reCoA, was higher in patients with AoV z-score ≤ - 3 (p = 0.007 vs. p = 0.46) and those, whose aortic annulus was less or equal than patient's weight (kg) + 1.5 mm as compared to those with larger aortic annulus (p = 0.03 vs. p = 0.16). In patients after surgical treatment of IAA/CoA with VSD, the AoV z-score at diagnosis is a significant risk factor for reoperation for LVOTO. With age, AoV growth and z-score improvement is expected. Small AoV at diagnosis is correlated with increased rate of re-intervention for LVOTO and reCoA."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62d61728752340480574d8db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"525-531","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658c037b4097070a21ed2087","658c037b4097070a21ed2088","658c037b4097070a21ed2089","658c037b4097070a21ed208a","62d61728752340480574d8db","658c037b4097070a21ed208b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454791c5","mniswId":"15808","title":"Pediatric Cardiology","issn":"0172-0643","eissn":"1432-1971","documentHash":"50ca9da5-80f5-49bd-9c32-16467183b2fc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658c108a4097070a21ee0191","year":"2022","volume":"43","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"d22cbd9f-ece1-4c90-83b8-ec81a7154698"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aortic valve","Coarctation of the aorta","Interrupted aortic arch","Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059187519"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65868de34097076c14227e0d","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Salachna","documentHash":"7c9958f2-013f-4eb4-b9b4-77f0dd0e9c4d"},{"objectId":"65868de34097076c14227e0c","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kępczyński","documentHash":"416272fd-abbd-464b-8e48-caa690aeb35d"},{"objectId":"65868de34097076c14227e0b","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Chlebna-Sokół","documentHash":"b8d71747-426d-4e9c-b9f2-190f352bf66a"},{"objectId":"65868de34097076c14227e09","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Pinkier","documentHash":"7dc1a4e7-5a7e-433d-842c-93f82059efa1"},{"objectId":"65868de34097076c14227e08","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Michałus","documentHash":"fe617ff9-57d8-4a6d-b7ab-4abe020d66d7"},{"objectId":"63574a29752340623bc01d0b","name":"LENA","lastName":"RUTKOWSKA","uuid":"ACE25FA9FEF67D7D83BB0A15358472E3ACD8C64892D64141F60B9E3CF907AE03D34D8E06AA085E00AC55E7F8A24AE344B81860FE79CD25A2B1D7EDC4D7004D8B","documentHash":"5abdcfb3-09d8-45d4-8b2c-30f10ee4c2a4"},{"objectId":"5f2e1e3b75234011c312178f","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Sałacińska","uuid":"6B44C60B7ACE12508FBA7636EFB0F58CA31391DC4289BA28986C2382E5720E334CAB71B1CC032A7781D8C9B2611CE0E964B45C448CC1D79037988D251F61B19E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1802-8795","documentHash":"d12079e8-ab85-491e-a799-d10d0f145fc6"},{"objectId":"5e7094f0878c28a0473c7699","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gach","uuid":"7A3C2D76764C084CC7D5ECB37445D440554AFC0853894108AA6E8BC4C5526A56A34370A6C87B061F1D93FA8C1FDF14BD35FE91D4A7451FA27EC223FBC7BF97D2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6590-5797","documentHash":"4a2cd1aa-4a61-4e7b-880c-3585d1dc1700"},{"objectId":"5e7092e1878c28a04739ea19","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Jakubowska-Pietkiewicz","uuid":"D4790217B1A682A9942932C8AD28EF4EE68035B43AAA8A2D30DC43D4DEA1F58DFE12265F1F35F80B4BBC5C6D4ACB647CDE6824AC1C00EF24E7D1C76E6BDB757C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5346-5229","documentHash":"80c99ac4-bd49-4555-a0a8-210e92f75e02"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65804ab54097076c14b09102","doi":"10.1002/mgg3.1996","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mgg3.1996","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The first glycine-to-tryptophan substitution in the COL1A1 gene identified in patient with progressively-deforming Osteogenesis imperfecta","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder of connective tissue with variable phenotype and heterogeneous genetic background. Majority of reported mutations are glycine substitutions, whose clinical outcome ranges from mild to perinatal lethal. The phenotype appears to be influenced by the properties of amino acid side chain and the degree of structural aberration of collagen molecules. Since the genotype–phenotype correlation remains unclear, the severity\r\nof mutation is mostly predicted according to previously-reported cases. Although the number of OI variants is constantly expanding, no glycine-to-tryptophan substitutions have been reported in COL1A1 gene.\r\n\r\nMethods: A sample from a 15-year-old girl presenting with progressivelydeforming OI type III was tested using an NGS custom gene panel.

from several shortfalls before February 2022, but the war of aggression started by the Russian leadership is poised to inflict a further severe blow that will have long-lasting consequences for the health of all Ukrainians. In pre-war Ukraine, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) contributed to 91% of deaths, especially cardiovascular diseases (67%). Ukrainians have a high prevalence of risk factors for NCDs ranking among the highest levels reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the European (EU) Region. Cardiovascular disease is one of the key health risks for the conflict-affected Ukrainian population due to significant limitations in access to health care and interruptions in the supply of medicines and resources. The excess mortality observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to a combination of viral illness and chronic disease states, is bound to increase exponentially from poorly treated NCDs. In this report, we discuss the impact of the war on the public health of Ukraine and potential interventions to provide remote health assistance to the Ukrainian population."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"352","pagesFromTo":"76-79","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658157b3409707482c20e5d3","658157b3409707482c20e5d4","658157b3409707482c20e5d5","658157b3409707482c20e5d6","658157b3409707482c20e5d7","658157b3409707482c20e5d8","658157b3409707482c20e5d9","658157b3409707482c20e5da","658157b3409707482c20e5db","658157b3409707482c20e5dc","658157b3409707482c20e5dd","658157b3409707482c20e5de","658157b3409707482c20e5df","658157b3409707482c20e5e0","658157b3409707482c20e5e1","658157b3409707482c20e5e2","658157b3409707482c20e5e3","658157b3409707482c20e5e4","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477244","mniswId":"2010","title":"Atherosclerosis","issn":"0021-9150","eissn":"1879-1484","documentHash":"72146c7b-a7c1-4b3b-92cb-9bb64b543388"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658157b3409707482c20e5d2","year":"2022","volume":"352","documentHash":"a7f5df11-5fd6-4a11-a79c-a220fddeb10d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cardiovascular disease","Healthcare systems","Remote monitoring","Ukraine","War"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059213965"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65817d3f409707482c251ca8","name":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Sahebkar","documentHash":"9d634e01-6767-4339-a354-dccf1d53edb3"},{"objectId":"65817d3f409707482c251ca7","name":"Željko","lastName":"Reiner","documentHash":"b7a9a283-403e-48d1-a5d3-063dd3e0622e"},{"objectId":"65817d3f409707482c251ca6","name":"Farzaneh","lastName":"Fathi","documentHash":"66fd198a-1043-4270-854f-30de2323bb2a"},{"objectId":"65817d3f409707482c251ca5","name":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Amin","documentHash":"fc854e19-b009-40d6-8b74-77d00ba56c7b"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Banach","uuid":"68B01DE963E856688B79EF95809B4608F3108276D6BAC030CC0B692BF60BDC13297F6EFBE2240F624F5681B3DBA155344ECAA8EE50DB71E703B1CD603F94D3C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6690-6874","documentHash":"a27f579b-d7c8-4074-b7d4-265d207dc2a7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2021-03-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65817d3f409707482c251ca4","doi":"10.5114/aoms/123225","publicUri":"https://www.archivesofmedicalscience.com/pdf-123225-62842","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The role of statins in lung cancer","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lung cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related mortality in the 21st century. Statins as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase not only reduce the cholesterol levels in the blood and decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease but may also play an important role in the prevention and treatment of lung cancer. Statins have several antitumor properties including the ability to reduce cell proliferation and angiogenesis, decrease invasion and synergistic suppression of lung cancer progression. Statins induce tumor cell apoptosis by inhibition of downstream products such as small GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Ras and Rac, which are dependent on isoprenylation. Statins reduce angiogenesis in tumors by down-regulation of pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor. In this review, the feasibility and efficacy of statins in the prevention and treatment of lung cancer are

influenced by extrinsic factors (specific and non-specific).\n\nMethods\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of these factors represented by nasal allergen challenge (specific factors) and methacholine challenge test (non-specific) on changes in mRNA expression of genes encoding the TGF-β (TGF-β1 and TGF-β3)‒Smad (mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/3 [MPK1/3], Smad1/3/6/7) signaling

There were 9 men and 18 women in the intranasal provocation group, and 17 men and 31 women in the methacholine test group. We found that both examined the types of challenges contributed to changes in the relative expression of genes of the TGF-β (TGF-β1 and TGF-β3)‒Smad (MPK1/3, Smad1/3/6/7) signaling pathway in asthmatic patients. A decrease was noted for MAPK1, MAPK3, Smad3, Smad6, and Smad7 genes and an increase of up to 2.5 times for TGF-β1 gene.\n\nConclusions\nOur experiment allows us to conclude that the change in the mRNA expression of the TGF-β1–MPK1/3 and Smad3/6/7 genes occurs after an intranasal allergen and bronchial methacholine challenge."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e0c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e2878c28a04739eb5f","5fc50516085dcb1e6ae0b9b8","5e7092de878c28a04739e75e","5e7092e3878c28a04739ebdf","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4689","616644a875234017e052cb12"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"7","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e2878c28a04739eb5f","5e7092de878c28a04739e75e","5e709430878c28a0473b7e0c","5fc50516085dcb1e6ae0b9b8","616644a875234017e052cb12","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4689","5e7092e3878c28a04739ebdf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bd38","mniswId":"3797","title":"Clinical and Translational Allergy","issn":"2045-7022","eissn":"2045-7022","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"4cbda377-ab93-4875-a376-8f3e98da185a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6596b25f4097074a390627ba","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"7","documentHash":"21b5c48a-75c0-4a04-ba05-c73afbaa99b0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Smad, TGF, asthma, immunology, inflammation, intranasal allergen and bronchial methacholine challenge, molecular allergy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059263065"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673a07ebfdbe832d85b24cc0","name":"Robert","lastName":"Fabijan","documentHash":"1d01fe30-8019-47a9-ac94-15b93c615224"},{"objectId":"673a07ebfdbe832d85b24cbf","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Polis","documentHash":"562e26c1-1aaa-43a1-9fb2-7571dfcbc5e7"},{"objectId":"673a07ebfdbe832d85b24cbe","name":"Artur","lastName":"Fabijan","documentHash":"f796a544-c1d4-420e-b433-7c6af58a26e9"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739dfe3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Zawadzka-Fabijan","uuid":"A587DA331BBC86F4078240616FA039378F18F86610596B82B1444D4D358F3C6B0C5A29C91F6E4311CABBC01C70FEB1B31A0D78F43D02A4466DC891B8A6ED1027","orcidId":"0000-0002-4031-0930","documentHash":"2dcc897c-b80e-4a28-82f7-dabfc5d1e5fd"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zakrzewski","uuid":"4CA0677A30743D9933C9C424D1E591A406C5379061E85D342FF0248953CA3E79B916EC63CFCC3240F1ACD6E3374CB78962702AACDA7987A0491757DBA21F1D1F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5454-1783","documentHash":"67f4ff93-38c6-48ba-8feb-cda9dbc04351"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d1a","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Nowosławska","uuid":"8875799752E4142855F25E81AE196EE68413104B2F12B63D5FF60DDD1B9130F2458B6DD4DAD648F0B976BB4DA7F12D7B5E3DFBD91D4483BC435F902B0226AEFF","orcidId":"0000-0002-2024-8906","documentHash":"837b744e-fba4-47de-97ee-0f3bff9b7335"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65d093aa4097077496536e67","doi":"10.3390/jpm13121695","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/13/12/1695","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Artificial Intelligence in Scoliosis Classification: An Investigation of Language-Based Models","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Open-source artificial intelligence models are finding free application in various industries, including computer science and medicine. Their clinical potential, especially in assisting diagnosis and therapy, is the subject of increasingly intensive research. Due to the growing interest in AI for diagnostics, we conducted a study evaluating the abilities of AI models, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and Scholar AI, in classifying single-curve scoliosis based on radiological descriptions. Fifty-six posturographic images depicting single-curve scoliosis were selected and assessed by two independent neurosurgery specialists, who classified them as mild, moderate, or severe based on Cobb angles. Subsequently, descriptions were developed that accurately characterized the degree of spinal deformation, based on the measured values of Cobb angles. These descriptions were then provided to AI language models to assess their proficiency in diagnosing spinal pathologies. The artificial intelligence models conducted classification using the provided data. Our study also focused on identifying specific sources of information and criteria applied in their decision-making algorithms, aiming for a deeper understanding of the determinants influencing AI decision processes in scoliosis classification. The classification quality of the predictions was evaluated using performance evaluation metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, and balanced accuracy. Our study strongly supported our hypothesis, showing that among four AI models, ChatGPT 4 and Scholar AI Premium excelled in classifying single-curve scoliosis with perfect sensitivity and specificity. These models demonstrated unmatched rater concordance and excellent performance metrics. In comparing real and AI-generated scoliosis classifications, they showed impeccable precision in all posturographic images, indicating total accuracy (1.0, MAE = 0.0) and remarkable inter-rater agreement, with a perfect Fleiss’ Kappa score. This was consistent across scoliosis cases with a Cobb’s angle range of 11–92 degrees. Despite high accuracy in classification, each model used an incorrect angular range for the mild stage of scoliosis. Our findings highlight the immense potential of AI in analyzing medical data sets. However, the diversity in competencies of AI models indicates the need for their further development to more effectively meet specific needs in clinical practice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","5e70928e878c28a047397d1a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1695","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d8878c28a04739dfe3","673a07ebfdbe832d85b24cbe","673a07ebfdbe832d85b24cbf","673a07ebfdbe832d85b24cc0","5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","5e70928e878c28a047397d1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e309","mniswId":"24289","title":"Journal of Personalized Medicine","eissn":"2075-4426","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0934c293-0199-48ae-83cc-d9ae60aa7a6a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658148d0409707482c1fdfde","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"12","documentHash":"a37eb3fa-a504-4def-aec8-22c3b244af44"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Microsoft Bing","ChatGPT","scoliosis","Scholar AI","artificial intelligence"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059383157"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673a07f2fdbe832d85b24cf5","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Polis","documentHash":"5da247a3-b893-4ad9-9984-1cc5cbb185ec"},{"objectId":"673a07f2fdbe832d85b24cf2","name":"Robert","lastName":"Fabijan","documentHash":"39263fc8-421b-4eb6-aa01-dd04be1f1818"},{"objectId":"673a07f2fdbe832d85b24cf1","name":"Artur","lastName":"Fabijan","documentHash":"6d572dc9-b174-45b1-ba56-f3f7f0b79d1b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739dfe3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Zawadzka-Fabijan","uuid":"A587DA331BBC86F4078240616FA039378F18F86610596B82B1444D4D358F3C6B0C5A29C91F6E4311CABBC01C70FEB1B31A0D78F43D02A4466DC891B8A6ED1027","orcidId":"0000-0002-4031-0930","documentHash":"2dcc897c-b80e-4a28-82f7-dabfc5d1e5fd"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zakrzewski","uuid":"4CA0677A30743D9933C9C424D1E591A406C5379061E85D342FF0248953CA3E79B916EC63CFCC3240F1ACD6E3374CB78962702AACDA7987A0491757DBA21F1D1F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5454-1783","documentHash":"67f4ff93-38c6-48ba-8feb-cda9dbc04351"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d1a","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Nowosławska","uuid":"8875799752E4142855F25E81AE196EE68413104B2F12B63D5FF60DDD1B9130F2458B6DD4DAD648F0B976BB4DA7F12D7B5E3DFBD91D4483BC435F902B0226AEFF","orcidId":"0000-0002-2024-8906","documentHash":"837b744e-fba4-47de-97ee-0f3bff9b7335"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65d093aa4097077496536e42","doi":"10.3390/diagnostics13132142","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/13/2142","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Evaluating Scoliosis Severity Based on Posturographic X-ray Images Using a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining Model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Assessing severe scoliosis requires the analysis of posturographic X-ray images. One way to analyse these images may involve the use of open-source artificial intelligence models (OSAIMs), such as the contrastive language–image pretraining (CLIP) system, which was designed to combine images with text. This study aims to determine whether the CLIP model can recognise visible severe scoliosis in posturographic X-ray images. This study used 23 posturographic images of patients diagnosed with severe scoliosis that were evaluated by two independent neurosurgery specialists. Subsequently, the X-ray images were input into the CLIP system, where they were subjected to a series of questions with varying levels of difficulty and comprehension. The predictions obtained using the CLIP models in the form of probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 were compared with the actual data. To evaluate the quality of image recognition, true positives, false negatives, and sensitivity were determined. The results of this study show that the CLIP system can perform a basic assessment of X-ray images showing visible severe scoliosis with a high level of sensitivity. It can be assumed that, in the future, OSAIMs dedicated to image analysis may become commonly used to assess X-ray images, including those of scoliosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki

expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in breast cancer cell lines (in vitro). Moreover, the data obtained in the in vivo and in vitro studies were correlated with the clinicopathological profiles of the patients. Material for the IHC studies comprised 490 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases and 26 mastopathy tissues. Western blot and RT-qPCR were performed on four breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, BT-474, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231) and the HME1-hTERT (Me16C) normal immortalized breast epithelial cell line (control). The Kaplan&amp;ndash;Meier plotter tool was employed to analyze the predictive value of overall survival of RBMS3 expression at the mRNA level. Cytoplasmatic RBMS3 IHC expression was observed in breast cancer cells and stromal cells. The statistical analysis revealed a significantly decreased RBMS3 expression in the cancer specimens when compared with the mastopathy tissues (p &amp;lt; 0.001). An increased expression of RBMS3 was corelated with HER2(+) cancer specimens (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and ER(&amp;minus;) cancer specimens (p &amp;lt; 0.05). In addition, a statistically significant higher expression of RBMS3 was observed in cancer stromal cells in comparison to the control and cancer cells (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). The statistical analysis demonstrated a significantly higher expression of RBMS3 mRNA in the SK-BR-3 cell line compared with all other cell lines (p &amp;lt; 0.05). A positive correlation was revealed between the expression of RBMS3, at both the mRNA and protein levels, and longer overall survival. The differences in the expression of RBMS3 in cancer cells (both in vivo and in vitro) and the stroma of breast cancer with regard to the molecular status of the tumor may indicate that RBMS3 could be a potential novel target for the development of personalized methods of treatment. RBMS3 can be an indicator of longer overall survival for potential use in breast cancer diagnostic process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Recent studies show high levels of single-strand breaks (SSBs) at specific sites in the genome of postmitotic neurons and point at SSB repair (SSBR) as an important element of homeostasis of the central nervous system. DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) is stabilized in the DNA damage-inducing state by neuronal stimulation, including cortical spreading depression. Impairment in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and X-ray repair cross complementing 1 (XRCC1), key SSBR proteins, may be linked with migraine by transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2). TRPM2 may also mediate the involvement of migraine-related neuroinflammation with PARP-1 activated by oxidative stress–related SSBs. In conclusion, aberrant activity of SSBR evoked by compromised PARP-1 and XRCC1 may contribute to pathological phenomena in the migraine brain. Such aberrant SSBR results in the lack of repair or misrepair of SSBs induced by ROS or resulting from impaired TOP1. Therefore, components of SSBR may be considered a prospective druggable target in migraine."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"277-286","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3","673f2e2efdbe832d85324de4","5e7092e0878c28a04739e95b","673f2e2efdbe832d85324de5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547900b","mniswId":"15003","title":"Neuroscientist","issn":"1073-8584","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"78fa1f92-7dfd-405e-81c1-ef24c0af6e06"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67503151fdbe8342911bb185","year":"2023","volume":"29","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"fccf402c-d03e-40bc-b6bc-722d0f351b4c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["migraine","DNA damage","DNA topoisomerase","XRCC1","DNA single-strand breaks","Access Options","DNA repair","PARP-1"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059712756"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67485d0ffdbe83571762f966","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Preis","documentHash":"6c158c3a-9231-4c7b-8d90-d1c336668eef"},{"objectId":"67485d0ffdbe83571762f965","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Leszczyńska","documentHash":"f726f126-5895-4709-9758-1ff39c0666cd"},{"objectId":"67485d0ffdbe83571762f964","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Węgrzynowski","documentHash":"7d303b9a-cf51-40f4-b73c-68940b25941f"},{"objectId":"647e9a2b40e3ff42bff6007c","name":"JULIA","lastName":"MURLEWSKA","uuid":"6E1DA3DE49A4007683DD7A196C11FD8F9162FAAE1F00850D7E0E8F5FE1434B78FA042E15E5BF5BCF8352120FD3ADDF60D425AF39F823C13247AD232FED7B050C","documentHash":"a5859c82-2e8d-4627-927a-7598dbb50d40"},{"objectId":"624663a87523402df09aa841","name":"OSKAR","lastName":"SYLWESTRZAK","uuid":"E561B0F9502AF894C839255CABC2A558128A5E7A4D4A2E6D912D1DA35BB6D892926654D43B55513438A98C2689C4339394E123C2BF8B5A13CC30BB3FCDB5B29E","documentHash":"4ab0bc47-eea7-401f-99f4-e6d5b5ee3cdc"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d6d","name":"IWONA","lastName":"STRZELECKA","uuid":"A8F6B10C50BBF2BDF29DB47B386D9C2391EBBC9122EF26DE636743A399BBB1422C63D5E5EA677389F4FDACE8201FEE0643C163A3A42C2A0B6580BB7ACB122DF4","orcidId":"0000-0003-3469-7064","documentHash":"df7f9982-7134-4034-b47b-75ec06c0f467"},{"objectId":"5e7092e1878c28a04739e995","name":"MARIA","lastName":"RESPONDEK-LIBERSKA","uuid":"94B91A1B5CABE50A9BD700309AB93021587DFAD8F5F7CA77DC3522ACBFBE051DA93404BFD9310D009B1A1E4D2BBAE5E63D49D1A14A9E8965D4E4C2247D54E32A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0238-2172","documentHash":"455be1ef-661c-40fe-bd1c-2c8964ad265a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66c7abaffdbe8327373fd5eb","doi":"10.3390/jcm12165186","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/16/5186","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Fetal Cardiac Hemodynamic and Sonographic Anomalies in Maternal COVID-19 Infection Depending on Vaccination Status - Polish Multicenter Cohort Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Most obstetrical studies have focused on maternal response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus but much less is known about the effect of COVID-19 on fetal physiology.

In the group of fetuses with normal heart anatomy, normal cardiovascular function had 147 (81%) fetuses and functional cardiovascular anomalies were present in 35 (19%) cases. Functional cardiovascular anomalies were present in 11 (16%) fetuses in the V group, 19 (47%) fetuses in the UV group and 5 (8%) fetuses in the control group (p < 0.01).

Migraine-related effects, such as cortical spreading depolarization and release of calcitonin gene-related peptide, may initiate adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-mediating pro-nociceptive signaling in the meninges causing headaches. Such signaling may be induced by the interaction of ATP with purinergic receptor P2X 7 (P2X7R) on microglial cells leading to a Ca2+ -mediated pH increase in lysosomes and release of autolysosome-like vehicles from microglial cells indicating autophagy impairment.\nMethods: A search in PubMed was conducted with the use of the terms \"migraine,\" \"autophagy,\" \"microglia,\" and \"degradation\" in different combinations.\nResults: Impaired autophagy in microglia may activate secretory autophagy and release of specific proteins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which can be also released through the pores induced by P2X7R activation in microglial cells. BDNF may be likewise released from microglial cells upon ATP- and Ca2+ -mediated activation of another purinergic receptor, P2X4R. BDNF released from microglia might induce autophagy in neurons to clear cellular debris produced by oxidative stress, which is induced in the brain as the response to migraine-related energy deficit. Therefore, migraine-related signaling may impair degradative autophagy, stimulate secretory autophagy in microglia, and degradative autophagy in neurons. These effects are mediated by purinergic receptors P2X4R and P2X7R, BDNF, ATP, and Ca2+ .\nConclusion: Different effects of migraine-related events on degradative autophagy in microglia and neurons may prevent prolonged changes in the brain related to headache attacks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1154-1166","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e95b","5e7092e2878c28a04739eb79","5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3","6746ee42fdbe832d85f38cf6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ea9","mniswId":"7416","title":"Headache","issn":"0017-8748","eissn":"1526-4610","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b9c6e250-6a4a-44ea-9103-81f063487873"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["autophagy","migraine","BDNF","P2X4R","microglia","P2X7R"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059924306"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673f3c66fdbe832d8532d03f","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Zieba","documentHash":"3e1eed31-ab68-4308-ac58-f9dbaf14c077"},{"objectId":"673f3c66fdbe832d8532d03e","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Slomka","documentHash":"dc30582c-cf2e-4f5b-bd9b-2764c27c4bb0"},{"objectId":"5ebedf7d752340254fc42f2c","name":"OSKAR","lastName":"ROSIAK","uuid":"F0F3C77BEFA463B14CFDA149EE836E0307DC8E19F94180E9A702E2EC55D4833BB31DA4D318D92FACF2D31A3532B3419DBEFF914C0FC5084FAD8CACF9B66BA42E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5326-4777","documentHash":"4602a488-a8ef-44a2-a42c-775f9d7ae36f"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ebaf","name":"Anna","lastName":"Piekarska","uuid":"E83A1F466D242FFCBC799404B88D9E62DC19385EC71F51F87F105987847212AC1CE0D1BEE0305CD42E5DFA1446AE3ED0BD91F74A609DD267B378C03C4762BD9D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7188-4881","documentHash":"0e078453-36ae-492e-8f1a-b8c2e0571c46"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673f3c66fdbe832d8532d03d","doi":"10.3390/vaccines11020366","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/11/2/366","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Assessment of Reactivity to the Administration of the mRNA Vaccine after Six Months of Observation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The fast spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus accelerated efforts to create an\r\neffective vaccine, and a novel mRNA vaccine was the first to appear effective. Scientific evidence\r\nregarding mRNA vaccination is limited; therefore, understanding how the immune system responds\r\nto an mRNA vaccine is critical. Our study was aimed at a long-term analysis of the presence and\r\nmaintenance of the immune response using the chemiluminescent method by analyzing the level of\r\nIgG antibodies in vaccinated people who were and were not infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\r\nMaterials and methods: Healthcare workers with a history of COVID-19 or who were naïve to the\r\ninfection were recruited for this study and administered two subsequent doses of the Comirnaty\r\nvaccine. IgG SRBD antibody levels were evaluated every month for six consecutive months using\r\nthe chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). Results: A total of 149 individuals were recruited for\r\nthis study, 68 had evidence of past COVID-19 infection, with 63 exhibiting elevated IgG SRBD\r\nantibody levels at initial evaluation. Statistically significant differences were observed between\r\nCOVID-19 convalescents and non-convalescents at all study time points, with the convalescent group\r\nconsequently representing higher antibody levels. Conclusions: COVID-19 convalescents showed\r\na stronger immune response to the vaccine after the first dose. This group exhibited higher IgG\r\nlevels in all examinations during the observation period. The natural waning of antibody levels\r\ncan be observed within six months.

We analyzed prenatal diagnosis, perinatal outcomes, and follow-up in these patients.\nResults: Our study included a cohort of 31 fetuses with EC, 4 and 27 of whom had partial and complete protrusion of the heart through a ventral defect in the thoracoabdominal wall, respectively. EC was diagnosed by fetal echocardiography at a mean gestational age of 20.3 ± 8.6 weeks (range, 8-35 weeks). Of the four cases, in which the karyotype was performed, all of them had a normal result (1 - 46,XX and 3 - 46,XY). Five patients showed conotruncal abnormalities and six ventricular septal defects. Termination of pregnancy (TOP) was performed in 15 cases (48%) and seven pregnant women had spontaneous fetal demise (22.5%). Of the seven fetuses that were born alive, four of them died, and three infants underwent surgery. Among these three infants, all of them survived, one was 5 months, 13 years old and 29 years old at the time of study completion.\nConclusions: Ectopia cordis is associated with high mortality rates and intracardiac/extra-cardiac defects.

Materials and Methods: It was an observational study of 100 neonates who had fetal echocardiography examinations in the third trimester (mean gestational age during the last echocardiography was 34 ± 3 weeks and mean birth weight was 3550 g). There were two groups: A: normal heart anatomy + no functional anomalies; group B: normal heart anatomy + functional abnormalities. Hyperbilirubinemia was defined as a bilirubin level of >10 mg%. Results: In group A, there were 72 cases and only 5 cases despite having normal heart anatomy and normal heart study that presented additional problems. In group B (28 cases), the prenatal functional findings included tricuspid regurgitation (TR) (15 cases, 53%), pericardial effusion (4 cases, 14%), myocardial hypertrophy (4 cases, 14%), cardiomegaly (2 cases, 7%), abnormal bidirectional blood flow across the foramen ovale (3 cases, 11%), aneurysm of atrial septum (2 case, 7%), abnormal E/A ratio for mitral and tricuspid valve (1 case, 3%), bright spot (3 case, 11%), abnormal Doppler flow in ductus arteriosus compared to aortic arch (difference >60 cm/s) (1 case, 3%), supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (1 case), and mitral regurgitation (1 case, 3%). In group A (n = 72 cases), bilirubin levels of >10 mg/dL were observed in 8% of newborns. In group B (n = 28), bilirubin levels of > 10 m/dL were observed in 46% of cases and TR was present in group B in 53% of cases (15/28 cases). The difference between group A and B in terms of elevated bilirubin levels was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In the case of fetal normal heart anatomy and normal heart study, a good neonatal outcome may be expected. When fetal cardiovascular functional abnormalities in normal heart anatomy are detected, with special attention paid to tricuspid valve regurgitation, a neonatal elevated bilirubin level (mean 11 mg/dL, range 10–15 mg/dL) may be expected."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","5e709288878c28a047397620","5e709413878c28a0473b5d6d","647e9a2b40e3ff42bff6007c","5e7092e1878c28a04739e995","624663a87523402df09aa841"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"6021","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e1878c28a04739e995","5e709413878c28a0473b5d6d","624663a87523402df09aa841","647e9a2b40e3ff42bff6007c","674d79aafdbe835717175e4e","5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","674d79aafdbe835717175e50","5e709288878c28a047397620"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","eissn":"2077-0383","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"650acea74097070d18c03187","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"18","documentHash":"934b2763-78a5-4347-b998-51ab03961fbd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["normal heart","tricuspid regurgitation","bilirubin","prenatal cardiology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059936215"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673f3c69fdbe832d8532d04a","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Zięba","documentHash":"7f26b9f0-f343-4379-bc36-1cc2b40d92fb"},{"objectId":"673f3c69fdbe832d8532d049","name":"Sebastia","lastName":"Słomka","documentHash":"b6c79521-24e8-4221-80e5-24f982161c09"},{"objectId":"5ebedf7d752340254fc42f2c","name":"OSKAR","lastName":"ROSIAK","uuid":"F0F3C77BEFA463B14CFDA149EE836E0307DC8E19F94180E9A702E2EC55D4833BB31DA4D318D92FACF2D31A3532B3419DBEFF914C0FC5084FAD8CACF9B66BA42E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5326-4777","documentHash":"4602a488-a8ef-44a2-a42c-775f9d7ae36f"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ebaf","name":"Anna","lastName":"Piekarska","uuid":"E83A1F466D242FFCBC799404B88D9E62DC19385EC71F51F87F105987847212AC1CE0D1BEE0305CD42E5DFA1446AE3ED0BD91F74A609DD267B378C03C4762BD9D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7188-4881","documentHash":"0e078453-36ae-492e-8f1a-b8c2e0571c46"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673f3c69fdbe832d8532d048","doi":"10.3390/vaccines11101625","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/11/10/1625","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Comparison of Post-Vaccination Response between mRNA and Vector Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in Terms of Humoral Response after Six Months of Observation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has accelerated work on the creation of effective vaccines, both in terms of previously known vector vaccines and new-generation (mRNA) vaccines. The scientific research on vaccination against COVID-19 infection is limited; therefore, understanding how the immune system responds to vaccines is critical. In our study, we conducted a long-term analysis of the presence and persistence of the immune response via chemiluminescence, analyzing the level of IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in subjects vaccinated with two types of mRNA (Comirnaty) and vector (Vaxzevria) vaccines. Materials and methods: Healthcare workers and a group of teachers were recruited for this study according to the 2021 government-launched vaccination calendar. They received two doses of the Comirnaty or Vaxzevria vaccine. SRBD (spike-receptor binding domain) IgG antibody levels were measured monthly for 6 consecutive months with a chemiluminescent assay (CLIA) and neutralizing antibodies for two periods—1 and 5 months from the completion of the vaccination course. Results: 168 people were recruited for this study: 135 people for the mRNA vaccine group and 33 people for the vector vaccine group. Comparing the serum IgG levels between the two types of vaccines, a significant difference in median values can be noted at all time points. In consecutive months, the mRNA-vaccinated group exhibited significantly higher SRBD levels compared to the vector group, with peak concentrations at one month after the complete vaccination cycle (745 AU/mL vs. 15.44 AU/mL; p < 0.001). Peak antibody concentration for the vector vaccine was observed one month later, at the third follow-up visit; however, the median IgG concentration was almost 7.7 times higher for the Comirnaty group. Both products were effective in stimulating neutralizing antibody production after vaccination. Higher median values were observed for the mRNA vaccines in both evaluations. At first evaluation, the median value for NA concentration in the Comirnaty group was 6 times higher than in the Vaxzevria group (median value 12.23 [IQR 27.3] vs. 1.7 [IQR 3.3]; p < 0.001. Conclusions: People vaccinated with the mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty) showed a stronger immune response to the vaccination than the group of people administered the vector vaccine (Vaxzevria). The Comirnaty group showed higher levels of IgG, including neutralizing antibodies, at all time points during the follow-up period, and this was independent of having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection. A natural decrease in antibody levels was seen within 6 months. A booster vaccination may be required. No serious side effects were observed in either group."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedf7d752340254fc42f2c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673f3c69fdbe832d8532d049","673f3c69fdbe832d8532d04a","5ebedf7d752340254fc42f2c","5e7092e2878c28a04739ebaf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d596","mniswId":"20030","title":"Vaccines","issn":"2076-393X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"926968ce-701e-4099-afd9-d226880c5415"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"657af832409707101931b86a","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"10","documentHash":"64541f51-90e5-40f1-bde2-8fa20126a274"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2","vector vaccine","Comirnaty","Vaxzevria","mRNA vaccine","IgG SRBD antibody"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059939011"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674f21fefdbe83571733a707","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Seraficka","documentHash":"28f1c1e9-373a-491b-9fa5-e414648dc14e"},{"objectId":"674f21fefdbe83571733a706","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Puczko-Nogal","documentHash":"ee845b56-793b-4b91-8b3b-0ab178e006c6"},{"objectId":"674f21fefdbe83571733a705","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jander","documentHash":"af1e020b-6e5b-4759-80ac-48498cc2c4f9"},{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c66a9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Pawlak-Bratkowska","uuid":"B50AEBAC4E1E20F890AF07B243617C29A5D2D8D3787B2645D3BFD9367C85E318E0B69FADF277F16FB11EB15EC79F8556F0DE4AB6E344EE60AA696E04E6CE94C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-5072-7983","documentHash":"48c41c55-4ea1-4790-8b1a-03377078b99b"},{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c3192","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Stańczyk","uuid":"1E393D61EEBDA20630533B56E0F3F2F59EE5E00FA1ACDE9DE121AA5D8795A846CD740358526D8EB39152909765430984015349410AF0D121CE96EDEC2BCE4739","orcidId":"0000-0001-6613-1642","documentHash":"9fd73588-0975-4ccf-b825-db810c2d7bb8"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d62","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Tkaczyk","uuid":"A21925A08ED68CED95EF6502C6131A4B6F59EAA91C073A01C558F231317807D60BD4A2AF35AAAF76BCFBD1178F955C36562F9BDBD7E2D3F533F97DC3B0AA660B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1753-7560","documentHash":"ccb9484c-fb9c-4722-aaa9-a95f7cfc61ff"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2023-12-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673f2514fdbe832d8531600f","doi":"10.5114/polp.2023.133531","publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Fosfomycin-prophylaxis-can-reduce-the-risk-of-severe-recurrent-urinary-tract-infections-requiring-hospitalisation-in-children-with-complex-urinary-tract-malformations,127,51985,1,1.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Fosfomycin prophylaxis can reduce the risk of severe  recurrent urinary tract infections requiring hospitalisation in children with complex urinary tract malformations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) with resistant bacterial strains are one of the most troublesome\r\nproblems in children with severe congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT).

The frequency of UTIs, their aetiology and course, frequency and duration of hospitalisation due to UTIs, prophylaxis and treatment outcomes were analysed.\r\nResults: The mean follow-up period was 16 months. Mean number of UTIs during observation was 5 (2–6).\r\nInfections with multi-drug resistant strains were observed in all patients before commencing fosfomycin prophylaxis, on average 21 days after urological procedure. Due to recurrent UTIs with highly resistant or reduced\r\nsusceptibility strains, despite standard prophylaxis, we introduced fosfomycin in 50–70 mg/kg dose once a day\r\nfor 4–9 months what reduced frequency of infections (3.6 vs. 1.0, p = 0.01), infections with decreased susceptibility strains (3.6 vs. 0.0, p = 0.00006) and need for hospitalisations (3.6 vs. 0.2, p = 0.003).

We didn’t record any significant adverse effects of the treatment or bacterial resistance development.\r\nConclusions: In children with urinary tract malformations, and in particular with a history of urological interventions, in the case of recurrent UTIs with strains of reduced susceptibility to antibiotics, several months\r\nof non-standard prophylactic treatment with fosfomycin may be considered."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d62","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3192"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"98","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"285-292","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397d62","5e7094e7878c28a0473c66a9","674f21fefdbe83571733a705","674f21fefdbe83571733a706","674f21fefdbe83571733a707","5e7094c0878c28a0473c3192"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a26a","mniswId":"25476","title":"Pediatria Polska","issn":"0031-3939","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"719b7274-9a7a-4247-b135-3b9831fcc281"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65818416409707482c262e03","year":"2023","volume":"98","number":"4","documentHash":"b04f555a-03a1-4d55-819f-8479da23568d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CAKUT","infants","urinary tract infections","antibiotic prophylaxis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059939899"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6746ee48fdbe832d85f38d2c","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Blasiak","documentHash":"b1f80529-cae0-4a76-82e4-2e6853eb3b19"},{"objectId":"5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3","name":"Michał","lastName":"Fila","uuid":"802F125F8F0CAEC5051D3FBB04D8EABEBBCEE3131B5F8864B3F7BCCCB5D2B4C14A8BB02A8533B99BDDB0788A6B85E63BB6753D0399760C384170E79B3F8E1A8F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0748-7080","documentHash":"b4da1b1e-0d75-4e37-99f2-e9698846b4d2"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eb79","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szczepańska","uuid":"2EFAE4303E2EA675707B4F3A24E7DE23AA4CEFAFBE528A95ADD0290E1BE6FD000446A0BC0C434D496002F571ED31A9CD39E7A1917940ECA2EFCC0E78CF14A77C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9912-5345","documentHash":"e0809707-f19f-469f-b224-61931f75e64d"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e95b","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Pawłowska","uuid":"721787D2C71E01D5FC0EFE65653204D070E0393866584BB758BA35E96BFF83033A326B85FA72EAEB555F0F0C4FE702307F1B7745B75F54EFB46579CAED733E80","orcidId":"0000-0002-5373-4783","documentHash":"b953ddf4-f0a8-4b15-a974-1fd539843503"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673f2e2afdbe832d85324dca","doi":"10.1007/s12035-023-03428-2","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-023-03428-2","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Epigenetic Connections of the TRPA1 Ion Channel in Pain Transmission and Neurogenic Inflammation - a Therapeutic Perspective in Migraine?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Persistent reprogramming of epigenetic pattern leads to changes in gene expression observed in many neurological disorders. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1 (TRPA1), a member of the TRP channels superfamily, is activated by many migraine triggers and expressed in trigeminal neurons and brain regions that are important in migraine pathogenesis. TRP channels change noxious stimuli into pain signals with the involvement of epigenetic regulation. The expression of the TRPA1 encoding gene, TRPA1, is modulated in pain-related syndromes by epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and effects of non-coding RNAs: micro RNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs. TRPA1 may change epigenetic profile of many pain-related genes as it may modify enzymes responsible for epigenetic modifications and expression of non-coding RNAs. TRPA1 may induce the release of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), from trigeminal neurons and dural tissue. Therefore, epigenetic regulation of TRPA1 may play a role in efficacy and safety of anti-migraine therapies targeting TRP channels and CGRP. TRPA1 is also involved in neurogenic inflammation, important in migraine pathogenesis. The fundamental role of TRPA1 in inflammatory pain transmission may be epigenetically regulated. In conclusion, epigenetic connections of TRPA1 may play a role in efficacy and safety of anti-migraine therapy targeting TRP channels or CGRP and they should be further explored for efficient and safe antimigraine treatment. This narrative/perspective review presents information on the structure and functions of TRPA1 as well as role of its epigenetic connections in pain transmission and potential in migraine therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"60","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"5578-5591","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e95b","5e7092e2878c28a04739eb79","5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3","6746ee48fdbe832d85f38d2c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478efd","mniswId":"14562","title":"Molecular Neurobiology","issn":"0893-7648","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d234943c-e112-4518-85be-318d868bd5e0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"675041defdbe8342911d53da","year":"2023","volume":"60","number":"10","doi":"","documentHash":"313e6e6f-351f-4181-99ec-f0fe4c4cfa3e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pain transmission","TRPA1","Migraine","Epigenetics","Neurogenic inflammation","TRP channels"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059940070"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6745a490fdbe832d85eab789","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Błasiak","documentHash":"cc1af2f2-5a13-4992-857a-c43fdc139e44"},{"objectId":"6745a490fdbe832d85eab787","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Chojnacki","documentHash":"cd6e66f8-187c-4f74-934b-c03c30e84f10"},{"objectId":"5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3","name":"Michał","lastName":"Fila","uuid":"802F125F8F0CAEC5051D3FBB04D8EABEBBCEE3131B5F8864B3F7BCCCB5D2B4C14A8BB02A8533B99BDDB0788A6B85E63BB6753D0399760C384170E79B3F8E1A8F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0748-7080","documentHash":"b4da1b1e-0d75-4e37-99f2-e9698846b4d2"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af218","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Chojnacki","uuid":"257153141E60189410E496AF5CE0DA3C8CD24BDC3693C45BCC5A66A9E7C64E53AA3309BDC4C9F6F9E35ECF9440BA9FE54C1A8441DEC7C0BA85BF53C156E8975F","orcidId":"0000-0002-1620-4775","documentHash":"4989eeb7-a5f4-4275-9679-c7c46f8bf41d"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac878","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Konrad","uuid":"560044DE7B3A3CE1767B6B72D6AAC7F840921AC326436A7ACC7F2729E7DF590D105FB0690988144879A5992555C81F7EDD31FB7E32121152DB678B950526E40E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7375-7512","documentHash":"3284382f-66c9-4817-8578-a38f0de6f33b"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa755","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Popławski","uuid":"5A557ECEEEE79F8EA68F20F83E7758E725E40BF011CA2468BC156824ABF8AA48F1F68FE8F43A08C7AFCDFB001764E825C05342C8705001795D4339F1662DC97A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2300-7339","documentHash":"f6c283ca-066f-4c0f-b920-233361789201"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ec23","name":"Anita","lastName":"Gąsiorowska","uuid":"E8ECB03C33B4DD5BF29656CED82D27A3CDBF1C2DE7CEAD684CED051C76F837ABEA22D7773F076525241D01B5C1EA3A6CDC4676B37565D2759DC42FFC31B032AD","orcidId":"0000-0001-8288-3721","documentHash":"0243eb68-58b3-468d-9f3c-6fac1dc55c5e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67407c7dfdbe832d853b68dc","doi":"10.3390/nu15040847","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15040847","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Beneficial Effect of Increased Tryptophan Intake on Its Metabolism and Mental State of the Elderly","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The elderly often suffer from sleep disorders and depression, which contribute to mood disorders. In our previous work, we showed that elderly individuals with mood disorders had a lower intake of TRP and recommended a TRP-based dietary intervention to improve the mental state of such individuals. In this work, we assessed the impact of a TRP-rich diet on the mental state of, and TRP metabolism in, elderly individuals with mood disorders. Forty elderly individuals with depression and sleep disorders and an equal number of elderly subjects without mood disorders were enrolled in this study. TRP intake was evaluated with the nutrition calculator. Patients with mood disorders had a lower TRP intake than their normal counterparts and received a TRP-rich diet with TRP content of 25 mg per kilogram of the body per day for 12 weeks. The mental state was assessed before and after this dietary intervention with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). At those times, urinary levels of TRP and its metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), L-kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), and quinolinic acid (QA) were determined by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and related to creatinine level. After TRP-based dietary intervention, the score of ISI and HAM-D decreased by more than half. A correlation analysis reveals that TRP, 5-HIAA, and KYNA might have anti-depressive action, while KYN and QA—pro-depressive. The levels of TRP, 5-HIAA, and KYNA in urine of mood disorder patients increased, while the levels of KYN and QA decreased. In conclusion, dietary consumption of adequate amount of tryptophan has a beneficial effect on mental health of the elderly with mood disorders and improves metabolism of this amino acid. Therefore, a TRP-enriched diet may be considered as a component of the treatment of elderly individuals with mood disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"847 (1-13)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093af878c28a0473af218","5e7092e3878c28a04739ec23","5e709378878c28a0473aa755","5e70938d878c28a0473ac878","6745a490fdbe832d85eab787","5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3","6745a490fdbe832d85eab789"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","issn":"2072-6643","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"249ff7e0-f443-46aa-b5c4-21f8cf400d2e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e6046e4097072ac2a9d653","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"4","documentHash":"e2ec1cbc-f0fc-4ffa-b4c1-a4b0ead106a0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tryptophan metabolism","tryptophan metabolites","kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism","the elderly","mood disorders","food intake control","tryptophan","dietary intervention"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059947509"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674ee073fdbe832d4f443e57","name":"Katarzyna Wiktoria","lastName":"Jankowska","documentHash":"7ed59b89-7629-434e-b529-415040ac5ace"},{"objectId":"674ee073fdbe832d4f443e56","name":"Nikodem","lastName":"Pietrzak","documentHash":"df4ba989-b3ab-414a-9a45-dc344485a67e"},{"objectId":"5ebedf7d752340254fc42f2c","name":"OSKAR","lastName":"ROSIAK","uuid":"F0F3C77BEFA463B14CFDA149EE836E0307DC8E19F94180E9A702E2EC55D4833BB31DA4D318D92FACF2D31A3532B3419DBEFF914C0FC5084FAD8CACF9B66BA42E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5326-4777","documentHash":"4602a488-a8ef-44a2-a42c-775f9d7ae36f"},{"objectId":"5e7092e1878c28a04739e9af","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Konopka","uuid":"22135CBED7C70CE399487B0DAA154B7EAA6397A1CA9741D45C58F5F0D202290FF7709B0034A61F9B1713446A027E3A874F313405B51B4EBD8893745B461A9075","orcidId":"0000-0001-6202-7506","documentHash":"8bc0c2af-b456-42cd-96d3-63b190003aa4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-06-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"674ee073fdbe832d4f443e54","doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0053.8512","publicUri":"https://otorhinolaryngologypl.com/gicid/pdf/01.3001.0053.8512","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Atrophy of the long process of the incus with unknown origin – a rare cause of acquired conductive hearing loss: A clinical case report and mini-review of the literature","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Among the pediatric population, the most common cause of conductive hearing loss is exudative otitis media. If fluid is not present in the tympanic cavity, an assessment of the middle ear transmission system is recommended.\nAim: To present a clinical case of atrophy of the long process of the incus in a 17-year-old patient with a 10-year history of conductive hearing loss, exhibiting an air-bone gap of 30 to 50 dB in the right ear qualified for exploratory tympanotomy. Literature review of internet databases to identify similar clinical cases.\nMaterial and methods: CARE guidelines were used to standardize the description of the clinical case. Surgical treatment included an exploratory tympanotomy using an endaural approach, visualizing atrophy of the long process of the incus and the connective tissue band connecting the stapes head to the lateral wall of the tympanic cavity. The eardrum was preserved. An ossiculoplasty was performed using autogenic materials – interposition of the incus. Internet databases PubMed and Scopus were searched using the search string „Incus atrophy” OR „Incus necrosis” AND NOT „Stapedectomy”.\nResults: On follow-up one month after surgery a hearing improvement was observed with a reduction in air-bone gap to 10–15 dB. No complications were observed.\nDiscussion: Atrophy of the long process of unknown origin is a very rare cause of acquired conductive hearing loss. A review of literature revealed 8 manuscripts describing similar cases, which are presented and discussed in the manuscript. Ossiculoplasty in such cases might be performed using autogenic or artificial materials as partial ossicular prostheses or bone cement.\nConclusions: Careful evaluation of imaging studies and hearing tests can often identify a defect in the conductive system; exploratory tympanotomy is often required. In cases such as the one presented, interposition of the incus might be a viable option."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki

Trial","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: EMPOWER-Lung 3 part 2 (NCT03409614), a double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study, investigated cemiplimab (antiprogrammed cell death protein 1) plus chemotherapy versus placebo plus chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC without EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 aberrations, with either squamous or nonsquamous histology, irrespective of programmed death-ligand 1 levels. At primary analysis, after 16.4 months of follow-up, cemiplimab plus chemotherapy improved median overall survival (OS) versus chemotherapy alone (21.9 versus 13.0 mo, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.71, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53-0.93, p = 0.014). Here, we report protocol-specified final OS and 2-year follow-up results.\nMethods: Patients (N = 466) were randomized 2:1 to receive histology-specific platinum-doublet chemotherapy, with 350 mg cemiplimab (n = 312) or placebo (n = 154) every 3 weeks for up to 108 weeks. Primary end point was OS; secondary end points included progression-free survival and objective response rates.\nResults: After 28.4 months of median follow-up, median OS was 21.1 months (95% CI: 15.9-23.5) for cemiplimab plus chemotherapy versus 12.9 months (95% CI: 10.6-15.7) for chemotherapy alone (HR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.51-0.82, p = 0.0003); median progression-free survival was 8.2 months (95% CI: 6.4-9.0) versus 5.5 months (95% CI: 4.3-6.2) (HR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.44-0.68, p < 0.0001), and objective response rates were 43.6% versus 22.1%, respectively. Safety was generally consistent with previously reported data. Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or higher was 48.7% with cemiplimab plus chemotherapy and 32.7% with chemotherapy alone.\nConclusions: At protocol-specified final OS analysis with 28.4 months of follow-up, the EMPOWER-Lung 3 study continued to reveal benefit of cemiplimab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC, across programmed death-ligand 1 levels."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum

atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which is still the most common cause of death worldwide. During the last decade, a novel lipid-lowering drug category has emerged, i.e., proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors. Apart from the two available anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (alirocumab and evolocumab), other nucleic acid-based therapies that inhibit or \"silence\" the expression of PCSK9 are being developed. Among them, inclisiran is the first-in-class small interfering RNA (siRNA) against PCSK9 that has been approved by both the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Importantly, inclisiran therapy may improve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target achievement by offering a prolonged and significant LDL-C-lowering effect with the administration of only two doses per year. The present narrative review discusses the ORION/VICTORION clinical trial program that has been designed to investigate the impact of inclisiran on atherogenic lipoproteins and major adverse cardiac events in different patient populations. The results of the completed clinical trials are presented, focusing on the effects of inclisiran on LDL-C and lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) levels as well as on other lipid parameters such as apolipoprotein B and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C). Ongoing clinical trials with inclisiran are also discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"577","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6756bd04fdbe833c07e62a22","6756bd04fdbe833c07e62a23","6756bd04fdbe833c07e62a24","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceed","mniswId":"15947","title":"Pharmaceuticals","issn":"1424-8247","eissn":"1424-8247","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"858fcf28-3fa0-4aea-a4ee-16e4fa145504"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"643e57b64097072d53951290","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"4","documentHash":"7b7b9158-935e-41a8-9763-ce1e33e8b768"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease","inclisiran","lipoprotein (a)","low-density lipoprotein cholesterol","proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059978782"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674ec9cdfdbe832d4f41aeef","name":"Seth S.","lastName":"Martin","documentHash":"ea134637-c791-4104-8786-2805f8facce0"},{"objectId":"674ec9cdfdbe832d4f41aeee","name":"Maged","lastName":"Mohammed","documentHash":"3ea187ab-37fe-4813-82a0-39c7134e67be"},{"objectId":"674ec9cdfdbe832d4f41aeed","name":"Kamal","lastName":"Awad","documentHash":"d430c0be-08ee-4b06-9136-e7c7cd5dee3c"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Banach","uuid":"68B01DE963E856688B79EF95809B4608F3108276D6BAC030CC0B692BF60BDC13297F6EFBE2240F624F5681B3DBA155344ECAA8EE50DB71E703B1CD603F94D3C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6690-6874","documentHash":"a27f579b-d7c8-4074-b7d4-265d207dc2a7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2023-09-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"674ec9cdfdbe832d4f41aeec","doi":"10.5114/aoms/171473","publicUri":"https://www.archivesofmedicalscience.com/pdf-171473-94244","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Association between electronic nicotine delivery systems use and risk of stroke: a meta-analysis of 1,024,401 participants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: To evaluate the relationship between electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use and the risk of stroke when compared to non-smokers.\nMethods: A comprehensive search was conducted until June 15, 2023.

multicenter retrospective study of calcineurin inhibitors in nephrotic syndrome secondary to podocyte gene variants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"While 44-83% of children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) without a proven genetic cause respond to treatment with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), current guidelines recommend against the use of immunosuppression in monogenic SRNS. This is despite existing evidence suggesting that remission with CNI treatment is possible and can improve prognosis in some cases of monogenic SRNS. Herein, our retrospective study assessed response frequency, predictors of response and kidney function outcomes among children with monogenic SRNS treated with a CNI for at least three months. Data from 203 cases (age 0-18 years) were collected from 37 pediatric nephrology centers. Variant pathogenicity was reviewed by a geneticist, and 122 patients with a pathogenic and 19 with a possible pathogenic genotype were included in the analysis. After six months of treatment and at last visit, 27.6% and 22.5% of all patients respectively, demonstrated partial or full response. Achievement of at least partial response at six months of treatment conferred a significant reduction in kidney failure risk at last follow-up compared to no response (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] 0.25, [0.10-0.62]). Moreover, risk of kidney failure was significantly lower when only those with a follow-up longer than two years were considered (hazard ratio 0.35, [0.14-0.91]). Higher serum albumin level at CNI initiation was the only factor related to increased likelihood of significant remission at six months (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 1.16, [1.08-1.24]). Thus, our findings justify a treatment trial with a CNI also in children with monogenic SRNS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki

gold standard after acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Because local and systemic ischemic complications can occur particularly in the early phase (i.e. 1-3 months) after ACS or PCI, the synergistic platelet inhibition of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is of the utmost importance in this early phase. Moreover, the use of the more potent P2Y12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor have shown to further reduce the incidence of ischemic events compared to clopidogrel after an ACS. On the other hand, prolonged and potent antiplatelet therapy are inevitably associated with increased bleeding, which unlike thrombotic risk, tends to be stable over time and may outweigh the benefit of reducing ischemic events in these patients. The duration and composition of antiplatelet therapy remains a topic of debate in cardiology due to competing ischemic and bleeding risks, with guidelines and recommendations considerably evolving in the past years. An emerging strategy, called \"de-escalation\", consisting in the administration of a less intense antithrombotic therapy after a short course of standard DAPT, has shown to reduce bleeding without any trade-off in ischemic events. De-escalation may be achieved with different antithrombotic strategies and can be either unguided or guided by platelet function or genetic testing. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence and provide practical recommendations on the use of different de-escalation strategies in patients with ACS and CCS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"110","pagesFromTo":"1-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67501fc9fdbe8342911a196e","67501fc9fdbe8342911a196f","67501fc9fdbe8342911a1970","67501fc9fdbe8342911a1971","67501fc9fdbe8342911a1972","67501fc9fdbe8342911a1973","67501fc9fdbe8342911a1974","67501fc9fdbe8342911a1975","67501fc9fdbe8342911a1976","67501fc9fdbe8342911a1977","67501fc9fdbe8342911a1978","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bbf","mniswId":"6196","title":"European Journal of Internal Medicine","issn":"0953-6205","eissn":"1879-0828","documentHash":"96d5930f-7b37-4901-8d1b-882219b1e894"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67501fc9fdbe8342911a196d","year":"2023","volume":"110","documentHash":"a46d0805-52e5-4d00-9274-238f88cc33e3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Acute coronary syndrome","Antiplatelet therapy","Chronic coronary syndrome","De-escalation","Percutaneous coronary intervention."]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059998467"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fbf","name":"Maen","lastName":"Hussein","documentHash":"0d68251b-04e3-45f9-b427-03fc06d2d4db"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fbe","name":"Xiaojin","lastName":"Shi","documentHash":"e14cba35-1027-41a0-8415-fc3569659d28"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fbd","name":"Helen","lastName":"Mann","documentHash":"d282e7a3-9d45-4bf2-b37e-35133590232f"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fbc","name":"Zhongwu","lastName":"Lai","documentHash":"1ad7a58b-71a4-4c74-817a-3ff05eb396f1"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fbb","name":"Ross","lastName":"Stewart","documentHash":"b12ceee0-55ff-4481-b9a5-b41eafefd542"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fba","name":"Dolores","lastName":"Mendoza Oliva","documentHash":"c412f684-0e62-4f76-a33d-571db79e257a"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb9","name":"Steven J.M.","lastName":"Gans","documentHash":"c6de32ed-b3cb-4de5-9cf4-e26aae484b04"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb8","name":"Ingel","lastName":"Demedts","documentHash":"eb6ba047-fbe3-4e16-8f96-8ce797cb58b4"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb7","name":"Rajnish","lastName":"Nagarkar","documentHash":"3531f93c-e8a3-47f4-be34-694638fac002"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb6","name":"Nikolay","lastName":"Kislov","documentHash":"701675d7-95f5-4db4-9e8a-5686663c79a0"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb5","name":"Byoung Yong","lastName":"Shim","documentHash":"24cc86ff-ffa9-418c-8bca-68a88277dfea"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb4","name":"Gabriella","lastName":"Gálffy","documentHash":"0c05f713-3cc0-4fcf-9463-00f900e2f2f1"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb3","name":"Shunichi","lastName":"Sugawara","documentHash":"8cee738e-bf94-4b5b-8535-5fbd8f0f84b6"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb2","name":"Byoung Chul","lastName":"Cho","documentHash":"bdddc432-ba2e-4e43-a627-a8f93e59880e"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb1","name":"Igor","lastName":"Bondarenko","documentHash":"cdbbd228-8dcb-42f8-a287-3854ecb28768"},{"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0fb0","name":"Myung-Ju","lastName":"Ahn","documentHash":"22d3c7b7-e403-4ee1-af0e-9fc310421ad5"},{"objectId":"5e7094ee878c28a0473c723f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kalinka","uuid":"597E19244A75851541285A13E9107AD526138CDD0DA112DAEBAF9DA9A62E4D3920BC74509D82C1983B64AC7584BE4CC9D0EC86CC6C6F21C298DA837AB2F6F6B0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4791-8372","documentHash":"dffd12d4-6351-42af-84e0-cc19ead4cb8d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-06-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"675035c5fdbe8342911c0faf","doi":"10.1016/j.jtho.2023.06.013","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1556086423006366?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Durvalumab in Combination With Olaparib Versus Durvalumab Alone as Maintenance Therapy in Metastatic NSCLC: The Phase 2 ORION Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Increased DNA damage triggered through poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition may modify tumor immunogenicity, sensitizing tumors to immunotherapy. ORION (NCT03775486) evaluated the combination of olaparib with durvalumab as maintenance therapy in patients with metastatic NSCLC.\nMethods: ORION is a phase 2, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, international study. Patients with metastatic NSCLC (without activating EGFR or ALK aberrations) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were enrolled to receive initial therapy with durvalumab (1500 mg intravenously; every 3 wk) plus platinum-based chemotherapy for four cycles. Patients without disease progression were then randomized (1:1) to maintenance durvalumab (1500 mg; every 4 wk) plus either olaparib (300 mg orally) or placebo (both twice daily); randomization was stratified by objective response during initial therapy and tumor histologic type. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1).\nResults: Between January 2019 and February 2020, 269 of 401 patients who received initial therapy were randomized. As of January 11, 2021 (median follow-up: 9.6 mo), median PFS was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval: 5.3-7.9) with durvalumab plus olaparib versus 5.3 months (3.7-5.8) with durvalumab plus placebo (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.57-1.02, p = 0.074). Safety findings were consistent with the known profiles of durvalumab and olaparib. Anemia was the most common adverse event (AE) with durvalumab plus olaparib (26.1% versus 8.2% with durvalumab plus placebo). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 AEs (34.3% versus 17.9%) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (10.4% versus 4.5%) was numerically higher with durvalumab plus olaparib versus durvalumab plus

size evaluation is an essential examination in pediatric nephrology. While body length/height is the best predictor of kidney length, age-based and body surface area (BSA)-based normative values may be useful in clinical practice or research. This study aimed to establish ultrasound-based kidney length lambda-mu-sigma (LMS) percentiles by age and BSA in healthy children.\nMethods: In 1758 Polish and Lithuanian children (868 boys, 49%) aged 0-19 years, kidney length was measured using ultrasonography. In all participants, anthropometric measurements were taken and kidney function was evaluated based on serum creatinine concentration. Participants with chronic or kidney diseases, abnormal kidney function, or pathologies in sonographic examination were excluded from the analysis.\nResults: Kidney length (median kidney length) increased progressively from infancy to the age of 18 years, from 60.1 to 114.2 mm in males, and from 57.3 to 105.2 mm in females. A gradual increase of kidney length (50th percentile) in relation to BSA (from 46.1 mm in infants with a BSA of 0-1.2 m2 to 118.3 mm in adolescents with a BSA of 2.6-2.8 m2) was also observed. LMS percentiles by age (stratified by sex) and BSA were determined and presented as graphs and tables of percentiles and LMS parameters by 1-year age intervals and 0.2 m2 of BSA, respectively.\nConclusions: We present the first age- and BSA-based kidney length LMS normative values based on the largest pediatric cohort to date, which can be used in both clinical practice and research studies.

This study was aimed to assess the impact of the implementation of this consensus in clinical practice.\nMethods: Non-interventional, national and multicenter study, with a prospective and retrospective design in two cohorts. Implementation of the consensus was performed on the prospective cohort. Prospective cohort included patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) from December 2020 to March 2022 and were followed-up for 3 months. Retrospective cohort included patients with ACS in the same hospital, matched for main baseline clinical characteristics, between August 2019 to February 2020, with a follow-up of 3 months. Additionally, patients were included if they had previously received lipid-lowering therapy and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) was >55 mg/dL.\nResults: A total of 516 patients were included (245 in the prospective cohort and 271 in the retrospective cohort). Overall, mean age was 67.9 ± 11.4 years, 73.8 % were men, and 35.8 % had diabetes. At discharge, 98.4 % and 98.9 %, respectively (P = 0.71) were taking statins (90.6% vs 88.9 %; P = 0.564 high intensity statins), 58.4% vs 33.2 %; P<0.001 ezetimibe, 1.2% vs 0.4 %; P = 0.35 PCSK9 inhibitors. During the follow-up, the dose of statins was increased in 11.4% vs 3.3 % (P<0.001), and ezetimibe was added in 25.7% vs 25.8 % (P = 0.976). At study end, significantly more patients achieved LDL-C <55 mg/dL in the prospective cohort (45.6% vs 33.5 %; P = 0.013).\nConclusions: The implementation of the Spanish lipid consensus was associated with a significant improvement of LDL-C control after only 3 months."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"756-764","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6756bae5fdbe833c07e608fd","6756bae5fdbe833c07e608fe","6756bae5fdbe833c07e608ff","6756bae5fdbe833c07e60900","6756bae5fdbe833c07e60901","6756bae5fdbe833c07e60902","6756bae5fdbe833c07e60903","6756bae5fdbe833c07e60904","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547856d","mniswId":"10516","title":"Journal of Clinical Lipidology","issn":"1933-2874","eissn":"1876-4789","documentHash":"ab830bb1-6b50-4ae7-8e83-3467a513349e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6756bae5fdbe833c07e608fc","year":"2023","volume":"17","number":"6","documentHash":"37f0b284-587e-46eb-bdac-e68cd2e11561"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Acute coronary syndrome","Control","Ezetimibe","LDL cholesterol","PCSK9 inhibitors","Statins"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060023042"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6756be89fdbe833c07e64832","name":"Peter E","lastName":"Penson","documentHash":"db64f650-3c08-4cc1-b231-52ae141c2368"},{"objectId":"6756be89fdbe833c07e64831","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Paneni","documentHash":"39bf3353-398b-4a4d-ab95-662b2ffbc39c"},{"objectId":"6756be89fdbe833c07e64830","name":"Christopher P","lastName":"Cannon","documentHash":"3b30805a-f150-401a-901c-4edd5ae7609e"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Banach","uuid":"68B01DE963E856688B79EF95809B4608F3108276D6BAC030CC0B692BF60BDC13297F6EFBE2240F624F5681B3DBA155344ECAA8EE50DB71E703B1CD603F94D3C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6690-6874","documentHash":"a27f579b-d7c8-4074-b7d4-265d207dc2a7"}],"objectId":"6756be89fdbe833c07e6482e","doi":"10.1093/eurheartj/ehac556","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-pdf/44/7/544/49171082/ehac556.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Individualized therapy in statin intolerance: the key to success","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Conflict of interest: M.B.: speakers bureau: Amgen, Daichii Sankyo, KRKA, Polpharma, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi, Teva, Viatris, Zentiva; consultant to: Adamed, Amgen, Daichii Sankyo, Esperion, NewAmsterdam, Novartis, Sanofi, Viatris; Grants from Amgen, Sanofi, and Viatris; CMO at Nomi Biotech Corporations; C.P.C.

The exact mechanism for triggering the symptoms is not fully understood. The condition occurs in all age groups and without gender predilection. The purpose of the study was to review the literature on vestibular paroxysmia, discuss criteria for the diagnosis of the disease, diagnostic management, proposed therapy, and present clinical cases from the authors’ own practice.\nMaterial and methods:\nA review of the scientific literature was conducted via the PubMed database using the keywords “vestibular paroxysmia,” “neurovascular conflict cochlear nerve,” and “neurovascular conflict vestibular nerve”. PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews were applied.\n\nResults:\nThere were 146 publications found; after analysis of titles and abstracts, 56 were included in the review; another 10 manuscripts were identified during reference review. Among them, 11 studies were devoted to diagnostic imaging, 19 described the clinical course of the condition based on retrospective studies, 15 were case reports, and 11 other reports and reviews. Following evaluation of this literature, two clinical cases of vestibular paroxysm from the authors’ own practice are described. These cases are presented along with their diagnosis and therapy.\nConclusions:\nImaging studies are of significant value in diagnosing many vascular–neural conflicts, but for vestibular paroxysmia the diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical symptoms and according to the division proposed by the Bárány Society in 2016.

Recent randomized clinical trials and epidemiological studies have provided new data on optimal management of complex patients with CAD. However, frail older adults are still underrepresented in the literature. This narrative review aims to highlight the importance of assessing frailty as an aid to guide therapeutic decision-making and tailor CAD management to the specific needs of older adults, taking into account age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, polypharmacy, and potential drug interactions.

GBM is characterized by an infiltrating growth nature, abundant vascularization, and a rapid and aggressive clinical course. For many years, the standard treatment of gliomas has invariably been surgical treatment supported by radio- and chemotherapy. Due to the location and significant resistance of gliomas to conventional therapies, the prognosis of glioblastoma patients is very poor and the cure rate is low. The search for new therapy targets and effective therapeutic tools for cancer treatment is a current challenge for medicine and science. microRNAs (miRNAs) play a key role in many cellular processes, such as growth, differentiation, cell division, apoptosis, and cell signaling. Their discovery was a breakthrough in the diagnosis and prognosis of many diseases. Understanding the structure of miRNAs may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of cellular regulation dependent on miRNA and the pathogenesis of diseases underlying these short non-coding RNAs, including glial brain tumors. This paper provides a detailed review of the latest reports on the relationship between changes in the expression of individual microRNAs and the formation and development of gliomas.

Methods: We included 56 children, aged 4–18 years, referred to our allergy clinic due to the incidence of adverse reaction during treatment. Skin prick tests and a drug provocation test were performed in all patients. Diagnostics for persistent urticaria were performed. Results: In 56 patients suspected of drug allergy, we proved NSAID hypersensitivity in 17 patients (30.1%). In 84.9% (n = 47) of patients, the clinical manifestations of hypersensitivity revealed angioedema and urticaria. The most common culprit drug among NSAIDs in children was ibuprofen. Thirty-one (55.4%) reactions were immediate, and 25 (44.6%) were delayed or late. Previous history of allergy was a risk factor for NSAID hypersensitivity (p = 0.001). Vitamin D deficiency in the blood serum was a risk factor for NASID hypersensitivity (OR = 5.76 (95% Cl: 1.42–23.41)). Conclusions: Hypersensitivity to NSAIDs is a difficult diagnostic problem in pediatric allergy. The most common manifestation of hypersensitivity to ibuprofen in children is acute urticaria and angioedema. Two important problems in the differential diagnosis are cofactors such as vitamin D levels and viral infections, which require further research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b8182"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1237","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00a6","5e709434878c28a0473b8182","5e7092e2878c28a04739eae1","673af932fdbe832d85b97d72","5e7094ec878c28a0473c6e67"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceed","mniswId":"15947","title":"Pharmaceuticals","issn":"1424-8247","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"56669e7d-d4d7-4326-aa65-87a9099a9b18"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f6f83540970739aa8566e1","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"9","documentHash":"ec17718a-0e13-40d0-8a62-23c1ad421076"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["angioedema","hypersensitivity","children","NSAIDs","urticaria"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060071677"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67505991fdbe83571794928e","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Błasiak","documentHash":"5e127b23-78b8-4b8b-9e77-4f2bd074a064"},{"objectId":"67505991fdbe83571794928d","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sobczuk","documentHash":"da3e2bbf-0e4e-4932-b321-27a954b77c8e"},{"objectId":"5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3","name":"Michał","lastName":"Fila","uuid":"802F125F8F0CAEC5051D3FBB04D8EABEBBCEE3131B5F8864B3F7BCCCB5D2B4C14A8BB02A8533B99BDDB0788A6B85E63BB6753D0399760C384170E79B3F8E1A8F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0748-7080","documentHash":"b4da1b1e-0d75-4e37-99f2-e9698846b4d2"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af218","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Chojnacki","uuid":"257153141E60189410E496AF5CE0DA3C8CD24BDC3693C45BCC5A66A9E7C64E53AA3309BDC4C9F6F9E35ECF9440BA9FE54C1A8441DEC7C0BA85BF53C156E8975F","orcidId":"0000-0002-1620-4775","documentHash":"4989eeb7-a5f4-4275-9679-c7c46f8bf41d"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea4a","name":"Jan","lastName":"Chojnacki","uuid":"837A1BF0AACB7DAE55B3444C5C50465E64784F58140642EFEEC31C19E1F83EE7D54C7D31E80950EC64B5D986D1DF13EC87BA918D264AAC004EC78E9B4C154722","orcidId":"0000-0001-8766-7868","documentHash":"8924d569-053d-498e-a334-a898dd516db5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67505991fdbe83571794928b","doi":"10.3390/nu15020289","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/2/289","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Nutrition and Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) in Migraine","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Targeting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its receptor by antibodies and antagonists was a breakthrough in migraine prevention and treatment. However, not all migraine patients respond to CGRP-based therapy and a fraction of those who respond complain of aliments mainly in the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, CGRP and migraine are associated with obesity and metabolic diseases, including diabetes. Therefore, CGRP may play an important role in the functioning of the gut-brain-microflora axis. CGRP secretion may be modulated by dietary compounds associated with the disruption of calcium signaling and upregulation of mitogen-activated kinase phosphatases 1 and 3. CGRP may display anorexigenic properties through induction of anorexigenic neuropeptides, such as cholecystokinin and/or inhibit orexigenic neuropeptides, such as neuropeptide Y and melanin-concentrating hormone CH, resulting in the suppression of food intake, functionally coupled to the activation of the hypothalamic 3′,5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The anorexigenic action of CGRP observed in animal studies may reflect its general potential to control appetite/satiety or general food intake. Therefore, dietary nutrients may modulate CGRP, and CGRP may modulate their intake. Therefore, anti-CGRP therapy should consider this mutual dependence to increase the efficacy of the therapy and reduce its unwanted side effects. This narrative review presents information on molecular aspects of the interaction between dietary nutrients and CGRP and their reported and prospective use to improve anti-CGRP therapy in migraine."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki

predict postnatal outcome in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) patients. We also aimed to verify the prognostic value of lung-to-head ratio (LHR).\r\n\r\nMaterial and methods:\r\nThe study group included 29 fetuses with CDH. We analyzed potentially prognostic parameters measured using fetal echocardiography and fetal ultrasound. The assessed parameters were compared between the group of patients with CDH who survived to discharge (n=21) and the subset of patients who died before discharge from hospital (n=8).\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nIn survivors, mean z-score for ascending aorta (AAo) diameter was 0.23 ± 0.98 vs – 1.82 ± 1.04 in patients who died (t-test, p=0.0015). In survivors, the main pulmonary artery/ascending aorta ratio was 1.22 ± 0.17 vs 1.46 ± 0.21 in patients who died (t-test, p=0.017).

This study evaluated patient-reported outcomes (PROs).\nMethods: PROs were assessed at day 1 (baseline), the start of each treatment cycle (every 3 weeks) for the first six doses, and then at start of every three cycles, using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) and Quality of Life-Lung Cancer Module (QLQ-LC13) questionnaires. Prespecified analyses included a longitudinal mixed-effect model comparing treatment arms and a time to definitive clinically meaningful deterioration (TTD) analysis performed for global health status/quality of life (GHS/QoL) and all scales from the questionnaires. Between-arm TTD comparisons were made using a stratified log-rank test and proportional hazards model.\nResults: A total of 312 patients were assigned to receive cemiplimab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy and 154 to receive placebo plus chemotherapy; 391 (83.9%) were male and the median age was 63.0 years (range, 25-84). For pain symptoms (EORTC QLQ-C30), a statistically significant overall improvement from baseline (-4.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] -8.36 to -1.60, p = .004) and a statistically significant delay in TTD (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.26-0.60, p < .0001) favoring cemiplimab plus chemotherapy were observed. Statistically significant delays in TTD, all favoring cemiplimab plus chemotherapy, were also observed in functioning and symptom scales. A significant overall improvement from baseline in GHS/QoL was seen for cemiplimab plus chemotherapy compared with nonsignificant overall change from baseline for placebo plus chemotherapy (1.69, 95% CI, 0.20-3.19 vs. 1.08, 95% CI, -1.34 to 3.51; between arms, p = .673). No analyses yielded statistically significant PRO results favoring placebo plus chemotherapy for any QLQ-C30 or QLQ-LC13 scale.\nConclusion: Cemiplimab plus chemotherapy resulted in significant overall improvement in pain symptoms and delayed TTD in cancer-related and lung cancer-specific symptoms and functions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ee878c28a0473c723f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"129","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"2256-2265","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4d7","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4d8","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4d9","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4da","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4db","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4dc","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4dd","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4de","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4df","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4e0","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4e1","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4e2","5e7094ee878c28a0473c723f","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4e3","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4e4","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4e5","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4e6","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4e7","6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4e8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00436ad49b31cced7e287","title":"Cancer, American Cancer Society","issn":"0008-543X","eissn":"1097-0142","documentHash":"5d5d93bf-ed37-421c-ad31-7948344631fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6763f574fdbe830ff2f9b4d6","year":"2023","volume":"129","number":"14","documentHash":"777b9f78-19c8-42f5-a47a-788b41b04485"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["advanced non-small cell lung cancer","cemiplimab","non-small cell lung cancer","patient-reported outcome","quality of life"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060175194"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674d8a59fdbe8324c6683ecb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Maciejewski","documentHash":"10b62600-b347-40c5-b73e-9b50482025c9"},{"objectId":"674d8a59fdbe8324c6683eca","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Lewek","documentHash":"fe743731-6653-44af-a80f-d2298fa2f3fc"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Bielecka-Dąbrowa","uuid":"D0F393DDAB7467C2BC5C8B3D0BF9ACCEA086D9623346F3735F447ECD7D88A2D8523B3602A8617CC9D91F58C615D2A1B36ED821D415D8AE482291C9B05B119E82","orcidId":"0000-0001-6666-3999","documentHash":"6d1fac70-cd18-4685-bbee-f65903d9f1de"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Banach","uuid":"68B01DE963E856688B79EF95809B4608F3108276D6BAC030CC0B692BF60BDC13297F6EFBE2240F624F5681B3DBA155344ECAA8EE50DB71E703B1CD603F94D3C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6690-6874","documentHash":"a27f579b-d7c8-4074-b7d4-265d207dc2a7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"674d8a59fdbe8324c6683ec8","doi":"10.1002/ccr3.8104","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ccr3.8104","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A case of pregnant patient with stenotic bicuspid aortic valve","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Key clinical message: Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) during pregnancy remains challenging; however, the postponement of surgery with the possibility of valvuloplasty as a bridge therapy seems reasonable. Our case showed that despite physiological changes during pregnancy, the aortic valve defect did not worsen, which allowed us to avoid dilemmas related to anticoagulation on artificial valve.\nAbstract: A 31-year-old woman, with a bicuspid aortic aorta, post-aortic valvulotomy, was listed for cardiac surgery because of severe aortic stenosis. However, the operation was postponed due to procreation plans. During the pregnancy and delivery, we did not observe neither deterioration of symptoms nor changes of echocardiographic parameters. Subsequent monthly echocardiographic studies did not reveal a significant increase of peak and mean aortic gradient.Presented case reports showed that despite physiological changes associated with pregnancy, the aortic valve defect did not worsen, which allowed to avoid dilemmas related to anticoagulation on artificial valves."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"8104","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674d8a59fdbe8324c6683eca","674d8a59fdbe8324c6683ecb","5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bd3c","mniswId":"3809","title":"Clinical Case Reports","issn":"2050-0904","eissn":"2050-0904","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"5595a11f-4381-4bd9-8253-6d7c3781d723"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674d8a59fdbe8324c6683ec9","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"12","documentHash":"23ee3557-3615-4fd7-8b70-c447a4134afa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aortic stenosis","bicuspid aortic valve","interventional cardiology","pregnancy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060187407"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67640504fdbe830ff2faa00d","name":"Marta","lastName":"Depczyk-Bukała","documentHash":"041ff72f-7159-4e0e-ab71-72b2f90b261e"},{"objectId":"67640504fdbe830ff2faa00c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Blomberg","documentHash":"12bad282-6804-48d8-a29c-07c5329704d9"},{"objectId":"67640504fdbe830ff2faa00b","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Krysiak","documentHash":"a73b8028-1b5e-4f8d-b8e4-b09f127447ed"},{"objectId":"67640504fdbe830ff2faa00a","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Tomczonek-Moruś","documentHash":"8d095fca-496a-485b-a03c-15d26c323e03"},{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e80c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zeman","uuid":"5222441B5C39CA2C64743E21689C4F77E914D43E7BA812256F5AA81E6CA795763E38D38C4819B52D09D12F94A5B3013BAD2B99377B8F63CF154C2701A89517B7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0136-6453","documentHash":"096ad8cc-a6e1-4574-bc80-90e2cb2b70f8"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d62","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Tkaczyk","uuid":"A21925A08ED68CED95EF6502C6131A4B6F59EAA91C073A01C558F231317807D60BD4A2AF35AAAF76BCFBD1178F955C36562F9BDBD7E2D3F533F97DC3B0AA660B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1753-7560","documentHash":"ccb9484c-fb9c-4722-aaa9-a95f7cfc61ff"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67640504fdbe830ff2faa009","doi":"10.3390/jcm12082850","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/8/2850/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Role of Lung Ultrasonography (LUS) as a Tool for Evaluating Children with Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) is a novel entity. The inflammatory process involves the circulatory, digestive, respiratory, and central nervous systems, as well as the skin. Making a diagnosis requires extensive differential diagnoses, including lung imaging. The aim of our study was to retrospectively assess the pathologies found in lung ultrasound (LUS) in children diagnosed with PIMS-TS and to evaluate the usefulness of the examination in diagnostics and monitoring.\nMethods: The study group consisted of 43 children diagnosed with PIMS-TS, in whom LUS was performed at least three times, including on admission to hospital, on discharge, and 3 months after disease onset.\nResults: Pneumonia (mild to severe) was diagnosed in 91% of the patients based on the ultrasound image; the same number had at least one pathology, including consolidations, atelectasis, pleural effusion, and interstitial or interstitial-alveolar syndrome. By the time of discharge, the inflammatory changes had completely regressed in 19% of the children and partially in 81%. After 3 months, no pathologies were detected in the entire study group.\nConclusion: LUS is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring children with PIMS-TS. Inflammatory lesions of the lungs resolve completely when the generalized inflammatory process subsides."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d62","5e7092de878c28a04739e80c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2850","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67640504fdbe830ff2faa00a","67640504fdbe830ff2faa00b","67640504fdbe830ff2faa00c","67640504fdbe830ff2faa00d","5e70928e878c28a047397d62","5e7092de878c28a04739e80c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","issn":"2077-0383","eissn":"2077-0383","documentHash":"befa56e5-391b-4865-9035-19691faf400b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"643e372a4097076e1e09ad33","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"12","number":"8","documentHash":"87660853-fc72-4a20-9cc7-6df91eb8e47b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MIS-C","PIMS-TS","adolescents","children","intensive care","lung ultrasound","pneumonia"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060187787"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676e6a3ffdbe8322e23bd39e","name":"Lech","lastName":"Dudarewicz","documentHash":"2deb6f38-195c-44b0-a56e-4e53b9c0e7d3"},{"objectId":"676e6a3ffdbe8322e23bd39d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Ałaszewski","documentHash":"6fdeb95d-e073-41e4-8e21-afeda0bb73a8"},{"objectId":"676e6a3ffdbe8322e23bd39c","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kępczyński","documentHash":"e3a7d684-dd00-497e-b0e7-70f87792e241"},{"objectId":"676e6a3ffdbe8322e23bd39b","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Pinkier","documentHash":"7d7e5002-1686-46da-984d-51f4b939bca8"},{"objectId":"63574a29752340623bc01ce7","name":"URSZULA","lastName":"WYSOCKA","uuid":"0511707FD7355DCFAFE3CF96D5D7E7A6FA04549E287013401A6DFB2E0F58113A46C401E65EB394EC15E78C2F7C00E2FBB3CCDB4EE4864FB672B5ECEFE60CEB5B","documentHash":"d59fe8ac-45d2-43ab-9195-c715d283e3c3"},{"objectId":"5f2e1e3b75234011c312178f","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Sałacińska","uuid":"6B44C60B7ACE12508FBA7636EFB0F58CA31391DC4289BA28986C2382E5720E334CAB71B1CC032A7781D8C9B2611CE0E964B45C448CC1D79037988D251F61B19E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1802-8795","documentHash":"d12079e8-ab85-491e-a799-d10d0f145fc6"},{"objectId":"5e7094f0878c28a0473c7699","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gach","uuid":"7A3C2D76764C084CC7D5ECB37445D440554AFC0853894108AA6E8BC4C5526A56A34370A6C87B061F1D93FA8C1FDF14BD35FE91D4A7451FA27EC223FBC7BF97D2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6590-5797","documentHash":"4a2cd1aa-4a61-4e7b-880c-3585d1dc1700"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676e6a3ffdbe8322e23bd39a","doi":"10.3390/jcm12247527","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/24/7527/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"To Test or Not to Test: Routine Thrombophilia Diagnostic Screening of Women with Reproductive Failures","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Recurrent reproductive failure is a global health issue affecting a significant number of women. Thrombophilias have been implicated as a possible cause. Inherited thrombophilias include a single nucleotide variant on factor V Leiden and prothrombin.\nObjective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the following single nucleotide variants: factor V Leiden (c.1601G>A), the prothrombin gene (c.*97G>A) and the reproductive failure in the Polish population.\nMethods: The study was conducted in a group of 545 patients with recurrent pregnancy loss, RPL (≥2 miscarriages), and in a group of 641 patients with infertility. The distribution of genotypes for the selected variants were determined by RFLP-PCR and by the real-time PCR method.\n\nResults: A variant of the F5 gene was found in 5.14% of patients with RPL and in 6.08% of infertile women. A variant of the F2 gene was identified in 0.73% of patients with RPL and in 2.03% of women with infertility. The frequency in the study groups did not differ from that in the general population. No association between the studied variants of the F5 gene or the F2 gene and the predisposition to reproductive wastage was found.\nConclusions: Recommendations for routine thrombophilia testing in women with recurrent miscarriages should be revisited.

2019 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory syndrome caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Heart failure (HF) is associated with a worse prognosis for patients with this viral infection, highlighting the importance of early detection and effective treatment strategies. HF can also be a consequence of COVID-19-related myocardial damage. To optimise the treatment of these patients, one needs to understand the interactions between this disease and viruses. Until now, the validity of the screening for cardiovascular complications after COVID-19 has not been confirmed. There were also no patients in whom such diagnostics seemed appropriate. Until appropriate recommendations are made, diagnosis procedures must be individualised based on the course of the acute phase and clinical symptoms reported or submitted after COVID-19. Clinical phenomena are the criteria for determining the recommended test panel. We present a structured approach to COVID-19 patients with heart involvement."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"245","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67663639ece39855f73e44f9","67696d29fdbe8317b9a3af93","67696d29fdbe8317b9a3af94","5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed62","mniswId":"27400","title":"Journal of Cardiovascular Development and Disease","issn":"2308-3425","eissn":"2308-3425","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3ae5d970-b4af-4961-8f42-0532869cf25c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67696d29fdbe8317b9a3af92","year":"2023","volume":"10","number":"6","documentHash":"6c9223c9-5877-4de6-8e00-ad25a3b692d5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","inflammation","heart failure","coagulopathy","cardiopulmonary exercise testing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060188169"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676527dafdbe832d0ce163aa","name":"Agata","lastName":"Bikiewicz","documentHash":"437824f9-8341-46cf-89f4-9cf0531525b2"},{"objectId":"676527dafdbe832d0ce163a9","name":"Marek","lastName":"Maciejewski","documentHash":"623a9250-2be4-419f-a972-3646da674f28"},{"objectId":"676527dafdbe832d0ce163a8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wittczak","documentHash":"b604657f-a97d-483e-ae17-dbe03e812e18"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Bielecka-Dąbrowa","uuid":"D0F393DDAB7467C2BC5C8B3D0BF9ACCEA086D9623346F3735F447ECD7D88A2D8523B3602A8617CC9D91F58C615D2A1B36ED821D415D8AE482291C9B05B119E82","orcidId":"0000-0001-6666-3999","documentHash":"6d1fac70-cd18-4685-bbee-f65903d9f1de"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e59","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Moszura","uuid":"B926E3EB576F0A30FF5D44C4D375E1458532F03E2300B872FD225E471CFC30F8FBCDC126EC07A2F8021F63789BCAB62F2A54C848234D550FBB1A95877C1FF18F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3876-2791","documentHash":"6ec32b60-9ca0-4d6e-a650-77d327cbfec0"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e58","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mazurek - Kula","uuid":"75BA4295BD3A241E5751E06A3139BE08E6B9A5D25EFD75E032A53B69B3072DAE888D0FBFCF6B1096872D71305B824A04D1DC08760C66E673C2B4ECEDDA93BD14","orcidId":"0000-0001-9445-6815","documentHash":"e23b04e4-c794-4025-a830-6f361de1dfc2"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e3c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Dryżek","uuid":"8B16971779CF73306B1A5B37A75CF8963E949DFE2865BF73B603CE495613BE88302EE5C843C53787C511A721AA490396EEA8F736F9ED9BDE16885E01D10658FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-8361-5224","documentHash":"33a06bf8-e46a-4630-be17-181e64c2d854"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"676527dafdbe832d0ce163a6","doi":"10.1002/ccr3.7222","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ccr3.7222","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Successful complex percutaneous intervention in patient with Fontan circulation and severe heart failure: A case report","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We report the case of a successful complex percutaneous intervention in a patient with Fontan circulation and severe heart failure.

We hypothesized that there were some HLA alleles that were related to both GO and TC and/or LDL levels. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare the TC/LDL results in patients in whom GO-related HLA alleles were present to those in whom they did not occur. HLA classes were genotyped using a next-generation sequencing method in 118 patients with Graves' disease (GD), including 63 and 55 patients with and without GO, respectively. Lipid profiles were assessed at the time of the GD diagnosis. A significant correlation between the presence of GO high-risk alleles (HLA-B*37:01 and C*03:02) and higher TC/LDL levels was found. Additionally, the presence of alleles associated with non-GO GD (HLA-C*17:01 and B*08:01), as well as alleles in linkage disequilibrium with B*08:01 (i.e., HLA-DRB1*03:01 and DQB1*02:01), was correlated with lower TC levels.

Methods: Of 146 patients hospitalised in the Cardiology Department, 82 completed a one-year follow-up (at least 15 months post-COVID-19 recovery). We compared their conditions at initial screening and follow-up to analyse the course of long COVID and exercise intolerance mechanisms. Clinical examinations, laboratory tests, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and body composition analysis were performed. Results: The patients, after one-year follow-up, had significantly higher levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) (p = 0.03), left atrium diameter (LA) (p = 0.03), respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (p = 0.008), and total body water content percentage (TBW%) (p < 0.0001) compared to the 3-month assessment. They also had lower forced vital capacity in litres (FVC) (p = 0.02) and percentage (FVC%) (p = 0.001). The factors independently associated with a decline in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) after one-year follow-up included the percentage of fat (OR 2.16, 95% CI: 0.51–0.77; p = 0.03), end-diastolic volume (EDV) (OR 2.38, 95% CI 0.53–0.78; p = 0.02), and end-systolic volume (ESV) (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 0.52–0.78; p = 0.02). Conclusions: Higher left ventricular volumes and fat content (%) were associated with a reduced peak VO2max when assessed 15 months after COVID-19 recovery."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e2878c28a04739eaaf","67408764fdbe832d853b8813","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","eissn":"2077-0383","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6576b49a4097071b8ef72384","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"24","documentHash":"61c2dc8c-4cd7-4c5f-be0f-cafca26aa5fb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","body mass analysis","maximal oxygen uptake","spiroergometry","long COVID"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197893"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67408762fdbe832d853b8805","name":"Ibadete","lastName":"Bytyci","documentHash":"d4aa335c-f138-4f78-aa3e-b854e82d7d0f"},{"objectId":"67408762fdbe832d853b8803","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Gryglewska-Wawrzak","documentHash":"da0b7bf9-6876-41d0-b11e-62aa4ed524d6"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eaaf","name":"Agata","lastName":"Sakowicz","uuid":"D870C866A8208AA363A949D9806D0AC7B8F73CA1075F90D5685BD8D6AEBBDEC4C89409CFDD7488C36C5A41FD8313064F5EEE8D4B1EFC3A9D17D1DD41528B3B8C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5083-2046","documentHash":"e00f208a-4b7c-4234-83ac-e5fc1c483042"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Bielecka-Dąbrowa","uuid":"D0F393DDAB7467C2BC5C8B3D0BF9ACCEA086D9623346F3735F447ECD7D88A2D8523B3602A8617CC9D91F58C615D2A1B36ED821D415D8AE482291C9B05B119E82","orcidId":"0000-0001-6666-3999","documentHash":"6d1fac70-cd18-4685-bbee-f65903d9f1de"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Banach","uuid":"68B01DE963E856688B79EF95809B4608F3108276D6BAC030CC0B692BF60BDC13297F6EFBE2240F624F5681B3DBA155344ECAA8EE50DB71E703B1CD603F94D3C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6690-6874","documentHash":"a27f579b-d7c8-4074-b7d4-265d207dc2a7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67375266fdbe832d85b0e748","doi":"10.3390/jcm12124160","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/12/4160","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Diagnostic Usefulness of Spiroergometry and Risk Factors of Long COVID in Patients with Normal Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought forth various clinical manifestations and long-term complications, including a condition known as long COVID. Long COVID refers to a persistent set of symptoms that continue beyond the acute phase of the disease. This study investigated the risk factors and the utility of spiroergometry parameters for diagnosing patients with long COVID symptoms. The 146 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with normal left ventricular ejection fraction and without respiratory diseases were included and divided into two groups: the group demonstrating long COVID symptoms [n = 44] and the group without long COVID symptoms [n = 102]. The clinical examinations, laboratory test results, echocardiography, non-invasive body mass analysis, and spiroergometry were evaluated. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04828629. Patients with long COVID symptoms had significantly higher age [58 (vs.) 44 years; p < 0.0001], metabolic age [53 vs. 45 years; p = 0.02)], left atrial diameter (LA) [37 vs. 35 mm; p = 0.04], left ventricular mass index (LVMI) [83 vs. 74 g/m2, p = 0.04], left diastolic filling velocity (A) [69 vs. 64 cm/s, p = 0.01], the ratio of peak velocity of early diastolic transmitral flow to peak velocity of early diastolic mitral annular motion (E/E’) [7.35 vs. 6.05; p = 0.01], and a lower ratio of early to late diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E/A) [1.05 vs. 1.31; p = 0.01] compared to the control group. In cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), long COVID patients presented lower forced vital capacity (FVC) [3.6 vs. 4.3 L; p < 0.0001], maximal oxygen consumption measured during incremental exercise indexed per kilogram (VO2max) [21 vs. 23 mL/min/kg; p = 0.04], respiratory exchange ratio (RER) [1.0 vs. 1.1; p = 0.04], forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) [2.90 vs. 3.25 L; p = 0.04], and a higher ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC%) [106 vs. 100%; p = 0.0002]. The laboratory results pointed out that patients with long COVID symptoms also had a lower rate of red blood cells (RBC) [4.4 vs. 4.6 × 106/uL; p = 0.01]; a higher level of glucose [92 vs. 90 mg/dL; p = 0.03]; a lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimate by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) [88 vs. 95; p = 0.03]; and a higher level of hypersensitive cardiac Troponin T (hs-cTnT) [6.1 vs. 3.9 pg/mL; p = 0.04]. On the multivariate model, only FEV1/FVC% (OR 6.27, 95% CI: 2.64–14.86; p < 0.001) independently predicted the long COVID symptoms. Using the ROC analysis, the FEV1/FVC% ≥ 103 was the most powerful predictor of spiroergometry parameters (0.67 sensitive, 0.71 specific, AUC of 0.73; p < 0.001) in predicting the symptoms of long COVID.

In a study conducted at the Clinic of Thoracic Surgery and Respiratory Rehabilitation in the Regional Multispecialist Center for Oncology and Traumatology of the Nicolaus Copernicus Memorial Hospital in Lodz, the effectiveness of rehabilitation intervention was assessed in 50 patients (n = 27 M, n = 23 F) postlobectomy due to early stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health—ICF Rehabilitation Core Set was used to evaluate the functional profile, the modified Laitinen scale for pain assessment, and the modified Borg scale for breathlessness evaluation. Additionally, lung-expansion time was monitored. The significance level of the statistical tests in this analysis was set at α = 0.05. The study employed an analysis of the normality of the distributions of the numerical variables, reporting of variable distributions, estimation of differences between groups, estimation of differences within groups, estimation of the independence of categorical variables, and regression analysis. The research confirmed that rehabilitation partially improves the functional profile of patients and reduces the sensation of breathlessness postsurgery. The study highlighted the need for future research with a larger number of participants and an extended observation period to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of rehabilitation on patients after lung lobectomy procedures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","5e70928e878c28a047397d1a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6ce3","5e709288878c28a0473976e5","67408272fdbe832d853b872d","67408272fdbe832d853b872e","67408272fdbe832d853b872f","67408272fdbe832d853b8730","67408272fdbe832d853b8731","5e70928e878c28a047397d1a","5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","67408272fdbe832d853b8734"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","eissn":"2077-0383","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65522c6c40970757f3d3557b","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"22","documentHash":"eb0bab48-bb8a-4d33-a39b-de52a1bcba2a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lung cancer","ICF rehabilitation core set","lung lobectomy","international classification functioning","disability and health (ICF)","pulmonary rehabilitation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198056"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67641715fdbe830ff2fbf3f7","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Zawadzka-Starczewska","documentHash":"ab537698-484d-478c-a128-6556df4c9c49"},{"objectId":"67641715fdbe830ff2fbf3f6","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Stasiak","documentHash":"9f7698ff-39d7-440e-a526-b62eefe8aff1"},{"objectId":"5e7094f1878c28a0473c78d9","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Stasiak","uuid":"B264807482104CB5E7482D11529E77EB3F338C9E7F143F54278CD843244AB15837A4C6B2C4F5FC779CC2386790DBC1C21285808F282814124FF056F776E19301","orcidId":"0000-0002-2910-7691","documentHash":"17f41ca9-cd74-4f43-b667-cba0bf843345"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e29","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"9AEED36EF6FDD1C7A152FECD18B74C86EE0F5FC6C9ED4C2598D64A50DA2FC2EE937D8A80C049C92E0412EE6ECAB101D78D8BC8974E862491A24AB18E51685148","orcidId":"0000-0002-8748-3337","documentHash":"7d8b26bd-246c-4611-be81-a715727aeec0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67641715fdbe830ff2fbf3f5","doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2023.1256922","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1256922/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Significance of HLA in Graves’ disease and Graves’ orbitopathy in Asian and Caucasian populations – a systematic review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Graves' disease (GD) and Graves' orbitopathy (GO) development were suspected to be HLA-related in both Asian and Caucasian populations. However, most studies were performed with application of serological methods or low resolution genetic typing, which led to inconsistent results even among the same population. The present review is intended to summarize the state-of-art knowledge on the HLA significance in GD and GO in Asians and Caucasians, as well as to find the most significant alleles for each of the populations.\nMethods: PubMed was searched for relevant articles using the following search terms: HLA plus thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy or Graves' disease or Graves' orbitopathy or thyroid eye disease or thyroid-associated orbitopathy.\nResults: In Asian population GD was found to be associated mostly with B*46:01, DPB1*05:01, DRB1*08:02/03, DRB1*16:02, DRB1*14:03, DRB1*04:05, DQB1*05:02 and DQB1*03:03, while DRB1*07:01, DRB1*01:01, DRB1*13:02, DRB1*12:02 are potentially protective. HLA-B*38:02, DRB1*16:02, DQA1*01:02, DQB1*05:02 can be considered associated with increased risk of GO in Asians, while HLA-B*54:01 may play protective role. In Caucasians, C*07:01, DQA1*05:01, DRB1*03, DQB1*02:01 are associated with GD risk while DRB1*07:01, DQA1*02:01 may be protective.

Only 22.3% of all cases appears to be diagnosed during the second trimester of pregnancy. Since the detection of prenatal aortic coarctations is very low, every effort should be made to change this situation. According to the authors of this study, the CSAi (carotid to subclavian artery index) could serve as a reliable indicator.\nMaterial and methods: Ninety-six fetuses from healthy, single, pregnancies, with good ultrasound visualization between 18 and 27.5 weeks of gestation, and twenty-three fetuses suspected of aortic coarctation (postnatally confirmed) were included in this study. Our first aim was to compare the current most common method of prenatal CoA diagnosis based on the measurement of the aortic z-score in the aortic isthmus using the method suggested by us-CSAi.\n\nResults: Logistic regression coefficients for z-score and CSAi were analyzed as predictors of coarctation occurrence. It appears that 39.4% of coarctation occurrence can be predicted on the basis of the z-score, and 93.5% on the basis of the CSAi. The cut-off value for CSAi in the study group was 0.81 (sensitivity: 95.7%, specificity 99%). Based on the ROC curve analysis, the cut-off value for the carotid to subclavian distance (mm) was determined; the risk of coarctation increased above this value. Based on the Gini index (0.867), this value was set at 2.55 (sensitivity 82.6%, specificity 93.7%).\nConclusions: CSAi measurement is currently the most sensitive method for aortic coarctation detection. For the purpose of our study, this method was applied in diagnostics in the second trimester of pregnancy. This method is easy, reproducible and should be widely introduced into everyday echocardiographic diagnostics of coarctation to minimize the risk of error."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki

patient-centered factors. We analyzed the impact of hospital and dialysis unit characteristics on pediatric dialysis patients' hospitalizations for access-related complications (ARCs).\nMethods: This cross-sectional study involved 102 hemodialysis (HD) and 163 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Data between July 2017 and July 2018 were analyzed.\nResults: Children's hospitals (CHs) had more pediatric nephrologists and longer PD experience (years) than general hospitals (GHs) (p = 0.026 and p = 0.023, respectively). A total of 53% of automated PD (APD) and 6% of continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients were in CHs (p < 0.001). Ninety-three percent of APD and 69% of CAPD patients were treated in pediatric-specific PD units (p = 0.001). CHs had a higher prevalence in providing hemodiafiltration (HDF) than GHs (83% vs. 30%). Ninety-seven percent of HDF vs. 66% for conventional HD (cHD) patients, and 94% of patients with arteriovenous fistula (AVF) vs. 70% of those with central venous catheters (CVC), were dialyzed in pediatric-specific HD units (p = 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively). Eighty patients (51 PD and 29 HD) had 135 (84 PD, 51 HD) hospitalizations. CAPD was an independent risk factor for hospitalizations for infectious ARCs (I-ARCs) (p = 0.009), and a health center's PD experience negatively correlated with CAPD patient hospitalizations for I-ARCs (p = 0.041). cHD and dialyzing in combined HD units significantly increased hospitalization risk for non-infectious (NI-)ARCs (p = 0.044 and p = 0.017, respectively).\nConclusions: CHs and pediatric-specific dialysis units have higher prevalence of APD and HDF use. Hospitalizations for I-ARCs in CAPD are lower in centers with longer PD experience, and pediatric HD units are associated with fewer hospitalizations due to NI-ARCs.

After menopause uterine fibroids stabilize or regress. Every new or growing lesion of the uterus after menopause has to be diagnosed. There is no general definition of fast growing uterine myoma. The presence of fast growing uterine myoma, regardless of its definition, is associated with some clinical issues: it may become symptomatic (pain, bleeding, bulk symptoms), may be responsible for infertility, and a malignant process (leiomyosarcoma) may be present. Regardless of common belief, the risk of sarcoma is not related to the size of the uterus or its fast enlargement. The prevalence of sarcoma in myomas is 0.26%, and in rapidly growing myomas is 0.27%. Treatment should be individualized, selected for the age of the woman and her expectations (preservation of fertility, uterus), symptoms, size and localization of the myomas.

Both overhydration and dehydration are non-physiological states of the body that can adversely affect human health. Congestion and residual congestion are common in patients hospitalized for HF and are associated with poor prognosis and high rates of rehospitalization. However, the clinical problem of dehydration is also prevalent in healthcare and community settings and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This article provides a comprehensive review of the issue of congestion and dehydration in HF, including HF guidelines, possible causes of dehydration in HF, confirmed and potential new diagnostic methods. In particular, a full database search on the relationship between dehydration and HF was performed and all available evidence in the literature was reviewed. The novel hypothesis of chronic subclinical hypohydration as a modifiable risk factor for HF is also discussed. It is concluded that maintaining euvolemia is the cornerstone of HF management. Physicians have to find a balance between decongestion therapy and the risk of dehydration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"2684","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67654f30fdbe832d0ce477f6","67654f30fdbe832d0ce477f7","5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb72","mniswId":"2502","title":"Biomedicines","issn":"2227-9059","eissn":"2227-9059","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0606c349-3dc9-452c-99fd-bb4e4300270c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6527eafc4097076ada0adf15","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"10","documentHash":"113ab670-7ea8-4c34-a911-7dac46ce3f62"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["congestion","bioimpedance","dehydration","euvolemia","heart failure","hydration","overhydration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060247623"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673c742bfdbe832d85c73ce4","name":"Edward","lastName":"Koziróg","documentHash":"dbc4ab19-1638-4838-b370-5026c4d5e995"},{"objectId":"673c742bfdbe832d85c73ce3","name":"Jan","lastName":"Stępniak","documentHash":"09a248b6-5cac-4b5e-85b3-082948b994de"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e0d","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Karbownik-Lewińska","uuid":"5C243A4778B55142A6E201FE36F40E973864AF44630106D25D165390E8E7462CFDEFFB9F3D42C24B9F1504D0C06AF72CBFE38FECED1F8066DA147B010F7FB5E1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3045-5669","documentHash":"fe4d0bb4-a449-41db-87b0-e1ac7f4b6691"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673c742bfdbe832d85c73ce2","doi":"10.3390/toxics11090746","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/11/9/746","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Protective Effect of Exogenous 17β-Estradiol against Experimentally Induced Oxidative Damage to Membrane Lipids Is Stronger in Male vs. Female Porcine Thyroids: Preliminary Results","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It is well-known that thyroid diseases are more prevalent in women than in men. The contribution of sex hormones may explain such disparity. The aim of this study was to check if there are any differences between sexes concerning the effects of 17β-estradiol on oxidative damage to membrane lipids (lipid peroxidation) in porcine thyroid homogenates under basal conditions and in the presence of Fenton reaction (Fe2+ + H2O2→Fe3+ + •OH + OH−) substrates. We observed that 17β-estradiol did not change the basal level of lipid peroxidation (measured spectrophotometrically as concentrations of malondialdehyde + 4-hydroxyalkenals) in thyroid homogenates, and no differences were found between sexes. The lipid peroxidation level in response to Fe2+ + H2O2 plus 17β-estradiol was lower in male thyroids. In turn, in male thyroids, 17β-estradiol reduced experimentally induced lipid peroxidation in as low of a concentration as 0.1 μM, whereas in female thyroids the lowest effective concentration of 17β-estradiol was 10 μM, i.e., 100 times higher than in males. In conclusion, the protective effects of exogenous 17β-estradiol against experimentally induced oxidative damage to membrane lipids is stronger in male than in female thyroids. Our observation suggests that female tissue is less sensitive to the protective effects of exogenous 17β-estradiol. This sexual dimorphism of oxidative processes in the thyroid may constitute one of the mechanisms of the different prevalence of thyroid diseases in women and in men."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397e0d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673c742bfdbe832d85c73ce3","673c742bfdbe832d85c73ce4","5e70928e878c28a047397e0d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d4d6","mniswId":"19614","title":"Toxics","eissn":"2305-6304","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f26fc49f-970c-4aae-a18e-354a629bd08e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6515768e4097070bf2a1e5f0","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"9","documentHash":"a59bb741-8904-4259-aa0b-bae4aba2d6d0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["thyroid","Fenton reaction","17β-estradiol","oxidative stress","sexual dimorphism"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060251035"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffd9","name":"Søren","lastName":"Brunak","documentHash":"94751057-88f1-4c5e-a048-4438daa9a426"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffd8","name":"Wei","lastName":"Gao","documentHash":"88ffc177-7f7e-41d2-b99c-7012244d6e4b"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffd7","name":"Tien Yin","lastName":"Wong","documentHash":"7cd9e17b-0eb6-4644-9f20-7e7249292599"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffd6","name":"Stephen T.","lastName":"Wong","documentHash":"eca995b5-b8a5-4b5d-b3f9-5b11ba338ec2"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffd5","name":"Sheikh Mohammed Shariful","lastName":"Islam","documentHash":"329647a1-8e29-4ac6-b098-a25b3060ed00"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffd4","name":"Roland","lastName":"Eils","documentHash":"2aac7cc6-9209-4deb-be6d-be1c3c0319a5"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffd3","name":"Oliver","lastName":"Kimberger","documentHash":"74809f4c-2ff2-4057-874a-1ae53caa37a0"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffd2","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kletecka-Pulker","documentHash":"2f7e15be-fa37-4787-8305-72c337b91a96"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffd0","name":"Leo Anthony","lastName":"Celi","documentHash":"b212e939-bd7d-473f-bf02-c9b13dab5876"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffcf","name":"Kazem","lastName":"Rahimi","documentHash":"664d6ebb-22c2-4476-a0c6-0f99cda8c6dd"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffce","name":"Josip","lastName":"Car","documentHash":"efa2c19b-bdb3-4216-bb32-6bb26f38cbee"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffcd","name":"Jeroen","lastName":"van der Laak","documentHash":"0f2be014-f3b4-4ff6-b360-68e123293a2d"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffcc","name":"Harald","lastName":"Willschke","documentHash":"716e593d-98bf-400e-915c-b809d7e95935"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffcb","name":"Hanchuan","lastName":"Peng","documentHash":"d53aedd7-9a1d-4ed6-aeec-89a1ddc98302"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffca","name":"Eva","lastName":"Schaden","documentHash":"1aabaf75-0aea-44bc-9610-cdf0943c2982"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffc9","name":"David","lastName":"Bates","documentHash":"4ecb5185-ab9d-44c5-9f60-ef6a7341c0d6"},{"objectId":"663c78984097071b7581ffc8","name":"Daniel S.

(2) Methods: The RV and LV Tei index for the cardiac function were measured in 297 singleton pregnancies, and we identified 25 LGA fetuses. There were 48% of LGA fetuses with a nuchal umbilical cord-LGA/NC-larger for gestational age fetuses with a nuchal cord. NC was detected with a color Doppler during a transverse scan of the fetal neck, when the umbilical cord formed a U shape. All fetuses had normal anatomy and normal uterine, placental, umbilical, intracardiac and cerebral Doppler waveforms values for their gestational age. (3) Results: The RV Tei index was significantly higher in the LGA subgroup vs. AGA (0.6 ± 0.2 vs. 0.50 ± 0.2; p value = 0.01), but in LGA fetuses with a single coil of the nuchal cord, there were not any significant changes in the Tei indexes. (4) Conclusions: The Tei index might not be impacted by the presence of the nuchal cord in LGA fetuses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["647e9a2b40e3ff42bff6007c","5e7092e1878c28a04739e995","624663a87523402df09aa841"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"3778","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["647e9a2b40e3ff42bff6007c","67690cedfdbe834b5155fe98","624663a87523402df09aa841","5e7092e1878c28a04739e995","67690cedfdbe834b5155fe99"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","issn":"1660-4601","eissn":"1660-4601","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"bad4d5e4-600e-403a-9e35-0edb9dd89452"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fc7d154097074e59fb02df","year":"2023","volume":"20","number":"5","documentHash":"122bbd8c-d547-4439-9057-bab57fd56777"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["LGA","nuchal cord","Tei index"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060254276"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673a07effdbe832d85b24cdb","name":"Sara","lastName":"Korabiewska-Pluta","documentHash":"f0b9ed6b-2744-4914-bbce-9c36d6848337"},{"objectId":"673a07effdbe832d85b24cd9","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Polis","documentHash":"4db37393-b718-4c0f-9e59-0e2ec3d6d161"},{"objectId":"673a07effdbe832d85b24cd8","name":"Artur","lastName":"Fabijan","documentHash":"9846afe7-08a7-4bf0-9c4c-3da755f9fe8f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739dfe3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Zawadzka-Fabijan","uuid":"A587DA331BBC86F4078240616FA039378F18F86610596B82B1444D4D358F3C6B0C5A29C91F6E4311CABBC01C70FEB1B31A0D78F43D02A4466DC891B8A6ED1027","orcidId":"0000-0002-4031-0930","documentHash":"2dcc897c-b80e-4a28-82f7-dabfc5d1e5fd"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zakrzewski","uuid":"4CA0677A30743D9933C9C424D1E591A406C5379061E85D342FF0248953CA3E79B916EC63CFCC3240F1ACD6E3374CB78962702AACDA7987A0491757DBA21F1D1F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5454-1783","documentHash":"67f4ff93-38c6-48ba-8feb-cda9dbc04351"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d1a","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Nowosławska","uuid":"8875799752E4142855F25E81AE196EE68413104B2F12B63D5FF60DDD1B9130F2458B6DD4DAD648F0B976BB4DA7F12D7B5E3DFBD91D4483BC435F902B0226AEFF","orcidId":"0000-0002-2024-8906","documentHash":"837b744e-fba4-47de-97ee-0f3bff9b7335"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65d093aa4097077496536e39","doi":"10.3390/diagnostics13122108","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/13/12/2108","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Congenital Anterior Dislocation of the Sacrococcygeal Bone in a Newborn","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a case of a child who was transported to the Neurosurgery Clinic from another hospital for the purpose of performing a surgical procedure of the spinal myelomeningocele.

Imagining examinations are the first-choice methods to detect DIE. The aim of this study is to assess whether rectal water contrast transvaginal sonography (RWC-TVS) can be a useful tool for the estimation of the size of deep bowel endometriotic nodules. This retrospective study includes 31 patients subjected to RWC-TVS who underwent surgery due to deep bowel endometriosis between January 2021 and December 2022. Nodule dimensions measured via ultrasound were compared to those of histopathological samples taken after surgery. In total, 52% of patients had endometriosis limited only to the intestines, 19% had endometriotic nodules located at uterosacral ligaments and posterior vaginal fornix, 6% at the anterior compartment, and 13% at a different location. Additionally, 6% of patients had nodules at more than two locations. In all but one case, the intestinal nodules could be seen on RWC-TVS images. The largest nodule dimension measured via RWC-TVS and the size of the equivalent histopathological sample correlated (R = 0.406, p = 0.03). Thus, RWC-TVS allows for the detection of DIE and moderate estimation of the nodule sizes and should be practiced during a diagnostic process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deef","uid":"bmJzN5wihIiD2B0BrRmdy3w","uuid":"b07a6b1d-45fa-418f-978a-d219aa5f7f6b","name":"Instytut Psychiatrii i Neurologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092db878c28a04739e4de"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deef","parentUuid":"b07a6b1d-45fa-418f-978a-d219aa5f7f6b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deef","rootUuid":"b07a6b1d-45fa-418f-978a-d219aa5f7f6b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397e92","6125ab299543c7051ff01b0b","5e70928f878c28a047397e8e","5e70928e878c28a047397d7a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674f2e9efdbe835717362250","674f2e9efdbe835717362251","6125ab299543c7051ff01b0b","674f2e9efdbe835717362253","5e7092db878c28a04739e4de","5e70928f878c28a047397e92","5e70928f878c28a047397e8e","5e70928e878c28a047397d7a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5f878c28514547e48f","mniswId":"24735","title":"Life","issn":"0024-3019","eissn":"2075-1729","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"8b5e5dcc-e36a-42d5-8ce9-572945a00f64"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["#Enzian classification","DIE","RWC-TVS","endometriosis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060281717"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6745d0fefdbe832d85ebd57a","name":"Kryspin R.","lastName":"Niedzielski","documentHash":"c8164b98-a060-43c1-a0dc-ad8f36325603"},{"objectId":"6745d0fefdbe832d85ebd578","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szesz","documentHash":"a2a6fd0e-f2e2-4db9-9c6f-ce4110a1bb4a"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8932","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Małecki","uuid":"EFA43C18934800AF3898F728E291ABFD587EB07CE3F1A03ADE68184A3BEA3B358356DE8FC3081F4A8D6E2599DEE9C2552D2DC8FDDC286339331E4B9B14089DB4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8014-479X","documentHash":"61578e8c-89dd-4bf2-a7bb-a0c3099e2f4a"},{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e71d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Sibiński","uuid":"E4AC298A36EE72543B6E2E0396D73FD16D2B94A178DD08BF6531F07D361021D297EE190F18AFC2BA2A74AAB1DC1DDA199A0178543D764E46616BB32B0D637F33","orcidId":"0000-0003-2967-0852","documentHash":"d3e885e4-534c-454a-bc57-d591eac53525"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6745d0fefdbe832d85ebd577","doi":"10.1186/s12891-023-06937-2","publicUri":"https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-023-06937-2","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"An evaluation of subtalar titanium screw arthroereisis for the treatment of symptomatic paediatric flatfeet - early results","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background Idiopathic flexible flatfoot is a common condition in children which typically improves with age and\r\nremains asymptomatic. However, the condition can sometimes be more severe, and cause mechanical impairment\r\nor pain. The aim of the study was to perform a prospective clinical, radiological, podoscopic and pedobarographic\r\nassessment (static and dynamic) of subtalar titanium screw arthroereisis for the treatment of symptomatic, idiopathic,\r\nflexible flatfeet.\r\nMethods A prospective, consecutive, non-controlled, cohort, clinical follow-up study was performed. In total, 30\r\npatients (41 feet), mean age 10 (6 to 16 years), were evaluated. Clinical and standing radiological assessments, static\r\nand dynamic pedobarography, as well as podoscopy, were performed before surgery and at final follow-up.\r\nResults Treatment was associated with significant improvements in heel valgus angle, radiographic parameters\r\n(lateral and dorso-planar talo-first metatarsal angle, calcaneal inclination angle, talar declination angle, longitudinal\r\narch angle) and podoscopic parameters (Clark’s angle, Staheli’s arch index and Chippaux-Smirak index). Significant\r\nincreases were noted for lateral loading, forefoot contact phase and double support / swing phase, and reduced\r\nmedial loading (dynamic pedobarography), as well as lateral midfoot area and loading, but decreased were observed\r\nfor medial forefoot loading (static pedobarography). Four patients reported persistent pain in the sinus tarsi region\r\n(six feet), and in one case, the implant was replaced for a larger one due to undercorrection. No overcorrections or\r\ninfection complications were noted in the study group.\r\nConclusions Subtalar arthroereisis is a minimally-invasive and effective surgical method for treating symptomatic,\r\nidiopathic, flexible flatfeet; it has an acceptable complication rate with good early clinical results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943c878c28a0473b8932"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"825","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6745d0fefdbe832d85ebd578","5e70943c878c28a0473b8932","5e7092de878c28a04739e71d","6745d0fefdbe832d85ebd57a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773dd","mniswId":"2634","title":"BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders","issn":"1471-2474","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"84599c15-f507-4c66-ac3f-c0d4302fd963"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Subtalar arthroereisis is a minimally-invasive and effective surgical method for treating symptomatic","idiopathic","flexible flatfeet","it has an acceptable complication rate with good early clinical results"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060281721"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67345fedfdbe830349f2a7ec","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Tymoniuk","documentHash":"8667fcca-a287-42dc-ae0e-e64ba1f5c1e0"},{"objectId":"67345fedfdbe830349f2a7eb","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Zawadzka-Starczewska","documentHash":"12e87a49-5e42-4c5c-958d-73ff0633212f"},{"objectId":"5e7094f1878c28a0473c78d9","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Stasiak","uuid":"B264807482104CB5E7482D11529E77EB3F338C9E7F143F54278CD843244AB15837A4C6B2C4F5FC779CC2386790DBC1C21285808F282814124FF056F776E19301","orcidId":"0000-0002-2910-7691","documentHash":"17f41ca9-cd74-4f43-b667-cba0bf843345"},{"objectId":"5e709334878c28a0473a4e09","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Stasiak","uuid":"17214ECEFA5D465CDE675ACD9984978665F15CA78F9655281379F73BFE609116AC48C43D7940AC1E45489E62DBA92A00BAD5CF7B89236A9FF9AF4434D683D0AA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8937-1988","documentHash":"619a19cb-68e8-4723-b868-cefc0897c957"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e29","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"9AEED36EF6FDD1C7A152FECD18B74C86EE0F5FC6C9ED4C2598D64A50DA2FC2EE937D8A80C049C92E0412EE6ECAB101D78D8BC8974E862491A24AB18E51685148","orcidId":"0000-0002-8748-3337","documentHash":"7d8b26bd-246c-4611-be81-a715727aeec0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6512a93540970743d204c4c5","doi":"10.1038/s41435-023-00193-z","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-023-00193-z","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Significance of HLA in the development of Graves’ orbitopathy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Graves' disease (GD), similarly to most autoimmune disease, is triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals.

Narodowy Program Zwalczania Chorób Nowotworowych), coordinated by the Ministry of Health, were pursued by conducting genetic diagnostics on individuals at high risk of developing cancer. A total of 1097 individuals were enrolled in the study, leading to the identification of 128 cases of germline mutations. The implementation of the NCCP led to the identification of genetic mutations in 4.43% of the patients qualified for BRCA1 and BRCA2 screening tests, in 18.18% of those qualified for a comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel in cases of breast and ovarian cancer, and in 17.36% of cases of colorectal and endometrial cancer. The research conducted allowed us to establish individualized preventive and therapeutic approaches for mutation carriers. However, the results prove that liberalizing the inclusion criteria for high-throughput diagnostics and the use of broad gene panels could significantly increase the percentage of detected carriers. This publication serves as a summary and discussion of the results obtained from the implementation of the NCCP as well as of the role of genetic consulting in personalized medicine."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e1878c28a04739e989"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f0878c28a0473c7699"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"[1-10], [poz.] 13178","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a8be6040970706a44c3d22","65a8be6040970706a44c3d23","65a8be6040970706a44c3d24","65a8be6040970706a44c3d25","65a8be6040970706a44c3d26","65a8be6040970706a44c3d27","65a8be6040970706a44c3d28","65a8be6040970706a44c3d29","5e7092e1878c28a04739e989","65a8be6040970706a44c3d2a","65a8be6040970706a44c3d2b","5e7094f0878c28a0473c7699","65a8be6040970706a44c3d2d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64eefc3d4097077159d15bae","year":"2023","volume":"24","number":"17","documentHash":"451c8896-06f5-4678-a907-418e3e915545"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BRCA1","hereditary endometrial cancer","hereditary colorectal cancer","ovarian cancer","hereditary breast ovarian cancer","colorectal cancer","endometrial cancer","breast cancer","CHEK2","PALB2","BRCA2"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060298937"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6745d0fafdbe832d85ebd56f","name":"Kryspin","lastName":"Niedzielski","documentHash":"74c31a85-055a-4850-8b10-03828de2b11e"},{"objectId":"6745d0fafdbe832d85ebd56d","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zając","documentHash":"e64efb15-dece-4d06-b972-a732a1016501"},{"objectId":"6745d0fafdbe832d85ebd56c","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Beczkowski","documentHash":"1cd86ada-ed4b-4b7a-b09c-4c6da38a6625"},{"objectId":"6745d0fafdbe832d85ebd56b","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Stelmach","documentHash":"55d40499-1f57-4b2f-9c51-212c877e6b87"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8932","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Małecki","uuid":"EFA43C18934800AF3898F728E291ABFD587EB07CE3F1A03ADE68184A3BEA3B358356DE8FC3081F4A8D6E2599DEE9C2552D2DC8FDDC286339331E4B9B14089DB4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8014-479X","documentHash":"61578e8c-89dd-4bf2-a7bb-a0c3099e2f4a"},{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e71d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Sibiński","uuid":"E4AC298A36EE72543B6E2E0396D73FD16D2B94A178DD08BF6531F07D361021D297EE190F18AFC2BA2A74AAB1DC1DDA199A0178543D764E46616BB32B0D637F33","orcidId":"0000-0003-2967-0852","documentHash":"d3e885e4-534c-454a-bc57-d591eac53525"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6745d0fafdbe832d85ebd56a","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-37063-7","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-37063-7","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Clinical and radiological evaluation of surgical treatment of medial epicondyle fractures of humerus in children.

Of these, 81presented with an isolated medial epicondyle fracture (mean age 11.6 years), and 31 with an elbow dislocation (mean age 11.9 years). Out of 112 patients tested, 98 achieved an excellent treatment result, ten good and a mean Mayo Elbow Performance Score (MEPS); no significant differences were observed between dislocated and non-dislocated elbow groups. Those with an isolated medial epicondyle fracture demonstrated a mean flexion of 140.7° and extension deficit of 3.0°, while those with an elbow dislocation displayed a mean flexion of 134.5° and extension deficit 6.1°. The dislocation group demonstrated significantly greater extension and flexion deficits (p = 0.019, p < 0.001, respectively). One patient required revision surgery due to nonunion. Ulnar nerve function was normal in 110 patients: in the other two, it resolved spontaneously in one, and the nerve was transposed in the other. Medial elbow instability was found in seven patients: two with elbow dislocation and five without. ORIF with K wires is a safe procedure for treating medial epicondyle humeral fractures that yields good or very good results. Similar outcomes are observed between patients with and without dislocation according to MEPS; however, flexion and extension are more limited in the former group."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943c878c28a0473b8932"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6745d0fafdbe832d85ebd56b","6745d0fafdbe832d85ebd56c","6745d0fafdbe832d85ebd56d","5e70943c878c28a0473b8932","5e7092de878c28a04739e71d","6745d0fafdbe832d85ebd56f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060302016"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674f0703fdbe8357172c9195","name":"Anna","lastName":"Fabiś-Strobin","documentHash":"34fa6f1b-796f-4f62-911e-e937120f62de"},{"objectId":"674f0703fdbe8357172c9194","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Beczkowski","documentHash":"b2f0225b-bc9d-46a6-a521-bc290e2fcb7c"},{"objectId":"674f0703fdbe8357172c9193","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Stelmach","documentHash":"3fa13fa1-3fc9-4f89-9dc6-046793440112"},{"objectId":"674f0703fdbe8357172c9192","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Korczyc-Stępnicka","documentHash":"c0af9d66-8c39-48fa-b4bf-7b34c02040c8"},{"objectId":"674f0703fdbe8357172c9191","name":"Kryspin","lastName":"Niedzielski","documentHash":"7e66361b-ae30-4cf7-85fd-4feeaf06f76f"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8932","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Małecki","uuid":"EFA43C18934800AF3898F728E291ABFD587EB07CE3F1A03ADE68184A3BEA3B358356DE8FC3081F4A8D6E2599DEE9C2552D2DC8FDDC286339331E4B9B14089DB4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8014-479X","documentHash":"61578e8c-89dd-4bf2-a7bb-a0c3099e2f4a"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e83f","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Fabiś","uuid":"DE122FB03AE2E5DE1DE873D99E2C47EDDB233DB4A1096F724A130A1FF50AEE898D6538CE9E7C42F902F815A0DB7DF5FADE02A432DBBFFA906E58AF502E43B3D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2148-3780","documentHash":"d7df6db5-f04c-43e6-95ef-b44617374533"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"674d8ccbfdbe8324c668bd44","doi":"10.1186/s12891-023-06249-5","publicUri":"https://bmcmusculoskeletdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12891-023-06249-5","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A clinical, radiological and isokinetic evaluation in patients with recurrent patellar dislocation undergoing MPFL reconstruction according to Avikainen: a prospective study evaluating early degenerative changes after a minimum 10-year follow-up period","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The aim of the study was to conduct a comprehensive functional and radiological follow-up assessment in patients at least 10 years after adductor magnus MPFL reconstruction, and to assess the presence of early degenerative changes.\nMethods: The mean age at the time of surgery was 16 years (range: 8 to 18 years, SD 2.5).

A single recurrence of dislocation was noted in three patients. A significant improvement in radiological parameters was noted. No significant difference in the incidence of chondromalacia, of any degree, was observed compared to controls. Significantly higher quadriceps peak torque was noted for both angular velocities (60 and 180°/sec) compared to the preoperative readings (p < 0.001).

Recent studies have shown that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) like long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) can contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Profiling of miRNA and lncRNA expression is carried out using state-of-the-art molecular biology techniques (RT-PCR, sequencing, microarray analysis). The use of the latest technologies may make it possible to establish a genetic profile, which is a promising prospect for early diagnosis of endometriosis. In the future, genetic testing may become the gold diagnostic standard and eliminate invasive laparoscopy. In the case of endometriosis, it is important to extend the research to molecular aspects, which may facilitate the diagnosis of the disease or indicate new (based for example ncRNA) treatment methods. The paper presents the latest data on the importance of miRNA/lncRNA in endometriosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397e92","6125ab299543c7051ff01b0b","5e70928f878c28a047397e8e","5e70928e878c28a047397d7a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"94","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"997-1003","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6125ab299543c7051ff01b0b","5e70928f878c28a047397e8e","5e70928f878c28a047397e92","5e70928e878c28a047397d7a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e44","mniswId":"7217","title":"Ginekologia Polska","doi":"10.17772/gp/","issn":"0017-0011","eissn":"2543-6767","websiteLink":"http://www.ginekolpol.com/","documentHash":"b93a7461-bd6b-4fb9-b540-2c716d08f206"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6757f8b1fdbe835dc16279d4","year":"2023","volume":"94","number":"12","doi":"","documentHash":"0b32d3c5-b4e4-4cb4-b039-0a7903634275"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["endometriosis","lncRNA","miRNA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060304801"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"624663a87523402df09aa841","name":"OSKAR","lastName":"SYLWESTRZAK","uuid":"E561B0F9502AF894C839255CABC2A558128A5E7A4D4A2E6D912D1DA35BB6D892926654D43B55513438A98C2689C4339394E123C2BF8B5A13CC30BB3FCDB5B29E","documentHash":"4ab0bc47-eea7-401f-99f4-e6d5b5ee3cdc"},{"objectId":"5e7094f1878c28a0473c78da","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Zych-Krekora","uuid":"41FB58971C35BBAAF50CF22A44480A0B6DC1B9A70B827F1B001864604F5D60BDE44B13ADCD56B902FFDAA2D705240BDDF618E4DEE7C7935BE96674B2C1A5D32E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4305-8328","documentHash":"9b2fd656-5d14-4858-8120-2d5ef566663f"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eaa4","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":"A2CF3568D4206E833A93B839E76E32B7FF43E216EF45BE2A0811620733662426F7E26BAD1759C72AC2DF8842B07A6D5A3EBAC2E85013B4130FEC64F497EE471E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6900-4347","documentHash":"d6f5ecdd-1d5e-49d3-afd3-d4adaff79962"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Krekora","uuid":"023602F0CB962981B544DDF9820660CB31E5420EA3295BC5FE50BB51857D21EBACBE932514660FB7F1A55CC1003FFF6E468FFDE8C5F86027CF074EA8BCE4E21B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5496-4556","documentHash":"7d44dde3-148f-4886-bf56-5cebf3e85de2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6756b77afdbe833c07e5cd1a","doi":"10.3390/jcm12185773","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/18/5773/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Impact of Prenatal and Postnatal Diagnosis on Parents: Psychosocial and Economic Aspects Related to Congenital Heart Defects in Children","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Congenital heart defects (CHD) are defects detected both prenatally and after birth.

death among females. MiRNAs, particularly the miR-196 family, can influence tumor progression by targeting specific pathways.

Samples for testing were obtained from archival paraffin blocks obtained from intraoperative material.\n\nResults: The study found that miRNA 196a expression was significantly elevated in ovarian cancer patients compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Higher miRNA 196a expression was also noted in patients with advanced FIGO stages (III, IV). Increased miRNA expression was significantly associated with higher mortality and chemoresistance (p < 0.05).

They can be treated nonoperatively or surgically with intramedullary nailing or plates. The method of choice for treating pediatric forearm shaft fractures is the application of elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN)|. The aim of the study was to evaluate ESIN in pediatric patients with forearm shaft fractures based on radiological images, and determine the etiology and complication rate associated with the injury.\n\nMethods: The study included 201 patients, 30.5% female 69.5% male, aged 1 to 17 years (mean 9.1 years; SD = 3.2), all had been diagnosed with a fracture of the forearm shaft and had been treated surgically with ESIN. In addition, all possessed a complete set of X-ray images and had attended a minimum six-month follow-up examination of the forearm. Axial alignment was evaluated retrospectively in the anatomical (AP) and lateral (LAT) positions. In total, 402 radiographs were examined. Of the injuries, 68% occurred during sports activity and 75% involved both the radius and the ulna.\n\nResults: Union was observed in all cases. Mean axial alignment values in AP and LAT X-ray or both the ulna and radius were satisfactory. Axial alignment values were not influenced significantly by age, type of surgery, type of fracture or etiology. Plaster cast application (9.8% of cases) significantly influenced radius axial alignment. The complication rate was 11.4% (n = 23). Significantly more complications were observed in patients receiving open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) (p = 0.0025).\n\nConclusion: The ESIN technique is an effective treatment for forearm diaphyseal fractures in children, with good results regarding reduction and bone healing, indicated by x-ray."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w

implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) in Poland: analysis of patient series and practical guidelines for breast surgeons","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Although breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma (BIA-ALCL) is infrequent, with less than 1000 noted cases worldwide, patients consenting for breast implant surgery should be aware of its risk. We describe the first Polish multicenter case-series data on BIA-ALCL patients and present diagnostic and treatment recommendation for breast surgeons.\nMaterial and methods: In cooperation with the Polish Society of Surgical Oncology and Polish Lymphoma Research Group, we collected BIA-ALCL cases in Poland.\nResults: We retrospectively reviewed clinical data of seven BIA-ALCL patients, diagnosed between July 2013 and November 2019. The median time from implant placement to the first BIA-ALCL symptoms was 65 months (range: 33-96 months). All the patients were exposed to textured implants at presentation. Capsulectomy with implant removal was performed in all the patients with immediate reimplantation in 2 cases. In a median follow-up of 19 months (range 5-81 months), there was no recurrence and all the patients stayed alive. Between 2013 and 2019, the incidence of BIA-ALCL in Polish female population age 30 and above ranged from 0 to 0.021/100 000/year.\nConclusions: BIA-ALCL is scarce in the Polish population. In a short-term follow-up, patients' prognosis remains excellent. Due to the withdrawal of roughly textured implants from the market and the exclusion of likely the most potent etiologic factor, it might be expected that the incidence of BIA-ALCL will become even rarer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki

(206 kobiet i 93 mężczyzn) z rozpoznaniem pierwotnego nadciśnienia tętniczego. Przeanalizowano dane medyczne pacjentów, w tym badania laboratoryjne, wyniki przezklatkowej echokardiografii i 24-godzinnych automatycznych pomiarów ciśnienia tętniczego. Rok po hospitalizacji przeprowadzono wywiad telefoniczny z pacjentami w celu oceny wartości ciśnienia tętniczego, farmakoterapii i zdarzeń sercowo-naczyniowych. Zebrane dane poddano analizie statystycznej.\r\n\r\nWyniki.\r\nPacjenci z nadwagą i dyslipidemią stanowili większość analizowanej grupy. W grupie mężczyzn średnie wartości rozkurczowego ciśnienia tętniczego były istotnie wyższe niż wśród kobiet. Porównanie wyników echokardiografii przezklatkowej wykazało, że kobiety miały istotnie wyższe wartości prędkości maksymalnej przedsionkowej fali napływu mitralnego (fala A) i stosunku prędkości maksymalnych wczesnorozkurczowej fali napływu mitralnego oraz wczesnorozkurczowej fazy ruchu pierścienia mitralnego (E/E’). Po roku od hospitalizacji większość pacjentów stosowała się do zaleceń i uzyskała średnie wartości ciśnienia tętniczego < 140/90 mm Hg. Aż 18,7% pacjentów wymagało rehospitalizacji z przyczyn sercowo-naczyniowych w ciągu rocznej obserwacji.\r\n\r\nWnioski.\r\nFarmakoterapia hipotensyjna w badanej populacji różniła się od zaleceń zawartych w wytycznych ESC/ESH dotyczących postępowania w nadciśnieniu tętniczym. Podwyższone parametry echokardiograficzne dysfunkcji rozkurczowej lewej komory były związane z gorszymi wynikami leczenia hipotensyjnego. Wiek i ciśnienie tętnicze poniżej 120/70 mm Hg zwiększały ryzyko rehospitalizacji w badanej populacji.\r\n\r\nnadciśnienie tętnicze, dysfunkcja rozkurczowa, farmakoterapia, rehospitalizacje"},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction. The aim of this study is comparison and evaluation of the results of antihypertensive treatment in patients with\r\nprimary arterial hypertension and identification of risk factors for cardiovascular rehospitalisation in this group of patients.\r\nMaterial and methods. 299 people (206 women and 93 men) diagnosed with primary arterial hypertension were\r\nincluded in the observational study. Patients’ medical data was analyzed, including laboratory tests, transthoracic\r\nechocardiography, and 24-hour automatic blood pressure measurements. One year after hospitalization, the patients\r\nwere interviewed by phone to assess blood pressure, pharmacotherapy, and cardiovascular events. The collected data\r\nwas analyzed statistically.\r\nResults. Overweight and dyslipidemic patients constituted the majority of the analyzed group. In the group of men, mean\r\ndiastolic blood pressure values were significantly higher than in women. A comparison of the results of transthoracic\r\nechocardiography showed that women had significantly higher values of A wave and the E/E’ ratio. One year after hospitalization, most of the patients complied with the recommendations and achieved mean blood pressure values < 140/90\r\nmm Hg. As many as 18.7% of patients required rehospitalization for cardiovascular reasons within one year of follow-up.\r\nConclusions. The antihypertensive drug therapy in the study population differed from the recommendations in the European\r\nSociety of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines for the management of hypertension. Increased echocardiographic parameters of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction were associated with worse outcomes of antihypertensive\r\ntreatment. Age and blood pressure below 120/70 mm Hg increased the risk of rehospitalization in the study

versus transvermian approach to tumors of the fourth ventricle and their impact on postoperative neurological complications: A multicenter study.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Tumors of the fourth ventricle are exceedingly rare; however, such lesions are formidable due to the severe postoperative neurological complications (pNCs) which often occur. The adoption of the telovelar approach over the transvermian was created to supposedly mitigate the pNCs; however, there is a lack of sufficient data supporting this theory.\nMethods: Records from six hospitals were reviewed for patients surgically treated for a single tumor within the 4th ventricle from 2016 to 2022. The pNCs which had 10 or more occurrences among the patients were individually assessed as the dependent variable in a binary logistic regression model against covariates which included the surgical approach.\nResults: This study of 67 patients confirms no significant differences in risk for pNCs between the transvermian and telovelar approach. Rather, multivariate analysis identified neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) as a protective factor for postoperative speech and swallowing defects (odds ratio [OR]: 0.076, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.011-0.525). Furthermore, intraoperative external ventricular drainage (EVD) was a protective factor for postoperative gait and focal motor defects (OR: 0.075, 95% CI 0.009-0.648) and for postoperative hydrocephalus (OR: 0.020, 95% CI 0.002-0.233). A univariate meta-analysis pooling the present study's patients and an additional 304 patients from the three additional studies in the literature confirms no significant differences in risk between the transvermian and telovelar approach for pNCs.\nConclusion: Intraoperative adjuncts including IONM and EVD may play a significant role in the postoperative outcome. Despite the present study's sample size being a major limitation, the findings may provide great value to neurosurgeons given the scarcity of the current literature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","uid":"bGdC_bzKT-HVRZ9O1mobrEA","uuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","name":"Pomorski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936c878c28a0473a92af","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","parentUuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","rootUuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","5e70928e878c28a047397d1a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"124","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674f7824fdbe8357174d8ae7","674f7824fdbe8357174d8ae8","674f7824fdbe8357174d8ae9","674f7824fdbe8357174d8aea","674f7824fdbe8357174d8aeb","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb4","674f7824fdbe8357174d8aec","5e70936c878c28a0473a92af","674f7824fdbe8357174d8aed","5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","5e70928e878c28a047397d1a","674f7824fdbe8357174d8af0","674f7824fdbe8357174d8af1","674f7824fdbe8357174d8af2","674f7824fdbe8357174d8af3","674f7824fdbe8357174d8af4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547eac8","mniswId":"26650","title":"Surgical Neurology International","issn":"2152-7806","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3da45882-b204-44b7-b061-470a3bf90956"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67653755fdbe832d0ce289b5","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"8084fdab-a1ec-4568-a250-43520642fe9f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Complications","Fourth ventricle","Telovelar","Transvermian;","Tumor"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654893465"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd39","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Hoffman","documentHash":"8e038359-03b0-4a72-8d62-8fe42c63b657"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd38","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Brzezińska-Rajszys","documentHash":"5930d41f-7647-48f8-b5a1-2fdc13bd249d"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd37","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Moszura","documentHash":"087aab80-e446-46f4-992b-40df75f0d7b5"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd36","name":"Olga","lastName":"Trojnarska","documentHash":"e783d73c-d448-46d8-9311-bcc3250841b4"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd35","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Bartczak-Rutkowska","documentHash":"3c4194af-891c-47c5-be97-830da0dd35fe"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd34","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Tomkiewicz-Pająk","documentHash":"1aa0b19a-2bd3-4aa5-a0cf-f13e955343ab"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd33","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Powichrowska","documentHash":"59f2b051-fae9-4341-be2d-95623afa9d33"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd32","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Żuk","documentHash":"bf15046d-4dbc-4bdc-955a-22e8b22ac785"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd31","name":"Maria","lastName":"Maciejewska-Szabelska","documentHash":"59100d60-4a74-4752-bd83-b71c9ae13c21"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd30","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Gładysz-Piestrzyńska","documentHash":"242839de-d4c0-40c7-8f11-faae90b0675f"},{"objectId":"674cde1efdbe8357170fdd2e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Warchoł-Celińska","documentHash":"e5fff5aa-3d1f-4f82-ad4c-1ed4edc1adf7"},{"objectId":"5e70931e878c28a0473a3130","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kusa","uuid":"E2FFAB2AC4404F1933DC589208D5E7B3585B45D58B02C64ECE8F90E7FA425B2030DB1A0BE336233042D7AECCBD8189D6C0A2632E42E04B0CDD64671D5C2ADE90","orcidId":"0000-0003-2607-1491","documentHash":"9a7d010a-ad24-433d-b477-52f6919b4e07"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e58","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mazurek -

To compare the centers and facilitate interpretation of results, the Fontan Surveillance Score (FSS) was developed. The higher score is consistent with better care, with a maximum of 19 points.\nResults: We included in the study 398 Fontan patients (243 adults and 155 adolescents [aged 14-18 years]). The median FSS was 13 points with variability between centers (interquartile range 7-14 points). Centers providing continuous care from the pediatric period until 18 years of age achieved a higher FSS compared to ACHD centers (median: 14 points vs. 12 points; P <0.001). Most of the patients, both in the ACHD (82.3%) and pediatric centers (89%), were seen annually and had a physical examination, electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram performed at each visit. However, we observed unsatisfactory utilization of tests identifying early stages of Fontan circulation failure (cardiopulmonary exercise tests, cardiac magnetic resonance, liver biochemistry and imaging, detection of protein-losing enteropathy).\nConclusions: Our results showed that there is no unified surveillance approach for Fontan patients in Poland. The practice of care for adults differs from that of adolescents."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","uid":"byQikIwqf13QiA2ApyMoNIQ","uuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","name":"Śląski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70931e878c28a0473a3130"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","parentUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","rootUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397e58"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"81","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"p.960-968","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674cde1efdbe8357170fdd2e","5e70928e878c28a047397e58","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd30","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd31","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd32","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd33","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd34","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd35","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd36","5e70931e878c28a0473a3130","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd37","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd38","674cde1efdbe8357170fdd39"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c22","mniswId":"13286","title":"Kardiologia Polska","issn":"0022-9032","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"bdb9d331-1798-477b-9734-2345cad7115c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655359dd40970760942d4a01","year":"2023","volume":"81","number":"10","doi":"","documentHash":"c6b01c8a-2ded-4d5c-8321-a259fd9913a6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fontan surgery","univentricular heart","adult congenital heart diseases","practice of care"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654916588"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6746ee45fdbe832d85f38d11","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Blasiak","documentHash":"136250e9-95c1-4404-8c07-3f808b87c9b7"},{"objectId":"5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3","name":"Michał","lastName":"Fila","uuid":"802F125F8F0CAEC5051D3FBB04D8EABEBBCEE3131B5F8864B3F7BCCCB5D2B4C14A8BB02A8533B99BDDB0788A6B85E63BB6753D0399760C384170E79B3F8E1A8F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0748-7080","documentHash":"b4da1b1e-0d75-4e37-99f2-e9698846b4d2"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eb79","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szczepańska","uuid":"2EFAE4303E2EA675707B4F3A24E7DE23AA4CEFAFBE528A95ADD0290E1BE6FD000446A0BC0C434D496002F571ED31A9CD39E7A1917940ECA2EFCC0E78CF14A77C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9912-5345","documentHash":"e0809707-f19f-469f-b224-61931f75e64d"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e95b","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Pawłowska","uuid":"721787D2C71E01D5FC0EFE65653204D070E0393866584BB758BA35E96BFF83033A326B85FA72EAEB555F0F0C4FE702307F1B7745B75F54EFB46579CAED733E80","orcidId":"0000-0002-5373-4783","documentHash":"b953ddf4-f0a8-4b15-a974-1fd539843503"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673f2e24fdbe832d85324db3","doi":"10.14336/ad.2023.0313","publicUri":"https://www.aginganddisease.org/EN/10.14336/AD.2023.0313","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Different Aspects of Aging in Migraine","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Migraine is a common neurological disease displaying an unusual dependence on age. For most patients, the peak intensity of migraine headaches occurs in 20s and lasts until 40s, but then headache attacks become less intense, occur less frequently and the disease is more responsive to therapy. This relationship is valid in both females and males, although the prevalence of migraine in the former is 2-4 times greater than the latter. Recent concepts present migraine not only as a pathological event, but rather as a part of evolutionary adaptive response to protect organism against consequences of stress-induced brain energy deficit. However, these concepts do not fully explain that unusual dependence of migraine prevalence on age. Many aspects of aging, both molecular/cellular and social/cognitive, are interwound in migraine pathogenesis, but they neither explain why only some persons are affected by migraine, nor suggest any causal relationship. In this narrative/hypothesis review we present information on associations of migraine with chronological aging, brain aging, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion as well as social, cognitive, epigenetic, and metabolic aging. We also underline the role of oxidative stress in these associations. We hypothesize that migraine affects only individuals who have inborn, genetic/epigenetic, or acquired (traumas, shocks or complexes) migraine predispositions. These predispositions weakly depend on age and affected individuals are more prone to migraine triggers than others. Although the triggers can be related to many aspects of aging, social aging may play a particularly important role as the prevalence of its associated stress has a similar age-dependence as the prevalence of migraine. Moreover, social aging was shown to be associated with oxidative stress, important in many aspects of aging. In perspective, molecular mechanisms underlying social aging should be further explored and related to migraine with a closer association with migraine predisposition and difference in prevalence by sex."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"2028-2050","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e95b","5e7092e2878c28a04739eb79","5e7094b6878c28a0473c23a3","6746ee45fdbe832d85f38d11"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f10","mniswId":"647","title":"Aging and Disease","eissn":"2152-5250","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"8fcaa1df-72cc-4f04-8c86-eef8f5010c72"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67502e9cfdbe8342911b1c7c","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"6","doi":"","documentHash":"c4d64051-205a-4571-8977-2db2465010bf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biological aging","molecular markers of aging","stem cell exhaustion","migraine","cellular senescence","metabolic aging","chronological aging","brain aging","social aging","cognitive aging"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654926572"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002b9","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Krzeszowski","documentHash":"06a019dc-0c1b-430f-a9fd-4e246984f894"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002b8","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Grzesiak","documentHash":"6a7a02b1-0dcd-4d1b-adda-2e11c0a4c16a"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002b7","name":"Renata","lastName":"Jaczyńska","documentHash":"85511443-6cd1-497e-98fe-9b62818b9d5a"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002b6","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Borowski","documentHash":"c9f178da-ce82-4b6b-87a4-ea12d7f4baa6"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002b5","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Górczewski","documentHash":"35880155-280c-45eb-a91e-808a1918c54a"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002b4","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Kondracka","documentHash":"9dd1b39a-5fff-4d0c-a6d4-2cba2efa9fa7"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002b2","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Staśkiewicz","documentHash":"3b1ba736-980e-46d2-b553-7ea609515bf5"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002b1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Massalska-Wolska","documentHash":"0c43cbe9-3dac-4d24-bf99-2c5314f393d0"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002b0","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Huras","documentHash":"0ca0a424-dc5e-46a0-b60a-ea20cb465cf4"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002af","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Górecka","documentHash":"cc33425c-a707-44a8-ba55-77716c6442f6"},{"objectId":"674ce0c3fdbe8357171002ae","name":"Magda","lastName":"Rybak-Krzyszkowska","documentHash":"e65f3f7b-3686-4f36-8241-0bd51e07ee28"},{"objectId":"5ed5bf4e7523404d1000e882","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Staniczek","uuid":"D140A19396ADFCC7F830232BEB540976C13D36E23061E20D11A755D4767E996D4B7885164E00F372A6909A214B20737C6293DBDDD568807EB37655AC1471192B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0740-7167","documentHash":"348e01ac-b826-429d-894e-772768a33cfd"},{"objectId":"5e7094f0878c28a0473c7699","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gach","uuid":"7A3C2D76764C084CC7D5ECB37445D440554AFC0853894108AA6E8BC4C5526A56A34370A6C87B061F1D93FA8C1FDF14BD35FE91D4A7451FA27EC223FBC7BF97D2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6590-5797","documentHash":"4a2cd1aa-4a61-4e7b-880c-3585d1dc1700"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65e5d00f4097076263d2294a","doi":"10.3390/v15112142","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/15/11/2142","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy prevention and treatment options: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a significant health concern affecting numerous expectant mothers across the globe. CMV is the leading cause of health problems and developmental delays among infected infants. Notably, this study examines CMV infection in pregnancy, its management, prevention mechanisms, and treatment options.\nMethods: Specifically, information from the Cochrane Library, PUBMED, Wiley Online, Science Direct, and Taylor Francis databases were reviewed along with additional records identified through the register, the Google Scholar search engine. Based on the search, 21 articles were identified for systematic review.\nResults: A total of six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were utilized for a meta-analytic review. As heterogeneity was substantial, the random effects model was used for meta-analysis. Utilizing the random-effects model, the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) approach, the estimate of effect size (d = -0.479, 95% CI = -0.977 to 0.019, p = 0.060) suggests the results are not statistically significant, so it cannot be inferred that the prevention methods used were effective, despite an inverse relationship between treatment and number of infected cases. The findings indicated that several techniques are used to prevent, diagnose, and manage CMV infection during pregnancy, including proper hygiene, ultrasound examination (US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amniocentesis, viremia, hyperimmunoglobulin (HIG), and valacyclovir (VACV).\nConclusions: The current review has significant implications for addressing CMV infection in pregnancy. Specifically, it provides valuable findings on contemporary management interventions to prevent and treat CMV infection among expectant mothers. Therefore, it allows relevant stakeholders to address these critical health concerns and understand the effectiveness of the proposed prevention and treatment options."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","uid":"byQikIwqf13QiA2ApyMoNIQ","uuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","name":"Śląski Uniwersytet Medyczny w

factors with incident stroke have generally assumed a uniform magnitude of associations across the age spectrum, an assumption we assess in this report.\nMethods: Participants enrolled 2003-2007 in the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort study who were stroke free at baseline were followed for incident stroke. Associations of traditional stroke risk factors with incident stroke were assessed using (1) proportional hazards analysis based on the baseline age of the participant and (2) Poisson regression analysis assessing associations based on the changing age of the participant during their follow-up (age at exposure). In each analysis, age strata were selected to have a similar number of strokes in each stratum, specifically 45-64, 65-73, and 74+ years for the proportional hazards analysis and 45-69, 70-79, and 80+ years for Poisson regression.\nResults: A total of 1,405 ischemic stroke events occurred among 28,235 participants over a median follow-up of 11.3 years, with a total of 276,074 person-years exposure. For both analytic approaches, the magnitude of the association with stroke was significantly less at older ages for diabetes (hazard or relative risk decreasing from ≈2.0 in younger strata to ≈1.3 in older strata), heart disease (from ≈2.0 to ≈1.3), and hypertension defined at a threshold of 140/90 mm Hg (from ≈1.80 to ≈1.50); however, there was no age-related difference in the magnitude of the association for smoking, atrial fibrillation, or left ventricular hypertrophy.\nDiscussion: Hypertension and diabetes are 2 of the more important risk factors for stroke; however, their association with stroke risk appears substantially less at older ages. That the magnitude of the association for smoking, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy does not decrease with age suggests their relative importance in determining stroke risk likely increases with age."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"100","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"e1444-e1453","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674d9f03fdbe8324c669c42e","674d9f03fdbe8324c669c42f","674d9f03fdbe8324c669c430","674d9f03fdbe8324c669c431","674d9f03fdbe8324c669c432","674d9f03fdbe8324c669c433","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fe7","mniswId":"14956","title":"Neurology","issn":"0028-3878","documentHash":"9e35f7ae-a711-4539-bbac-855a9a67dfd3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674d9f03fdbe8324c669c42d","year":"2023","volume":"100","number":"14","documentHash":"c4b6d1a9-53db-47a5-bf9b-f0a31b6c8898"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655026979"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6760023efdbe834e36a4555a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Rubik","documentHash":"9ffe1407-28c7-4f8f-a654-6fbba8de10fc"},{"objectId":"6760023efdbe834e36a45559","name":"Aldona","lastName":"Ploszka","documentHash":"59791c1b-0fff-498e-bece-c9e0b36c62fb"},{"objectId":"6760023efdbe834e36a45558","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Nosek-Wasilewska","documentHash":"d7e61f5f-f3b1-496d-a84a-562ce3d316a0"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d62","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Tkaczyk","uuid":"A21925A08ED68CED95EF6502C6131A4B6F59EAA91C073A01C558F231317807D60BD4A2AF35AAAF76BCFBD1178F955C36562F9BDBD7E2D3F533F97DC3B0AA660B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1753-7560","documentHash":"ccb9484c-fb9c-4722-aaa9-a95f7cfc61ff"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6760023efdbe834e36a45557","doi":"10.15557/pimr.2023.0040","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.15557/pimr.2023.0040","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Phenotypic anomalies in Kabuki syndrome and their implications – an analysis of two cases in the light of scientific literature","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Kabuki syndrome (KS1: OMIM 147920, KS2: OMIM 300867) is a rare disorder characterised by dysmorphic face and limbs, microcephaly, short stature, and concomitant multiorgan congenital defects. The prevalence is estimated at 1:32,000–86,000 live births. Most patients are also diagnosed with mild to moderate intellectual disability. Molecular diagnosis includes an analysis for the two most common mutations in KMT2D (KS1), also known as MML2, and KDM6A (KS2) genes.

Serum FGF-2 levels were measured in all newborns on days 1 and 7 of life. \r\n\r\nResults: \r\nAnalysing the dynamics of changes in serum FGF-2 level, a statistically significant positive correlation was observed for birth weight (R = 0.20, p = 0.0423) in the first week of life. However, no statistically significant correlation was found for gestational age (R = 0.06, p = 0.5146). Infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia had significantly lower gestational age than those without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (p < 0.0001) and birth weight (p < 0.0001). No statistically significant correlation was found between the dynamics of changes in serum FGF-2 level in the first week of life and the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia development for the definition of bronchopulmonary dysplasia on day 28 of life (p = 0.5330), and for the definition as the need for supplemental oxygen and/or respiratory support at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age (p = 0.7914). \r\n\r\nConclusions: \r\nThe study found no association between the serum FGF-2 level in the first week of life and the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia development in infants born before 32 weeks of gestation with a birth weight ≤1,500 g. In the study group, a statistically significant positive correlation was found for birth weight.

an autosomal chromosomal disorder, which is associated with numerous ranges of congenital anomalies. Purpose of this largest study in Poland was to analyze diagnosis and follow-up of fetuses with the prenatal diagnosis of Trisomy 18 in our tertiary center.\nMaterial and methods: The study was conducted in a tertiary center for fetal cardiology. The inclusion criteria comprised fetuses with karyotype of Trisomy 18. Data on number of delivery, number of pregnancy, cardiac and extracardiac diseases, type and date of childbirth, sex, birth date, Apgar score, survival time and autopsy were analyzed.\nResults: There were 41 fetuses with diagnosis confirmed by amniocentesis: 34 were females, 7 males. CHD was detected prenatally in 73% cases at mean gestational age of 26 weeks. The most common CHD was AV-canal (13 cases, 43%) and VSD (13 cases, 43%). In 1999-2010 the average time to detect a heart defect was 29 weeks, in 2011-2021 it was 23 weeks (p < 0.01, U-Mann-Whitney). IUGR was diagnosed in the 3rd trimester in 29 cases (70%), polyhydramnion in 21 cases (51%).\nConclusions: Congenital heart defects in female fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction in 3rd trimester with polyhydramnios and in subsequent pregnancy, regardless of maternal age, were typical prenatal findings for Trisomy 18. Heart defects with incomplete septum such as AVC or VSD (which nowadays can be detected in the 1st half of the pregnancy) were the most common anomaly in Edwards Syndrome. These heart defects did not require intervention in the early neonatal period."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709413878c28a0473b5d6d","624663a87523402df09aa841"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092db878c28a04739e4ab","5e709413878c28a0473b5d6d","67485cfafdbe83571762f8da","5e70928e878c28a047397d72","5e7092e1878c28a04739e995"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"94","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"366-373","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709413878c28a0473b5d6d","5e7092e1878c28a04739e995","67485cfafdbe83571762f8da","624663a87523402df09aa841","5e70928e878c28a047397d72","5e7092db878c28a04739e4ab"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e44","mniswId":"7217","title":"Ginekologia Polska","issn":"0017-0011","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"fa72e960-43ac-46fe-a501-115322965f92"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6762c319fdbe83713ff51040","year":"2023","volume":"94","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"7210539d-22ec-4be4-816f-c2dbcc0af485"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Trisomy 18","Edwards Syndrome","chromosomal disorder","congenital heart defects"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655035747"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67652565fdbe832d0ce1486b","name":"Yinon","lastName":"Gilboa","documentHash":"cff6b275-dd0a-43df-b533-8b834690b707"},{"objectId":"67652565fdbe832d0ce1486a","name":"Ron","lastName":"Bardin","documentHash":"01a4bf9b-4300-4373-b73e-f4b104223acd"},{"objectId":"67652565fdbe832d0ce14869","name":"Sharon","lastName":"Perlman","documentHash":"3bba1f5e-e938-42a8-a79a-d4d00ceccb4a"},{"objectId":"5e7094f1878c28a0473c78da","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Zych-Krekora","uuid":"41FB58971C35BBAAF50CF22A44480A0B6DC1B9A70B827F1B001864604F5D60BDE44B13ADCD56B902FFDAA2D705240BDDF618E4DEE7C7935BE96674B2C1A5D32E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4305-8328","documentHash":"9b2fd656-5d14-4858-8120-2d5ef566663f"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e8e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Krekora","uuid":"023602F0CB962981B544DDF9820660CB31E5420EA3295BC5FE50BB51857D21EBACBE932514660FB7F1A55CC1003FFF6E468FFDE8C5F86027CF074EA8BCE4E21B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5496-4556","documentHash":"7d44dde3-148f-4886-bf56-5cebf3e85de2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-12-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67652565fdbe832d0ce14867","doi":"10.5603/gp.a2022.0157","publicUri":"https://journals.viamedica.pl/ginekologia_polska/article/viewFile/92638/69884","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Sonographic imaging and differential diagnosis of fetal perineal masses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This case series describes our experience with a prenatal diagnosis of fetal perineal masses.

The approved standard therapy consists of surgical cytoreduction and platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy, and of targeted therapy in selected patients. The main therapeutic problem is chemoresistance of recurrent and metastatic HGSOC tumors which results in low survival in the group of FIGO III/IV. Therefore, the prediction and monitoring of chemoresistance seems to be of utmost importance for the improvement of HGSOC management. This type of cancer has genetic heterogeneity with several subtypes being characterized by diverse gene signatures and disturbed peculiar epigenetic regulation. HGSOC develops and metastasizes preferentially in the specific intraperitoneal environment composed mainly of fibroblasts, adipocytes, and immune cells. Different HGSOC subtypes could be sensitive to distinct sets of drugs. Moreover, primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumors are characterized by an individual biology, and thus diverse drug responsibility. Without a precise identification of the tumor and its microenvironment, effective treatment seems to be elusive. This paper reviews tumor-derived genomic, mutational, cellular, and epigenetic biomarkers of HGSOC drug resistance, as well as tumor microenvironment-derived biomarkers of chemoresistance, and discusses their possible use in the novel complex approach to ovarian cancer therapy and monitoring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092db878c28a04739e43e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"229–249","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e3878c28a04739ec2e","681dd2abfdbe8313927d2f3e","681dd2abfdbe8313927d2f3f","5e7092db878c28a04739e43e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547788c","mniswId":"4733","title":"Current Oncology","issn":"1198-0052","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"f3c446c8-0168-45df-a90a-1454dbd8fda1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662b7a844097075aa60f8b83","year":"2024","volume":"31","number":"1","documentHash":"99e8cfc5-276c-48b3-ae47-5785cd5cb37d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chemoresistance","ovarian cancer","biomarkers","prediction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779468881"}]
