His fulfilling life and varied artistic career may intrigue and provoke us to look into his work. The composer of the great Requiem does not enjoy popularity and although his name is known in the musical circles, his works are rarely performed. Undoubtedly, this is a loss for Polish music repertoire, and its impoverishment. In this lecture devoted to Maciejewski, I would like to introduce the figure of this composer as a man and artist, but also as a philosopher. His life was full of ideas that had a significant impact on his music and professional decisions. My main interests are compositions for piano duo, which seems particularly interesting in the context of the relatively limited Polish repertoire for this type of chamber ensemble. Pieces for piano duo falls into three categories: originals, arrangements and transcriptions. Maciejewski’s original works include Piano Duo Concertante (1936), Allegro Concertante (1936), Kołysanka i Tarantela (1938), Oberek (1943) and Mazurek (1951). Arranged music, i.e. pieces based on a popular melody but enriched with the composer’s creativity, thanks to which they essentially become original compositions: Tańce szwedzkie (1940–42) and Negro Spirituals (1943). Transposed music comprises 23 compositions representing various styles and genres. This paper was prepared on the basis of Roman Maciejewski’s own experience in performing piano duos."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5a","uid":"boOlJ-wxjhgOSXc4DeKXcwg","uuid":"5befab98-bc6e-4039-8315-eed54f8cce0f","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.
