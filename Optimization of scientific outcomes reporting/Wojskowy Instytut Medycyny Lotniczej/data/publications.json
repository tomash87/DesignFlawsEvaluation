Together, these stress and social hormones might help regulate the emotional response to HF-rTMS. This pilot study evaluated the effect of HF-rTMS on acute testosterone and cortisol dynamics and emotional state in eleven healthy adults. Using a sham-controlled, single-blind, crossover design, participants completed a HF-rTMS session targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and motor cortex on separate days. Stimulation (250 total pulses) was applied at 90% of the resting motor threshold. Salivary testosterone and cortisol, mood, motivation, anxiety, and heart rate (HR) were assessed before (T1) and 1 (T2), 15 (T3), and 30 min (T4) after each session. There were no significant session differences in testosterone and cortisol concentration, mood, motivation, and HR. Although DLPFC stimulation produced less anxiety (vs. motor cortex), and testosterone output was stable across both treatments (vs. sham-related decline in testosterone), neither differed from the sham. Within-person fluctuations in testosterone, mood, motivation, and/or anxiety were significantly related across the DLPFC and motor cortex trials only. In conclusion, a single sub-maximal session of HF-rTMS did not affect the hormonal, emotional, or physiological state of healthy adults, relative to a sham. However, the emergence of stimulation-specific testosterone and/or emotional linkages suggests that the repeated effects of HF-rTMS may also manifest at the individual level. This offers another pathway to explain the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS and a model to explore interindividual variability in health-related outcomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b8878c28a04738643a","name":"Imperial College London","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6141f2782467f00a85804414"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e3","uid":"bWAncCFOOFggrGtc2DIwFog","uuid":"5ffa91bd-7336-4c07-959e-0d3f198f1d5a","name":"Instytut Optoelektroniki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d7878c28a0473c521e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933a878c28a0473a542c","5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b4878c28a047385811","uid":"bJ-ji5NiY_gi01uQJeUheHg","uuid":"557b1db8-bde1-4f11-ae7c-0bf51122e518","name":"Zakład Endokrynologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"651–659","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70949d878c28a0473c06cb","5e7094d7878c28a0473c521e","6141f2782467f00a85804414","5e70933a878c28a0473a542c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fe5","mniswId":"14954","title":"Neurological Sciences","doi":"10.1007/10072.1590-3478","issn":"1590-1874","eissn":"1590-3478","documentHash":"6258613c-2047-42cd-83df-6fe1e9b0016b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62da847140970752a1f1cf15","year":"2022","volume":"43","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"58c43311-1d50-4dd7-8e09-00b725f26ae3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cortical","HPA","HPG","Neuromodulation","Steroids","Stress"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747056192595"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b808f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"CB5563DBAD99E3EAB2D1F21B481ADC62403071362BAD1B6AFF0337B29C9BF1AECB037166FEBF5F3DE08624BB74444B15D1DF35A0517D66D208A619B7E2997EAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8722-0692","documentHash":"d2d631aa-bf06-4b4b-9449-bbd72d1834fb"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f98","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gąsik","uuid":"276F65819269D5EC65B6068AB1E957A8C082601E557300DE902FD0BD9A4E6D4CD15BAC1EC4E26286571A3FB3C9251E71731E62B530165AFE4BBF283EA86B1235","orcidId":"0000-0001-6492-6361","documentHash":"d28dec7f-efd9-410d-8da2-c3df319125d9"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Dereń","uuid":"8E4E129503EF74F1405EF82DEB16CE116DD41EA4FF2678A7971D949D50A7A44DAED8D6F15057E7B6D6A2DEF62672678D297A72E06ACA330861DC1339C3EB237E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4013-1895","documentHash":"9b00cfe4-872d-4ad9-80af-45419fe066eb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":12,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"61cf58292467f001be8c5098","publicUri":"http://pjambp.com/view/abstract/id/14572","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Psychophysiological and environmental parameters recorder for a truck simulator","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: This paper describes the recorder integrated with a truck simulator which is a set of measuring devices used for measuring and recording environmental parameters in the simulator's cabin and psychophysiological parameters of a driver, centrally managed by the simulator's information system.

Limited information exists on changes in cardiac autonomic modulation in extremely obese patients (BMI>40). The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of extreme (morbid) obesity and concomitant diseases on cardiovascular autonomic function. Participants of this study are 40 women and 40 men in mean age 47,9 years old diagnosed with morbid obesity (mean BMI 47,49) and hospitalized to further bariatric treatment. In 42 patients diagnosed with hypertension (treated with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors along with well controlled blood pressure), type 2 diabetes (treatment with the oral drugs) also occurred. Furthermore, 46 patients were diagnosed with depression. None of the participants used antidepressants or sedative agents. Total of 80 healthy (40 women and 40 men) in mean age 42,7 years old and with mean BMI 24,6 were formed in group of controls. All of patients had 24-hour ECG monitoring with Holter method in order to evaluate the autonomic activity with time and frequency domain analysis (heart rate variability - HRV).\n\nResults: Obese group showed a significant reduction of parasympathetic activity and a significant increase in sympathetic activity. No significant differences in cardiac autonomic modulation were noted between the Hypertensive-Diabetic patients and those, only with morbid obesity. However, in studied group, obese patients with depression had lower time and frequency domain parameters (p<0.05) except SDNN, SDANN and LF/HF ratio in contrast to obese non-depressive individuals. Additional load of diabetes and hypertension in depressed patients did not affect the cardiac autonomic modulation differences. Further prospective study can be undertaken within the same subjects to evaluate the effect of weight loss on the cardiac autonomic activity.\n\nConclusions:\n1. Extreme obesity altered cardiac autonomic activity independently of hypertension and diabetes.\n2. Depression associated with morbid obesity intensified HRV reduction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny

pharmacotherapy (paroxetine) and their combination would result in changes in temperament towards a pattern of increasing stimulation processing capacity. We assumed that temperament changes might be recorded in participants with posttreatment remission of PTSD. The research question was whether all treatment modalities used in the study would lead to the same changes in temperament. Data from 135 patients who had completed therapy were randomly assigned to a twelve-week treatment of PE, paroxetine or combined treatments and were analysed. Temperamental traits were assessed by the Formal Characteristics of Behaviour-Temperament Inventory before and after treatment and at the one-year follow-up, and PTSD symptoms were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders and a Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale. The results showed that temperament changes were observed only in subjects with remission of PTSD symptoms regardless of treatment modality and were maintained at follow-up. In conclusion, the study indicates that temperament traits change under effective treatment of PTSD towards a pattern of increased stimulation processing capacities. Despite the mechanisms of change, pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions influence this process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af710"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","name":"Wydział Psychologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a77ab"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"189","pagesFromTo":"111493","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63e0de7340970740cdc74706","63e0de7340970740cdc74707","5e7093b5878c28a0473af710","5e709355878c28a0473a77ab"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454791f5","mniswId":"15884","title":"Personality and Individual Differences","issn":"0191-8869","documentHash":"06abacc9-b599-4ffa-b1d1-85c14977ca6e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e0de7340970740cdc74705","year":"2022","volume":"189","documentHash":"6198ae50-1f49-4cc5-9feb-07b4835a3894"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058505622"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63e0d20b40970740cdc66dd2","name":"A","lastName":"Aryaie","documentHash":"e7451c32-1ab5-4fa6-8bfe-94cab1e17676"},{"objectId":"63e0d20b40970740cdc66dd1","name":"A","lastName":"Khan","documentHash":"8bdd098f-fdea-4cf2-a20a-d18721cad691"},{"objectId":"63e0d20b40970740cdc66dd0","name":"C","lastName":"Ibikunle","documentHash":"2c0cefc8-1474-4342-b81d-c8920150871f"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","name":"Michał","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"2DC5281868BC78E9C26D21E0DC520F19540A18FD2EA58B5363B94947AC0955C9A0CB1A73FF4A40149185E818A0C2BEACBE59432EC2451BF788E3208C50BBAD4B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5524-5932","documentHash":"0ff7aaa5-ed88-4d00-b98b-8654d53cdadf"}],"objectId":"63e0d20b40970740cdc66dce","doi":"10.1093/bjs/znac402.010","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article-pdf/109/Supplement_8/znac402.010/47443790/znac402.010.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"IBCOx-17 Safety of Single Stage Revision Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy Compared to Laparoscopic Roux-Y Gastric Bypass After Failed Gastric Banding","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Reoperation, after failed gastric banding, is a controversial topic. A common approach is band removal with conversion to gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy in a single-step procedure. In 2017 the analysis of MBSQAIP Participant User File (PUF) from 2015 revealed that conversion to sleeve gastrectomy might be a safer approach when compared to gastric bypass surgery. We decided to utilize MBSAQIP data from 2015-2018 and replicate the study, addressing critical methodological flaws. This study aimed to assess the safety of revisional surgery to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) compared to laparoscopic Roux-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) after failed laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) based on MBSAQIP Participant User File from 2015 to 2018.\n\nMethods: Patients who underwent a one-stage conversion of LAGB to LSG (Conv-LSG) or LRYGB (Conv-LRYGB) were identified in the MBSAQIP PUF from 2015 to 2017. Conv-LRYGB cases were matched (1:1) with Conv-LSG patients using propensity scoring to control for potential confounding. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were readmission, reoperation, intervention, leak and bleed rates, and morbidity.\n\nResults: A total of 9 974 patients (4987 matched pairs) were included in the study. The groups were closely matched as intended. was associated with higher risk for readmission Conv-LRYGB, as compared with conv-SG, was associated with a similar risk of mortality (0.02% vs. 0.02%; relative risk [RR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03 to 3.20, p=0.32). Conversion to LRYGB increased the risk for readmission (6.16% vs. 3.77%; RR, 1.63; 95%CI, 1.37 to 1.94, p<0.01); reoperation (2.15% vs. 1.36%; RR, 1.57; 95%CI, 1.17 to 2.12, p=<0.01); intervention (3.19% vs. 1.32%; RR, 2.41; 95%CI, 1.82 to 3.19, p<0.01); leak (1.76% vs. 1.02%; RR, 1.57; 95%CI, 1.72 to 2.42, p<0.01); bleeding (1.66% vs. 1.00%; RR, 1.66; 95%CI, 1.7 to 2.34, p<0.01); and morbidity (4.97% vs. 2.35%; RR, 2.12; 95%CI, 1.70 to 2.63, p<0.01).\n\nConclusions: The study confirms that a single stage conversion of failed gastric banding is associated with greater morbidity and higher complication rates when converted to LRYGB versus LSG in the first 30 days postoperatively. These differences are significant with regards to readmission, reoperation, intervention, leak and bleed rates, and morbidity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny

Articles published by November 2021 were retrieved; data were extracted according to the evidence-based PICO (population, intervention, control, outcome) model and analyzed using a random-effects model to estimate the pooled relative risk (RR) and its 95% confidence interval. The heterogeneity of studies was tested and quantified using Cochran's Q.\n\nResults: The initial search yielded 327 articles. After evaluation, 13 studies were analyzed. The thorough evaluation resulted in 13 articles, which were analyzed. A total number of 3,233,044 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The mean time of follow-up was 9.5 ± 7.9 years.

We have used them in the food industry as probiotics and supplements. In some settings, rod-shaped lactic acid bacteria may become pathogenic. It may occur in immunocompromised or heart disease patients after cardiac surgery, patients with disturbed intestinal wall permeability, or those treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nCase presentation: We present rare bacteraemia induced by the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus casei in a 63-year-old patient after the attempted removal of ICD electrodes, complicated by acute regurgitation of the tricuspid valve. The patient underwent urgent cardiac surgery, the electrode elements were removed, and the tricuspid valve was replaced with a biological prosthesis. After surgery, the patient required intensive, multidisciplinary treatment with mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, and blood product transfusion because of multiple organ failure. On the 14th day of hospitalisation, the clinical symptoms of septic shock were observed. The microbiological investigation was performed, and Lactobacillus casei was cultured from a dialysis catheter sample. Dedicated antimicrobials were administered, and the patient was discharged home in good overall condition.\n\nConclusions: The present case shows that the promoted use of probiotics must be cautiously administered to patients in severe conditions, especially when accompanied by reduced immune system efficiency symptoms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c1878c28a0473c3328"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64afe79c4097077ac5c27a36","64afe79c4097077ac5c27a37","64afe79c4097077ac5c27a38","64afe79c4097077ac5c27a39","64afe79c4097077ac5c27a3a","64afe79c4097077ac5c27a3b","5e7094c1878c28a0473c3328"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478521","mniswId":"10395","title":"Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery","issn":"1749-8090","eissn":"1749-8090","websiteLink":"http://cardiothoracicsurgery.biomedcentral.com/","documentHash":"726e04ae-1aae-477d-ba59-179e44ffee40"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64afe79c4097077ac5c27a35","year":"2023","volume":"18","number":"1","documentHash":"2483c71b-8a04-4eca-8bbb-78801162e561"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lactobacillus casei","Bloodstream infection","Implantable cardioverter defibrillator, complications","Cardiac surgery","Case report"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058835917"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64c8ef684097073b97dd53e6","name":"R.","lastName":"Różycki","documentHash":"36f5cb7f-278a-4f8c-a8bd-e6f5f2d0b2c0"},{"objectId":"64c8ef684097073b97dd53e5","name":"M.","lastName":"Olesińska","documentHash":"bfb331db-956c-45ed-9b8a-b2c939ab029c"},{"objectId":"64c8ef684097073b97dd53e4","name":"K.","lastName":"Romanowska-Prochnicka","documentHash":"0b0fbf8f-be9e-43e8-a49f-4a800346c1bf"},{"objectId":"642645aa40e3ff13873b5b8a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rerych","uuid":"B3B7EFF736523CFA60214E471B9CE2022BA14CC1DA4923C250DFF3AAB36F22D80B361A14A94F2D37833CF5178F4D3BBACEC795CC83EA591F123A072FBF2A5C93","documentHash":"fc392166-8a6c-40f2-a694-00bca84897f1"},{"objectId":"642645aa40e3ff13873b5b7a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Paczwa","uuid":"87D0AD284DD714AB0FFAB4C62E89AC7ECC8775ABDD521AEA8C8078CDEC604C25136B2D8520B8769303DC77498835EE2E7B66D34DE8FBDD06BE056D8C9B554AB3","documentHash":"c66714c2-e63b-4b21-9130-a0771b41ea30"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d18","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Gołębiewska","uuid":"F2665AB5B2999FC02DF56FDF3784FB9010206206FF605C3B6759C258FC69B0D63B53C0C26D5CC54B227ED867F9E393FF3B6959EFC0DDEDB812CFA48A6C4874DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3013-4363","documentHash":"4f47e4eb-f533-4405-b749-296388f9de84"}],"objectId":"64c8ef684097073b97dd53e2","doi":"10.1136/annrheumdis-2023-eular.4506","publicUri":"https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1136/annrheumdis-2023-eular.4506","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"AB0880 CORRELATION BETWEEN THE RESULTS OF NAIL FOLD CAPILLAROSCOPY AND OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY IN PATIENTS WITH SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Vasculopathy of blood vessels are, apart from immunological disorders, an important.\nCommon pathogenetic link of dangerous organ complications in systemic sclerosis (SSc).\nEndothelial damage is one of the mechanisms leading to disorders of vascular hemostasis, platelet activation, thrombosis causing coagulopathy and microangiopathy.\nNailfold capillaroscopy (NC) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool for the detection and monitoring patients with SSc and current methods of the assessment of microcirculation and capillary structure within the nail folds.\nAlthough vascular pathologies can occur in other organs including the organ of vision.

Patients with early scleroderma pattern in capillaroscopy showed larger superficial FAZ (0,4± 0,07 mm2) than pts with active (0,24 ± 0,09 mm2) and late (0,22 ±0,09 mm2). There was correlation between deep FAZ area and scleroderma pattern showing larger FAZ in pts with active (0,46±0,14 mm2) than pts with active (0,2 ±0,12 mm2) and late (0,17±0,13 mm2). Statistically significant difference was found between interstitial lung disease NSIP and UIP in correlation with deep FAZ area. Pts with NSIP had larger FAZ (0,32 ±0,14 mm2) than UIP pts (0,17 ±0,12 mm2). Moreover, NSIP pts had higher parafoveal mean superficial vessel density (42,21% ±1,69) than UIP (39,89 ±1,23). NSIP pts had also higher mean parafoveal deep vessel density (43,58 ±1,5 %) than UIP pts (41,72 ±1,55 %).\n\nConclusion: In conclusion, our findings indicate ocular vascular abnormalities in patient with SSc. The results show the important role of OCTA in diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of microvascular changes in SSc. Moreover, NF correlate with FAZ."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny

The choice of staple line reinforcement technique in LSG remains a subject of debate, particularly concerning postoperative bleeding complications.\n\nAim: The aim of this retrospective analysis is to assess the influence of different staple line reinforcement techniques on the occurrence of bleeding complications LSG.\n\nMaterial and methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing LSG between September 2021 and April 2023 at our institution. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the staple line reinforcement method: continuous suturing (n = 53) and clipping (n = 28). Surgical outcomes, including operative time, length of hospital stay, and bleeding complications, were assessed. Complications were classified using the Clavien-Dindo classification.\n\nResults: Continuous suturing was associated with a significantly longer operative time (88.15 min vs. 74.64 min, p < 0.05) but a similar length of hospital stay. Notably, no bleeding complications occurred in the continuous suturing group, while the clipping group experienced postoperative bleeding in 7.14% of cases (p < 0.05). Continuous suturing exhibited a slightly higher incidence of minor complications classified as Class I in the Clavien-Dindo classification (7.55% vs. 0%).\n\nConclusions: This retrospective analysis suggests that continuous suturing may provide enhanced hemostasis along the staple line, reducing the risk of postoperative bleeding compared to clipping. Despite the longer operative time and a slightly higher rate of minor complications, the clinical significance of these findings should be considered within the context of individual patient risk profiles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny

Impact of a Single Haemodialysis Session on the Retinal Thickness and Optic Nerve Morphology","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The aim of the study was to assess the influence of a single haemodialysis (HD) session on the retinal and optic nerve morphology in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients. Methods: It is a prospective study including only the right eye of 35 chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients subjected to HD. Each patient underwent a full eye examination 30 min before HD (8 a.m.) and 15 min after HD. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to assess the peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) thickness, macular nerve fibre layer (mRNFL) thickness, ganglion cell layer with inner plexiform layer thickness (GCL+), GCL++ (mRNFL and GCL+) thickness, total retinal thickness (RT) and total macular volume (TMV). The correlation was tested between such systemic parameters changes as systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), body weight, plasma osmolarity and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) and ultrafiltration volume with total RT and pRNFL thickness changes during HD. Results: In the results of a single HD session, we could observe a statistically significant increase in the total RT thickness (pre-HD 270.4 ± 19.94 μm, post-HD 272.14 ± 20.11 μm; p = 0.0014), TMV (pre-HD 7.48 ± 0.53 mm3, post-HD 7.52 ± 0.55 mm3; p = 0.0006), total pRNFL thickness (pre-HD 97.46 ± 15.71 μm, post-HD 100.23 ± 14.7 μm; p = 0.0039), total GCL+ thickness (pre-HD 70.11 ± 9.24 μm, post-HD 70.6 ± 9.7 μm; p = 0.0044), and GCL++ thickness (pre-HD 97.46 ± 12.56 μm, post-HD 97.9 ± 12.94 μm; p = 0.0081). We observed a significant correlation between the change in total RT and DBP change, as well as between body weight change and the change in total pRNFL thickness. There was also a correlation between total pRNFL thickness change and the presence of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: Even a single HD session affects the retinal and pRNFL thickness, which should be taken into account when interpreting the OCT results in patients subjected to HD. The impact of changes after a single HD session on selected parameters requires further assessment in subsequent studies, including long-term observation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w

Clinical guidelines recommend using ceftazidime/avibactam with aztreonam (CZA + AT) as the preferred option for NDM-producing Enterobacterales. However, the number of observations on such treatment regimen is limited. This retrospective study reports the clinical and microbiological outcomes of 23 patients with KP-NDM hospital-acquired infection treated with CZA + AT at a single center in Poland.\nMethods: The isolates were derived from the urine, lungs, blood, peritoneal cavity, wounds, and peritonsillar abscess. In microbiological analysis, mass spectrometry for pathogen identification, polymerase chain reaction, or an immunochromatographic assay for detection of carbapenemase, as well as VITEK-2 system, broth microdilution, and microdilution in agar method for antimicrobial susceptibility tests were used, depending of the pathogens' nature. CZA was administered intravenously (IV) at 2.5 g every eight hours in patients with normal kidney function, and aztreonam was administered at 2 g every eight hours IV. Such dosage was modified when renal function was reduced.\nResults: KP-NDM was eradicated in all cases. Four patients (17.4%) died: three of them had a neoplastic disease, and one - a COVID-19 infection.\nConclusion: The combination of CZA + AT is a safe and effective therapy for infections caused by KP-NDM, both at the clinical and microbiological levels. The synergistic action of all compounds resulted in a good agreement between the clinical efficacy of CZA + AT and the results of in vitro susceptibility testing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny

of the most common causes of vertigo, it is often underdiagnosed and omitted in the diagnosis of patients reporting vertigo. The aim of the study was to establish a diagnostic pattern useful in patients admitted due to vertigo, based on the most common clinical characteristics of patients suffered from posterior canal BPPV (PC-BPPV), horizontal canal BPPV with geotropic (HCG-BPPV) and apogeotropic nystagmus (HCA-BPPV). \nMethods: The analysis covered the results obtained in 105 patients with a positive result of the Dix-Hallpike maneuver or the supine roll test. The patients were divided into 3 groups based on the BPPV type: gr.1:PC-BPPV (60%); gr.2: HCG-BPPV (27%); gr.3: HCA-BPPV (13%). Patients before the diagnostic maneuvers filled the questionnaire concerning their symptoms and previous diseases. \nResults: Almost all patients had vertigo during turning over in bed and the character of the symptoms was paroxysmal. The answers to questions about the type of head movement evoked vertigo and how long vertigo lasted were differentiating. The percentages of correct diagnosis speculated by the combined answers were 69.6% in PC-BPPV, 61.8% in HCG-BPPV, and 80% in HCA-BPPV. \nConclusions: Basing on those observations there is presented the diagnostic schedule which could be useful in dizziness examination. The above results indicate that a properly collected interview with the patient allows for a high percentage of accurate diagnosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d4878c28a0473b17ec","5e70941b878c28a0473b6565"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"(16)","pagesFromTo":"1-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66bf13b2fdbe834206588226","5e70941b878c28a0473b6565","66bf13b2fdbe834206588227","5e7093d4878c28a0473b17ec","5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","issn":"2077-0383","eissn":"2077-0383","documentHash":"befa56e5-391b-4865-9035-19691faf400b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66bf13b2fdbe834206588225","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"16","documentHash":"24020c78-12f7-41ce-b4e1-282df4ca2772"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Vertigo","Dizziness","Apogeotropic nystagmus","Semicircular canals"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059719795"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e8","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Różycki","documentHash":"ae2d6eae-52d7-4d8f-9f30-4ba42fec6563"},{"objectId":"669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e7","name":"Michał","lastName":"Patyk","documentHash":"d4c94c44-359e-4a98-8be4-3309e82b790d"},{"objectId":"669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e6","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bojarska","documentHash":"ffe19964-48a2-4069-bde3-e29a7495b25f"},{"objectId":"669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e5","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Rotuski","documentHash":"37976c70-fa81-4a51-8f96-90a51aa0d98d"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d18","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Gołębiewska","uuid":"F2665AB5B2999FC02DF56FDF3784FB9010206206FF605C3B6759C258FC69B0D63B53C0C26D5CC54B227ED867F9E393FF3B6959EFC0DDEDB812CFA48A6C4874DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3013-4363","documentHash":"4f47e4eb-f533-4405-b749-296388f9de84"}],"objectId":"669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e3","doi":"10.3390/diagnostics14141476","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/14/14/1476/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Purtscher Retinopathy Resulting from a Car Crash Accident—Multimodal Imaging Value","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purtscher retinopathy is a rare but severe sight-threatening eye condition that mostly occurs in middle-aged men after chest compression or head injury. In cases such as acute pancreatitis, connective tissue disorders, kidney failure or COVID-19 infection with similar ocular findings but no history of trauma, a diagnosis of Purtscher-like retinopathy is made. We present a case of a 72-year-old female with typical symptoms of Purtscher retinopathy in both eyes after a car crash accident. Although the pathophysiology of the disease is not fully understood, the main cause of Purtscher retinopathy seems to be an embolic occlusion of the precapillary arterioles which supply the superficial peripapillary capillaries. Activation of the C5a component of the complement predisposes the leukocytes to aggregation, which obstructs blood flow. The main symptom of Purtscher retinopathy is sudden, painless deterioration of vision which occurs up to 48 h after the injury. In most patients, the changes observed in the fundus of the eye resolve within several months, and visual acuity slowly improves, sometimes even returning to the state from before the injury. However, risk factors such as older age, high hyperopia, and late treatment implementation can make the prognosis less favorable."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d18","669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e6","669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e5","669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e8","669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"1476","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e5","669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e6","669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e7","669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e8","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d18"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bf1a","mniswId":"5040","title":"Diagnostics","eissn":"2075-4418","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"39f0ab20-dff4-4c25-a21a-f57d5d573c52"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"669a18dbfdbe8343cdba39e4","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"14","documentHash":"72ab8c4f-2c65-4ed0-859f-f29ee0231011"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Purtscher retinopathy","Purtscher-like retinopathy","Purtscher flecken","traumatic retinopathy","multifocal electroretinography","visual evoked potentials","kinetic perimetry","OCT","fluorescein angiography"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059746258"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"642645aa40e3ff13873b5b8a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rerych","uuid":"B3B7EFF736523CFA60214E471B9CE2022BA14CC1DA4923C250DFF3AAB36F22D80B361A14A94F2D37833CF5178F4D3BBACEC795CC83EA591F123A072FBF2A5C93","documentHash":"fc392166-8a6c-40f2-a694-00bca84897f1"},{"objectId":"642645aa40e3ff13873b5b7a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Paczwa","uuid":"87D0AD284DD714AB0FFAB4C62E89AC7ECC8775ABDD521AEA8C8078CDEC604C25136B2D8520B8769303DC77498835EE2E7B66D34DE8FBDD06BE056D8C9B554AB3","documentHash":"c66714c2-e63b-4b21-9130-a0771b41ea30"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d18","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Gołębiewska","uuid":"F2665AB5B2999FC02DF56FDF3784FB9010206206FF605C3B6759C258FC69B0D63B53C0C26D5CC54B227ED867F9E393FF3B6959EFC0DDEDB812CFA48A6C4874DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3013-4363","documentHash":"4f47e4eb-f533-4405-b749-296388f9de84"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7f66","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Romanowska-Próchnicka","uuid":"E130E86506762AF87019DABEF121547B123DF3EC7D12BA649682F6E9C7EEAEB342ADDD752DA972F74F938D09612929E83B983C61924FA94EAD9CFE4B86A064BC","documentHash":"f999daab-7039-4ba4-8a18-b4a7bbc83279"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b47c5","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Olesińska","uuid":"253DC11B84FC4B4AA5EA4742E78A1C81C5144EA5B6E99D229C01F72CC63A40DFA8C8EC36FF0272916D61E21E346846B8D4948E171496524E98F7CDB343B0A334","orcidId":"0000-0003-3028-1061","documentHash":"fab9a735-7b88-4c86-b274-2c41edc75e29"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b404f","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Różycki","uuid":"4577160554EE553BDA184ECDAE8E37C07D70A0C04C14C08EC0961D4FA5CF6F73CBD762F71842EF0DD664C140D6E352DC3C03446F0A5D1ED00C2320C06E41A8A2","documentHash":"3b932947-3884-4bc2-95c0-a85f2b4a6dd6"}],"objectId":"669a1391fdbe8343cdba253c","doi":"10.1136/annrheumdis-2024-eular.3372","publicUri":"https://ard.bmj.com/content/83/Suppl_1/651.2","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"POS0880 Optical coherence tomography angiography in patients with mixed connective tissue disease","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The vascular complications due to connective tissue diseases (CTD) are a difficult clinical problem to be diagnosed and treated. Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a rare systemic autoimmune disease overlapping clinical feature of at least two connective tissue disorders including: systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), accompanied by the presence of anti-ribonucleoprotein antibodies (anti-U1RNP). The mechanism of vasculopathy associated with MCTD remains largely unknown. Vascular pathologies can affect different organs including the organ of vision. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT A) is a noninvasive imaging method of microvasculature of the retina and choroid providing the assessment of retinal perfusion.\nObjectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) parameters in patients with mixed connective tissue disease compared to healthy individuals.\nMethods: This study included 51 eyes from 27 patients (24 female,3 male) with MCTD and 112 eyes from 56 controls (47 female,9 male). The median age of the study patients was 44 and 38 in the control group. There was no statistically difference between the two groups in terms of age (p = 0,4043) and sex (p = 0,5496). OCTA scans were obtained in all participants. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ), FAZ perimeter (PERIM), flow density (FD), choriocapillaries flow area (CCFA), outer retina flow area (ORFA), foveal and parafoveal mean superficial and deep vessel density were compared between MCTD patients and healthy subjects. All the statistical procedures were carried out by using Statistica 13.3 (TIBCO Software Inc., Palo Alto, CA, U.S.A.)\nResults: Parafoveal mean superficial vessel density and parafoveal mean deep vessel density were significantly lower in the MCTD group than in controls (p = 0,0173, p = 0,0014, respectively). The FAZ, FAZ PERIM and FD values in the MCTD patients were lower than in the control group and statistically significant for all parameters (p = 0,0191, p = 0,0160, p = 0,0089, respectively). The decrease of CCFA was noticed in patients with MCTD (p = 0,0433). There was no statistically significant difference in the ORF area between groups (p = 0,8342).\nConclusion: Our research indicates ocular vascular abnormalities in patient with MCTD, decreased retinal vessel density and lower choricapillaries flow. The results show the important role of OCTA in diagnosis and monitoring microvascular changes in MCTD patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d18","5e7093f5878c28a0473b404f","642645aa40e3ff13873b5b8a","642645aa40e3ff13873b5b7a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"83","issue":"Suppl 1","pagesFromTo":"651","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709431878c28a0473b7f66","642645aa40e3ff13873b5b8a","642645aa40e3ff13873b5b7a","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d18","5e7093f5878c28a0473b404f","5e7093fd878c28a0473b47c5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454770a1","mniswId":"1303","title":"Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases","issn":"0003-4967","eissn":"1468-2060","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5f4cc3ac-5713-4cdb-ac55-dd0afa69d0c5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059746444"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66eaa75cfdbe836650af84f3","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Dec","documentHash":"80c1379f-3153-4922-a1ba-612455e30796"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":12,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"66eaa75cfdbe836650af84f1","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.24.04.2023.03","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.24.04.2023.03","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"ASSESSMENT OF BRAIN BIOELECTRICAL ACTIVITY IN CLINICALLY HEALTHY FLIGHT PERSONNEL AND FLIGHT TRAINING CANDIDATES FOLLOWING COVID-19 INFECTION","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Electroneurophysiological tests, together with tests to evaluate structures of the central nervous system (CNS), are in neurological diagnostics among the basic additional specialized examinations for diagnostic, therapeutic and certification purposes. The electroencephalographic (EEG) test is one of the methods of elelectroneurophysiological evaluation of the CNS. EEG is a non-invasive objective test of the bioelectrical activity of the brain.\n\nObjective: To investigate whether the course of COVID-19 with clinical mild/moderate respiratory tract involvement, in non-hospitalized patients, may affect brain bioelectrical activity.\n\nMethods: Eighty-five subjects were selected for evaluation of EEG recordings from clinically initially healthy flight personnel and flight training candidates. Of all the male and female subjects, between 04 January 2021 to 31 January 2022, as part of periodic and qualifying certification examinations at the Military Institute of Aviation Medicine, for the purposes of the Regional Military Aviation and Medical Commission. The selected group consisted of individuals aged 14-60 (average age: 27 years and 6 months), which included 14 women (average age: 24 years and 2 months) and 71 men (average age 29 years and 3.5 months). The subjects were ill with COVID-19 (non-hospitalized) for approximately 3-4 weeks, during the period; June 2020 – December 2021. Routinely made recordings of bioelectrical brain activity with the Grass Technologies EEG TWin 4.5.3 system were visually evaluated. EEG examinations were performed in the supine position, in the before noon hours, in a darkened and acoustically isolated laboratory. Before the study, each person declared min. 6-8 hours of sleep and eating a meal (breakfast). Except for the flight training candidates and one person from flight personnel, all other subjects declared having received one and 29 subjects two SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations, prior to contracting COVID-19. Some subjects had one further revaccination after recovery from the disease. EEG examinations were performed between one and fourteen months after recovery from COVID-19. The mean time between recovery and EEG examination was 6.5 (6.47) months.\n\nResults: EEG recordings within normal limits (normal) were found in 79 subjects, while six subjects (7.05%) had abnormal brain bioelectrical activity recordings.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 with clinical mild/moderate respiratory tract involvement by initially healthy individuals may adversely affect spontaneous brain bioelectrical activity in some individuals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66eaa75cfdbe836650af84f3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"18-24","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66eaa75cfdbe836650af84f3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eaa1bcfdbe836650aea408","year":"2020","volume":"26","number":"3","documentHash":"5f91c063-ff41-4d20-a0f4-e82340cf7100"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["EEG","SARS-CoV-2","COVID-19","post-COVID complications"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059777131"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f515bcfdbe83204d98c611","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Jaśkiewicz","documentHash":"f529c892-31e8-4f4b-a8af-74a58d61dc28"},{"objectId":"66f515bcfdbe83204d98c610","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sowa","documentHash":"767de648-746a-4e4b-9961-4d9ca377e4f6"},{"objectId":"66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60f","name":"Olga","lastName":"Markowska","documentHash":"d665f900-e6bf-4809-942e-a6d82a7b2668"},{"objectId":"66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60e","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Słoma","documentHash":"f0b1d6b8-4711-41c2-ae8b-217652094427"},{"objectId":"66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Przybylski","documentHash":"f3659897-7bdb-4335-a10b-cad1d5106128"},{"objectId":"66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Abakumow","documentHash":"e71b8305-6c6a-4e90-9315-a19b63f629ab"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":"C0A32190081AC4F30070F9ABD1DC8A19D56C31A0643074A3CE06E324618DF8100E040EDA9CB0742D261E60E4618202784774376B5D6371996DB8A739E71E4473","orcidId":"0000-0001-8347-0232","documentHash":"58246b4c-b642-4359-9013-6a685f2dc147"}],"objectId":"66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60b","doi":"10.3390/jpm14091010","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/14/9/1010/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Aggressive and Autoaggressive Behaviors in Patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Correlation with Middle Cerebral Artery Flow Velocity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background/Objectives The purpose of this study was to see whether there is a correlation between the behavior of autism spectrum disorder patients and brain abnormalities based on the velocity of blood flow in the MCA (middle cerebral artery). Methods: The use of HAP (High Altitude Protection) suits, which are used in aviation, to treat patients with ASD (autism spectrum disorder) causes significant changes in their functioning and physiological processes. These changes are not only noted in psychological tests but are observed in cerebral blood flow using transcranial Doppler ultrasound of the MCA. Results The results of this study made it possible to distinguish two groups with different flow velocities, which can be characterized as flows of less than 80 cm/s and flows of more than 80 cm/s. In addition, it was shown that in patients with elevated blood flow velocity, aggressive behaviors account for 86.96%, while self-aggressive behaviors account for 65.2%. On the other hand, in the case of patients with reduced flow velocity, i.e., less than 80 cm/s, the rate of aggressive behavior is 20% and that of self-aggressive behavior is 50%. The experiment showed that after therapy, there is a normalization of blood flow, which increased in the case of patients with a reduced flow rate below 80 cm/s and, in the case of elevated blood velocity after therapy, decreased towards normal levels. Conclusions The observed rate of normalization of flow velocities in the MCA translated into significant changes in the behavior and functioning of patients in the neurotypical direction, which was noticeable in the psychological tests conducted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a","66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60d","66f515bcfdbe83204d98c610"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1010","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60c","66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60d","66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60e","66f515bcfdbe83204d98c60f","66f515bcfdbe83204d98c610","66f515bcfdbe83204d98c611","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e309","mniswId":"24289","title":"Journal of Personalized Medicine","issn":"2075-4426","eissn":"2075-4426","documentHash":"ebceef71-c4b9-4d83-9e80-549e172981aa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66cd7daafdbe83243847ff24","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"9","documentHash":"8f512f85-3e2c-4468-9365-40cbeb80f9d2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["autism","autism therapy","cerebral artery","ultrasound","aggression","suit"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059791086"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03aa8","name":"Martin","lastName":"O'Donnell","documentHash":"97ec0376-2329-43c8-b106-ad842c1dafd3"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03aa7","name":"Salim","lastName":"Yusuf","documentHash":"31a5f266-a8b3-4a56-ab6e-211dcb097509"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03aa6","name":"Andrew","lastName":"Smyth","documentHash":"f32a9ca5-9159-44f8-914d-d9970175606f"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03aa5","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Wasay","documentHash":"18048f6a-66b1-4ce6-a433-fb064834a984"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03aa4","name":"Aytekin","lastName":"Oguz","documentHash":"6024bcba-d45e-429f-9c31-eeaf2e481d61"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03aa3","name":"Fernando","lastName":"Lanas","documentHash":"951e9e08-467c-404a-a9b7-e0da7e5b007c"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03aa2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Czlonkowska","documentHash":"a7023c3d-b701-41d5-8ac1-ec4d2b023c5c"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03aa1","name":"Helle K.","lastName":"Iversen","documentHash":"11cc7e3c-686f-4256-b6d5-1a8a4905ecfb"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03aa0","name":"Annika","lastName":"Rosengren","documentHash":"50c530e7-c756-421b-9b7a-568a33f4e06f"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03a9f","name":"Conor","lastName":"Judge","documentHash":"bf200a56-1c69-42a9-823a-d447824f3730"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03a9e","name":"Denis","lastName":"Xavier","documentHash":"4eed0e7a-3339-4a62-861a-a68f0bd4078f"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03a9d","name":"Shahram","lastName":"Oveisgharan","documentHash":"9bce63ef-3d6e-4bae-9ed8-1e99e2923deb"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03a9c","name":"Peter","lastName":"Langhorne","documentHash":"c14e4b75-de29-4afe-889d-5d297362d37f"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03a9b","name":"Xingyu","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"a5788f9b-693c-4404-b1eb-f834517a666b"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03a9a","name":"Graeme J.","lastName":"Hankey","documentHash":"c2299ff5-ae99-4aa7-9e87-27abe50f522b"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03a99","name":"Robert","lastName":"Murphy","documentHash":"034f927e-3597-4265-b5ea-f0d4a65c0d23"},{"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03a98","name":"Catriona","lastName":"Reddin","documentHash":"ea105492-f03d-49b0-8319-d0a703efee0c"},{"objectId":"5e7093f3878c28a0473b3d62","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Ryglewicz","uuid":"3B39A06BCFB05E6265C81045A50CC72D003102F637803F1DB0219A9692D4A28649771375C7101F0AEFF15ED6AF532DAFF2A60EADE3FFFE4D5CD5906BAF5A8A7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3401-8220","documentHash":"079be6fb-02b0-4500-b973-2cb4861438db"}],"objectId":"66f68bb5fdbe831edeb03a96","doi":"10.1111/ene.16314","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ene.16314","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Blood pressure variability in acute stroke: Risk factors and association with functional outcomes at 1 month","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background and purpose: Blood pressure variability, in acute stroke, may be an important modifiable determinant of functional outcome after stroke. In a large international cohort of participants with acute stroke, it was sought to determine the association of blood pressure variability (in the early period of admission) and functional outcomes, and to explore risk factors for increased blood pressure variability.\n\nPatients and methods: INTERSTROKE is an international case-control study of risk factors for first acute stroke. Blood pressure was recorded at the time of admission, the morning after admission and the time of interview in cases (median time from admission 36.7 h). Multivariable ordinal regression analysis was employed to determine the association of blood pressure variability (standard deviation [SD] and coefficient of variance) with modified Rankin score at 1-month follow-up, and logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for blood pressure variability.\n\nResults: Amongst 13,206 participants, the mean age was 62.19 ± 13.58 years. When measured by SD, both systolic blood pressure variability (odds ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.24 for SD ≥20 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure variability (odds ratio 1.15; 95% confidence interval 1.04-1.26 for SD ≥10 mmHg) were associated with a significant increase in the odds of poor functional outcome. The highest coefficient of variance category was not associated with a significant increase in risk of higher modified Rankin score at 1 month. Increasing age, female sex, high body mass index, history of hypertension, alcohol use, and high urinary potassium and low urinary sodium excretion were associated with increased blood pressure variability.\n\nConclusion: Increased blood pressure variability in acute stroke, measured by SD, is associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcome at 1 month.

Daily tea/coffee intake is consumed by > 50% of populations and may represent an important population-level exposure. Therefore, it is first essential that we better understand the associations between the tea/coffee intake and stroke.\n\nAims: This research aims to generate hypotheses about the global associations between tea and coffee intake and stroke. These insights will identify interventions for stroke prevention that can be further explored using alternative study designs.\n\nMethods: INTERSTROKE is a large international matched case-control study of first stroke from 32 countries. Participants were asked \"how many cups do you drink each day?\" of coffee, green tea, black tea, and other tea. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between intake and stroke.\n\nResults: We included 13,462 cases and 13,488 controls from INTERSTROKE; mean age was 61.7 (13.4) years and 59.6% (n = 16,010) were male. Overall, 19.4% (n = 5239) did not consume tea/coffee, 47.0% (n = 12,666) consumed tea only, 14.9% (n = 4024) consumed coffee alone, and 18.6% (n = 5021) consumed both, with significant regional variations. After multivariable adjustment, there was no association between low/moderate coffee intake and stroke, but high consumption (> 4/day) was associated with higher odds of all stroke (OR = 1.37 (95% CI = 1.06-1.77)) or ischemic stroke (OR = 1.32 (95% CI = 1.00-1.74)). Tea consumption was associated with lower odds of all (OR = 0.81 (95% CI = 0.69-0.94) for highest intake) or ischemic stroke (OR = 0.81 (95% CI = 0.68-0.98) for highest intake).\n\nConclusions: High coffee consumption was associated with higher odds of all or ischemic stroke; low-moderate coffee had no association with stroke. In contrast, tea consumption was associated with lower odds of stroke. These associations suggest that individuals consider avoiding high coffee consumption (⩾ five cups/day) to impact future stroke risk.\n\nData access statement: The design and rationale of INTERSTROKE was published previously.

Meanwhile, a number of studies conducted so far indicate that perceiving a higher risk in a certain behaviour is associated with a lower tendency to engage in that behaviour. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine whether there are differences in specific types of risky behaviours behind the wheel in relation to drivers’ perceptions of road risk. The Road Traffic Behaviour Questionnaires KZD and KZD-P were used to evaluate, respectively, different risky behaviours and risk perceptions in road traffic. Two groups of Polish car drivers with similar average KZD scores but significantly different KZD-P scores, i.e., higher vs. lower, were compared. The profiles of the answers were statistically analysed. It was found that drivers with a lower risk perception were far more likely to engage in those behaviours that are the most commonly reported and directly endanger road safety, e.g., speeding and running a red light. Simultaneously, there were several unsafe driving behaviours, e.g., driving without a seatbelt or speaking on a mobile phone while driving, which were taken regardless of risk perception, i.e., even by the drivers who were aware of their riskiness. The results suggest that risk perception is a significant factor in preventing not all types but only selected hazardous behaviours in road traffic. The significance of the findings for traffic safety as well as ideas for further research in this area are discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61b80fb87523402a58cb870f","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","5e7093b5878c28a0473af710"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"e39375","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","5e7093b5878c28a0473af710","61b80fb87523402a58cb870f","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c2a4","mniswId":"7504","title":"Heliyon","issn":"2405-8440","eissn":"2405-8440","documentHash":"70f70987-7e3b-4241-9b3b-c4bb0901a1ce"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"670e1069fdbe8318b36ca032","year":"2024","volume":"10","number":"20","documentHash":"13640d49-7c1c-4f93-86c4-70867c682778"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Risk perception","Risky driving behaviours","Car drivers","Traffic violation","Road safety"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059850948"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb56","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Dobkowski","documentHash":"fe10aeb5-6ba0-4015-a992-ec418f9f1fea"},{"objectId":"674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb55","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Jędras","documentHash":"76a4feec-cb08-44b2-b14c-ee930d0eb1b0"},{"objectId":"674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb54","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sroczyński","documentHash":"f5ccd648-6322-460f-8fcf-c8f77fa169f0"},{"objectId":"674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb53","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Golik","documentHash":"fb7f34c9-7f37-4591-a7dd-283f4a6da375"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","name":"Michał","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"2DC5281868BC78E9C26D21E0DC520F19540A18FD2EA58B5363B94947AC0955C9A0CB1A73FF4A40149185E818A0C2BEACBE59432EC2451BF788E3208C50BBAD4B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5524-5932","documentHash":"0ff7aaa5-ed88-4d00-b98b-8654d53cdadf"}],"objectId":"674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb51","doi":"10.20452/wiitm.2024.17896","publicUri":"https://www.mp.pl/videosurgery/en/node/17896/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Effects of obesity on outcomes of laparoscopic TAPP inguinal hernia repairs: a retrospective analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Inguinal hernia repair, particularly the transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) technique, is common worldwide. Obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥30 kg/m2) can influence surgical outcomes, potentially resulting in longer operative time, higher complication rate, and prolonged hospital stay.\n\nAim: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of obesity on surgical outcomes following laparoscopic TAPP inguinal hernia repair.\n\nMaterials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients who underwent laparoscopic TAPP inguinal hernia repair between September 2021 and December 2023. We included patients aged 18 years or older who had elective unilateral TAPP repair for primary inguinal hernia. The patients were categorized based their BMI as obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) and nonobese (BMI <⁠30 kg/m2). Outcomes assessed included recurrence rate, surgical site infections (SSIs), operative time, and length of hospital stay.\n\nResults: We analyzed 201 patients of whom 30 (14.8%) were obese and 171 (85.2%) were nonobese. Recurrence rates were 6.67% in the obese and 2.35% in the nonobese patients (P = 0.222). No SSIs were observed in the obese patients, as compared with 1.76% in the nonobese individuals (P = 1). Mean (SD) operative time was 78.87 (31.88) minutes for the obese and 70.28 (27.25) minutes for the nonobese patients (P = 0.203). Mean (SD) hospital stay was 3.13 (0.35) days for the patients with and 3.05 (0.28) days for those without obesity (P = 0.086).\n\nConclusions: There were no significant differences in recurrence rates, SSIs, operative time, or hospital stay between the obese and nonobese patients. Appropriate surgical expertise and perioperative management can result in comparable outcomes for both groups. Further research is recommended to understand the impact of obesity on hernia recurrence."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb53","674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb54","674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb55","674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"342-346","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb53","674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb54","674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb55","674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb56","5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff940ad49b31ccec69c0f","title":"Videosurgery and Other Miniinvasive Techniques","issn":"1895-4588","eissn":"2299-0054","documentHash":"f336f1ef-c0fd-4a95-b717-d4f2a9e4112d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674ef6d8fdbe832d4f46eb52","year":"2024","documentHash":"0e6d4d08-bcbd-4a64-b6a8-c91216bfd733"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["body mass index","inguinal hernia","obesity","recurrence rate","transabdominal preperitoneal patch plasty"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059955005"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f94","name":"Marek","lastName":"Prost","uuid":"2A0CC984D0EA572ACE1ADE99403F369A208B9FF2F950A985442935F1A31594C02D828739162CA056E98388A485E29E76E5AAF9A21133830551C8A4534F7056E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5620-4171","documentHash":"ac37fe83-fa75-467f-976e-d1591791e5fd"}],"objectId":"674edde8fdbe832d4f43cb8b","publicUri":"https://pzwl.pl/Dziecko-przedwczesnie-urodzone.-Pierwsze-lata-zycia,187357313,p.html?srsltid=AfmBOorwcVcpyOAZp8G8aKpru1v3FbdBAO4ruhyXz_dIPboX8NTabPSS","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Późne zmiany w narządzie wzroku u dzieci urodzonych przedwcześnie","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f94"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"393-408","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f94"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"65731c9c4097071b8e6fe8ea","title":"Dziecko przedwcześnie urodzone.

This study aimed to replicate a real flight of the MiG-29 aircraft using a centrifuge-based dynamic flight simulator and to determine the simulator’s accuracy in recreating in-flight aircraft performance. A 60-second recording of the real flight of the MiG-29 aircraft, captured by the flight data recorder, was chosen for replication in the HTC-07 human training centrifuge simulator. To evaluate how accurately the simulator replicates the performance of the aircraft, the linear accelerations and angular velocities acting on a pilot during the real flight were compared with those during the replication of that flight in the simulator. The fit of these parameters was assessed using the root mean square percentage error (RMSPE) and the correlation coefficient (r). The highest replication accuracy was achieved for the vertical component of the linear acceleration (RMSPE=2068; r=0.98), while the worst result was obtained for the longitudinal component (RMSPE=14205; r=0.31). Inaccuracies were much more pronounced for the angular velocity. The roll angular velocity had the lowest replication error (RMSPE=12640). However, its correlation with the recorded velocity during the real flight was very weak (r=-0.02). Despite some inaccuracies in replicating other components of the acceleration and angular velocity vectors, the HTC-07 simulator seems valuable for investigating aviation incidents or accidents related to human factors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"53","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"161-190","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a054","mniswId":"24160","title":"Journal of Konbin","issn":"1895-8281","eissn":"1895-8281","documentHash":"3d87a489-7b60-496f-8a0b-9a61e96fe0f3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674ee6b6fdbe832d4f4527f1","year":"2023","volume":"53","number":"4","documentHash":"634b8a4f-c97b-430e-b725-a4ee23f721d4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["human factor","flight simulator","centrifuge","flight safety","accident investigation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059955390"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f94","name":"Marek","lastName":"Prost","uuid":"2A0CC984D0EA572ACE1ADE99403F369A208B9FF2F950A985442935F1A31594C02D828739162CA056E98388A485E29E76E5AAF9A21133830551C8A4534F7056E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5620-4171","documentHash":"ac37fe83-fa75-467f-976e-d1591791e5fd"}],"objectId":"674f0ca8fdbe832d4f487c71","publicUri":"https://medbook.com.pl/pl/pediatria/87975-algorytmy-postepowania-w-praktyce-pediatrycznej-marcin-tkaczyk-19406.html?srsltid=AfmBOopGV-W5qNfQZwdapXtD01CCjfIKIZYh9rs_Ns-QhMtfWPaw3PGE","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Choroby oczu","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Unikalne opracowanie algorytmów diagnostyczno-leczniczych do użytku w podstawowej opiece zdrowotnej dzieci.\n\nAlgorytmy powstały w wyniku analizy dostępnych standardów, zaleceń oraz doświadczenia klinicznego autorów, którzy od wielu lat leczą dzieci i współpracują z podstawową opieką zdrowotną.

Our study examined whether subjective feelings about QoL are related to the psychosocial functioning in paediatric patients. A cross-sectional study among 50 children with WD, aged 7–18 years. Participants completed the KINDL QoL questionnaire and the Child Behavior Checklist assessing internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Internalizing and externalizing behaviors and their interaction are significant in predicting the QoL of children with WD. Internalizing behaviors are significant predictor of the QoL β = −0.328 (p < 0.05). The effect of internalizing behavior on the QoL varies with the level of externalizing behavior β = −0.344* (p < 0.05). Simple effects analysis indicates that the highest QoL for children with WD is in the group characterized by both low levels of internalizing and medium levels of externalizing behaviors, t = −3.052 (df = 46) and p < 0.01, or high levels of externalizing behaviors, t = −2.725 (df = 46) p < 0.01. The interaction between internalizing behaviors explained an additional 7.5% of the variance in scores on the QoL scale. Overall, the final regression model explained 14.9% of the scores on the QoL scale. Monitoring internalizing and externalizing behaviors will allow a better understanding of the course of treatment. In chronic disease, the QoL is an aspect that determines the doctor-patient relationship and often determines the course of the therapeutic process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"79","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"206-212","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674eef47fdbe832d4f461d13","674eef47fdbe832d4f461d14","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647","674eef47fdbe832d4f461d15","674eef47fdbe832d4f461d16","674eef47fdbe832d4f461d17"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547896c","mniswId":"12199","title":"JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC GASTROENTEROLOGY AND NUTRITION","issn":"0277-2116","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b343bbd1-c0d5-4c96-8090-a347c0a31ed4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674eef47fdbe832d4f461d12","year":"2024","volume":"79","number":"2","documentHash":"9ccb83c2-cccd-4aa5-9da7-b821d92fb903"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["adaptation process","anger","chronic disease"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059955564"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f94","name":"Marek","lastName":"Prost","uuid":"2A0CC984D0EA572ACE1ADE99403F369A208B9FF2F950A985442935F1A31594C02D828739162CA056E98388A485E29E76E5AAF9A21133830551C8A4534F7056E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5620-4171","documentHash":"ac37fe83-fa75-467f-976e-d1591791e5fd"}],"objectId":"674ee1e4fdbe832d4f44677d","publicUri":"https://podyplomie.pl/okulistyka/37897,zacma-jako-objaw-galaktozemii","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Zaćma jako objaw galaktozemii","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f94"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"11","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"11-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f94"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a21f","mniswId":"1001513","title":"Okulistyka po Dyplomie","issn":"2083-5124","eissn":"2449-9250","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4c999ccb-ff3b-483a-9093-16f659336be2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059982059"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Lewkowicz","uuid":"BF6D249A381A0391439E308824924A8ABB75132BA2EB9A3C3E64407CED94E95127441BA92A3FD2E9B4FDD85F05549D8368FC546DF560AAFF0FFD9F1568488BB8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3691-6558","documentHash":"51f0522a-472a-43d8-beeb-5096e983e846"}],"objectId":"674edadffdbe832d4f439967","publicUri":"https://itwl.pl/component/content/article/1528-wydawnictwa-ksiazkowe/2022/553-mechanika-w-lotnictwie-ml-xx-2022-pod-red-krzysztofa-sibilskiego-i-piotra-lichoty?Itemid=671","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Algorytm optymalnego bodźcowania ruchowego z LQR do generowania złudzenia przechylenia w symulatorze lotu z platformą Stewarta-Gougha","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem prezentowanych badań było opracowanie algorytmu optymalnego bodźcowania ruchowego (ang.

In the face of rising life expectancy, adequate hernia management in older adults is crucial. Laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal patch plasty (TAPP) for hernia repair is minimally invasive, but poses challenges in the elderly due to a larger number of comorbidities.\n\nAim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TAPP hernia repair in patients aged 70 years and older.\n\nMaterials and methods: Our retrospective study reviewed data of patients who underwent elective unilateral TAPP repair for primary inguinal hernia between September 2021 and December 2023. The patients were divided by age: 70 and older (cases) and younger than 70 (controls). Primary outcomes included recurrence rate, surgical site infections (SSIs), operative time, and hospital stay. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and inferential tests.\n\nResults: The study included 201 patients (47 cases and 154 controls). The mean (SD) age was 75.74 (4.73) years for the cases and 53.47 (12.8) years for the controls. No recurrences were found in the elderly (cases) group, while the control group recorded a 3.92% recurrence rate (P = 0.34). SSIs affected 2.13% of the cases and 1.31% of the controls (P = 0.55). Operative times were similar (71.44 vs 71.96 min; P = 0.8). Hospital stay was 3.11 days for the cases and 3.04 days for the controls (P = 0.14).\n\nConclusions: Laparoscopic TAPP hernia repair is a safe and effective procedure in the elderly and its outcomes are comparable to those recorded in younger patients. Further studies are needed to validate these results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","674ef566fdbe832d4f468bbb","674ef566fdbe832d4f468bba","674ef566fdbe832d4f468bb9","674ef566fdbe832d4f468bb8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"325-329","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674ef566fdbe832d4f468bb8","674ef566fdbe832d4f468bb9","674ef566fdbe832d4f468bba","674ef566fdbe832d4f468bbb","5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a72","mniswId":"20126","title":"Videosurgery and Other Miniinvasive Techniques","issn":"1895-4588","eissn":"2299-0054","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"493e628e-1a66-4943-8279-bfeabe266e77"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674ef566fdbe832d4f468bb7","year":"2024","documentHash":"c30504d7-a8f3-4fcb-a921-ff84cf7988ff"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["elderly","hernia repair","laparoscopic surgery","outcomes","transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059985721"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Lewkowicz","uuid":"BF6D249A381A0391439E308824924A8ABB75132BA2EB9A3C3E64407CED94E95127441BA92A3FD2E9B4FDD85F05549D8368FC546DF560AAFF0FFD9F1568488BB8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3691-6558","documentHash":"51f0522a-472a-43d8-beeb-5096e983e846"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Biernacki","uuid":"0BB4DA4BBAC66385A263453765956DD53EF2596A6817DD55D280BB75512AFE118FEC6185785BC5E76AF55F1C63C339EA849E0616285D5E19650E18E44AD33329","orcidId":"0000-0002-1650-0013","documentHash":"642946bd-d527-4249-b8db-9ddaac00e65d"}],"objectId":"674ef198fdbe832d4f463838","doi":"10.1016/j.apergo.2024.104268","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0003687024000450?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The role of visual conditions and aircraft type on different aspects of pilot workload","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective: The objective of our work was to assess the impact of flight conditions by aircraft type on the workload estimated using NASA-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).\n\nBackground: Learning about subjective workload is important for assessing the impact of a pilot's work environment on their performance in the cockpit. This is an important element of flight safety and includes the prevention of aviation accidents.\n\nMethods: The study included 146 military pilots that fly the following aircrafts: flying fast-jet (21), fixed-wing (24), and rotary-wing (101). The NASA-TLX questionnaire was used to assess workload and pilots were asked to determine the level of workload resulting from flying under the following conditions: daytime flight (VFR), night-vision flight performed under Night Visual Flight Rules (NVFR), and night-vision flight using night-vision goggles (NVGs).\n\nResults: The highest level of workload was consistently attributed to flights performed under NVG conditions. NVFR conditions were rated as the most burdensome, while VFR conditions were rated as the least burdensome. Fast-jet pilots rated their mental performance and effort workload as significantly higher than pilots of other aircrafts.\n\nConclusion: Pilots' perceived workload is influenced by both flight conditions and the type of aircraft they fly. Workload knowledge is important for flight safety and should be taken into account during training and flight-task planning.\n\nApplication: The results of our study can be useful both in flight training and in work on the effectiveness of the human-machine interface.

Both invasive and native species are capable of spreading tropical diseases, which endanger troops stationing in areas rich in mosquitos. The aim of the review is to analyze current knowledge about the distribution of mosquito species in Europe, including Poland, and the factors influencing their presence.\n\nReview methods:\nA systematic literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. The search included key words related to mosquitoes, vector-borne diseases, and climate change. Data were supplemented with information from the websites of the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).\n\nBrief description of the state of knowledge:\nInvasive mosquitoes, such as Aedes albopictus, have been spreading in Europe since the 1990s. Rising temperatures and global movement of people and goods are the main driving forces of this phenomenon. Even native European mosquito species, like Culex spp., are able to transmit tropical diseases. The European Mosquito Control Association is developing mosquito control programmes but they are not sufficiently implemented.\n\nSummary:\nMosquitoes transmit various viral and parasitic diseases. The presence of invasive exotic mosquitoes in Europe is linked to developments in transportation and climate change. Rising temperatures enable mosquitoes to adapt to new regions previously free of them. This issue requires effective protective measures and competent personnel to implement vector control methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["674ef858fdbe832d4f46f570","5e709315878c28a0473a291c","5e709344878c28a0473a5fa8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674ef858fdbe832d4f46f570","5e709315878c28a0473a291c","674ef858fdbe832d4f46f571","5e709344878c28a0473a5fa8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705a","mniswId":"1204","title":"Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine","issn":"1232-1966","eissn":"1232-1966","documentHash":"b31b4b25-9a38-44f0-af3e-954c16558214"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659fbe2440970707a12a7d24","year":"2024","documentHash":"cc068f28-36c5-452c-ac4a-aea0052f8d13"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climate change","transmission","invasive species","pathogenicity","mosquito"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059992454"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f94","name":"Marek","lastName":"Prost","uuid":"2A0CC984D0EA572ACE1ADE99403F369A208B9FF2F950A985442935F1A31594C02D828739162CA056E98388A485E29E76E5AAF9A21133830551C8A4534F7056E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5620-4171","documentHash":"ac37fe83-fa75-467f-976e-d1591791e5fd"}],"objectId":"674f0e05fdbe832d4f488ebe","publicUri":"https://pzwl.pl/Pacjent-z-cukrzyca-interdyscyplinarnie,247341332,p.html?srsltid=AfmBOoqwNnyV0tzzIGudOEp-jdb80KRb5jDuT8_wz9kM1ovPQ2XA4HMz","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Pacjent z cukrzycą u okulisty, bo oczy to nie tylko zwierciadło duszy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Monografia poświęcona interdyscyplinarnej opiece nad chorymi z cukrzycą, przedstawiająca liczne powikłania, które mogą wystąpić w cukrzycy, ukazane z perspektywy nie tylko diabetologa, ale przede wszystkim przez lekarzy innych specjalizacji: lekarza rodzinnego, kardiologa, lekarza medycyny rodzinnej i sportowej, geriatry, nefrologa, endokrynologa, gastrologa, dermatologa, bariatry, okulisty, ginekologa, reumatologa, seksuologa, neurologa, psychiatry, dietetyka, hematologa czy pulmonologa.

Since the use of nitisinone in addition to diet in 1992, survival rates have increased significantly, but more and more socio-emotional problems have become apparent. The aim of the study was the assessment the relationship between variations in serum tyrosine and phenylalanine levels and measurements of socio-emotional functioning and determination of patients’ IQs.\n\nThe aim of the study\nwas the assessment the relationship between variations in serum tyrosine and phenylalanine levels and measurements of socio-emotional functioning and determination of patients’ IQs.\n\nMaterial and methods\nTwelve children were studied, from a single centre, born between 1994 and 2012, treated with nitisinone and a low-phenylalanine and -tyrosine diet. The psychological evaluation was conducted using the parent form of the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL)/4–18. Additionally, the patients’ IQs were measured using the Stanford-Binet 5 (SB5) Intelligence Scale. Statistical analyses were performed using PAWS software suite version 26. We found that phenylalanine variability over time correlated with measures of emotional and behavioural functioning. This relationship holds true for externalising behaviour, associated with the experience of maladjustment and aggression. Total score intellectual and cognitive function was within the norm for all patients.\n\nConclusions\nTo maintain better quality of life for patients and their families in terms of emotional and behavioural functioning, it may be important to avoid spikes (significant fluctuations) in phenylalanine levels. Regular, detailed psychological evaluations are recommended to detect potential problems and implement interventions aimed at achieving the best possible individual development and realise the intellectual and behavioural potential, thereby improving the patient's and her family's quality of life."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"8-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["674efcf6fdbe832d4f472f8a","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647","674efcf6fdbe832d4f472f8b","674efcf6fdbe832d4f472f8c","674efcf6fdbe832d4f472f8d","674efcf6fdbe832d4f472f8e","674efcf6fdbe832d4f472f8f","674efcf6fdbe832d4f472f90","674efcf6fdbe832d4f472f91"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a26c","mniswId":"25479","title":"Pediatric Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism","issn":"2081-237X","eissn":"2083-8441","websiteLink":"http://www.pediatricendocrinology.pl","documentHash":"e253aa6b-7e14-4c82-8265-67d86d9f7e23"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674efcf6fdbe832d4f472f89","year":"2024","volume":"30","number":"1","documentHash":"e1d8d77b-1897-4c5f-bf76-c0bc81ac209a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tyrosinaemia type 1","emotional and behavioural functioning","phenylalanine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059992813"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Baran","uuid":"DE5109AC31FEAD2D4357F905BBFB2BD9EF45B6B0D2C67EC84D748D3C6C51422BF715AD923918E9DFED3BE616640AF742C25045F13190E0E5D30C560DF323F8A6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9233-1293","documentHash":"630f66b2-eb31-43c6-afc4-c10eac142c0a"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af710","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"33581742CA14A3609216D8FDDA88C64836165861D5679EC635C5F7E8953CE3C664BCBA2085F7C302CD9FB4A5115A3CCE7389EF1174BA29CF5C9AC92B8E6FD38B","orcidId":"0000-0003-2143-9883","documentHash":"aaf7a92b-beee-4f4d-9922-3117b9e76e3e"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d32d","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Mamcarz","uuid":"03BC8788D6CB3A5188F00F29D5FBAE24FC90116793AF8C35981093D04037FB9EABC6935D6FA45366A05099AF174664A5BBB8C9414D0626E10BC66EB868232242","orcidId":"0000-0001-6307-6326","documentHash":"1cf51c50-99bb-4813-808f-bea6f71d79eb"}],"objectId":"66f16266fdbe833567ac02bf","doi":"10.1016/j.trf.2024.06.024","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S136984782400158X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Risk-taking behind the wheel: Validation of the Road Traffic Behaviours Questionnaire based on data from Polish car drivers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Applying appropriate measurement tools is necessary when examining risky driving behaviours. The aim of this paper is to present a revised Road Traffic Behaviours Questionnaire, i.e., KZD(R), for studying the tendency towards risky behaviour on the road. The study was conducted on a group of 1281 Polish passenger car drivers (630 females) with an average age of 38.78 years (SD = 13.16). The psychometric properties of the questionnaire have been checked by means of factor analysis and adequate reliability measures (the McDonald’s omega index of reliability was 0.92, showing a high internal consistency of the scale, and the stability index after a year was at the same level). Positive correlations of the questionnaire results with impulsiveness and venturesomeness from the IVE questionnaire, as well as negative correlations with empathy (IVE) and agreeableness from the Big Five model, confirmed the validity of the tool to measure risk-taking behind the wheel. Moreover, the ROC curve analysis was performed to assess the differentiating ability of the tool’s scores in relation to the self-reported data collected from the drivers on the number of road accidents, traffic tickets received, and situations of driving after alcohol usage. The cutpoint above 10 points was established as optimal for classifying drivers into the group of potential dangerous risk-takers in road traffic. Overall, the KZD(R) can be a useful tool to measure risk-taking behind the wheel for various road safety and accident prevention purposes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","5e7093b5878c28a0473af710"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de22","uid":"bgWwWc4g_PZlP-gzFo2l2EA","uuid":"9d3664e2-2c7a-448a-9fb2-278de61e6136","name":"Katolicki Uniwersytet Lubelski Jana Pawła II","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cf878c28a04739d32d"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de22","parentUuid":"9d3664e2-2c7a-448a-9fb2-278de61e6136","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de22","rootUuid":"9d3664e2-2c7a-448a-9fb2-278de61e6136","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"105","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","5e7092cf878c28a04739d32d","5e7093b5878c28a0473af710"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799be","mniswId":"19746","title":"TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR","issn":"1369-8478","documentHash":"a730e9be-cec7-45e8-a268-9ae964dde7ee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f16266fdbe833567ac02c0","year":"2024","volume":"105","documentHash":"0a8276c8-6eb4-46ea-a0c0-2bf1f257ea40"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Road Traffic Behaviours Questionnaire","KZD","KZD(R)","Risk taking","Car drivers","Road traffic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060589562"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674f0831fdbe832d4f483100","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Dereń-Szumełda","documentHash":"5a34f6b7-d56e-4528-bdcd-18e28791d314"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b808f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"CB5563DBAD99E3EAB2D1F21B481ADC62403071362BAD1B6AFF0337B29C9BF1AECB037166FEBF5F3DE08624BB74444B15D1DF35A0517D66D208A619B7E2997EAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8722-0692","documentHash":"d2d631aa-bf06-4b4b-9449-bbd72d1834fb"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Dziuda","uuid":"9FEFD234C4BCA4347083F86144629E8A34EDE89D406C69FEB221E8A7C1EC02B1A851D8AF241D5F91FA8BB1A9025D1AA085D757CC6D7F99A3A8EDE63ECEE42B82","orcidId":"0000-0003-1816-4604","documentHash":"6627d7c3-a4d8-4e95-92c5-b1b4874a828c"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Dereń","uuid":"8E4E129503EF74F1405EF82DEB16CE116DD41EA4FF2678A7971D949D50A7A44DAED8D6F15057E7B6D6A2DEF62672678D297A72E06ACA330861DC1339C3EB237E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4013-1895","documentHash":"9b00cfe4-872d-4ad9-80af-45419fe066eb"}],"objectId":"674f0831fdbe832d4f4830ff","publicUri":"https://repo.bg.wat.edu.pl/info/book/WATfee17984bc94444b8f0044f8f3c34bd2?ps=20&lang=pl&title=&pn=1&cid=28944","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Wymagania prawne procesu certyfikacji wyrobu medycznego pn. \"System SymuLBNP\"","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","5e709433878c28a0473b808f","674f0831fdbe832d4f483100"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","5e709433878c28a0473b808f","674f0831fdbe832d4f483100","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"633c10e74097074f73506593","title":"Problematyka normalizacji, jakości i kodyfikacji w aspekcie integracji z NATO i Unią Europejską : jakość - problemy i rozwiązania.

We sought to explore the association between intake of these beverages and stroke.\nMethods\nINTERSTROKE is an international matched case-control study of first stroke. Participants reported beverage intake using food frequency questionnaires or were asked “How many cups do you drink each day of water?” Multivariable conditional logistic regression estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations with stroke.\nResults\nWe include 13,462 cases and 13,488 controls; mean age was 61.7±13.4 years and 59.6% (n=16,010) were male. After multivariable adjustment, carbonated beverages were linearly associated with ischemic stroke (OR 2.39 [95% CI 1.64-3.49]); only consumption once/day was associated with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (OR 1.58 [95% CI 1.23-2.03]). There was no association between fruit juice/drinks and ischemic stroke, but increased odds of ICH for once/day (OR 1.37 [95% CI 1.08-1.75)] or twice/day (OR 3.18 [95% CI 1.69-5.97]). High water intake (>7 cups/day) was associated ischemic stroke (OR 0.82 [95% CI 0.68-0.99]) but not ICH. Associations differed by Eugeographical region—increased odds for carbonated beverages in some regions only; opposing directions of association of fruit juices/drinks with stroke in selected regions.\nConclusion\nCarbonated beverages were associated with increased odds of ischemic stroke and ICH, fruit juice/drinks were associated with increased odds of ICH, and high water consumption was associated with reduced odds of ischemic stroke, with important regional differences. Our findings suggest optimizing water intake, minimizing fruit juice/drinks, and avoiding carbonated beverages."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f3878c28a0473b3d62"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"391-402","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67af4350fdbe8332768e8d4b","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d4c","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d4d","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d4e","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d4f","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d50","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d51","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d52","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d53","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d54","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d55","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d56","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d57","5e7093f3878c28a0473b3d62","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d58","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d59","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d5a","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d5b","67af4350fdbe8332768e8d5c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478ab1","mniswId":"12729","title":"Journal of Stroke","issn":"2287-6391","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"fb0e7d18-5ff6-422c-b6e2-48733274cc85"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67af4350fdbe8332768e8d4a","year":"2024","volume":"26","number":"3","documentHash":"790938a3-95e1-449e-9c72-7786aadd34f1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Stroke","Carbonated beverages","Fruit juice","Water","Diet"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060628732"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62eb9f684097071dc17b6be8","name":"Omar M.","lastName":"Ghanem","orcidId":"0000-0002-5725-8497","documentHash":"215ad598-dc70-4058-aa9e-d65c93a15f45"},{"objectId":"62eb9f684097071dc17b6be7","name":"Rana","lastName":"Pullat","documentHash":"ee3bf570-63ce-430b-8cd8-3923843f3056"},{"objectId":"62eb9f684097071dc17b6be6","name":"Farah","lastName":"Husain","documentHash":"7ba4b687-84ce-4f84-a35c-6d11bc3a23b8"},{"objectId":"62eb9f684097071dc17b6be5","name":"Omer","lastName":"Ul Hassan","documentHash":"9eef9fcd-74a6-4f15-86e0-4054233611ea"},{"objectId":"62eb9f684097071dc17b6be4","name":"Ahmet","lastName":"Vahibe","documentHash":"05cee988-00ac-46fc-a5e8-f84aee2c595f"},{"objectId":"62eb9f684097071dc17b6be3","name":"John","lastName":"Corbett","documentHash":"a08bbdc0-ac9e-4edc-8d70-8129e467c7cc"},{"objectId":"62eb9f684097071dc17b6be1","name":"Ben","lastName":"Clapp","documentHash":"c59bd09a-6cfc-4277-8d78-21bb182b6890"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","name":"Michał","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"2DC5281868BC78E9C26D21E0DC520F19540A18FD2EA58B5363B94947AC0955C9A0CB1A73FF4A40149185E818A0C2BEACBE59432EC2451BF788E3208C50BBAD4B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5524-5932","documentHash":"0ff7aaa5-ed88-4d00-b98b-8654d53cdadf"}],"objectId":"62eb9f684097071dc17b6bdf","doi":"10.1007/s00464-022-09477-3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00464-022-09477-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Duodenal switch without versus with laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a perioperative risk comparative analysis of the MBSAQIP database (2015–2019)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background The results of concurrent cholecystectomy with Roux-en Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy have been\nwell elucidated. Large-scale data on the outcomes of concomitant cholecystectomy during biliopancreatic diversion with\nduodenal switch (BPD-DS) are still lacking. Our study aimed to explore whether simultaneous cholecystectomy with BPD-\nDS alters the 30-day postoperative outcomes.\nMethods We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MBSAQIP database between 2015 and 2019. Propensity-score\nmatching (PSM) in BPD-DS with cholecystectomy (Group 1) and BPD-DS without cholecystectomy (Group 2) cohorts was\nperformed (PSM ratio 1:2). The two groups were matched for a total of 21 baseline variables including age, gender, BMI,\nASA class, and other medical comorbidities and conditions. The 30-day postoperative morbidity, mortality, reoperation,\nreintervention, and readmissions were obtained.\nResults Initially, 568 patients in Group 1 and 5079 in Group 2 were identified. After performing PSM, 564 and 1128 patients\nrespectively were compared. The BPD-DS with cholecystectomy group reported a higher rate of reoperation and reinter -\nvention compared to BPD-DS alone (3.9% versus 2.4% and 3.2% versus 2%, respectively), even though it did not reach\nstatistical significance. The intervention time was significantly higher in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (192.4± 77.6 versus\n126.4 ± 61.4 min). Clavien-Dindo complications (1–5) were similar between these two PSM cohorts.\nConclusion Concomitant cholecystectomy during BPD-DS increases operative times but does not affect the other outcomes.\nBased on our results, the decision of cholecystectomy at the time of BPD-DS should be left to the surgeon's judgment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62eb9f684097071dc17b6be1","5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","62eb9f684097071dc17b6be3","62eb9f684097071dc17b6be4","62eb9f684097071dc17b6be5","62eb9f684097071dc17b6be6","62eb9f684097071dc17b6be7","62eb9f684097071dc17b6be8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479891","mniswId":"19158","title":"Surgical Endoscopy","issn":"0930-2794","eissn":"1432-2218","documentHash":"5afa00d1-bd3c-43f0-9946-454eec1e7f3c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6267dd3940970720eb52772c","year":"2022","volume":"","number":"","doi":"10.1007/s00464-022-09220-y","documentHash":"6e8bc550-0557-4721-84b8-26cdd7851dc5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060638875"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659e51554097077f7b4e8937","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sroczyński","documentHash":"c1e6f74f-a29d-4458-9d69-12ae23fd84ee"},{"objectId":"659e51554097077f7b4e8936","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Golik","documentHash":"318a1f4a-a263-4a56-9ce8-e63865736c96"},{"objectId":"659e51554097077f7b4e8935","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Jędras","documentHash":"cd37302f-9e2e-41ff-b45e-0f54e692faa3"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","name":"Michał","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"2DC5281868BC78E9C26D21E0DC520F19540A18FD2EA58B5363B94947AC0955C9A0CB1A73FF4A40149185E818A0C2BEACBE59432EC2451BF788E3208C50BBAD4B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5524-5932","documentHash":"0ff7aaa5-ed88-4d00-b98b-8654d53cdadf"}],"objectId":"659e51554097077f7b4e8932","doi":"10.5114/wiitm.2023.134121","publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/doi_ft/10.5114/wiitm.2023.134121","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The influence of obesity on the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a retrospective analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide has raised concerns about its impact on surgical outcomes across various procedures. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC), a common surgical intervention for benign gallbladder disease, is no exception. The relationship between obesity and LC outcomes remains complex and merits further investigation.\n\nAim: This retrospective study aimed to assess the influence of obesity on the safety and surgical outcomes of LC.\n\nMaterial and methods: Patients were divided into 2 groups: those with obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m²) and non-obese controls (BMI < 30 kg/m²). Baseline characteristics, operative duration, hospitalization length, and post-operative complications, categorized by the Clavien-Dindo classification, were evaluated.\n\nResults: Among 116 patients with obesity and 176 non-obese controls, differences in age and gender were noted but were not clinically significant. Operative time was longer in the group with obesity. Hospitalization length and adverse event occurrence did not differ significantly. Importantly, post-operative complications showed no substantial differences between the groups, suggesting that obesity may not significantly increase the complication risk in this population.\n\nConclusions: Obesity may not substantially elevate the risk of adverse events or severe complications following LC in this patient population. Careful patient selection, preoperative evaluation, and surgical technique remain crucial. Further research in larger, diverse populations is needed to validate these findings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["659e51554097077f7b4e8937","5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","659e51554097077f7b4e8935","659e51554097077f7b4e8936"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","659e51554097077f7b4e8935","659e51554097077f7b4e8936","659e51554097077f7b4e8937"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a72","mniswId":"20126","title":"Videosurgery and Other Miniinvasive Techniques","issn":"1895-4588","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"6ac0bd40-48d6-408a-9118-c6928accf196"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659e51554097077f7b4e8933","year":"2023","documentHash":"ce5ef225-6097-48f4-817b-15b5e90a5dba"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["post-operative complications,","obesity,","laparoscopic cholecystectomy,","Clavien-Dindo classification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060638938"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"669a0e9dfdbe8343cdb9e422","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Różycki","documentHash":"eeb0275e-49f8-48f1-8f30-f99377f0099e"},{"objectId":"669a0e9dfdbe8343cdb9e421","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Romanowska-Próchnicka","documentHash":"36fafaeb-58a1-479c-aa0a-e0fafd55b729"},{"objectId":"669a0e9dfdbe8343cdb9e420","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rerych","documentHash":"7d8d191b-0c30-440c-9ec3-a29d2bcd7370"},{"objectId":"669a0e9dfdbe8343cdb9e41f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Paczwa","documentHash":"cbe4fc47-01d3-4b5b-99ba-3f18dd7be2b1"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d18","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Gołębiewska","uuid":"F2665AB5B2999FC02DF56FDF3784FB9010206206FF605C3B6759C258FC69B0D63B53C0C26D5CC54B227ED867F9E393FF3B6959EFC0DDEDB812CFA48A6C4874DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3013-4363","documentHash":"4f47e4eb-f533-4405-b749-296388f9de84"}],"objectId":"669a0e9dfdbe8343cdb9e41e","doi":"10.3390/life14050627","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/14/5/627/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Ocular Manifestation in Systemic Sclerosis—A Literature Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune connective tissue disease that affects more than 2 million people worldwide.

The underlying cause of this variability is unknown, suggesting the involvement of additional factors. The aim of our study was to describe the properties of mutated channels and investigate genetic causes for clinical syndromes’ variability in the family of five SCN1A gene p.Arg1596Cys mutation carriers. The analysis of additional genetic factors influencing SCN1A-associated phenotypes was conducted through exome sequencing (WES). To assess the impact of mutations, we used patch clamp analysis of mutated channels expressed in HEK cells and in vivo neural excitability studies (NESs). In cells expressing the mutant channel, sodium currents were reduced. NESs indicated increased excitability of peripheral motor neurons in mutation carriers. WES showed the absence of non-SCA1 pathogenic variants that could be causative of disease in the family. Variants of uncertain significance in three genes, as potential modifiers of the most severe phenotype, were identified. The p.Arg1596Cys substitution inhibits channel function, affecting steady-state inactivation kinetics. Its clinical manifestations involve not only epileptic symptoms but also increased excitability of peripheral motor fibers. The role of Nav1.1 in excitatory neurons cannot be ruled out as a significant factor of the clinical phenotype."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny

Standard, wearable devices for measuring physical activity can be removed by the patient. Therefore, there is concern about the reliability of the results obtained. This study compares selected physical activity measurements obtained with a wearable device to those obtained with an activity patch permanently attached to the patient’s forearm (for the duration of a single week only), providing continuous measurement.\n\nMethods: Physical activity was measured simultaneously with both devices in a group of 14 morbidly obese patients over a period of one week: one month before insertion of intragastric balloon (IGB) and one month after its removal. Selected measures (covered distance and energy expenditure during physical activity) were compared both cross-sectionally and in terms of changes over course of the IGB treatment.\n\nResults: The covered distance measurements obtained using both devices were correlated both before IGB placement and after IGB (r>0.606, p<0.024). Similarly, the increases in distance traveled measurements obtained with both devices were correlated (r=0.76, p=0.04). The obtained measurements of energy expenditure during physical activity correlated only after IGB removal (r=0.600, p=0.012).\n\nConclusion: The results confirm that in large cohorts, measurements of physical activity obtained with wearable devices are comparable to those obtained with activity patches. However, the possibility remains that in individual cases the measurement may differ due to patient non-compliance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709315878c28a0473a291c","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a6","66f3d6fbfdbe8326af95a1db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"11-20","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a6","66f3d6fbfdbe8326af95a1db","5e709315878c28a0473a291c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f3d5bbfdbe8326af957d09","year":"2023","volume":"29","number":"1","documentHash":"2c927cc2-fe4f-44cd-a3e2-6e02556e3d36"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["physical activity","wearable device","activity patch","obesity","intragastric balloon"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060881632"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Dziuda","uuid":"9FEFD234C4BCA4347083F86144629E8A34EDE89D406C69FEB221E8A7C1EC02B1A851D8AF241D5F91FA8BB1A9025D1AA085D757CC6D7F99A3A8EDE63ECEE42B82","orcidId":"0000-0003-1816-4604","documentHash":"6627d7c3-a4d8-4e95-92c5-b1b4874a828c"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":"C0A32190081AC4F30070F9ABD1DC8A19D56C31A0643074A3CE06E324618DF8100E040EDA9CB0742D261E60E4618202784774376B5D6371996DB8A739E71E4473","orcidId":"0000-0001-8347-0232","documentHash":"58246b4c-b642-4359-9013-6a685f2dc147"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5fa8","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Maculewicz","uuid":"A16E25B84D56979731364ABF505DACDF21EFA4C88BD2D2507ABA1F9D741E597B4E03995F22CCF98A0354454D17C6F9E8C32A373C7AA5B08177020F11888D9787","orcidId":"0000-0002-3122-3085","documentHash":"b6b49af3-9a33-4330-b050-06cf9a76dd40"},{"objectId":"5e709315878c28a0473a291c","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Gaździński","uuid":"2C5B4765262B25F21601B48BC758FF0CACA8B48946A8B8F9900E11EC221458CC94CEFB60EC27BCE0D3663809F56BBE8B6DB45B167C08FE5E644CDF679731F6A7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0740-8765","documentHash":"28947595-3a9d-43b1-bf8f-a88eafda337a"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e8c","name":"AGATA","lastName":"LEOŃSKA-DUNIEC","uuid":"C36888EBCAA5FF1616C3A5A55CDBD68B868B585F2896D2E174F9E96957517D153622449604512D4F1DF37A80FEBCDBA6DA15588F658A89728ABB687739D388AA","orcidId":"0000-0001-6787-3760","documentHash":"7d78e697-918e-4b9f-9396-3fe291130a0a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"656ee85040970720e1f63d5e","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.18.12.2023.04","publicUri":"http://pjambp.com/view/abstract/id/16356","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"WHICH IS THE MOST RELIABLE MARKER TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF COSMIC RADIATION EXPOSURE IN POLISH MILITARY PILOTS: A MINI REVIEW OF LITERATURE","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Military pilots, similar to civilian pilots and crew members, receive larger doses of ionizing radiation than the general population. Exposition to small doses of ionizing radiation at prolonged durations has been related to slightly higher incidence of certain cancers. However, fighter jet pilots from time to time flight their airplanes at even higher altitudes, thus exposing themselves to higher doses of more energetic radiation than their civilian counterparts. In this mini review we discuss the procedures involved in controlling the radiation exposure to military and civilian pilots, as well as air crews. Markers of radiation exposure are discussed. Based on available literature, it appears that the biological markers of radiation, i.e., markers related to the actual changes in tissues, account also for individual differences in anatomy and physiology, as well as individual differences in sensitivity and lifestyle, as jet engine emissions, electromagnetic fields from cockpit instruments, ultraviolet radiation, carcadian rhythm disruption, etc.\nThis mini review concludes that biological dosimetry methods, i.e., counting frequencies of chromosomal aberrations, appears to be most suitable to evaluate exposure to ionizing radiation in military pilots."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a","5e709315878c28a0473a291c","5e709344878c28a0473a5fa8","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

These suits, when properly adjusted, can be used in the rehabilitation of patients with neurological or orthopaedic deficits. The purpose of this publication is to show the most commonly adapted solutions based on HAP suits and space suits, as well as to demonstrate the process of adapting HAP (High Altitude Protection) suits of WUK 90 type (Type 90 High Altitude Pressure Suits) for therapy purposes. In rehabilitation applications, these suits are suitable for adaptation in therapy where the technical parameters of the devices allow to explore completely different therapeutic possibilities. Such devices, however, require adaptation to the needs of disabled people with orthopaedic injuries or mental disorders and specific conditions for rehabilitation, as was the case with the WUK suit, which after introducing technical modifications and adaptation solutions was given the name R-WUK (abbreviated from the Polish name “Rehabilitacyjny Wysokościowy Ubiór Kompensacyjny” (Rehabilitation High Altitude Pressure Suit)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"42-48","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d5a315fdbe8351d9246e66","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d59fe6fdbe8351d9245162","year":"2020","volume":"26","number":"1","documentHash":"54ad499d-1da4-4569-9d1f-30d78e26f56c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["WUK suit","R-WUK suit","ATLANT suit","ADELI suit","suit therapy","HAP suit"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060881687"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b808f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"CB5563DBAD99E3EAB2D1F21B481ADC62403071362BAD1B6AFF0337B29C9BF1AECB037166FEBF5F3DE08624BB74444B15D1DF35A0517D66D208A619B7E2997EAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8722-0692","documentHash":"d2d631aa-bf06-4b4b-9449-bbd72d1834fb"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Dereń","uuid":"8E4E129503EF74F1405EF82DEB16CE116DD41EA4FF2678A7971D949D50A7A44DAED8D6F15057E7B6D6A2DEF62672678D297A72E06ACA330861DC1339C3EB237E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4013-1895","documentHash":"9b00cfe4-872d-4ad9-80af-45419fe066eb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"66d59fe6fdbe8351d9245161","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.27.03.2023.03","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.27.03.2023.03","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"TOWARDS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM: REVIEW OF AVAILABLE SOLUTIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS FOR BUILDING A FUNCTIONALLY OPTIMAL SYSTEM","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: The article reviews the technical solutions of devices that enable the patient to monitor selected medical parameters in time.

At a later stage of their development, they were supplemented with a system to prevent the negative effects of gravitational acceleration. A new and very different application of HAP suits is their use in the kinesitherapy process for patients with neurological deficits. However, due to the possibility of cardiovascular overload and a potentially dangerous increase in blood pressure, studies have been conducted to observe the occurrence of increased blood pressure. The study was conducted on a group of 39 patients with various neurological deficits during a fiveoccupation therapy session. Previously published results obtained for 17 healthy subjects (control group) were used for comparison [2]. The WUK 90 version of the HAP suit was used during the therapy.

It enables better visualization of the surgical site, improves depth perception and facilitates tissue identification. All 3D endoscopy capabilities are still under review.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare analogous endoscopic surgeries performed with 3D technique and those performed with traditional 2D technique based on the analysis of length of surgery, blood loss, occurrence of intraoperative complications and hospital stay time.\n\nMaterial: The material included 346 patients who underwent endoscopic paranasal sinus surgery with unilateral or bilateral sinus opening. In case of 152 patients, corrective surgery of the nasal septum was additionally performed. The patients were divided into two groups (2D group and 3D group) comprising 173 patients each, who underwent paranasal sinus opening using 2D and 3D endoscopic visualization. Each group was divided into four subgroups: the first were patients after bilateral paranasal sinus surgery (PSS), the second were patients after bilateral endoscopic paranasal sinus surgery and nasal septal correction surgery (PSS+NS), the third were patients after unilateral paranasal sinus surgery (UPSS), and the fourth group was patients after unilateral endoscopic paranasal sinus surgery and nasal septum correction surgery (UPSS+NS).\n\nMethods: The surgery was carried out using a TipCam 3D endoscope from Storz (Germany), 18 mm in length, 4 mm in diameter, with 30° optics, with an integrated camera capable of transmitting 3D images, as well as classic 2D endoscopes, 16 mm in length, 4 mm in diameter and 30° optics, along with a video track and instrument set.\nPatients underwent unilateral or bilateral endoscopic surgery with opening of the maxillary sinuses, frontal sinuses, anterior and posterior ethmoid as well as corrective surgery of the nasal septum.\nPatients underwent unilateral or bilateral endoscopic surgery with opening of the maxillary sinuses, frontal sinuses, anterior and posterior ethmoid as well as corrective surgery of the nasal septum.\n\nResults: The length of surgery were as follows in the 2D group: 2D/PSS+NS group — 107 min. (±22); 2D/PSS group — 95 min (±24); 2D/UPSS+NS group — 68 min (±21); 2D/UPSS group — 53 min (±14);\nThe length of surgery in the 3D group: 3D/PSS+NS group — 91 min. (±17); 3D/PSS group — 83 min (±20); 3D/UPSS+NS group — 69 min (±15); 2D/UPSS group — 49 min (±10);\nAmong the complications were early and late postoperative bleeding, eyelid or orbital hematomas, and eyelid edema. There were 17 complications in the 2D group (9.82%), and 7 complications in the 3D group (4.05%).\n\nConclusions: It was found that 3D endoscopic surgeries significantly reduced the length of surgery, especially in serious bilateral paranasal sinus surgeries. and influenced a decrease in perioperative complications.\n3D endoscopic surgeries had no significant effect on the amount of blood loss and the length of the patient’s stay at the Clinic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9c","5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"11-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d5a77cfdbe8351d9247c9e","year":"2020","volume":"26","number":"2","documentHash":"5f5b55c9-a6aa-4c04-9129-4c1861293c4d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["intraoperative 3D spatial imaging","endoscopic paranasal sinus surgery","chronic rhinosinusitis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060926627"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af710","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"33581742CA14A3609216D8FDDA88C64836165861D5679EC635C5F7E8953CE3C664BCBA2085F7C302CD9FB4A5115A3CCE7389EF1174BA29CF5C9AC92B8E6FD38B","orcidId":"0000-0003-2143-9883","documentHash":"aaf7a92b-beee-4f4d-9922-3117b9e76e3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"66d5b21cfdbe8351d924da05","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.30.03.2023.04","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.30.03.2023.04","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"PREDICTIVE VALIDITY OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF ADOLESCENTS PLANNING TO START AVIATION TRAINING.

Many people decide to take the aviation career at an early age, so the question arises whether the psychological features visible in developmental age can be a basis for predicting success in adulthood.\n\nMethods: The analysis took into account the results of psychological tests of 97 people (15-16 years old) who were enrolled in the Aviation High School, then after graduation again tested as candidates for aviation studies. Measurements of the stability of the psychological variables were calculated, as well as the factor structure of the results. Then, the predictive value of factors distinguished in this analysis was determined.\n\nResults: Despite the visible developmental changes in cognitive functions (higher results in the second assessment), most of the indicators are characterized by a satisfactory stability. In the structure of the results, six relatively independent factors were distinguished, one of which, defined as general intellectual ability, turned out to be the best predictor of a positive qualification in later assessment.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: The obtained results allow us to conclude that the psychological tests and indicators used in the study of adolescents seem to be adequate and guarantee high stability of measurements, even over a period of several years. As predicted, the greatest predictive power has the general intellectual ability, which is the basic property\nthat allows the acquisition and consolidation of other skills."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af710"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"25-33","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af710"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d5a77cfdbe8351d9247c9e","year":"2020","volume":"26","number":"2","documentHash":"5f5b55c9-a6aa-4c04-9129-4c1861293c4d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cognitive performance","developmental changes","factor analysis","measurement stability","psychomotor performance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060926689"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a57","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Francuz","documentHash":"1ed695bb-4d92-442a-99f7-381b9e8e049d"},{"objectId":"674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a56","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Augustynowicz","documentHash":"013b2100-4418-409e-80c2-78f797ed8bc3"},{"objectId":"674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a55","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Stróżak","documentHash":"e823216a-13b9-44a1-93da-2d3055c197a8"},{"objectId":"674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a54","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Fudali-Czyż","documentHash":"fbd6787f-27ae-431c-b248-cd68dc2e1945"},{"objectId":"674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a53","name":"Bibianna","lastName":"Bałaj","documentHash":"cd7bb291-3b5e-40a2-bb00-14d45554eb6a"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Lewkowicz","uuid":"BF6D249A381A0391439E308824924A8ABB75132BA2EB9A3C3E64407CED94E95127441BA92A3FD2E9B4FDD85F05549D8368FC546DF560AAFF0FFD9F1568488BB8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3691-6558","documentHash":"51f0522a-472a-43d8-beeb-5096e983e846"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a51","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.22.04.2024.01","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.22.04.2024.01","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"HOW DOES MENTAL DISTRACTION INDUCED BY AN ADDITIONAL TASK AFFECT THE SEVERITY OF SIMULATOR SICKNESS SYMPTOMS IN PILOTS: A SPATIAL DISORIENTATION SIMULATOR STUDY","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: To improve the effectiveness of spatial disorientation (SD) training in a flight simulator, pilots are recommended to perform an additional task that induces a mental distraction. The presented study explored how the inclusion of an additional task that may enhance the effectiveness of SD training changes the severity of simulator sickness symptoms reported after exposure in the Gyro-IPT simulator.\n\nMethods: We compared the incidence of simulator sickness symptoms in pilots across four setups of flight scenarios (varying according to cognitive load distraction) collected during our previous studies. A total of 77 male military pilots (age 28.3±6.2) with flight experience (810.72 ±969.43 hours) were randomly assigned to one of four groups and then exposed to a 60-min long flight session (12 flight profiles, six involved an SD-conflict) with active control in the Gyro IPT simulator. In addition to the primary flying task, in three flight scenarios, pilots were asked to perform an additional visual (a change detection flicker task [CDFT]), auditory (an auditory N-back task [NBT]), or duration-discrimination task (DDT)). To measure simulator sickness symptoms, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was administered pre- and post-simulator exposure.\n\nResults: The severity of simulator sickness symptoms due to visual and motion cues did not significantly change when the pilot performed a non-sickening cognitive task (additional visual or auditory task). The total SSQ score and scores for nausea, oculomotor disturbance, and disorientation in the CDFT and DDT were slightly higher than in the control condition (flight without additional task). Despite the observed differences, according to the SSQ scoring criteria, the simulator sickness symptoms reported by the pilots were negligible.\n\nConclusions: The additional tasks (CDFT, auditory NBT, or DDT) applied to improve the effectiveness of SD training in the Gyro-IPT simulator do not significantly change unwanted effects, such as simulator sickness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"5-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a53","674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a54","674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a55","674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a56","674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a57"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2543-7186","eissn":"2451-3512","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com","documentHash":"a472e9f6-35e6-4ad4-a99e-7e7334967a34"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674ecf4dfdbe832d4f424a52","year":"2021","volume":"27","number":"2","documentHash":"3c443d44-0dec-4102-8c7e-69b8a427f8f5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["simulator sickness","motion sickness","flight simulator","spatial disorientation","expertise","cognitive load"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060926785"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46ac","name":"Marian","lastName":"Macander","uuid":"D0C49A0E7D7E99B8C24214B47D8263B612942E53236087FC963FF13975FFF6971F1F488BF04DE11B69B154DF3FD5445CA3BEF46E2D056CEDF309327FE8B054E7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0073-1324","documentHash":"e8dce236-81b3-4bd8-b92c-171061e5c86e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"67da9247fdbe836aa6441734","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.28.02.2024.02","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.28.02.2024.02","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"REASONS FOR FAILED EJECTIONS IN THE POLISH AIR FORCE IN THE YEARS 1951-2021","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The primary task of an ejection seat is to help the pilot safely exit an inoperable aircraft. The factor that ejects the seat from the aircraft cockpit is a powder charge or rocket engine. Injuries sustained by the crew during catapulting depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, the sequence of ejection times and the speed of the decision. Most modern military jets are equipped with rocket ejection systems. The TS-11 “ISKRA” aircraft, equipped with a powder charge ejection seat, was in use by the Polish Air Force until 2022. The present study was undertaken by the author to analyze the causes of failed ejections in the Polish Air Force between 1951 and 2021.\n\nMethods: The author created a medical form based on a serious airplane accident. He analyzed all the ejections, studying the minutes of the commissions investigating aviation accidents between 1951 and 2021. The data received were entered into a form and then statistically analyzed. The author set out to determine the relationship between the characteristics of the ejection process and the types of injuries sustained by ejecting pilots. The results were analyzed for various injuries with a special focus on fatal injury cases.\n\nResults: Analysis included approval of 281 completed forms from severe aviation accidents between 1951 and 2021. The rate of failed ejections was 25.27% of the total. It ranks among the highest in military aviation compared to other such studies. The most important factor hindering safe ejecting was deciding to leave the aircraft cockpit too late.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion: The ejection seat has saved the lives of thousands of aircrews since its introduction in the 1940s. Using it is generally a safe life-saving measure. However, a number of factors may cause potential damage during ejection. These include the rapidity of the pilot's decisions, the task at hand, the aircraft's position, flight altitude or weather conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46ac"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"7-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46ac"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2543-7186","eissn":"2451-3512","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com","documentHash":"a472e9f6-35e6-4ad4-a99e-7e7334967a34"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67da9272fdbe836aa64423e1","year":"2021","volume":"27","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"77717adb-58c2-476d-9ff9-1b41dbe3868c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ejecting","military pilot","fatal injuries","late decisions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060926843"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61b80fb87523402a58cb870f","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Krej","uuid":"3472418FCAD967D10255F8C74159E8EB77BEF3657F94A2E6343A5B6BAE0AAB7D336C5AE13A4EE41C45E2F807A9F5D45E1CEE4BF8CD02F6CE6969C80B4BC6A928","orcidId":"0000-0001-6535-078X","documentHash":"9fc18266-c06a-4787-8078-b7efe2e43339"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Baran","uuid":"DE5109AC31FEAD2D4357F905BBFB2BD9EF45B6B0D2C67EC84D748D3C6C51422BF715AD923918E9DFED3BE616640AF742C25045F13190E0E5D30C560DF323F8A6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9233-1293","documentHash":"630f66b2-eb31-43c6-afc4-c10eac142c0a"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Lewkowicz","uuid":"BF6D249A381A0391439E308824924A8ABB75132BA2EB9A3C3E64407CED94E95127441BA92A3FD2E9B4FDD85F05549D8368FC546DF560AAFF0FFD9F1568488BB8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3691-6558","documentHash":"51f0522a-472a-43d8-beeb-5096e983e846"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Dziuda","uuid":"9FEFD234C4BCA4347083F86144629E8A34EDE89D406C69FEB221E8A7C1EC02B1A851D8AF241D5F91FA8BB1A9025D1AA085D757CC6D7F99A3A8EDE63ECEE42B82","orcidId":"0000-0003-1816-4604","documentHash":"6627d7c3-a4d8-4e95-92c5-b1b4874a828c"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Dereń","uuid":"8E4E129503EF74F1405EF82DEB16CE116DD41EA4FF2678A7971D949D50A7A44DAED8D6F15057E7B6D6A2DEF62672678D297A72E06ACA330861DC1339C3EB237E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4013-1895","documentHash":"9b00cfe4-872d-4ad9-80af-45419fe066eb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"668d362efdbe8309305c7221","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.18.12.2023.05","publicUri":"http://pjambp.com/view/abstract/id/16790","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"REVIEW OF LOWER BODY NEGATIVE PRESSURE APPLICATIONS TO SIMULATE +GZ-INDUCED CARDIOVASCULAR STRAIN: RESEARCH HISTORY","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: In the paper, a general overview of the development and applications of l ower body negative pressure ( LBNP) technology have been provided. The article also descr ibes the LBNP designs used to investigate the relationship between tolerance to negative pressure around the lower body and tolerance to acceleration (+Gz).\n\nMethods: A systematic review of the literature on the development and application of LBNP in the sc ope not limited to the time or geography framework was explored. Searches were performed using predefined keywords and filters for LBNP (e.g., aerospace, medicine, cardiovascular, space, acceleration, Gz ). Databases such as PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDire ct, and others relevant to this field of study were selected for the search.\n\nResults: The results of the review were organized by thematic categories (LBNP development, applications and use to s imulate +Gz induced cardiovascular strain ). Syntheses of the r esults are presented, highlighting key themes and insights.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion: T he use of LBNP to simulate cardiovascular strain, typically induced by positive G forces (+Gz) in fighter jet flight, has played an important role in our understanding of the cardiovascular response to gravitational forces. This knowledge not only benefits pilots, but also has wider implications for healthcare and working conditions where individuals may face similar physiological challenges. Although numerous reports su pport the development of LBNP for space mission applications, there is no evidence for the use of LBNP to simulate accelerations greater than +1 Gz over the past two decades. However, further research in this area is still warranted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61b80fb87523402a58cb870f","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"35-45","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","61b80fb87523402a58cb870f","5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eba5c","mniswId":"201376","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","documentHash":"85575dc9-b308-4a22-9d81-821e52cc880e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f3d912fdbe8326af95c75d","year":"2023","volume":"29","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"a1283347-8406-4fed-b238-c4de3918fc95"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aviation medicine","LBNP","negative pressure","acceleration stress"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060926861"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66eaa1bcfdbe836650aea409","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Zgnilec","documentHash":"a665f274-d375-40eb-9760-98eb25fd9618"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wojdas","uuid":"85AD14C85112C26BC9B7759EF839D84DFC87BF76F58A5C732BCBC6CFBB8896C38059AEAB94D363740965D62BDE9203E8905B3F85DBE8EEBC0716A09CA7FDA800","documentHash":"b67b0524-f36a-4db4-abc7-4967b47dd7d5"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9c","name":"Roman","lastName":"Stablewski","uuid":"9BB3751EFD57768D2E4B4E5F7E05BD33402F646478609D04B31E1F12D1811B60A92767BCE58140C3298638FCAA28A6DDFD53622ED86DB6C365D66CAF7274EF2D","documentHash":"1a964faa-3d05-4c97-bb1e-0dae18e60a09"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"66eaa1bcfdbe836650aea407","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.24.04.2023.01","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.24.04.2023.01","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"INFLUENCE OF PLASTIC SURGERY OF THE INFERIOR TURBINATE ON THE PATENCY OF THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Chronic hypertrophic rhinitis is one of the most common diseases in rhinology. Various surgical techniques are used to reduce hypertrophic changes in the inferior turbinates. The aim of our study is to determine the impact of plastic surgery of the lower nasal turbinates, performed by cryoablation or radiocoblation, on the patency of the Eustachian tube and to determine how long the waiting period should be for activities that particularly require patent ear tubes, such as traveling by plane.\n\nMaterial: A total of 70 patients treated at the Department of Otolaryngology of the Military Institute of Aviation Medicine were qualified for the study. Due to the technique of conchoplasty of the lower nasal turbinates, the patients were divided into two groups. Group I consisted of 35 patients, including 15 women and 20 men, aged 24 to 62 (mean 42.67 years), operated on by cryoablation. Group II also comprised 35 patients, including 12 women and 23 men, aged 29 to 69 (mean 44.21 years), operated on by radiocoblation.\n\nMethods: Plastic surgeries of the lower nasal turbinates, also known as conchoplasties, were performed under local anesthesia with a cryosurgery machine with the use of a nasal applicator and an apparatus for submucosal coblation with the use of radio waves. The patency of the Eustachian tube was assessed by tympanometry before the operation and 1, 2 and 3 weeks after the operation.\n\nResults: No statistically significant (p < 0.001) disturbances of the patency of the Eustachian tubes were observed after conchoplastic surgeries, using both the cryoablation and radiocoablation methods.\n\nConclusions: Conchoplasties of the lower nasal turbinates performed by cryo- and radiocoblation do not impair the patency of the Eustachian tubes.

Nutritional status was assessed by anthropometric and body composition measurements.\n\nResults: Overweight was diagnosed in 47.6% and obesity in 11,9% members. Abdominal obesity was diagnosed in 38.6% of men and 23.1% of women. In women, the mean HGS of the right and the left hand, respectively, was 33.08 ± 3.57kg and 33.69 ± 2.95kg. For men, mean HGS of right and left hand were 55.79 ± 7.62kg and 54.63 ± 7.93kg, respectively. Furthermore, for men HGS was positively correlated with skeletal muscle mass (r = 0.39), lower limb length (r = 0.33) and chest circumference measured on inspiration (r = 0.33), but not on expiration. There was no significant correlation between HGS, age, and BMI.\n\nConclusions: Our study adds to the body of evidence demonstrating an alarmingly high proportion of soldiers with diagnosed obesity. Military medical flight personnel had higher mean handgrip strength as compared to reference values in the male group and in the female group in the left hand. Handgrip strength appears to be related to skeletal muscle mass, similarly to other studies in the general population."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709315878c28a0473a291c","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a6","66eaab1afdbe836650afc841"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"5-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a6","66eaab1afdbe836650afc840","66eaab1afdbe836650afc841","66eaab1afdbe836650afc842","5e709315878c28a0473a291c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eaab1afdbe836650afc83f","year":"2020","volume":"26","number":"4","documentHash":"21860cb7-362d-45c3-8753-291344d10154"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["obesity","overweight","nutritional status","fat mass index","handgrip strength","military flying medical personnel"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060927072"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"670f5952fdbe8317edcca475","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Dereń-Szumełda","documentHash":"3a534f3a-c471-48d0-9be5-30aeacaa7488"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b808f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"CB5563DBAD99E3EAB2D1F21B481ADC62403071362BAD1B6AFF0337B29C9BF1AECB037166FEBF5F3DE08624BB74444B15D1DF35A0517D66D208A619B7E2997EAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8722-0692","documentHash":"d2d631aa-bf06-4b4b-9449-bbd72d1834fb"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Dziuda","uuid":"9FEFD234C4BCA4347083F86144629E8A34EDE89D406C69FEB221E8A7C1EC02B1A851D8AF241D5F91FA8BB1A9025D1AA085D757CC6D7F99A3A8EDE63ECEE42B82","orcidId":"0000-0003-1816-4604","documentHash":"6627d7c3-a4d8-4e95-92c5-b1b4874a828c"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Dereń","uuid":"8E4E129503EF74F1405EF82DEB16CE116DD41EA4FF2678A7971D949D50A7A44DAED8D6F15057E7B6D6A2DEF62672678D297A72E06ACA330861DC1339C3EB237E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4013-1895","documentHash":"9b00cfe4-872d-4ad9-80af-45419fe066eb"}],"objectId":"670f5952fdbe8317edcca474","publicUri":"https://repo.bg.wat.edu.pl/info/book/WATb4d19220a4b948598336e60237e3db38/","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"WYMAGANIA PRAWNE PROCESU CERTYFIKACJI WYROBU MEDYCZNEGO PN. \"SYSTEM SYMULBNP\"","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","5e709433878c28a0473b808f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"25-36","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","5e709433878c28a0473b808f","670f5952fdbe8317edcca475","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66f0fe82fdbe8327370f653e","title":"Problematyka normalizacji, jakości i kodyfikacji w aspekcie integracji z NATO i UE.

In this study, however, we did not investigate how the severity of symptoms differs between pilots and non-pilots. Therefore, the presented study aimed to examine whether the symptoms of simulator sickness induced in pilots and non-pilots during spatial disorientation (SD) training are significantly different. We were particularly interested in whether the standard flight scenario used in SD training could be a contributing factor in increasing simulator sickness in novice, inexperienced pilots.\nMethod: We used the data from the previous study, where twenty male military pilots (age 31.6 ±8.22) with flight experience (total flight hours 1300 ±1167.4) and 20 non-pilots (age 30.9 ±7.72) were assigned to one of two groups and then exposed to a 1-hour long flight session (12 flight profiles, six involved an SD-conflict) with active control in the Gyro IPT simulator. To measure simulator sickness symptoms, the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) was administered pre and post-simulator exposure. In the presented study, the SSQ scores were analyzed independently for the total SSQ and subscores for nausea, oculomotor, and disorientation, and then were compared between groups.\nResults: The score of the total severity and for each subscale of SSQ symptoms in the non-pilots‘ group were higher than those in the pilots group, however, these differences were not significant. Despite the observed differences, according to the SSQ scoring criteria the simulator sickness symptoms reported by the participants after exposure to the applied flight scenario were negligible.\nConclusion: The flight scenarios used in SD training did not generate significantly different symptoms of simulator sickness between non-pilots and pilots. The low level of severity of simulator sickness symptoms in these two study groups may indicate difficulty in predicting simulator sickness based on SSQ only."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"13-25","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","66eaac9efdbe836650afcf47","66eaac9efdbe836650afcf48"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eaab1afdbe836650afc83f","year":"2020","volume":"26","number":"4","documentHash":"21860cb7-362d-45c3-8753-291344d10154"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["simulator sickness","motion sickness","flight simulator","spatial disorientation","expertise"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060927129"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67da945cfdbe836aa6445d77","name":"Anna","lastName":"Czerwińska","documentHash":"d2133993-8619-41b7-b254-f6d7d15155e8"},{"objectId":"67da945cfdbe836aa6445d76","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Łaszczyńska","documentHash":"08b7961a-8633-4a73-8def-479f67a9fcba"},{"objectId":"67da945cfdbe836aa6445d75","name":"Anna","lastName":"Przewodzka","documentHash":"5cb5471c-1481-495d-99fd-5857e98a2936"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Lewkowicz","uuid":"BF6D249A381A0391439E308824924A8ABB75132BA2EB9A3C3E64407CED94E95127441BA92A3FD2E9B4FDD85F05549D8368FC546DF560AAFF0FFD9F1568488BB8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3691-6558","documentHash":"51f0522a-472a-43d8-beeb-5096e983e846"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Biernacki","uuid":"0BB4DA4BBAC66385A263453765956DD53EF2596A6817DD55D280BB75512AFE118FEC6185785BC5E76AF55F1C63C339EA849E0616285D5E19650E18E44AD33329","orcidId":"0000-0002-1650-0013","documentHash":"642946bd-d527-4249-b8db-9ddaac00e65d"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":"C0A32190081AC4F30070F9ABD1DC8A19D56C31A0643074A3CE06E324618DF8100E040EDA9CB0742D261E60E4618202784774376B5D6371996DB8A739E71E4473","orcidId":"0000-0001-8347-0232","documentHash":"58246b4c-b642-4359-9013-6a685f2dc147"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"67da945cfdbe836aa6445d73","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.17.12.2024.01","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.17.12.2024.01","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"HOW DO MODAFINIL AND GALANTAMINE AFFECT HEART RATE DURING +GZ STRESS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Fatigue remains a significant challenge in the field of aviation safety. This is particularly the case in military aviation, where aircrews are expected to perform complex and cognitively demanding tasks, often with unpredictable working hours, insufficient sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of a single dose of modafinil on the physiological response (based on heart rate) to variable acceleration up to +3Gz during a limited period of sleep deprivation, compared with that of placebo and a single dose of galantamine.\n\nMethods: To determine the effect of stimulant use, 12 male volunteers with a mean age of 24 ± 2.5 years were tested under three night-time conditions, after an average of 27 hours of sleep deprivation. Participants received placebo, galantamine 10 mg, and modafinil 100 mg, and were tested in a human centrifuge during a daytime control session. Heart rate, blood pressure, core body temperature, and body hydration were measured in participants during the experiment.\n\nResults: As we expected, both galantamine and modafinil counteracted the effects of fatigue on the physiological response to variable acceleration up to +3Gz compared to placebo, with the beneficial effect of galantamine being greater than that of modafinil. A single administration of galantamine (10 mg) to participants after 27 hours of wakefulness resulted in a statistically significant reduction in heart rate relative to both placebo and modafinil.\n\nConclusions: None of the drugs tested (modafinil or galantamine) at a single dose had a negative effect on the physiological response to variable acceleration reaching +3Gz. Therefore, if there are no contraindications to their use, they may be useful in combating the symptoms of fatigue in flight attendants exposed to overload during prolonged flights."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67da945cfdbe836aa6445d75","67da945cfdbe836aa6445d76","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a","67da945cfdbe836aa6445d77","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"5-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67da945cfdbe836aa6445d75","67da945cfdbe836aa6445d76","67da945cfdbe836aa6445d77","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2543-7186","eissn":"2451-3512","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com","documentHash":"a472e9f6-35e6-4ad4-a99e-7e7334967a34"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67da949ffdbe836aa64467f6","year":"2021","volume":"27","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"1551fa49-1df7-48a4-8fe9-55fd66c98f26"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["acceleration","G-forces","stimulant","sleep deprivation","Go pills"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060927140"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67da9d46fdbe836aa645f8b2","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Różycki","documentHash":"3b4b78a1-fa67-4c79-a3f2-9762286a70b6"},{"objectId":"642645aa40e3ff13873b5b80","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Szabelska","uuid":"3CC4C71342877FBF83DA781052219E64A448911BEC2C7B4C31A0039E5A3508936F7900E9DD6588853CD0790AF78E165A22F597A70B5A49A96FBA8D55BC735F19","documentHash":"003c364f-bafd-4f08-b02e-9d279cf62b6a"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6d18","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Gołębiewska","uuid":"F2665AB5B2999FC02DF56FDF3784FB9010206206FF605C3B6759C258FC69B0D63B53C0C26D5CC54B227ED867F9E393FF3B6959EFC0DDEDB812CFA48A6C4874DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3013-4363","documentHash":"4f47e4eb-f533-4405-b749-296388f9de84"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"67da9d46fdbe836aa645f8b0","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.22.04.2024.05","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.22.04.2024.05","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"DIAGNOSTICS OF OPTIC DISC DRUSEN – MULTIMODAL IMAGING POSSIBILITIES","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: Optic nerve drusen (OND) are calcified deposits in the optic nerve head.

The data obtained included age, sex, date of surgery, results of preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and postoperative histopathological examination.\n\nResults: The medical histories of 146 patients were analyzed—77 women and 69 men with an average age of 53.7 years. In the histopathological examination results, 137 tumors were benign, and 9 cases were malignant. The most frequently diagnosed benign tumors of the parotid gland were pleomorphic adenoma and Warthin's tumor. The most prevalent malignant tumors were mucoepidermoid carcinoma, acinic cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Tumor recurrences were observed in three patients. The concordance between the results of preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy and histopathological examination was 83.5%. The sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing tumors were 66.7% and 93.4%, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Performing cytological and imaging studies is essential for properly planning the scope of the surgery.

A PILOT STUDY","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background and Study objective: Continuous perioperative monitoring of blood oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry is an established standard of care. The incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in orthopedic patients is higher when compared to any other group of hospitalized patients. Although its etiology remains unclear, factors such as thromboembolic complications may play a role. Thromboembolic material, including that released from the surgery site, enters the bloodstream and then travels to the brain. The decrease in blood flow in the involved cerebral vessels may decrease cerebral oxygen saturation. Considering this, we decided to determine if the regional cerebral saturation monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy corresponds with readings of blood oxygen saturation monitored by pulse oximetry in patients who underwent primary total hip arthroplasty.\n\nMethods: A total of 20 patients scheduled for elective total hip arthroplasty were enrolled in the study. All orthopedic procedures were performed under spinal anesthesia and intravenous sedation. Monitoring of regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was carried out from the time of the initiation of spinal anesthesia until the end of the surgery, using the near-infrared spectroscopy method. In all, 15 patients were analyzed.\n\nResults and Conclusions: We found the following: (1) rSO2 values decreased continuously over the surgery, and (2) rSO2 value changes were not related to mean arterial pressure variations or to hemoglobin saturation as analyzed by pulse oximetry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c1878c28a0473c3328"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"5-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c1878c28a0473c3328","66d5a77cfdbe8351d9247c9f","66d5a77cfdbe8351d9247ca0","66d5a77cfdbe8351d9247ca1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d5a77cfdbe8351d9247c9e","year":"2020","volume":"26","number":"2","documentHash":"5f5b55c9-a6aa-4c04-9129-4c1861293c4d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["blood pulse oximetry","regional cerebral oxygen saturation","primary hip arthroplasty"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060984401"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Baran","uuid":"DE5109AC31FEAD2D4357F905BBFB2BD9EF45B6B0D2C67EC84D748D3C6C51422BF715AD923918E9DFED3BE616640AF742C25045F13190E0E5D30C560DF323F8A6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9233-1293","documentHash":"630f66b2-eb31-43c6-afc4-c10eac142c0a"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b808f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"CB5563DBAD99E3EAB2D1F21B481ADC62403071362BAD1B6AFF0337B29C9BF1AECB037166FEBF5F3DE08624BB74444B15D1DF35A0517D66D208A619B7E2997EAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8722-0692","documentHash":"d2d631aa-bf06-4b4b-9449-bbd72d1834fb"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Dziuda","uuid":"9FEFD234C4BCA4347083F86144629E8A34EDE89D406C69FEB221E8A7C1EC02B1A851D8AF241D5F91FA8BB1A9025D1AA085D757CC6D7F99A3A8EDE63ECEE42B82","orcidId":"0000-0003-1816-4604","documentHash":"6627d7c3-a4d8-4e95-92c5-b1b4874a828c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2025},"objectId":"6800bc48fdbe830a5fbe62f3","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.28.03.2025.03","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.28.03.2025.03","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"AUTOMOTIVE INTERIOR MONITORING SYSTEMS: A REVIEW OF SELECTED TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE RECOGNITION OF FATIGUE SYMPTOMS IN MOTOR VEHICLE DRIVERS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Road traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of health loss, disability, and premature death for thousands of people worldwide.

In addition to the symptoms of simulator sickness expressed at the level of subjective indicators, it is also important to consider physiological indicators. The present study was designed to test whether the use of a fixed-base vs. fullmotion simulator influences the severity of simulator sickness symptoms and changes in the level of oculomotor variables.\n\nMethods: Twelve male subjects with age M=29.8, SD=4.26 participated in this study. Each subject performed two 30-minute simulator tasks following the same route. Each of these tasks was performed in different configuration of a truck simulator manufactured by ETCPZL Aerospace Industries: Condition 1 – fixed-base simulator, Condition 2 – full-motion simulator. Eye movements were recorded during the simulator task. Additionally, the SSQ questionnaire was filled out immediately after the simulator task and 1 h after leaving the simulator.\n\nResults: The results show a higher level of most symptoms of simulator sickness under 2nd condition (full-motion simulator). In the case of measurement immediately after completing the task on the simulator, there was an increase in oculomotor problems. On the other hand, the measurement after 1 h also revealed a significant increase in nausea, oculomotor and disorientation. Moreover, after 1 hour, a relationship between nausea symptoms and oculomotor indices was found.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: Results indicate the influence of simulator testing conditions on the occurrence of simulator sickness symptoms. In addition, the relationship between variables measured by the oculograph and subjective symptoms of simulator sickness was demonstrated. The results obtained indicate changes in the sensitivity of physiological indicators and are discussed in the context of the possibility of using simulators in the diagnosis and training of selected functions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"12-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b4647"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eaa1bcfdbe836650aea408","year":"2020","volume":"26","number":"3","documentHash":"5f91c063-ff41-4d20-a0f4-e82340cf7100"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["physiological variables","simulators","simulator sickness"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060984659"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wojdas","uuid":"85AD14C85112C26BC9B7759EF839D84DFC87BF76F58A5C732BCBC6CFBB8896C38059AEAB94D363740965D62BDE9203E8905B3F85DBE8EEBC0716A09CA7FDA800","documentHash":"b67b0524-f36a-4db4-abc7-4967b47dd7d5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"66eaafabfdbe836650afdfb0","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.17.05.2023.04","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.17.05.2023.04","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"EFFECT OF INFLAMMATORY FACTORS IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: Both immune mechanisms, involved in inflammatory processes induced by viral and bacterial pathogens or allergy-inducing agents, and non-immune mechanisms play a direct role in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).\nContrary to popular belief, bacterial infection plays a much smaller role. As a rule, this is a secondary process – following the development of inflammatory processes in the mucosa of the paranasal sinuses, its defense mechanisms are disrupted, which promotes the development of infection. Bacterial infection of the paranasal sinuses is associated with the formation of a biofilm responsible for the persistence of rhinosinusitis, or bacterial endotoxins acting as superantigens cause the persistence of the inflammatory process.\nThe main role in the inflammatory process is played by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, as the centers regulating cytotoxic and humoral immune responses. They act in various ways, mainly cytotoxic, and as such can interact with virtually all nucleated host cells showing expression of antigens of endogenous origin and through cytokines, mainly pro-inflammatory cytokines, and they increase migration of inflammatory cells into the mucosa of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The paper discusses in detail the interaction of immunocompetent cells and their impact on chronic inflammatory processes in the mucosa of paranasal sinuses.\nAtopy is another factor contributing to the CRS, increasing the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting processes that lead to obstruction of the ostiomeatal complex.\nThe complexity of the clinical picture of the CRS in relation to ongoing research on pathogenesis indicates that it is still not possible to strictly define the phenotypes of the disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"37-44","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2451-3512","eissn":"2543-7186","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com/","documentHash":"f2b5da4a-c1e3-4d23-b700-9984504c1547"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eaab1afdbe836650afc83f","year":"2020","volume":"26","number":"4","documentHash":"21860cb7-362d-45c3-8753-291344d10154"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chronic rhinosinusitis","pathogenesis","CD4+ T lymphocytes","CD8+ T lymphocyte","cytokines","biofilm","atopy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060984693"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Lewkowicz","uuid":"BF6D249A381A0391439E308824924A8ABB75132BA2EB9A3C3E64407CED94E95127441BA92A3FD2E9B4FDD85F05549D8368FC546DF560AAFF0FFD9F1568488BB8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3691-6558","documentHash":"51f0522a-472a-43d8-beeb-5096e983e846"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b51a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kowaleczko","uuid":"E5DBFFF760486A18A3869999E61E73CBE6910B6C8934B52C5C601C94FE652617684587A18434516C8D75D89A3760C6BA99F37B26661527C0D53B19BDF81B84FF","documentHash":"36bf7b27-cab7-42f3-a59a-a2bc8e02b2fe"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"67da8e94fdbe836aa643d9c9","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.30.08.2024.01","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.30.08.2024.01","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"ANATOMY-BASED MODELLING OF THE HUMAN VESTIBULAR RECEPTORS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MOTION CUEING IN DYNAMIC FLIGHT SIMULATORS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The motion simulation fidelity depends on the vestibular model used in motion cueing algorithm. Therefore, identifying and selecting the most appropriate mathematical model of the vestibular system is important for motion cueing tasks in motion simulators. This paper presents a method for modelling human vestibular receptors and self-motion sensation.\n\nMethods: Previous work in the field of mathematical modeling of vestibular system were summarized and full procedure of modeling the human self-motion sensation was presented. In addition, we tested whether an increased complexity of the model, particularly with regard to the anatomy (position and orientation) of vestibular receptors (semicircular canals and otolith organs), could significantly influence the estimation of human self-motion sensation. To investigate this, the pilot’s motion sensation was evaluated during a 20-second real flight in an F-16 aircraft (data from this flight came from an Enhanced Crash Survivable Memory Unit, and is detailed in our previous paper). Simulations were conducted with and without model complexities, specifically regarding the position and orientation of the vestibular receptors, as compared to previous models.\n\nResults: It was found that the estimated sensation of angular velocity varies, especially in relation to the pitch angular velocity when the roll velocity is present. The sensed gravito-inertial acceleration also varies, particularly with longitudinal acceleration when the vertical acceleration reaches high values.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions: The complexity of the model, particularly with regards to the orientation of the vestibular receptors, significantly affects the estimated motion sensation. Nevertheless, further research and verification are required to confirm these findings and evaluate their practical implications in simulators that are equipped with a motion

paper explores the utility of Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) as a simulation method for replicating the physiological effects of +Gz acceleration stress experienced by aviators during high-performance flight maneuvers.\nThe study investigates the feasibility of using LBNP to induce cardiovascular responses akin to those observed during +Gz acceleration, including changes in heart rate, blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, mean arterial pressure, and central venous pressure.\n\nMethods: Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical data (keywords and filters such as LBNP, aerospace, centrifuge, simulator, acceleration, Gz, and databases including PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and others relevant to this field of study were selected for the search), we evaluate the efficacy of LBNP in simulating the hemodynamic challenges associated with high-G environments.\n\nResults: The results of the review were organized by thematic categories (advantages of the LBNP test compared to a human centrifuge, changes in heart rates during exposure to +Gz and in the LBNP test, and the relationship between tolerance to LBNP and G-tolerance level). Syntheses of the results are presented, highlighting key themes and insights.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion: LBNP appears to be effective in simulating the impact of +Gz acceleration, particularly in conditions where the acceleration changes slowly (0.01 G/s) or moderately (0.05 G/s). Our findings suggest that LBNP holds promise as a versatile and practical tool for investigating physiological responses to +Gz acceleration stress and for advancing our understanding of human adaptation to extreme gravitational forces. Considering the high cost of installing a human centrifuge to assess +Gz acceleration tolerance, LBNP may serve as a cost-effective alternative for studying human physiology during exposure to moderate and slowly varying acceleration (+Gz)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61b80fb87523402a58cb870f","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5","5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"21-30","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46aa","5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","61b80fb87523402a58cb870f","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2543-7186","eissn":"2451-3512","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com","documentHash":"a472e9f6-35e6-4ad4-a99e-7e7334967a34"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"681dafabfdbe83601a6d804d","year":"2023","volume":"29","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"157f51c2-4040-41c1-af45-87e95344fc0b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aviation medicine","LBNP","negative pressure","acceleration stress","centrifuge"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061021156"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681da3bffdbe83601a6d362d","name":"Paweł Jan","lastName":"Jagielski","documentHash":"bfd1555f-b538-4e5e-90b0-e3d0d31c05d9"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Baran","uuid":"DE5109AC31FEAD2D4357F905BBFB2BD9EF45B6B0D2C67EC84D748D3C6C51422BF715AD923918E9DFED3BE616640AF742C25045F13190E0E5D30C560DF323F8A6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9233-1293","documentHash":"630f66b2-eb31-43c6-afc4-c10eac142c0a"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a6","name":"Agata","lastName":"Gaździńska","uuid":"DE4FAF92070B29020889C5384B7204B0935BDD06F39797666EAE67B9E390BA6533BEFF1ECBD60C066FE3FF2B384C7BA687F2FE86C882812693CA171EF1A1684F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9910-3445","documentHash":"f4fe7ab6-3b41-4325-98ca-86657b366eeb"}],"objectId":"681da3bffdbe83601a6d362c","doi":"10.13075/mp.5893.01543","publicUri":"https://medpr.imp.lodz.pl/pdf-203946-125082","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lifestyle habits and body weight of military flying personnel of the Polish Armed Forced","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The aim of this study was to assess whether and to what extent the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic affected the lifestyle and body weight of military flying personnel. Material and Methods: The study involved 930 Polish soldiers – members of aircrew. The study was conducted by using a survey designed by the author, as part of the implementation of the National Health Programme 2021–2025. The survey used the research technique computer assisted web interview. Results: Approximately half of the soldiers surveyed (49%) declared that they did not contract COVID-19. Analysis of the results on the frequency of consumption of selected food items showed that most food items respondents consumed at similar levels during the pandemic, compared to the pre-pandemic period. There was a positive increase in the frequency of consumption of nuts, fresh fruit and vegetables in 14.8%, 15.9% and 19% of respondents, respectively. More than 20% of those surveyed declared that they consumed less restaurant meals, fast food, sweets and sugary drinks. The vast majority of the respondents (77.6%) answered that they did not feel more negative emotions compared to the pre-pandemic period COVID-19 and emotions did not affect their diet. The frequency of physical activity remained the same for 71.9% of soldiers, while 14.9% respondents said they played sport less often than before the pandemic. Overweight was diagnosed in 50.2% of respondents, while 12.8% were obese. More than half of the respondents (56%) declared that their weight had not changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, 25.1% declared that their weight had increased and 8.9% that it had decreased. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic condition did not disrupt the existing lifestyles of most military flying personnel. More than half of the military flying personnel surveyed reported no effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on weight change. A quarter of soldiers reported weight gain, which was associated with negative changes in diet and physical activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a6","5e709440878c28a0473b8f22"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"76","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46a6","5e709440878c28a0473b8f22","681da3bffdbe83601a6d362d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2b","mniswId":"14213","title":"Medycyna Pracy","issn":"2353-1339","eissn":"0465-5893","websiteLink":"http://medpr.imp.lodz.pl/","documentHash":"c30d7ca9-3098-4d0a-beb0-9d7af4d9c424"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c8544cfdbe83551ec46c13","year":"2025","documentHash":"a30b1401-591e-4936-9f3c-1e29ea5baa66"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["obesity","lifestyle","physical activity","COVID-19","pandemic","military flying personnel"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061024245"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c1878c28a0473c3328","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Tomaszewski","uuid":"C7EC90662AB7B8A172276DA2530ECA61E4F65B6125273B509E0DF80F82D39E4C7311854429113AC6B8C7699FDDDB3AB276CD71CBB872503D3935E65E4A3AAF7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6589-1460","documentHash":"5a1b6f5b-dd7a-40d6-9de3-f472b06506ca"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2025},"objectId":"681dbaf8fdbe83601a6e4e14","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.28.03.2025.04","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.28.03.2025.04","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"METFORMIN: WHEN TO DISCONTINUE IT BEFORE GENERAL ANESTHESIA?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: Metformin is one of the main medications in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Some long-term observations may also indicate the need for repeated tests in order to ensure material endurance after multiple exposures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a","681daf77fdbe83601a6d7d79","681daf77fdbe83601a6d7d76","681daf77fdbe83601a6d7d77"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"31-35","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["681daf77fdbe83601a6d7d76","681daf77fdbe83601a6d7d77","681daf77fdbe83601a6d7d78","681daf77fdbe83601a6d7d79","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2543-7186","eissn":"2451-3512","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com","documentHash":"a472e9f6-35e6-4ad4-a99e-7e7334967a34"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"681dafabfdbe83601a6d804d","year":"2023","volume":"29","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"157f51c2-4040-41c1-af45-87e95344fc0b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["high altitude operations","medical supplies resilience"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061076978"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681db71bfdbe83601a6e17ff","name":"JANUSZ","lastName":"HAŁKA","documentHash":"12b6d8e9-eb24-4679-b88f-6ec7bc77688f"},{"objectId":"681db71bfdbe83601a6e17fe","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KADE","documentHash":"5d848651-9ef6-4f4e-b8b4-b177372c1caf"},{"objectId":"681db71bfdbe83601a6e17fd","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"PODGÓRSKA","documentHash":"f8cbd456-3600-4a8b-b78d-c00da7e5dbe3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2025},"objectId":"681db71bfdbe83601a6e17fc","doi":"10.13174/pjambp.25.04.2025.02","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.13174/pjambp.25.04.2025.02","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"NEUTROPHIL GELATINASE-ASSOCIATED LIPOCALIN (NGAL) - NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKER OF SEPSIS AND KIDNEY INJURY","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a marker of cellular stress, released from various tissues as a result of neutrophil activation. According to literature data, the detection of NGAL is applicable in cardiological conditions, metabolic disorders such as diabetes or dyslipidemia. Moreover, NGAL is recognised as one of the biomarkers of sepsis. Up to 70% of acute kidney injury (AKI) cases may be related to the development of sepsis. Renal tissue injury associated with inflammation, hypoxia or exposure to toxins leads to an increase in plasma NGAL concentration earlier than other commonly used biochemical markers, even as soon as two hours after injury. Studies have demonstrated the utility  of NGAL in early diagnosis of AKI, prediction of chronic kidney disease progression, and assessment of graft function following kidney transplantation. Aviators exposed to hypobaric hypoxia, i.e. high altitude hypoxia, are at risk of injury to several organs, including the kidneys. Novel biomarkers can indicate  structural kidney damage before renal function deteriorates. The use of NGAL to identify specific sites of renal tissue injury represents an additional area of investigation, as well as a potential target for therapeutic intervention. The aim of the study is to review the current medical knowledge regarding NGAL biomarker, with particular emphasis on its use in the diagnosis of kidney injury and sepsis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["681db71bfdbe83601a6e17fe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"15-20","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["681db71bfdbe83601a6e17fd","681db71bfdbe83601a6e17fe","681db71bfdbe83601a6e17ff"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00aebad49b31ccedd4751","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","issn":"2543-7186","eissn":"2451-3512","websiteLink":"http://pjambp.com","documentHash":"a472e9f6-35e6-4ad4-a99e-7e7334967a34"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"681dafabfdbe83601a6d804d","year":"2023","volume":"29","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"157f51c2-4040-41c1-af45-87e95344fc0b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["NGAL","biomarker","kidney injury","sepsis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061077129"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f696b3fdbe831edeb0cdca","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gugała-Iwaniuk","documentHash":"be979ffd-aed4-4867-92de-4dde89a5b9e1"},{"objectId":"66f696b3fdbe831edeb0cdc9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bochyńska","documentHash":"77b0307a-b463-4424-862d-d61d4b73d59a"},{"objectId":"5e7093f3878c28a0473b3d62","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Ryglewicz","uuid":"3B39A06BCFB05E6265C81045A50CC72D003102F637803F1DB0219A9692D4A28649771375C7101F0AEFF15ED6AF532DAFF2A60EADE3FFFE4D5CD5906BAF5A8A7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3401-8220","documentHash":"079be6fb-02b0-4500-b973-2cb4861438db"},{"objectId":"5e70939b878c28a0473ad98a","name":"Halina","lastName":"Sienkiewicz-Jarosz","uuid":"F981DEBE634691F3430A497C151922EAF363618048F825EB434EFE013618CC484B4B1ADD5CDD051A75CFFC5063BE439345D67370995182960F5503E9ED13A2BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2953-1943","documentHash":"e0b1f15e-0df8-4891-b5ec-5a5b8d6aedeb"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a549e","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Witkowski","uuid":"3AFAAF85C6371D7250F902C0BBEA2B9BF9119924EC4EB955ADEC2586A936E58D483566726CA2335C5B6F3B60F4BF3D38B3FC0864773ED732947775178CF9CD23","orcidId":"0000-0003-0531-9558","documentHash":"e5ddc7d0-b8bf-4ba6-a234-f7b5b410ac56"}],"objectId":"66f696b3fdbe831edeb0cdc7","doi":"10.5114/ppn.2022.125029","publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/doi_ft/10.5114/ppn.2022.125029","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Volume changes of medial temporal lobe structures in patients with genetic generalized and temporal lobe epilepsy in relation to neuropsychological functions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: In patients with epilepsy (PWE), cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions are associated with abnormalities in various brain areas. The aim of the study was to compare the volume of the hippocampus (VHIP), amygdala (VAMG) and parahippocampal gyrus (VPHG) with the results of neuropsychological assessment in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and genetic generalized epilepsy (GGE).\n\nMethods: 33 PWE were enrolled in the study (mean age 37.3), 10 with TLE and 23 GGE (12 with GGE with tonic-clonic seizure [GGE-GTCS], and 11 with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy). 19 healthy persons (mean age 32.2) were enrolled as the control group (CG). Measurements of VHIP, VAMG and VPHG were made with 3D completely balanced steady state (CBASS) and 3D T1-weighted sequence. All participants underwent a neuropsychological assessment using a multi-domain cognitive battery and emotional state questionnaires.\n\nResults: The left hippocampus was significantly smaller in patients with left TLE (LTLE) and with GGE-GTCS, compared to the CG (p = 0.0069). In LTLE a significant enlargement of the right amygdala in comparison to the CG and other types of epilepsy were found (p = 0.0015). Among patients with LTLE and GGE-GTCS, impairment of attention and executive functions was statistically more common than in the CG. VHIP right (r = 0.25 p < 0.01) and VHIP left (r = 0.26 p < 0.04) were positively correlated with phonetic verbal fluency.\n\nConclusions: PWE showed changes in the volume of selected medial temporal lobe (MTL) structures. Selective impairment of attention and executive functions was found. Some neuropsychological findings correlate with volume changes in MTL structures. Antiseizure medications therapy could have an impact on the severity of neuropsychological dysfunctions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deef","uid":"bmJzN5wihIiD2B0BrRmdy3w","uuid":"b07a6b1d-45fa-418f-978a-d219aa5f7f6b","name":"Instytut Psychiatrii i Neurologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933a878c28a0473a549e","66f696b3fdbe831edeb0cdc9","5e70939b878c28a0473ad98a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deef","parentUuid":"b07a6b1d-45fa-418f-978a-d219aa5f7f6b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deef","rootUuid":"b07a6b1d-45fa-418f-978a-d219aa5f7f6b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f3878c28a0473b3d62"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"143-150","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f696b3fdbe831edeb0cdc9","5e70933a878c28a0473a549e","66f696b3fdbe831edeb0cdca","5e7093f3878c28a0473b3d62","5e70939b878c28a0473ad98a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a2d4","mniswId":"16408","title":"Postępy Psychiatrii i Neurologii","issn":"1230-2813","eissn":"1230-2813","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"09ef426d-147c-47ec-8921-91ef83d0fc07"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f696b3fdbe831edeb0cdc8","year":"2022","volume":"31","number":"4","documentHash":"750bd87a-f49b-4f76-ba15-ad776169bcd8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MTL structures volumetry","amygdala enlargement","idiopathic generalized epilepsy","neuropsychological functions","temporal lobe epilepsy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747261656495"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"647701a34097071bcb566604","name":"Marek E.","lastName":"Prost","documentHash":"e61e956c-ed2b-4307-a952-f65686944b90"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"647701a34097071bcb566603","doi":"10.24292/01.ot.311222.3","publicUri":"https://www.journalsmededu.pl/index.php/ophthatherapy/article/download/2672/2587","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Stosowanie somatotropiny a krótkowzroczność","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["647701a34097071bcb566604"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"9","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"226-229","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["647701a34097071bcb566604"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ee8c","mniswId":"200143","title":"OphthaTherapy.

It is highly contagious, with transmission occurring through contaminated water, food, or poor hygiene. Globally, 1.7 billion cases of diarrhoeal diseases are diagnosed annually, causing approximately 525,000 deaths among children under the age of five. Dehydration caused by diarrhoea is a primary cause of hospitalisation, particularly in developing countries. Aim: Analysis of the aetiology, frequency, and seasonal distribution of viral pathogens responsible for acute gastroenteritis in children hospitalised between 2019 and 2022 at the Military Institute of Medicine – National Research Institute in Warsaw, Poland. Materials and methods: Medical records of patients aged 0 to 18 diagnosed with rotavirus, norovirus, and adenovirus-induced acute gastroenteritis were analysed. The pathogens had been identified with reliable immunochromatographic tests. Exclusion criteria encompassed bacterial infections, dietary errors, and inflammatory conditions. Data examined included age, gender, aetiology of gastroenteritis, seasonality, duration of hospitalisation, and clinical symptoms (diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and dehydration). Laboratory results such as white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, electrolyte levels, and organ function markers were also evaluated. Results: Data from 350 children hospitalised between 2019 and 2022 were analysed. The highest number of hospitalisations occurred in 2019 and 2022, with fewer cases in 2020–2021, likely reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most patients were between 6 and 12 months old. Rotavirus infection commonly presented with fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, and dehydration. Adenovirus and mixed infections were associated with slightly higher C-reactive protein levels, while rotavirus infections showed mildly elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels. Haematocrit, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and electrolyte levels were similar across all cases. Conclusions: Our analysis showed that rotavirus was the most frequent cause of acute viral diarrhoea in children, followed by norovirus and adenovirus, with mixed infections being the least common. The peak incidence occurred in autumn and winter, except in 2021, reflecting changes in the dynamics of infections related to the coronavirus pandemic.

Although NVGs with green image color (P43 phosphor) are only accepted in military aviation, white image (P45 phosphor) seems to be equally well-regarded by aviators. The aim of our study was to determine if the experience of using NVGs with the green screen affects image preference for that color, and if the screen color preference is related to luminance level.\n\nMethods: Subjects (127 military pilots, 26-56 yr, M = 37.2; 62 pilots with flight experience with NVG use) were asked to observe a model terrain board at two different luminance levels (corresponding roughly to ambient conditions during starlight and one-half moonlight) while using two types of NVGs (green P43 and white P45 phosphor screens). The pilots were asked to answer a questionnaire about their preference for NVG display color.\n\nResults: The findings showed a significant difference between screen color preference and pilots' experience with the green-phosphor-based NVGs (43.5% vs. 23.1% for white screens). However, there was no relationship between screen color preference and luminance level.\n\nDiscussion: Previous NVG experience seems to play an important role in shaping a user's individual preference for a certain phosphor screen color, although green and white phosphor screens both provide satisfactory visibility. Nevertheless, when deciding, it is advisable to experiment with both colors and select the one that suits the user's preferences and needs. Lewkowicz R, Dereń-Szumełda J.

Objective methods for quantifying speech impairment that can be used across languages could facilitate assessment of disease progression and intervention strategies. The aim of this study was to analyze acoustic features to identify language-independent features that could be used to quantify speech dysfunction in English-, Spanish-, and Polish-speaking participants with HD.\n\nMethod: Ninety participants with HD and 83 control participants performed sustained vowel, syllable repetition, and reading passage tasks recorded with previously validated methods using mobile devices. Language-independent features that differed between HD and controls were identified. Principal component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised clustering were applied to the language-independent features of the HD data set to identify subgroups within the HD data.\n\nResults: Forty-six language-independent acoustic features that were significantly different between control participants and participants with HD were identified. Following dimensionality reduction using PCA, four speech clusters were identified in the HD data set. Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) total motor score, total functional capacity, and composite UHDRS were significantly different for pairwise comparisons of subgroups. The percentage of HD participants with higher dysarthria score and disease stage also increased across clusters.\n\nConclusion: The results support the application of acoustic features to objectively quantify speech impairment and disease severity in HD in multilanguage

between alcohol consumption and stroke, particularly for low-moderate intake. We explored these associations in a large international study.\n\nMethods: INTERSTROKE, a case-control study, is the largest international study of risk factors for acute stroke. Alcohol consumption was self-reported and categorized by drinks/week as low (1-7), moderate (7-14 for females and 7-21 for males), or high (>14 for females and >21 for males). Heavy episodic drinking (HED) was defined as >5 drinks on ≥1 day per month. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to determine associations.\n\nResults: We included 12,913 cases and 12,935 controls; 25.0% (n = 6,449) were current drinkers, 16.7% (n = 4,318) former drinkers, and 58.3% (n = 15,076) never drinkers. Current drinkers were younger, male, smokers, active, and with higher-paid occupations. Current drinking was associated with all stroke (OR 1.14; 95% CI 1.04-1.26) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21-1.84) but not ischemic stroke (OR 1.06; 95% CI 0.95-1.19). HED pattern was associated with all stroke (OR 1.39; 95% CI 1.21-1.59), ischemic stroke (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.10-1.51), and ICH (OR 1.76; 95% CI 1.31-2.36). High level of alcohol intake was consistently associated with all stroke, ischemic stroke, and ICH. Moderate intake was associated with all stroke and ICH but not ischemic stroke. Low alcohol intake was not associated with stroke overall, but there were regional differences; low intake was associated with reduced odds of stroke in Western Europe/North America (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.45-0.96) and increased odds in India (OR 2.18; 95% CI 1.42-3.36) (p-interaction 0.037). Wine consumption was associated with reduced odds of all stroke and ischemic stroke but not ICH. The magnitudes of association were greatest in those without hypertension and current smokers.\n\nDiscussion: High and moderate intake were associated with increased odds of stroke, whereas low intake was not associated with stroke. However, there were important regional variations, which may relate to differences in population characteristics of alcohol consumers, types or patterns of consumption."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f3878c28a0473b3d62"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"100","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f69514fdbe831edeb0b97d","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b97e","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b97f","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b980","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b981","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b982","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b983","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b984","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b985","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b986","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b987","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b988","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b989","5e7093f3878c28a0473b3d62","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b98a","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b98b","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b98c","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b98d","66f69514fdbe831edeb0b98e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fe7","mniswId":"14956","title":"Neurology","issn":"0028-3878","documentHash":"9e35f7ae-a711-4539-bbac-855a9a67dfd3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f69514fdbe831edeb0b97c","year":"2023","volume":"100","number":"2","documentHash":"7e4375e1-8b85-49ff-a5b2-1dcdc3438ca4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655019250"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677cd7f3fdbe833088a7cb8d","name":"Piotr Aleksander","lastName":"Rot","documentHash":"c5f93e69-f788-4a36-8318-5b5da3933360"},{"objectId":"617373a97523400564d2323a","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Witkowska","uuid":"B3EFE7E394B3C4CBD6F6ABC7881CD2AB339C685F6C4397563F6FC010184F60E5E4B3DE18FFA322DE5D9E5CBB767CE63616F1C6EEAB5197B6A44939441EB32016","documentHash":"4b6f0e1e-28fc-4b4a-ae83-a7451a90852d"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wojdas","uuid":"85AD14C85112C26BC9B7759EF839D84DFC87BF76F58A5C732BCBC6CFBB8896C38059AEAB94D363740965D62BDE9203E8905B3F85DBE8EEBC0716A09CA7FDA800","documentHash":"b67b0524-f36a-4db4-abc7-4967b47dd7d5"}],"objectId":"677cd7f3fdbe833088a7cb8c","doi":"10.12659/ajcr.945625","publicUri":"https://www.amjcaserep.com/download/index/idArt/945625","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A 46-Year-Old Man with an Incidental Finding of a Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma in a Thyroglossal Duct Cyst","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BACKGROUND: The thyroglossal duct cyst, which develops from the midline migratory tract between the foramen cecum and the anatomic location of the thyroid, is the most prevalent congenital abnormality of the neck, accounting for about 70% of all cervical neck masses in children and 7% in adults. Only up to 1% of these abnormalities contain malignant thyroid tissue, with 90% of those cases being papillary thyroid carcinoma. Thyroglossal duct cyst is rarely linked to carcinoma. Clinical presentation of thyroglossal duct cyst carcinoma is generally impossible to differentiate from benign tumors before surgery, and most cases are incidentally detected after surgery, due to histopathological evaluation of the resected cyst.\n\nCASE REPORT: A 46-year-old man presented with a painless, progressively enlarging neck lump. Physical examination identified a well-defined, mildly firm mass situated anteroinferior to the hyoid bone. Imaging indicated that a thyroid gland duct cyst was the most likely diagnosis. The patient underwent the Sistrunk procedure. Histopathological analysis revealed papillary thyroid carcinoma within the thyroid gland duct cyst.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Carcinomas occurring in the thyroglossal cyst are uncommon. The causes of thyroglossal duct carcinoma are unclear, and neither a detailed medical history nor a physical examination can reliably diagnose it before surgery. The management of such cases remains debated, owing to the rarity of reported occurrences. So far, the standard treatment involves the Sistrunk procedure, followed by close patient monitoring. For patients with metastatic disease, a total thyroidectomy is necessary, and if neck metastases are present, neck dissection is required."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042","617373a97523400564d2323a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"e945625","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["617373a97523400564d2323a","677cd7f3fdbe833088a7cb8d","5e7093f5878c28a0473b4042"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479bdc","mniswId":"879","title":"American Journal of Case Reports","issn":"1941-5923","eissn":"1941-5923","documentHash":"8060b22f-07c0-4655-abfe-e22323c904f8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667134ab40970745515eb2fe","year":"2024","volume":"25","documentHash":"89fd9b38-a975-42fc-b00b-a0c6c499873f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Thyroglossal Cyst","Thyroid Neoplasms","Thyroidectomy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655038496"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","name":"Michał","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"2DC5281868BC78E9C26D21E0DC520F19540A18FD2EA58B5363B94947AC0955C9A0CB1A73FF4A40149185E818A0C2BEACBE59432EC2451BF788E3208C50BBAD4B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5524-5932","documentHash":"0ff7aaa5-ed88-4d00-b98b-8654d53cdadf"}],"objectId":"67d4227bfdbe830c1d992d29","doi":"10.1097/sla.0000000000005506","publicUri":"https://journals.lww.com/10.1097/SLA.0000000000005506","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Use of Telemedicine for Postdischarge Assessment of the Surgical Wound: International Cohort Study, and Systematic Review With Meta-analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective: This study aimed to determine whether remote wound reviews using telemedicine can be safely upscaled, and if standardized assessment tools are needed.\n\nBackground: Surgical site infection (SSI) is the most common complication of surgery worldwide, and frequently occurs after hospital discharge. Evidence to support implementation of telemedicine during postoperative recovery will be an essential component of pandemic recovery.\n\nMethods: The primary outcome of this study was SSI reported up to 30 days after surgery (SSI), comparing rates reported using telemedicine (telephone and/or video assessment) to those with in-person review. The first part of this study analyzed primary data from an international cohort study of adult patients undergoing abdominal surgery who were discharged from hospital before 30 days after surgery. The second part combined this data with the results of a systematic review to perform a meta-analysis of all available data conducted in accordance with PRIMSA guidelines (PROSPERO:192596).\n\nResults: The cohort study included 15,358 patients from 66 countries (8069 high, 4448 middle, 1744 low income). Of these, 6907 (45.0%) were followed up using telemedicine. The SSI rate reported using telemedicine was slightly lower than with in-person follow-up (13.4% vs 11.1%, P<0.001), which persisted after risk adjustment in a mixed-effects model (adjusted odds ratio: 0.73, 95% confidence interval: 0.63–0.84, P<0.001). This association was consistent across sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including a propensity-score matched model. In 9 eligible nonrandomized studies identified, a pooled mean of 64% of patients underwent telemedicine follow-up. Upon meta-analysis, the SSI rate reported was lower with telemedicine (odds ratio: 0.67, 0.47–0.94) than in-person (reference) follow-up (I2=0.45, P=0.12), although there a high risk of bias in included studies.\n\nConclusions: Use of telemedicine to assess the surgical wound postdischarge is feasible, but risks underreporting of SSI. Standardized tools for remote assessment of SSI must be evaluated and adopted as telemedicine is upscaled globally."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"277","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"e1331-e1347","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477097","mniswId":"1292","title":"Annals of Surgery","issn":"0003-4932","eissn":"1528-1140","documentHash":"da989a34-6848-4662-b9a3-073f30e2ee2e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67d4227bfdbe830c1d992d2a","year":"2022","volume":"277","number":"6","documentHash":"abf6a9d2-025d-4d26-8d4a-6968d4a8849f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["surgical site infection","surgical complications","global surgery","global health","research methodology","outcome assessment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655060206"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681da1ebfdbe83601a6cdceb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rola","documentHash":"a086f651-9cb7-4aeb-a19a-b8b3928c897d"},{"objectId":"681da1ebfdbe83601a6cdcea","name":"Michal Andrzej","lastName":"Kurek","documentHash":"ca98ac79-4a5f-4910-9f8a-e1e89f383451"}],"objectId":"681da1ebfdbe83601a6cdce8","doi":"10.3357/amhp.6463.2025","publicUri":"https://asma.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/amhp/96/2/article-p135.xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Screening and Interpretation Rules for Resting Electrocardiograms in Polish Air Force Aircrew","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the basic screening tests used in assessing fitness for military service and in periodic examinations of professional soldiers. Its purpose is to reduce the risk of death from cardiovascular disease by early detection of cardiac pathologies predisposing to sudden cardiac arrest. Commonly used electrocardiographic standards do not perform well in screening, accounting for the recognition of a large number of abnormalities unrelated to structural heart disease.\n\nMethods: A comprehensive literature review was performed using electronic databases such as PubMed®, Google Scholar, and relevant aerospace medical journals. The search focused on keywords, including \"screening ECG,\" \"electrocardiographic criteria,\" \"military aircrew,\" and \"aviation medicine.\" Articles that discussed ECG interpretation rules and the implementation of screening protocols in military aircrew were included. The review also involved an examination of guidelines and policies from major aviation regulatory bodies.\n\nResults: This review includes information on topics relevant to the application of 12-lead ECG in screening diagnostics, such as general ECG interpretation criteria, limitations of ECG as a screening tool, objectives of ECG-based screening, and past experiences with the use of screening ECG in athletes within the context of military medicine.\n\nDiscussion: We discuss various criteria for the interpretation of screening ECG in athletes and soldiers to increase the specificity of this test. We also present a proposal for a system of criteria for interpreting ECGs in aircrew of the Polish Air Force, which may help improve the detection of cardiac pathologies in this professional group.

terms of recurrence, postoperative pain, and surgical complications.\nSummary background data: International guidelines recommend mesh fixation for large M3 inguinal hernias during laparoendoscopic repairs due to high recurrence rates. However, emerging experimental and registry data suggest that anatomically shaped, rigid and three-dimensional meshes may maintain stability without fixation. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap through a multicenter randomized controlled trial.\nMethods: The MEFISTO Trial is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial conducted in 12 surgical centers. A total of 204 patients with M3 inguinal hernias were randomized into two groups: a non-fixation group using three-dimensional, rigid, anatomical meshes. Fixation group using flat lightweight meshes fixed with tissue adhesive. The primary outcome was the recurrence rate at 12 months. The secondary outcomes included postoperative pain (Visual Analog Scale) and surgical site occurrence. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods for non-inferiority studies.\nResults: The recurrence rate at 12 months was 3.1% and 2.1% in the non-fixation and fixation groups respectively (P = 0.6847). No differences were observed in pain at discharge, 7-10 days post-surgery, or 12 months post-surgery. No significant differences were found in surgical complications or operative times between groups.\nConclusions: Non-fixation of three-dimensional meshes is non-inferior to fixation of flat lightweight meshes for M3 inguinal hernia repair. These findings support the potential revision of international hernia management guidelines to incorporate non-fixation approaches with appropriate mesh types."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947f878c28a0473be649"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e7878c28a0473c69d4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"281","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"921-927","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a38","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a39","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a3a","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a3b","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a3c","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a3e","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a40","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a42","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a45","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a46","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a47","67b31d6dfdbe83707bf58a48","5e7093c5878c28a0473b07cf","5e70947f878c28a0473be649","5e709479878c28a0473bdedd","624cfb287523402df09d2c9d","5e7094e7878c28a0473c69d4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477097","mniswId":"1292","title":"Annals of Surgery","issn":"0003-4932","eissn":"1528-1140","documentHash":"da989a34-6848-4662-b9a3-073f30e2ee2e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6837fd85fdbe833a2776941f","year":"2025","volume":"281","number":"6","doi":"","documentHash":"ba9f2b3c-44f4-4b27-b058-9f097e4a408c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mesh fixation","laparoendoscopic hernia repair","randomized controlled trial","TAPP","recurrence rate"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748646940836"}]
