Current scientific tools may not be adequate for monitoring and assessing subsequent changes to biodiversity. In this paper, we evaluate the scientific and budgetary trade-offs associated with morphology-based taxonomy and metabarcoding approaches to biodiversity surveys in the context of nascent deep-seabed mining for polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, the area of most intense interest. For the dominant taxa of benthic meiofauna, we discuss the types of information produced by these methods and use cost-effectiveness analysis to compare their abilities to yield biological and ecological data for use in environmental assessment and management. On the basis of our evaluation, morphology-based taxonomy is less cost-effective than metabarcoding but offers scientific advantages, such as the generation of density, biomass, and size structure data. Approaches that combine the two methods during the environmental assessment phase of commercial activities may facilitate future biodiversity monitoring and assessment for deep-seabed mining and for other activities in remote deep-sea habitats, for which taxonomic data and expertise are limited."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"655-663","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60bf89262467f0444bf26cfe","60bf89262467f0444bf26cff","60bf89262467f0444bf26d00","60bf89262467f0444bf26d01","60bf89262467f0444bf26d02","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547810a","mniswId":"8422","title":"Integrated environmental assessment and management","issn":"1551-3777","eissn":"1551-3793","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1f6e9802-8e5a-4cc5-96fc-40b369542fee"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biodiversity","Deep-seabed mining","Environmental assessment","Metabarcoding","Taxonomy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747051556594"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da84f","name":"Emma","lastName":"Undeman","documentHash":"8d79fbb6-33bc-4931-9231-7705e9e1d924"},{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da84d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sobek","documentHash":"df4e239d-d5c5-4434-a4a8-d67bcb53477e"},{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da84c","name":"Mikhail","lastName":"Sofiev","documentHash":"db9ef0cc-ea09-4c40-a7cc-52dd7a88affe"},{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da84b","name":"Caroline P.","lastName":"Slomp","orcidId":"0000-0002-7272-0109","documentHash":"72ac0e54-8f8e-49c6-946d-5b3b681ba029"},{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da84a","name":"Andreas","lastName":"Schramm","documentHash":"72f587e8-0ce7-4d8a-965d-c639c1d10be5"},{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da849","name":"Oleg","lastName":"Savchuk","orcidId":"0000-0002-3873-4662","documentHash":"86fd11e0-51fa-4f70-9cff-f74eec8991bb"},{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da848","name":"Jørgen E.","lastName":"Olesen","documentHash":"921c3c10-9ba6-4a93-8606-af807d664a3d"},{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da847","name":"Michael","lastName":"Naumann","documentHash":"b625b2a2-5eb4-43bf-a4f3-50483b6665c1"},{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da846","name":"Bärbel","lastName":"Müller-Karulis","documentHash":"3beccfd9-f96f-47e3-8b9a-7878837c6452"},{"objectId":"624ea2bd2467f009a40da845","name":"H.

The recent decades have brought significant changes in the Baltic Sea. First, the rising nutrient loads from land in the second half of the 20th century led to eutrophication and spreading of hypoxic and anoxic areas, for which permanent stratification of the water column and limited ventilation of deep-water layers made favourable conditions. Since the 1980s the nutrient loads to the Baltic Sea have been continuously decreasing. This, however, has so far not resulted in significant improvements in oxygen availability in the deep regions, which has revealed a slow response time of the system to the reduction of the land-derived nutrient loads. Responsible for that is the low burial efficiency of phosphorus at anoxic conditions and its remobilization from sediments when conditions change from oxic to anoxic. This results in a stoichiometric excess of phosphorus available for organic-matter production, which promotes the growth of N2-fixing cyanobacteria and in turn supports eutrophication.\n\nThis assessment reviews the available and published knowledge on the biogeochemical functioning of the Baltic Sea. In its content, the paper covers the aspects related to changes in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (C, N, and P) external loads, their transformations in the coastal zone, changes in organic-matter production (eutrophication) and remineralization (oxygen availability), and the role of sediments in burial and turnover of C, N, and P. In addition to that, this paper focuses also on changes in the marine CO2 system, the structure and functioning of the microbial community, and the role of contaminants for biogeochemical processes. This comprehensive assessment allowed also for identifying knowledge gaps and future research needs in the field of marine biogeochemistry in the Baltic Sea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"633-685","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a","624ea2bd2467f009a40da83c","624ea2bd2467f009a40da83d","624ea2bd2467f009a40da83e","624ea2bd2467f009a40da83f","624ea2bd2467f009a40da840","624ea2bd2467f009a40da841","624ea2bd2467f009a40da842","624ea2bd2467f009a40da843","624ea2bd2467f009a40da844","624ea2bd2467f009a40da845","624ea2bd2467f009a40da846","624ea2bd2467f009a40da847","624ea2bd2467f009a40da848","624ea2bd2467f009a40da849","624ea2bd2467f009a40da84a","624ea2bd2467f009a40da84b","624ea2bd2467f009a40da84c","624ea2bd2467f009a40da84d","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","624ea2bd2467f009a40da84f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779db","mniswId":"5271","title":"Earth System Dynamics","issn":"2190-4979","eissn":"2190-4987","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f71f48a0-a236-4168-916e-dc33338082c8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058093179"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"627e57634097070501c611d9","name":"Henning","lastName":"Reiss","orcidId":"0000-0003-1393-0269","documentHash":"0ce39a0d-fa42-4f9d-92e4-9607f0e6f1b1"},{"objectId":"627e57624097070501c611d8","name":"Paul E.","lastName":"Renaud","orcidId":"0000-0003-3821-5974","documentHash":"9e4f26bc-4b71-423c-96dd-4ae8e0141d89"},{"objectId":"627e57624097070501c611d7","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Cochrane","documentHash":"d89c2341-7950-4332-80d6-cfa1aabd7def"},{"objectId":"627e57624097070501c611d6","name":"Johan C.","lastName":"Faust","documentHash":"72249272-4368-4ff7-9052-b6673c095d9f"},{"objectId":"627e57624097070501c611d4","name":"Arunima","lastName":"Sen","orcidId":"0000-0001-7847-2137","documentHash":"701f87ae-2184-47c8-83b8-6fbd64dea849"},{"objectId":"5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","name":"Marc","lastName":"Silberberger","uuid":"E363DD7660B6F1967F260E77F0DEF03CA3C92DBDD2009A5DBC438FB3DAEB66FD9BD2F93626269E3F1CFEEB33857F9B6DB8B35FB96FCEC7ADE22AD4C7FDCB76B5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8819-4388","documentHash":"5c5d0ad5-b173-4b3e-82f6-be9607003a7e"}],"objectId":"627e57624097070501c611d2","doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107803","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0272771422000622?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Environmental monitoring data reveals geographic and depth-based differentiation of benthic fjord communities","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Multi-fjord studies require resources and time usually not afforded to academic projects. We used data from environmental monitoring surveys to conduct an extensive multi-fjord study that allowed us to explore large scale patterns of benthic communities of fjords along the Norwegian coast. We found a distinction between the subarctic Finnmark subprovince and the more temperate West Norwegian subprovince, and within the latter, a distinction between shallow stations (less than 220 m water depth) and deeper stations (greater than 220m water depth). Sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content was lower among Finnmark stations compared to West stations at similar water depths and this could account for species that thrive in organic rich sediment being abundant in the latter, as well as the near absence of chemosynthesis-based species from the Finnmark stations. However, neither lower marine primary production due to extensive polar night periods nor less terrigenous carbon input due to sparse tree cover appear to explain the lower TOC of Finnmark stations. In fact, despite the northernmost tree and forest line running through Finnmark, stations in this region had higher C/N rations, which can be indicative of terrigenous carbon input, which could be due to permafrost derived peatlands and marshes that are abundant in this region. We suggest that the observed biogeographic differentiation is not based just on terrestrial or vertical water column carbon fluxes but additionally on sedimentary carbon retention capacity which is linked to grain size. Sediment reworking by species such as capitellid worms could potentially further impact sediment organic matter content. The coarser sediment of Finnmark stations furthermore supports taxa that rely on larger grain sizes. Though few deepwater species were observed, two-thirds of the total taxa enumerated in this study were absent from deep stations (>220 m water depth). Environmental parameters were largely not statistically different between deep stations and shallow stations of either subprovince, but species differences suggest that sediment grain size could explain some of the community differences. This study highlights the value of monitoring data that can be used for gaining understanding over large spatial scales that is not possible through academic budgets and research-funding periods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"268","pagesFromTo":"107803","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["627e57624097070501c611d4","5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","627e57624097070501c611d6","627e57624097070501c611d7","627e57624097070501c611d8","627e57634097070501c611d9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b48","mniswId":"5962","title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","issn":"0272-7714","eissn":"1096-0015","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f0a974e1-f795-4803-a548-95d5a6a9d439"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Multi-fjord;","Norway;","Macrofauna;","Benthos;","Spatial;","Subarctic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058115004"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf377","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"85FD817EC7A87F03F838855336B25207286B8767235FEC849DD4568444510725B2225280529810C7754A21DDEE8BCA4353F3BD29A41F34EEFEA5967457C303A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9132-1990","documentHash":"311369bd-713f-4e50-ad69-8c04ac3dcea3"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf343","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kitowska","uuid":"127771033B5E4A478D132F5BC3AE4A318687B0AEEFFF97603D14800DC684380C5CE781B5CB907274578B2A0AD625E2A2C718A4A7D20D073386DD44509E9A6D0A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2421-034X","documentHash":"edfe1b13-c623-40bb-b9c5-089956d44b86"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Markuszewski","uuid":"0014105502B25E9A2BA9F3C5F0DDFB201E300286645007F34F9BF1734051EE556B442316548E3AD68FE389CF9B7EAB5AEE3A3D2175A5C349563039874A4736EB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1160-6318","documentHash":"8b99a50a-c43a-445c-9075-c50ccb381d72"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3cea","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Niedźwiecka","uuid":"96EC04B8E66D2520DD94DDC0266EC593CAB2E2ED1B7D13402AA2A7BC78A2BAE04282011C99450492E8236CA258FC9B98AC7641502ABE387E28023D29D57A7CBD","orcidId":"0000-0003-1315-5231","documentHash":"dd80c8e3-4e20-4a35-92fe-c12bcf91c6cb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62286e6a2467f0086c9bf34f","doi":"10.3390/rs14020312","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/2/312/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Distribution of pCO2W and Air-Sea CO2 Fluxes Using FFNN at the Continental Shelf Areas of the Arctic Ocean","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A feed-forward neural network (FFNN) was used to estimate the monthly climatology of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2W) at a spatial resolution of 1° latitude by 1° longitude in the continental shelf of the European Arctic Sector (EAS) of the Arctic Ocean (the Greenland, Norwegian, and Barents seas). The predictors of the network were sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), the upper ocean mixed-layer depth (MLD), and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), and as a target, we used 2 853 pCO2W data points from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas. We built an FFNN based on three major datasets that differed in the Chl-a concentration data used to choose the best model to reproduce the spatial distribution and temporal variability of pCO2W. Using all physical–biological components improved estimates of the pCO2W and decreased the biases, even though Chl-a values in many grid cells were interpolated values. General features of pCO2W distribution were reproduced with very good accuracy, but the network underestimated pCO2W in the winter and overestimated pCO2W values in the summer. The results show that the model that contains interpolating Chl-a concentration, SST, SSS, and MLD as a target to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of pCO2W in the sea surface gives the best results and best-fitting network to the observational data. The calculation of monthly drivers of the estimated pCO2W change within continental shelf areas of the EAS confirms the major impact of not only the biological effects to the pCO2W distribution and Air-Sea CO2 flux in the EAS, but also the strong impact of the upper ocean mixing. A strong seasonal correlation between predictor and pCO2W seen earlier in the North Atlantic is clearly a yearly correlation in the EAS. The five-year monthly mean CO2 flux distribution shows that all continental shelf areas of the Arctic Ocean were net CO2 sinks. Strong monthly CO2 influx to the Arctic Ocean through the Greenland and Barents Seas (>12 gC m−2 day−1) occurred in the fall and winter, when the pCO2W level at the sea surface was high (>360 µatm) and the strongest wind speed (>12 ms−1) was present."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3cea","5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","5e709489878c28a0473bf343","5e709489878c28a0473bf377"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"312","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709328878c28a0473a3cea","5e709489878c28a0473bf343","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","issn":"2072-4292","documentHash":"05b1e2d5-d1a7-4a36-8bf2-d32e29113bc3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61eeb19c2467f0689144f088","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"2","documentHash":"620da02c-2abd-4e51-a024-ce5fe723fa25"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["feed-forward neural network;","the European Arctic Sector;","partial pressure of CO2;","Air-Sea CO2 flux"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124428"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"622872c62467f0086c9c078e","name":"Carlos","lastName":"Garcia-Soto","documentHash":"dfb403e5-319d-4b30-acb6-de16d1b4f84e"},{"objectId":"622872c62467f0086c9c078d","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Kotynska-Zielinska","documentHash":"a8ba595e-2d98-473b-a5ab-f4a6f8dca3b4"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651c","name":"TYMON","lastName":"ZIELIŃSKI","uuid":"C324D30030FFB1D821F13CA4C438B654B82F5050D3298D1A50BB41185EF70CD31FD4DA77DE03586D1C0F5FC8FC0F39ECDC58D1956839D195025A90DA5E2BE1BE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4712-8899","documentHash":"f0c26ff7-1742-409b-aa86-c0253dfa2a66"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"622872c62467f0086c9c078a","doi":"10.3390/su14020926","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/2/926/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Blueprint for Ocean Literacy: EU4Ocean","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we discuss the importance of the efficient communication of science results to citizens across the world.

This study focuses on the provenance of sedimentary organic matter deposited in the Gulf of Gdańsk (southern Baltic) and Oslofjord/Drammensfjord (southern Norway) based on the analysis of multiple specific proxies in recent sediments (0–5 cm layer) sampled at 12 sites in 2014. Bulk markers (total organic carbon/total nitrogen [TOC/TN] and stable organic carbon isotopes [δ13CTOC]) and various molecular geochemical markers of organic matter origin (n-alkanes, branched alkanes, unresolved complex mixture [UCM], polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAHs], hopanes, steranes, and polar steroids including sterols and stanols) were used to comprehensively assess the origin of sedimentary organic matter in the studied basins. The results of this study indicate that the combined use of TOC/TN and δ13CTOC may lead to ambiguous outcomes, and anthropogenic input may affect the sedimentary TOC/TN ratio. The analysis of molecular proxies allowed the identification of locations most impacted by anthropogenic organic matter derived from petrogenic sources and/or sewage effluents and the classification of the studied sites based on the contribution of marine/terrestrial biogenic matter. This study demonstrates that key issues, such as the forms of sedimentary chemical markers, post-depositional changes, and specific diagenetic products, although neglected by some researchers, must be considered for the reliable assessment of organic matter sources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such extensive study on surface sediments from the Gulf of Gdańsk and Oslofjord/Drammensfjord in terms of the use of both bulk and molecular markers to investigate organic matter sources."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii

The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere. Based on the summaries of the recent knowledge gained in palaeo-, historical, and future regional climate research, we find that the main conclusions from earlier assessments still remain valid. However, new long-term, homogenous observational records, for example, for Scandinavian glacier inventories, sea-level-driven saltwater inflows, so-called Major Baltic Inflows, and phytoplankton species distribution, and new scenario simulations with improved models, for example, for glaciers, lake ice, and marine food web, have become available. In many cases, uncertainties can now be better estimated than before because more models were included in the ensembles, especially for the Baltic Sea. With the help of coupled models, feedbacks between several components of the Earth system have been studied, and multiple driver studies were performed, e.g. projections of the food web that include fisheries, eutrophication, and climate change. New datasets and projections have led to a revised understanding of changes in some variables such as salinity. Furthermore, it has become evident that natural variability, in particular for the ocean on multidecadal timescales, is greater than previously estimated, challenging our ability to detect observed and projected changes in climate. In this context, the first palaeoclimate simulations regionalised for the Baltic Sea region are instructive. Hence, estimated uncertainties for the projections of many variables increased. In addition to the well-known influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation, it was found that also other low-frequency modes of internal variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, have profound effects on the climate of the Baltic Sea region. Challenges were also identified, such as the systematic discrepancy between future cloudiness trends in global and regional models and the difficulty of confidently attributing large observed changes in marine ecosystems to climate change. Finally, we compare our results with other coastal sea assessments, such as the North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment (NOSCCA), and find that the effects of climate change on the Baltic Sea differ from those on the North Sea, since Baltic Sea oceanography and ecosystems are very different from other coastal seas such as the North Sea. While the North Sea dynamics are dominated by tides, the Baltic Sea is characterised by brackish water, a perennial vertical stratification in the southern subbasins, and a seasonal sea ice cover in the northern subbasins."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"457-593","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6239c81c2467f009d30016dd","6239c81c2467f009d30016de","6239c81c2467f009d30016df","6239c81c2467f009d30016e0","6239c81c2467f009d30016e1","6239c81c2467f009d30016e2","6239c81d2467f009d30016e3","6239c81d2467f009d30016e4","6239c81d2467f009d30016e5","6239c81d2467f009d30016e6","6239c81d2467f009d30016e7","6239c81d2467f009d30016e8","6239c81d2467f009d30016e9","6239c81d2467f009d30016ea","6239c81d2467f009d30016eb","6239c81d2467f009d30016ec","6239c81d2467f009d30016ed","6239c81d2467f009d30016ee","6239c81d2467f009d30016ef","6239c81d2467f009d30016f1","6239c81d2467f009d30016f2","6239c81d2467f009d30016f3","6239c81d2467f009d30016f4","6239c81d2467f009d300172c","6239c81d2467f009d300172d","6239c81d2467f009d300172e","6239c81d2467f009d300172f","6239c81d2467f009d3001730","6239c81d2467f009d3001731","6239c81d2467f009d3001732","5e709347878c28a0473a654a","6239c81d2467f009d3001734","6239c81d2467f009d3001735","6239c81d2467f009d3001736","6239c81d2467f009d3001737","6239c81d2467f009d3001738","6239c81d2467f009d3001739","6239c81d2467f009d300173a","6239c81d2467f009d300173b","6239c81d2467f009d300173c","6239c81d2467f009d300173d","6239c81d2467f009d300173e","6239c81d2467f009d300173f","6239c81d2467f009d3001740","6239c81d2467f009d3001741","6239c81d2467f009d3001742","6239c81d2467f009d3001743"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779db","mniswId":"5271","title":"Earth System Dynamics","issn":"2190-4979","eissn":"2190-4987","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f71f48a0-a236-4168-916e-dc33338082c8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058135176"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"EEF890B1E5D83511CFF757CBCF10CA2BD7991D3807A5C930A1FE7E612F46F8C684536138A249461DB575FC1B980CA1B886292FD94C3FEBB57329BF6C05122B7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0911-3082","documentHash":"6cad81c7-1414-4d5a-958e-f2eaeda4b528"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6544","name":"Agata","lastName":"Zaborska","uuid":"FE40EF42F9E848E1D09D278DBA4FECC8CD79F3BC581694CBDEC7B3EE47F2AC0C2688E35AC59379BC3BC9C53F432C7CF089A8C0E8D1D11ACB2050D908A2E6CF9E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1432-7421","documentHash":"f9a20830-9869-4364-97d8-deb620a80580"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b20","name":"Ksenia","lastName":"Pazdro","uuid":"6538DFA042434F944EC3F934E8085434F2F9A5F7DA28C2F322EFC9FCA07523B4807443385DC8947D7F1AC9EA4A37393C4041BA2DDE8C79642BF66690FA9FB669","orcidId":"0000-0003-0283-1468","documentHash":"870f628d-167d-4246-99f6-00e6c1024232"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739945b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pouch","uuid":"9D8E0E331A2E1554B9833195757F665FCB9551025B4D9DC772A41CA36D50F685CDA5AAF4F26E7415651E9F3B10B980DD557F43CBF11D50F88AE0078596519343","orcidId":"0000-0002-2898-8896","documentHash":"4ebf3f5f-2242-46bc-b69c-77d5b603ac61"}],"objectId":"623b0a352467f02a86c57b1c","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.113488","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0025326X22001709?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Bioaccumulation of PCBs, HCB and PAHs in the summer plankton from West Spitsbergen fjords","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Concentrations of seven polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and twelve polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were examined in plankton collected in summer from different Arctic fjords (Hornsund, Kongsfjorden, Adventfjorden). The levels of all target contaminants in arctic protists have been analyzed for the first time. This is also the first report on PAH levels in arctic fjords zooplankton. ∑7 PCB, HCB and ∑12 PAH concentrations were up to 3.58 ng/g w.w., 0.28 ng/g w.w. and 249 ng/g w.w., respectively. Among the zooplankton species, the highest concentrations of the most analyzed contaminants were detected in Themisto abyssorum. This could be explained by the predatory feeding strategy of this species. The importance of diet was confirmed by the low concentrations of contaminants detected in the herbivorous copepod Calanus spp. Depending on contaminant, bioaccumulation occurred in 50 to 100% studied cases. Studies have shown significant biomagnification of PCBs and PAHs in zooplankton predator-prey pairs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6544","5e709326878c28a0473a3b20","5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","5e70929e878c28a04739945b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"177","pagesFromTo":"113488","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a04739945b","5e709347878c28a0473a6544","5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","5e709326878c28a0473a3b20"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d73","mniswId":"13923","title":"MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN","issn":"0025-326X","documentHash":"660ed6d4-6a65-41f7-86f9-b65deb221d1c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"623b0a352467f02a86c57b22","year":"2022","volume":"177","documentHash":"301b1b1a-6f1d-4bfd-aba0-defc402baf76"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Polychlorinated biphenyls;","Hexachlorobenzene;","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons;","Arctic fjords;","Zooplankton;","Bioaccumulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058135652"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"622874722467f0086c9c0f72","name":"Renee","lastName":"Zbizika","documentHash":"a873fdc4-4da2-4c0f-9276-cc08dafe8f9c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651c","name":"TYMON","lastName":"ZIELIŃSKI","uuid":"C324D30030FFB1D821F13CA4C438B654B82F5050D3298D1A50BB41185EF70CD31FD4DA77DE03586D1C0F5FC8FC0F39ECDC58D1956839D195025A90DA5E2BE1BE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4712-8899","documentHash":"f0c26ff7-1742-409b-aa86-c0253dfa2a66"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739941f","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Pakszys","uuid":"1F3B135D1A9727549067EF95CCBDEB84D6AB61608808E2526841E6DD2021006F70CD19FFE16B2FF24122999C414972382496892CB7584C4FE4ECBFE997317A93","orcidId":"0000-0001-6098-8215","documentHash":"7ff87010-03dc-4fba-a7c6-f5d8fafb4213"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"622874722467f0086c9c0f70","doi":"10.3390/atmos13010101","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/1/101/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Deep Neural Networks for Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a measure of the extinction of solar radiation by aerosols in the atmosphere. Understanding the variations of global AOD is necessary for precisely determining the role of aerosols. Arctic warming is partially caused by aerosols transported from vast distances, including those released during biomass burning events (BBEs). However, measuring AODs is challenging, typically requiring active LIDAR systems or passive sun photometers. Both are limited to cloud-free conditions; sun photometers provide only point measurements, thus requiring more spatial coverage. A more viable method to obtain accurate AOD may be found through machine learning. This study uses DNNs to estimate Svalbard’s AODs using a minimal set of meteorological parameters (temperature, air mass, water vapor, wind speed, latitude, longitude, and time of year). The mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and true data was 0.00401 for the entire set and 0.0079 for the validation set. It was then shown that the inclusion of BBE data improves predictions by 42.167%. It was demonstrated that AODs may be accurately estimated without the use of expensive instrumentation, using machine learning and minimal data. Similar models may be developed for other regions, allowing immediate improvement of current meteorological models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a04739941f","5e709347878c28a0473a651c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"101","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622874722467f0086c9c0f72","5e70929e878c28a04739941f","5e709347878c28a0473a651c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","documentHash":"24c31de6-3ae6-404a-a0c1-7a0222895472"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"622874722467f0086c9c0f76","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"87221915-6e71-4e16-974f-9933af1edda2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aerosol optical depth;","arctic atmosphere;","deep neural network;","maritime aerosol network;","biomass burning event"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058192470"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f2a5","name":"Leif G.","lastName":"Anderson","documentHash":"fa15942a-033a-4f4e-87cd-f79436a95575"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f2a4","name":"Irene","lastName":"Wåhlström","orcidId":"0000-0001-8735-268X","documentHash":"583a1540-93f8-47f4-a061-eb25ce1cd91d"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f2a3","name":"Adam","lastName":"Ulfsbo","documentHash":"7093151e-3e5c-4d9c-b598-5c0234cb2a2e"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f2a2","name":"Igor","lastName":"Semiletov","documentHash":"ae3d5cda-2d76-4627-b591-9b0d1a8194ec"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f2a0","name":"Younjoo J.","lastName":"Lee","orcidId":"0000-0002-2869-9680","documentHash":"72725f4d-0197-46e6-a226-c5d4b6ae4f0f"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f29f","name":"Sara","lastName":"Jutterström","documentHash":"798ff539-215d-473a-870f-1e7f47ea3914"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f29e","name":"Martin","lastName":"Jakobsson","orcidId":"0000-0002-9033-3559","documentHash":"3381fc7a-fe18-4c98-8259-9240f507726b"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f29d","name":"Göran","lastName":"Björk","documentHash":"0804609b-9045-4c81-9dc1-b480f1442d19"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f29c","name":"Wieslaw","lastName":"Maslowski","orcidId":"0000-0002-5790-9229","documentHash":"ee1d47d6-7f49-4d8f-bff2-f11068c7c8dc"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f29b","name":"Karen M.","lastName":"Assmann","orcidId":"0000-0002-2884-0365","documentHash":"61cdd08f-c500-4aef-a7ca-82886758e222"},{"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f29a","name":"Jaclyn","lastName":"Clement Kinney","documentHash":"27590703-cdf4-4a0a-a96c-741ca4422f83"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6531","name":"Robert","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"2D5DB9D57FC7F36F61EC129D9952718B8EE760677732DD55A275E92756962D368291051F6920872AC1B25967C13152ED107489FCB8248776FDD5045A6623150F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8698-0799","documentHash":"5a7dc855-7273-4918-89fd-9450b6dfc8de"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"622736482467f06c1764f298","doi":"10.5194/os-18-29-2022","publicUri":"https://os.copernicus.org/articles/18/29/2022/os-18-29-2022.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"On the circulation, water mass distribution, and nutrient concentrations of the western Chukchi Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Substantial amounts of nutrients and carbon enter the Arctic Ocean from the Pacific Ocean through the Bering Strait, distributed over three main pathways. Water with low salinities and nutrient concentrations takes an eastern route along the Alaskan coast, as Alaskan Coastal Water. A central pathway exhibits intermediate salinity and nutrient concentrations, while the most nutrient-rich water enters the Bering Strait on its western side. Towards the Arctic Ocean, the flow of these water masses is subject to strong topographic steering within the Chukchi Sea with volume transport modulated by the wind field. In this contribution, we use data from several sections crossing Herald Canyon collected in 2008 and 2014 together with numerical modelling to investigate the circulation and transport in the western part of the Chukchi Sea. We find that a substantial fraction of water from the Chukchi Sea enters the East Siberian Sea south of Wrangel Island and circulates in an anticyclonic direction around the island. This water then contributes to the high-nutrient waters of Herald Canyon. The bottom of the canyon has the highest nutrient concentrations, likely as a result of addition from the degradation of organic matter at the sediment surface in the East Siberian Sea. The flux of nutrients (nitrate, phosphate, and silicate) and dissolved inorganic carbon in Bering Summer Water and Winter Water is computed by combining hydrographic and nutrient observations with geostrophic transport referenced to lowered acoustic Doppler current profiler (LADCP) and surface drift data. Even if there are some general similarities between the years, there are differences in both the temperature–salinity and nutrient characteristics. To assess these differences, and also to get a wider temporal and spatial view, numerical modelling results are applied. According to model results, high-frequency variability dominates the flow in Herald Canyon. This leads us to conclude that this region needs to be monitored over a longer time frame to deduce the temporal variability and potential trends."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6531"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"29-49","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622736482467f06c1764f29a","622736482467f06c1764f29b","622736482467f06c1764f29c","622736482467f06c1764f29d","622736482467f06c1764f29e","622736482467f06c1764f29f","622736482467f06c1764f2a0","5e709347878c28a0473a6531","622736482467f06c1764f2a2","622736482467f06c1764f2a3","622736482467f06c1764f2a4","622736482467f06c1764f2a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c4","mniswId":"15346","title":"Ocean Science","issn":"1812-0784","eissn":"1812-0792","documentHash":"dd653668-e554-422b-a610-6ebf954eb164"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058192503"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7da","name":"Loïc N.","lastName":"Michel","orcidId":"0000-0003-0988-7050","documentHash":"b69535ec-8d73-4702-b506-b57123e7788b"},{"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7d9","name":"Anton","lastName":"Van de Putte","orcidId":"0000-0003-1336-5554","documentHash":"0b4933d4-b5aa-441c-8e54-f8294555d0f4"},{"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7d8","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Saucède","orcidId":"0000-0001-6056-4447","documentHash":"0821e453-134a-4f9c-80b6-aafcf5361c6a"},{"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7d7","name":"Gilles","lastName":"Lepoint","orcidId":"0000-0003-4375-0357","documentHash":"610d856d-8d68-4518-913a-384620b3984f"},{"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7d5","name":"Quentin","lastName":"Jossart","orcidId":"0000-0002-2280-243X","documentHash":"01a8dc00-4d9f-4bff-8d43-3360b8d7a531"},{"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7d4","name":"Marc","lastName":"Eléaume","orcidId":"0000-0003-1999-1177","documentHash":"5c284432-88ba-40b6-b2a8-2bc79b7d6148"},{"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7d3","name":"Bruno","lastName":"Danis","orcidId":"0000-0002-9037-7623","documentHash":"b2c884d8-6916-421d-ba45-34c049ef6a01"},{"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7d1","name":"Baptiste","lastName":"Le Bourg","orcidId":"0000-0002-1455-2020","documentHash":"954c34d0-0e0f-402b-b8ba-dad6c59ff06a"},{"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7d0","name":"Camille","lastName":"Moreau","orcidId":"0000-0002-0981-7442","documentHash":"a05217f4-dca8-4ecc-b893-f14e6157a128"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"objectId":"622869132467f0086c9bc7ce","doi":"10.1002/ecy.3611","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecy.3611","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Trophic markers and biometric measurements in Southern Ocean sea stars (1985–2017)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sea stars (Echinodermata: Asteroidea) are a key component of Southern Ocean benthos, with 16% of the known sea star species living there. In temperate marine environments, sea stars commonly play an important role in food webs, acting as keystone species. However, trophic ecology and functional role of Southern Ocean sea stars are still poorly known, notably due to the scarcity of large-scale studies. Here, we report 24,332 trophic marker (stable isotopes and elemental contents of C, N, and S of tegument and/or tube feet) and biometric (arm length, disk radius, arm to disk ratio) measurements in 2,456 specimens of sea stars. Samples were collected between 12 January 1985 and 8 October 2017 in numerous locations along the Antarctic littoral and subantarctic islands. The spatial scope of the data set covers a significant portion of the Southern Ocean (47.717° S to 86.273° S; 127.767° W to 162.201° E; depth, 6–5,338 m). The data set contains 133 distinct taxa, including 72 currently accepted species spanning 51 genera, 20 families, and multiple feeding guilds/functional groups (suspension feeders, sediment feeders, omnivores, predators of mobile or sessile prey). For 505 specimens, mitochondrial CO1 genes were sequenced to confirm and/or refine taxonomic identifications, and those sequences are already publicly available through the Barcode of Life Data System.

Climate change has amplified warming and intensified extreme events, in both the ocean and the atmosphere, with severe implications for the marine environment. Here, we present our long-term (1999–2020) hydrographic observations from the shelf south-west of Spitsbergen, focusing on the extent of Atlantic and Arctic waters, and we examine their impact on the water masses in Hornsund fjord. Our results show an 8% y−1 increase of the Atlantic Water volume fraction on the shelf during the period 1999–2020, especially noticeable in the last decade. Although this does not imply a significant increase in the amount of waters of the Atlantic origin in the fjord, the greater role of Atlantic Water is attributed to changes in water properties (volume and temperature) of the upper water layer in Hornsund. The strong controlling effect of Arctic Water, transported by the Spitsbergen Polar Current, on the salinity of the fjord surface and intermediate layers is helping to preserve the Arctic character of Hornsund. Nevertheless, ongoing Atlantification of the Nordic and Barents Seas may reduce supply of Arctic Water, thereby diminishing the role of the Spitsbergen Polar Current as the agent mitigating the impact of Atlantic Water on the west Spitsbergen fjords. In the future, this may contribute to the disappearance of the gradation in hydrographic conditions currently observed in the fjords along the west coast of Spitsbergen."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6556","5e709347878c28a0473a6525","5e70943f878c28a0473b8d4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"200","pagesFromTo":"102714","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8d4d","5e709347878c28a0473a6556","5e709347878c28a0473a6525"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"4bc3bbad-0ed4-4dfe-8f62-93517ff00731"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62272fe22467f06c1764a4db","year":"2022","volume":"200","documentHash":"f2a133d4-2c63-4491-9e4a-fbd0d4d1c7d0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Atlantification","Svalbard","West Spitsbergen Shelf","Polar Front","Hornsund","Water masses","Hydrography"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058193203"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62d511ba4097074b28a6edf1","name":"M.

The\ndistribution of Mytilus mussels is influenced by a number of benthic and pelagic environmental variables (e.g., substratum\ntype and availability, water movement, phytoplankton production, physical disturbance) as well as interactions between\nthese variables. Because of its broad tolerance of environmental variation the Mediterranean species, Mytilus galloprovin-\ncialis, has the greatest ability of all blue mussels to colonise new geographic regions. Understanding how population genetic\nvariation is related to, or caused by, environmental variation is important but has long been a challenge. The present study\nexamined the genetic differentiation of native populations of M. galloprovincialis throughout its entire geographic range in\nthe Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov using 53 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP loci). Mussels,\nin total 1004 individuals collected from 36 locations, were genotyped and combined with existing SNP data for mussels\nfrom 11 reference sites. Pairwise comparisons of FST values, correspondence analysis (CA) and STRUCTURE analysis all\nrevealed four groups of populations: the Atlantic Ocean; the western Mediterranean; the Aegean Sea; and the Azov, Black\nand Marmara Seas. One population – from Algeria (Oran West) – was intermediate between the two main groups of the\nMediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Seascape genetic analyses using GLM and DistLM analyses were employed to test\nsite-specific genetic variation as a function of 13 environmental variables. The GLM identified five environmental variables\nthat explained variation in site-specific FST values, whilst in the DistLM best-fit model only four were significant. These\nanalyses suggest that a complex mix of environmental variables contribute to explaining genetic variation of M. gallopro-\nvincialis populations within the Mediterranean Sea, which most likely reflects the complex geological history of formation,\nisolation and reconnection among the regional sub-basins of the Sea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6562","5e709347878c28a0473a654e","5e709347878c28a0473a6509","60c2fd4c9543c7233654353d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"89","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"755-784","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6509","5e709347878c28a0473a6562","60c2fd4c9543c7233654353d","62d511b94097074b28a6ede4","62d511b94097074b28a6ede5","62d511b94097074b28a6ede6","62d511b94097074b28a6ede7","5e709347878c28a0473a654e","62d511b94097074b28a6ede9","62d511b94097074b28a6edea","62d511b94097074b28a6edeb","62d511b94097074b28a6edec","62d511b94097074b28a6eded","62d511b94097074b28a6edee","62d511b94097074b28a6edef","62d511b94097074b28a6edf0","62d511ba4097074b28a6edf1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c115","mniswId":"6355","title":"European Zoological Journal","issn":"2475-0263","eissn":"2475-0263","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7147f04e-dbb7-46dc-b15b-03d013be99e8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biogeography","single nucleotide polymorphism","seascape genetics","geological formation","isolation and reconnection"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058203769"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"631f21824097075c0bbb3ace","name":"Maria","lastName":"Holzmann","documentHash":"af3abbdb-da63-4e14-9fc3-61584ea8535d"},{"objectId":"631f21824097075c0bbb3acd","name":"Andrew J.","lastName":"Gooday","documentHash":"6e69286f-749d-46d5-a2d9-7f7f4666d109"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2cac","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Majewski","uuid":"6A9A1F51F8D6B8BFF70183E8E7FC79109556E1C2325D88724491707987802B0DCFD7F637794C637E5E5E17B69988332FB7EB7D343C641A5B0886434601AB0714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5407-1782","documentHash":"852d65bf-f2be-49f4-a926-9e5ddebce95b"}],"objectId":"631f21824097075c0bbb3acc","doi":"10.1007/s00300-022-03017-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-022-03017-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"New species of Gromia (Protista, Rhizaria) from South Georgia and the Falkland Islands","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Testate protists in the genus Gromia (‘gromiids’, supergroup Rhizaria) are common and diverse in marine settings. However, their ecological significance is not well understood, partly because they remain largely undescribed with most records being of the type species, G. oviformis. To enhance our knowledge of gromiid biodiversity, we use morphological and genetic data to describe four new species with tests of different shapes from sublittoral depths (21–136 m) in South Georgia fjords: G. pashukae (ovate), G. landrethi (spherical), G. amygdaliformis (almond-shaped), and G. saoirsei (elongate), maximum lengths 3.4, 2.5, 1.4 and 4.5 mm, respectively. We also describe two smaller (~1 mm) gromiid species from intertidal sites on the Falkland Islands: G. cedhageni (ovate test with finely granular, orange-coloured contents), and Gromia psammophila (subrectangular test with numerous small mineral grains embedded in pale, finely granular material). Gromia landrethi is also represented by DNA sequences from specimens collected in Ushuaia (Argentina) and G. psammophila by sequenced specimens from southern Chilean fjords, but the other species are known only from localities in South Georgia or the Falkland Islands. Analysis of partial SSU rRNA genes confirms the presence of these six new species, as well as an undescribed species represented by a clade of three sequences branching separately. Our results increase the number of described gromiid species from 10 to 16, and underline the importance of these poorly known relatives of the foraminifera in higher-latitude intertidal and fjord settings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

In this region, between 2004 and 2008, a significant increase in surface water temperature was observed due to the transport of Atlantic water from lower latitudes and was defined as a Warm Water Anomaly (WWA). Effects of the WWA in the eastern Fram Strait were observed across the entire food web, from the pelagic to the deep seafloor. The material for our study was collected before (in 2000) and after the WWA (in 2010 and 2017) at station depths ranging from 203 m to 5561 m. Samples of macrofauna and surface sediments were collected with use of a box corer to analyze species composition and functional traits, and environmental characteristics in sediments. We explore the influence of environmental changes on the structure (species composition and diversity) and functioning (functional trait composition and diversity) of macrofauna communities. An increase of primary production in surface waters during and after the WWA was reflected in a higher food availability at the seafloor from shelf to abyssal depths. Warming induced environmental changes led to an increase of macrofauna density and taxonomic diversity at all water depths. Macrofauna species composition significantly changed after the WWA. At all study sites, macrofauna functional diversity increased after the warm period. Functional trait composition changed significantly along the bathymetric transect. Despite changes in the taxonomic composition, macrofauna communities at the shallowest stations showed high functional redundancy, i.e., trait composition remained unchanged after the WWA. At water depths below 1500 m, where functional redundancy was significantly lower, functional trait composition changed significantly after the WWA. Our results suggest that macrofauna communities on the shelves are more resistant to environmental changes compared to deep-sea assemblages in the eastern Fram Strait."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a653a","5e709347878c28a0473a651e","5e709469878c28a0473bc622"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","uid":"b6NUXJH6kJYzzJvxqM0-8WA","uuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","name":"Morski Instytut Rybacki - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709482878c28a0473beb78"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","parentUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","rootUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"144","pagesFromTo":"109464","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709469878c28a0473bc622","5e709482878c28a0473beb78","5e709347878c28a0473a653a","632acb3840970732c4adfe49","5e709347878c28a0473a651e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779f6","mniswId":"5322","title":"Ecological Indicators","issn":"1470-160X","eissn":"1470-160X","documentHash":"4932dd42-cdd5-4ab4-89e3-eaea9fbdb543"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632acb3840970732c4adfe47","year":"2022","volume":"144","documentHash":"9b12b10e-a08e-4de3-9495-46de55bd31cf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Functional traits","Deep-sea","Macrofauna","HAUSGARTEN","Arctic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058236052"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"627e5a974097070501c61a0e","name":"Marta","lastName":"Szczepanek","documentHash":"63f2b1a5-d41a-4705-94c8-a958268df015"},{"objectId":"627e5a974097070501c61a0d","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Borawska","documentHash":"161cd6cf-835e-4b73-9032-994b4b7e31ec"},{"objectId":"5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","name":"Marc","lastName":"Silberberger","uuid":"E363DD7660B6F1967F260E77F0DEF03CA3C92DBDD2009A5DBC438FB3DAEB66FD9BD2F93626269E3F1CFEEB33857F9B6DB8B35FB96FCEC7ADE22AD4C7FDCB76B5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8819-4388","documentHash":"5c5d0ad5-b173-4b3e-82f6-be9607003a7e"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6546","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kędra","uuid":"B950AFC0394B7FA11EB92F7D86E8B739E8F8E7879A82119B50736842491ECD0E305659B79802EAF50951C7A11F3F4453F898F95EE3550F2986DCF421440D2324","orcidId":"0000-0002-2223-5850","documentHash":"dc1fef89-bd48-43c8-8077-d9cff1028c90"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739941d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Koziorowska-Makuch","uuid":"3509723B3C9ACF6AC999AADF8F9DFFCBC59EBD1303980F82ED6C7F4BD7719E1581D1822C26EAABF3F62D27DEB38E556101B6169DCDBBF6E954F2721AB7FCCE40","orcidId":"0000-0002-9111-9597","documentHash":"f1a7632d-a947-4305-b1e3-6d63b76e893b"}],"objectId":"627e5a974097070501c61a09","doi":"10.1007/s12237-022-01074-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12237-022-01074-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Disentangling the Drivers of Benthic Oxygen and Dissolved Carbon Fluxes in the Coastal Zone of the Southern Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Benthic fluxes of oxygen and carbon in coastal zones are poorly resolved in mechanistic models due to the lack of understanding of the diverse interactions among the physical, chemical, and biological drivers of biogeochemical fluxes. To inform modelling efforts we used ex-situ incubation experiments to identify spatial and seasonal patterns of oxygen and dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC and DOC) fluxes in the coastal southern Baltic Sea. We used boosted regression trees to identify important drivers of the studied fluxes. Our results demonstrate that benthic communities, in addition to sediment parameters, played a dominant role in shaping oxygen and DIC fluxes, while neither benthic community, environment, season, nor sampling location could account for the highly variable DOC fluxes. DIC fluxes were partly decoupled from oxygen fluxes, since carbonate dissolution, anaerobic respiration, and submarine groundwater discharge affected DIC fluxes in the study region.

However, seagrass habitats are being degraded globally due to modification of coastline, terrestrial inputs, and climate change. While the effects of seagrass meadows vegetation density on associated macrofauna standing stocks and taxonomic richness have been widely investigated, the relationships with functional diversity aspects remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate if macrofauna standing stocks and richness indicators (both taxonomic and functional) are related to the habitat-builders presence and structural characteristics (density, biomass, diversity) in temperate Zostera marina Linnaeus, 1753 meadows (Baltic Sea). Relationships between faunal (density, biomass, species and functional trait composition and diversity), vegetation and sediment indicators were tested based on materials collected by scuba divers. Macrofauna density (ranging from 587.6 ± 188.2 to 4514.1 ± 977.8 ind. 0.1 m−2), biomass (ranging from 43.1 ± 28.3 to 13.6 ± 30.8 g 0.1 m−2) and species richness (ranging from 7 ± 1.4 to 20 ± 1.4) responded positively to seagrass presence regardless of meadows characteristics. Functional trait richness ranged from 203.7 ± 64.3 to 44.7 ± 41.1 and was enhanced only in presence of the greatest macrophyte diversity. Therefore, it is the diversity of meadows that boosts the functional richness of associated fauna. This implies that 1) monospecies seagrass meadows do not necessarily provide a higher number of functions than neighboring bare sediments in systems with low diversity such as Baltic Sea, 2) both taxonomic and functional indicators should be used to describe macrofauna communities. This result is an important message for conservation planning for systems with low diversity, as restoration of at least a few macrophytes species not only the dominant seagrass species could be considered to secure greater taxonomic and functional richness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a651e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"144","pagesFromTo":"109512","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633a91374097076a063b7ef9","5e709347878c28a0473a651e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779f6","mniswId":"5322","title":"Ecological Indicators","issn":"1470-160X","eissn":"1470-160X","documentHash":"807f288a-7088-4fdc-9c91-78a88af56bcf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632acb3840970732c4adfe47","year":"2022","volume":"144","documentHash":"9b12b10e-a08e-4de3-9495-46de55bd31cf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biodiversity indicators","Ecosystem engineers","Functional diversity","Eelgrass"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058246971"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633bedbd4097074f734e2b15","name":"Vladislav Y.","lastName":"Miamin","documentHash":"f557fea9-181c-4845-8ac7-069a44d599a7"},{"objectId":"633bedbd4097074f734e2b14","name":"Yury H.","lastName":"Hihiniak","documentHash":"81c1f6f7-7601-4d0b-b28d-d942f42a723c"},{"objectId":"60debfdd9543c72336544659","name":"Dzmitry","lastName":"Lukashanets","uuid":"3F71DBD7AE3A317E255A60D5D776FAF5FE25F3B31438E28E9192FCCC58E00C51CF2E6073A6A35D69A47962EAD949797B3E495BBAFFEF72FC42E652DE2D0875F6","documentHash":"6570d212-c655-4e40-a930-b82d59739fb7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-06-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"633bedbd4097074f734e2b10","doi":"10.33265/polar.v41.7781","publicUri":"https://polarresearch.net/index.php/polar/article/download/7781/14704","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Extremely high abundances of Prasiola crispa-associated micrometazoans in East Antarctica","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To elucidate poorly known aspects of the microscopic metazoan distribution in ice-free parts of the Antarctic, we examined samples of the multicellular terrestrial alga Prasiola crispa, collected over the last decade in different parts of continental East Antarctica and Haswell Island. We found that the micrometazoans inhabiting the algae consist of remarkably abundant bdelloid rotifers (subclass Bdelloidea), followed by tardigrades. We did not find nematodes. The rotifer assemblages were characterized by low diversity (only six species). Nevertheless, rotifer densities were extremely high: mean densities ranged from 75 to 3030 individuals per 100 mg of the dry sample weight and the maximum value numbered in excess of 8000 per 100 mg of the dry sample weight. These data show that terrestrial algae, along with mosses, are a very attractive habitat for rotifers and tardigrades in the Antarctic. The statistical analysis showed a lack of correlations between rotifer and tardigrade densities and nutrients (N, C, P, K and Na). Our findings are consistent with the patchy distribution of terrestrial micrometazoans in the Antarctic that has previously been found."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60debfdd9543c72336544659"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"7781","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60debfdd9543c72336544659","633bedbd4097074f734e2b14","633bedbd4097074f734e2b15"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792f0","mniswId":"16271","title":"Polar Research","issn":"0800-0395","eissn":"1751-8369","documentHash":"df95bd97-4625-4227-ab93-93af2ac83426"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633bedbd4097074f734e2b12","year":"2022","volume":"41","documentHash":"9b242274-e8e6-4eaa-ab1b-f2058640230e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bdelloids","rotifers","tardigrades","algae","nematodes","Antarctic oases"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058247212"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633bfe6b4097074f734f8d46","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Konwent","documentHash":"fe4d8050-c259-44aa-97e7-34da4b4381d1"},{"objectId":"633bfe6b4097074f734f8d45","name":"Paula Sancho","lastName":"Martinez","documentHash":"f126de79-d568-48a5-9c88-437ec528574a"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6541","name":"Lech","lastName":"Kotwicki","uuid":"CEECA66DAF2E358E21F839F30352004FB3521D54E17236B1E8957B809DE11A2D2B30D28C4F68C7808E1907665A1D43B8C3716FA31D8E6A80279E7C2A427E9E30","orcidId":"0000-0001-5876-5696","documentHash":"f96c8d28-5ab4-4378-a9cd-4c6e9afc9155"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739940b","name":"Kajetan","lastName":"Deja","uuid":"9D662B5DB9D9989CA2118EDEC7988EF7D4D3980D2C609A38B7C9587CFC9D6D5B787097E27010CA8550182A7210D7D7626DAA6E7FFF1C7E0FD28C9FB88D4072BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6707-3883","documentHash":"2fb48e59-8c28-4aaa-9364-256c74d01e4d"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399408","name":"MIKOŁAJ","lastName":"MAZURKIEWICZ","uuid":"02A0720C4DB7D495D30D78C17E89284B4CB30C34D8A129A2DADEDC0B48677C1A39962BA95793418B1B32013B98B02B5CFCC63435E3140FB2F2A0E4C6CAD0CD35","orcidId":"0000-0001-5253-1020","documentHash":"d6883f1b-48e0-4c8a-ac5c-bf019f80fd73"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-05","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"633bfe6b4097074f734f8d44","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2022.07.004","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S007832342200080X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Plastic contamination of sandy beaches along the southern Baltic – a one season field survey results","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The subject of this study was microplastics (>32 µm), large micro-/macroplastics (>2 mm) and plastic litter (visible by naked eye) contamination on sandy beaches and in coastal waters along the Polish coast of the Baltic Sea. Microplastics were studied with particular attention, with simultaneous observations in the water and across the beach. Other data was intended to serve as a background and as possible sources of microplastics. Most of the microplastics found were fibers <1 mm long, with blue fibers dominating, followed by transparent, red and green ones, both in sand and water samples. The concentration of microplastics on the beach sand ranged from 118 to 1382 pieces kg−1, while in coastal waters from 0.61 to 2.76 pieces dm−3. As for large micro-/macroplastics and plastic litter, there was no dominant litter along the coast. The amount of large micro-/macroplastics ranged from 2 to 124 pieces m−2 (or from 0.13 to 44.30 g m−2). Regarding plastic litter, on average between 0.03 and 6.15 litter debris m−2 were found (or from 0.007 to 4.600 g m−2). The study confirms that plastic pollution of the Polish coastal zone is a significant problem comparable with both the rest of the Baltic Sea and other seas and oceans. Similar color-based composition of microplastics among all studied sites suggests that they may have a common source, while the contamination of large micro-/macroplastics and plastic litter (both amount of particles and their composition) along the Polish coast is highly site-specific and may be influenced by various local factors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a04739940b","5e709347878c28a0473a6541","5e709347878c28a0473a6500","5e70929e878c28a047399408"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"769-780","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a047399408","633bfe6b4097074f734f8d45","633bfe6b4097074f734f8d46","5e70929e878c28a04739940b","5e709347878c28a0473a6541","5e709347878c28a0473a6500"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633bfc984097074f734f632c","year":"2022","volume":"64","number":"4","documentHash":"ef441991-cbf5-4f51-afbf-b2ad30fcdce4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Microplastic","Marine litter","Sources","Coastal zone","Baltic Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058247372"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"632ac01340970732c4acca92","name":"Anthony","lastName":"Craig","documentHash":"be524661-4474-419c-a894-d3b5852c90eb"},{"objectId":"632ac01340970732c4acca91","name":"Karen","lastName":"Frey","documentHash":"0f077904-350a-43ff-b5fa-35116b413244"},{"objectId":"632ac01340970732c4acca90","name":"Christina","lastName":"Goethel","documentHash":"ff3d6c13-8d93-43bd-b80b-d4f7b4968126"},{"objectId":"632ac01340970732c4acca8f","name":"Younjoo J.","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"833e9334-82c5-48ec-8438-dbefdfd1f9d4"},{"objectId":"632ac01340970732c4acca8e","name":"Wieslaw","lastName":"Maslowski","documentHash":"8ec55957-4a7f-4798-8f3e-20a8d3e57c43"},{"objectId":"632ac01340970732c4acca8d","name":"Jaclyn","lastName":"Clement Kinney","documentHash":"4be35097-d927-48ab-b3dc-44742ac3addb"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6531","name":"Robert","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"2D5DB9D57FC7F36F61EC129D9952718B8EE760677732DD55A275E92756962D368291051F6920872AC1B25967C13152ED107489FCB8248776FDD5045A6623150F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8698-0799","documentHash":"5a7dc855-7273-4918-89fd-9450b6dfc8de"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"632ac01340970732c4acca8c","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0266180","publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266180","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"On the variability of the Bering Sea Cold Pool and implications for the biophysical environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Bering Sea experiences a seasonal sea ice cover, which is important to the biophysical environment found there. A pool of cold bottom water (<2°C) is formed on the shelf each winter as a result of cooling and vertical mixing due to brine rejection during the predominately local sea ice growth. The extent and distribution of this Cold Pool (CP) is largely controlled by the winter extent of sea ice in the Bering Sea, which can vary considerably and recently has been much lower than average. The cold bottom water of the CP is important for food security because it delineates the boundary between arctic and subarctic demersal fish species. A northward retreat of the CP will likely be associated with migration of subarctic species toward the Chukchi Sea. We use the fully-coupled Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) to examine variability of the extent and distribution of the CP and its relation to change in the sea ice cover in the Bering Sea during the period 1980–2018. RASM results confirm the direct correlation between the extent of sea ice and the CP and show a smaller CP as a consequence of realistically simulated recent declines of the sea ice cover in the Bering Sea. In fact, the area of the CP was found to be only 31% of the long-term mean in July of 2018. In addition, we also find that a low ice year is followed by a later diatom bloom, while a heavy ice year is followed by an early diatom bloom. Finally, the RASM probabilistic intra-annual forecast capability is reviewed, based on 31-member ensembles for 2019–2021, for its potential use for prediction of the winter sea ice cover and the subsequent summer CP area in the Bering Sea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6531"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"e0266180","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["632ac01340970732c4acca8d","632ac01340970732c4acca8e","5e709347878c28a0473a6531","632ac01340970732c4acca8f","632ac01340970732c4acca90","632ac01340970732c4acca91","632ac01340970732c4acca92"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","eissn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"fcfcc06e-e7b2-4412-a89f-df94326b9f49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62556eec2467f052bcab125d","year":"2022","volume":"17","number":"4","documentHash":"13308194-f933-416b-8a24-b0075ae39a0b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058258085"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6295b4f44097072fefb744fd","name":"P.

However, much of our knowledge about animal microbiomes comes from two deeply studied groups: vertebrates and arthropods. To understand interactions on a broader scale of diversity, we characterized the bacterial microbiomes of close to 1,000 microscopic marine invertebrates from 21 phyla, spanning most of the remaining tree of metazoans. Samples were collected from five temperate and tropical locations covering three marine habitats (sediment, water column and intertidal macroalgae) and bacterial microbiomes were characterized using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Our data show that, despite their size, these animals harbour bacterial communities that differ from those in the surrounding environment. Distantly related but coexisting invertebrates tend to share many of the same bacteria, suggesting that guilds of microorganisms preferentially associated with animals, but not tied to any specific host lineage, are the main drivers of the ecological relationship. Host identity is a minor factor shaping these microbiomes, which do not show the same correlation with host phylogeny, or ‘phylosymbiosis’, observed in many large animals. Hence, the current debate on the varying strength of phylosymbiosis within selected lineages should be reframed to account for the possibility that such a pattern might be the exception rather than the rule."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709481878c28a0473be9a6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6295b4f44097072fefb744ef","6295b4f44097072fefb744f0","6295b4f44097072fefb744f1","6295b4f44097072fefb744f2","6295b4f44097072fefb744f3","6295b4f44097072fefb744f4","5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","6295b4f44097072fefb744f6","6295b4f44097072fefb744f7","6295b4f44097072fefb744f8","6295b4f44097072fefb744f9","6295b4f44097072fefb744fa","6295b4f44097072fefb744fb","6295b4f44097072fefb744fc","6295b4f44097072fefb744fd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5b878c28514547cd62","mniswId":"14827","title":"Nature Microbiology","issn":"2058-5276","eissn":"2058-5276","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"c98ed79d-7c7c-4d1d-a94c-996d74a5b091"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6295b4f54097072fefb74500","year":"2022","documentHash":"e915ab84-99a0-42ab-bda7-fe261d091c59"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Coevolution","Microbial ecology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058258183"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63525509409707615cc83841","name":"Michal","lastName":"Kucera","documentHash":"695f4eb6-302c-4ae9-b490-ec72b33cd7ab"},{"objectId":"63525509409707615cc83840","name":"Tine L.","lastName":"Rasmussen","documentHash":"faf291db-2468-4683-b8de-1c645549371e"},{"objectId":"63525509409707615cc8383f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Zamelczyk","documentHash":"3edf5de6-6d26-4841-b943-c7de77ea57b7"},{"objectId":"63525509409707615cc8383e","name":"Kirstin","lastName":"Werner","documentHash":"f1953915-e4f0-4da1-8108-0b2dedad5bb1"},{"objectId":"615bb8a875234017e04eda8d","name":"Mattia","lastName":"Greco","uuid":"476734BF5B11C961C32223CB7E068E727168B16E760C3E65EA2F3EC44B69129BF9B0032DEB1211FF34D5CFC2FCB55E40881DD6805DEFB2513B12C9EE93082646","documentHash":"120e02af-f940-4384-9c8e-2f3addeb7ff7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-16","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63525509409707615cc8383c","doi":"10.1111/gcb.16037","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.16037","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Decadal trend of plankton community change and habitat shoaling in the Arctic gateway recorded by planktonic foraminifera","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Fram Strait plays a crucial role in regulating the heat and sea-ice dynamics in the Arctic. In response to the ongoing global warming, the marine biota of this Arctic gateway is experiencing significant changes with increasing advection of Atlantic species. The footprint of this ‘Atlantification’ has been identified in isolated observations across the plankton community, but a systematic, multi-decadal perspective on how regional climate change facilitates the invasion of Atlantic species and affects the ecology of the resident species is lacking. Here we evaluate a series of 51 depth-resolved plankton profiles collected in the Fram Strait during seven surveys between 1985 and 2015, using planktonic foraminifera as a proxy for changes in both the pelagic community composition and species vertical habitat depth. The time series reveals a progressive shift towards more Atlantic species, occurring independently of changes in local environmental conditions. We conclude that this trend is reflecting higher production of the Atlantic species in the Nordic Seas, from where they are advected into the Fram Strait. At the same time, we observe the ongoing extensive sea-ice export from the Arctic and associated cooling-induced decline in density and habitat shoaling of the subpolar Turborotalita quinqueloba, whereas the resident Neogloboquadrina pachyderma persists. As a result, the planktonic foraminiferal community and vertical structure in the Fram Strait shift to a new state, driven by both remote forcing of the Atlantic invaders and local climatic changes acting on the resident species. The strong summer export of Arctic sea ice has so far buffered larger plankton transformation. We predict that if the sea-ice export will decrease, the Arctic gateway will experience rapid restructuring of the pelagic community, even in the absence of further warming. Such a large change in the gateway region will likely propagate into the Arctic proper."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["615bb8a875234017e04eda8d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1798-1808","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["615bb8a875234017e04eda8d","63525509409707615cc8383e","63525509409707615cc8383f","63525509409707615cc83840","63525509409707615cc83841"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e4f","mniswId":"7245","title":"GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","issn":"1354-1013","eissn":"1365-2486","documentHash":"5c9da737-f24b-45cc-8cf7-b567a143645c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63525509409707615cc8383d","year":"2021","volume":"28","number":"5","documentHash":"ac749a32-8909-4e29-acf5-7effc504ab3e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic","Atlantification","climate change","foraminifera","Fram Strait","marine calcifiers","plankton"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261232"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63341b8d4097070fbdd5b727","name":"Friederike","lastName":"Prowe","documentHash":"402f2996-a34d-4ae0-82ea-c1a53239a21a"},{"objectId":"63341b8d4097070fbdd5b726","name":"Selina","lastName":"Våge","documentHash":"b0fc9fa9-7d2a-42b6-b779-aea5d1842520"},{"objectId":"63341b8d4097070fbdd5b725","name":"S.

In oceanic food webs, the plankton compartment encompasses by far most of the biomass and diversity. Therefore, capturing plankton diversity is paramount for marine ecosystem modelling. In recent years, many models have been developed, each representing different aspects of plankton diversity, but a systematic comparison remains lacking. Here we present established modelling approaches to study plankton ecology and diversity, discussing the limitations and strengths of each approach. We emphasize their different spatial and temporal resolutions and consider the potential of these approaches as tools to address societal challenges. Finally, we make suggestions as to how better integration of field and experimental data with modelling could advance understanding of both plankton biodiversity specifically and more broadly the

Four species have so far been described from the tropical Pacific and the Caribbean Sea. We report here the first occurrence of Carterina from the Southeastern Levantine Shelf of the Mediterranean Sea. Based on molecular and morphological results, we describe Carterina labinea sp. nov., which is characterized by a trochospiral test with a conical, tapered spiral side and a concave umbilical side. The test is composed of elongate fusiform calcareous spicules. Tests have a mean diameter of 720 μm, which is twice the vertical height, and spicules vary in length and width from 112/15 μm to 73/14 μm. Our results show that the genus Carterina extends its distribution beyond tropical Seas and might be more widely distributed than previously thought. Moreover, the appearance of the new species in the study area suggests it is a new colonizer as continuous biomonitoring studies in the area show that it is absent in sediment samples taken before 2020. Our results highlight the importance of ongoing monitoring programs in high-risk basins such as the Levantine to gain more information about the biodiversity changes and improve environmental conservation of Eastern Mediterranean littoral areas progressively colonized by tropical species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"85","pagesFromTo":"125911","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63527815409707615cca3adc","63527815409707615cca3add","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bed","mniswId":"6257","title":"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY","doi":"","issn":"0932-4739","eissn":"0932-4739","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/european-journal-of-protistology","documentHash":"09f89973-ce44-4334-b88e-42889c6d4373"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63527815409707615cca3adb","year":"2022","volume":"85","documentHash":"3777e5d2-ed2d-49cc-9cc5-35728d5ab0c3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Foraminifera","New Carterina species","SSU rDNA sequences","First record","Southeastern","Levantine shelf"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261720"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"632da7544097073ab886579d","name":"K.","lastName":"Dmoch","documentHash":"056c03a2-b76c-4263-af17-b7092784a55e"},{"objectId":"632da7544097073ab886579c","name":"K.","lastName":"Jankowska","documentHash":"fc4e0ac3-791f-45e9-a22b-342995b9750f"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b2f","name":"Marta","lastName":"Głuchowska","uuid":"06CBE3D59DC14CBE09FB73635ADBB4E995D1982AA396A38790681F9254FD20FC302593539E220C6961F9191EC4DB193A0D6AFBBC024C04893983841970F8338C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3032-4925","documentHash":"550563d4-4df6-4803-a008-600c081f997e"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kwaśniewski","uuid":"8365CC02046923AD10F327E0A9DF80A2A87646DD41F10E1B4BA9B189ECBDAF4BC4DDB9C2AE001CE03926A8551D8319BB4076255C7C53DDF5522FBDA2313D5552","orcidId":"0000-0003-3104-0761","documentHash":"8b17d9b8-6501-443c-a119-2fcad7a66046"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655c","name":"Józef","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"E8901DD6BAD74E4F0A531BC69DC86134B02AC9BDAB17361AAFA79F2ED26ABBC473DFEDC614DF70B146B917A0E212BFD4740299FB5AB0C805A789195BA88BE5E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2344-0047","documentHash":"6a141822-0a06-4fc9-83c5-d08f585c8615"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6520","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Błachowiak-Samołyk","uuid":"8C6AD77D97DA3D9D5230CB20B5B200FB76893BFE72A48BE0BAB6068DBB7BD96049B3C885C6414B2EF04BBFB8AFD27AC9468868A23DB7A01FB8AEBEECC4EDAD0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8076-2168","documentHash":"5036109f-207f-446c-bac6-ec8dd36677f9"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"},{"objectId":"5e70932f878c28a0473a490c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Piwosz","uuid":"14475DCF5DE7D1E3315331537B3FBFD85ECF1484CA0955CFA345692EE2E6D30C749308EBFA2D02F0F9CE0A80A7B1D309809FB44AA113FA39E9B81324AC0A8DB4","orcidId":"0000-0002-3248-3364","documentHash":"3b7811fb-c4bc-4ed5-8aaa-a33035ed8601"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"632da7544097073ab8865799","doi":"10.33275/1727-7485.1.2022.690","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.33275/1727-7485.1.2022.690","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Arctic fjord during warming: Planktonic point of view","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The climate affects aquatic ecosystems worldwide, yet the most dramatic impact has been observed in Polar Regions. The presented study aimed to test the hypothesis that changes in biodiversity are linked to changes in the food web functioning under different temperature conditions, with large species dominant in cold waters and smaller species dominant in warmer waters. Two sites with contrasting hydrology were surveyed in summer 2005 in Hornsund (west Spitsbergen). The first site was located close to the fjord entrance and was strongly influenced by the Atlantic waters (WARM). The second was located deep inside the fjord, where the water is fresher and colder due to glacier meltwater runoff (COLD). Temperature, salinity and photosynthetic active radiation were measured, nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll a were analyzed. Plankton biota, including different fractions of zooplankton, phytoplankton and bacteria was collected and enumerated. The temperature differences were the most pronounced out of the abiotic parameters measured. In particular, the COLD site was characterized by lower water temperature and higher turbidity due to the influence of meltwater. Significant differences in the composition and the quantitative ratios of plankton biota were noted, with the most dramatic variation in the number of microplankton taxa and their biomass. The overall plankton biomass at the WARM site (91 mg C ⋅ m–3) was higher than that at the COLD site (71 mg C ⋅ m–3), as well as the primary production rates. Microplanktonic assemblages at the WARM site included twice as many taxa. The protists constituted more than half of the plankton biomass at the WARM site (53.2%), whereas their share at the COLD site was slightly higher (63.6%). The nanoplankton fraction was numerically dominant among the protists, whereas copepods were the main component of the zooplankton biomass. The differences in planktonic communities’ compositions observed between the two sites might have arisen due to the influence of turbid meltwater runoff, which eliminates larger, strictly autotrophic and decreases primary production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","5e709347878c28a0473a6500","5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","5e709411878c28a0473b5b2f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","uid":"b6NUXJH6kJYzzJvxqM0-8WA","uuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","name":"Morski Instytut Rybacki - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70932f878c28a0473a490c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","parentUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","rootUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"67-84","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c","5e709411878c28a0473b5b2f","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","5e70932f878c28a0473a490c","5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","632da7544097073ab886579c","632da7544097073ab886579d","5e709347878c28a0473a6500"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e717c9046e0fb0001cf9fb1","title":"Ukrainian Antarctic Journal","issn":"1727-7485","documentHash":"a364e9b5-e3d5-452e-9681-2cad566f6001"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632da7544097073ab886579a","year":"2022","volume":"20","number":"1(24)","documentHash":"66713f27-65d8-4b64-9029-872104966f68"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic fjord","bacteria","climate change","Hornsund","protists","zooplankton"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261967"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd7161","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Suaria","documentHash":"a4b1a304-5d00-470d-80e4-0a20b6804836"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd7160","name":"Stefania","lastName":"Piarulli","documentHash":"29ccc4c1-3666-4a6d-8584-f74ad3169e0c"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd715f","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Llopis Monferrer","documentHash":"93f14635-3f0c-453c-ac95-663d9746ec99"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd715e","name":"Cristina","lastName":"Galobart","documentHash":"d5731163-e651-4c26-9f65-632d0d85f754"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd715d","name":"Marcos","lastName":"Fontela","documentHash":"8542497a-e27f-488e-becd-444a6da58e2f"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd715c","name":"Timotej","lastName":"Turk Dermastia","documentHash":"5b660824-8deb-418e-b05b-a1ba043be3e8"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd715b","name":"Ivana","lastName":"Buselic","documentHash":"cdbd8984-f082-4115-a623-49cc1c843c79"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd715a","name":"María","lastName":"López-Acosta","documentHash":"e36724ba-a901-494d-8302-03ef29f1c226"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd7159","name":"Louise C","lastName":"Gammage","documentHash":"16d685c7-4cba-4099-b6a3-e9a9ae689df2"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd7158","name":"Alina M","lastName":"Wieczorek","documentHash":"c0ec204d-d2be-4cf3-88e4-816c80b50f1b"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd7157","name":"Eleanor","lastName":"Ford","documentHash":"97a35dd1-7a55-4747-b89d-cca1643edd9d"},{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd7156","name":"Amanda","lastName":"Schadeberg","documentHash":"b86c4017-069e-41b1-b492-737630e11415"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac2ba","name":"Marek","lastName":"Lubośny","uuid":"BCCE25C1AD2634686D73062F6CABB978C50DF6A1DACBF6FA375380C32D1FB59DB75034F7CCC1F1EEE78E019A5A811C7AA2370719C6D307748AF74BBBF4C89DF1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6370-8880","documentHash":"4d42ad1e-e518-42d0-804f-bf5e9ef51aa3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd7154","doi":"10.1093/icesjms/fsac167","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsac167/46342768/fsac167.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Productivity, pressure, and new perspectives: impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on marine early-career researchers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The worldwide disruption caused by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the activities of marine scientists working towards the goals of the UN Ocean Decade. As in other disciplines, marine early-career researchers (ECRs) are essential contributors to the development of novel and innovative science. Based on a survey of 322 of our peers, we show that the pandemic negatively impacted marine ECRs in ways that further exacerbate existing structural challenges such as social isolation, job insecurity, and short-term contracts, competitive funding, and work pressure. Furthermore, we find that the success and wellbeing of marine ECRs depends heavily on networking opportunities, gaining practical experience, collecting data, and producing publications, all of which were disrupted by the pandemic. Our analysis shows that those in the earliest stages of their careers feel most vulnerable to long-term career disadvantage as a result of the pandemic. This paper contributes to the empirical body of work about the impacts of the pandemic on marine science and offers recommendations on how marine ECRs should be supported to achieve the UN Ocean Decade’s goal of producing “the science we need for the ocean we want”."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac2ba"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633d4f35409707220fbd7156","633d4f35409707220fbd7157","633d4f35409707220fbd7158","633d4f35409707220fbd7159","633d4f35409707220fbd715a","633d4f35409707220fbd715b","633d4f35409707220fbd715c","633d4f35409707220fbd715d","633d4f35409707220fbd715e","633d4f35409707220fbd715f","5e709389878c28a0473ac2ba","633d4f35409707220fbd7160","633d4f35409707220fbd7161"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f93","mniswId":"7847","title":"ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE","issn":"1054-3139","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e4aeb6ac-1394-42c6-923c-4629f54c8563"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633d4f35409707220fbd7155","year":"2022","documentHash":"8afc4ae2-6d49-4059-bd3e-6f649b180aea"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["early career scientists","intersectional","institutional responses","marine science","reflexive science","SARS-CoV-2","UN Ocean Decade"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058268484"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"634eafe1409707350c33e282","name":"Martin V.","lastName":"Sørensen","documentHash":"81a5e307-8813-4516-b4a7-e4b8feebd31c"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"89E34998A7815703314F14609081D0B42B721BC6BC02334A524F1A72E99979BE1D2892A3F7AD68FC281490897050CAC6FC5A6472BC066A2DFADD377EF7948831","orcidId":"0000-0002-8175-575X","documentHash":"60624fd9-0ebc-49d7-8f66-5b468fb82647"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"634eafe1409707350c33e280","doi":"10.5852/ejt.2022.844.1949","publicUri":"https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt/article/download/1949/7875","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Echinoderes (Kinorhyncha: Cyclorhagida) from the Hikurangi Margin, New Zealand","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Limited data are available for the kinorhynch fauna from the Southern Hemisphere, with little or no data from New Zealand. Here, we provide a first comprehensive overview of the diversity of mud dragons, with an emphasis on species of Echinoderes from the continental slope of New Zealand, from a variety of habitats such as slopes, canyons and seamounts located in the Hikurangi Margin region. The study revealed fifteen species of Echinoderes. Of these, ten are described as new to science: E. aragorni sp. nov., E. blazeji sp. nov., E. dalzottoi sp. nov., E. frodoi sp. nov., E. galadrielae sp. nov., E. gandalfi sp. nov., E. landersi sp. nov., E. leduci sp. nov., E. legolasi sp. nov. and E. samwisei sp. nov. Moreover, Echinoderes juliae Sørensen et al., 2018, Echinoderes sp. aff. E. balerioni, Echinoderes sp. aff. E. galadrielae/beringiensis, Echinoderes sp. aff. E. lupherorum and Echinoderes sp. aff. E. unispinosus are reported in the investigated region. The most abundant among all was E. gandalfi sp. nov., but it was found only in canyons. Interestingly, the second most common species was E. juliae that was found at several stations in canyons, seamount and on the slope. This species is one of the deep-sea species originally found on the abyssal plain off Oregon and along the continental rise off California, Northeast Pacific, recorded in polymetallic nodules in the tropical eastern Pacific, and recently found on the abyssal plains off Chile, east of the Atacama Trench. These findings, together with records of Echinoderes sp. aff. E. lupherorum and Echinoderes sp. aff. E. unispinosus indicate that, despite their low dispersal abilities, kinorhynchs, similar to other meiofaunal species, may exhibit a wider distribution pattern than previously assumed. The number of recorded species and numerous new species show that New Zealand sediments not only are inhabited by a diverse kinorhynch fauna, but Echinoderes, the most speciose genus, still holds much to discover."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709481878c28a0473be9a6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"844","pagesFromTo":"1-108","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","634eafe1409707350c33e282"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bfe","mniswId":"6282","title":"European Journal of Taxonomy","doi":"","issn":"2118-9773","eissn":"","websiteLink":"https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt","documentHash":"573610df-5c98-4fd1-822d-b591179eb98f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"634eafe1409707350c33e281","year":"2022","volume":"844","documentHash":"b8bc3046-4781-4fa7-b7b1-4b149287f4c4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Echinoderidae","deep-sea canyons","kinorhynchs","meiofauna","seamounts","taxonomy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058275850"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63527190409707615cc9d7df","name":"Tine L.","lastName":"Rasmussen","documentHash":"6c8a39be-373b-4c61-ab7a-9f202d3fc666"},{"objectId":"63527190409707615cc9d7de","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Sommer","documentHash":"b5e63354-bfc1-4f99-8d69-ac05d8a14d39"},{"objectId":"63527190409707615cc9d7dd","name":"Tina","lastName":"Treude","documentHash":"e8797c98-910b-41dd-a220-6a2e7b080e41"},{"objectId":"63527190409707615cc9d7dc","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Sztybor","documentHash":"9f347f8d-afbf-4dbf-b4c5-cf32140c0977"},{"objectId":"63527190409707615cc9d7db","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Melaniuk","documentHash":"2328fd8a-0e4e-4ca9-8aad-4db5e670a16c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6526","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zajączkowski","uuid":"61768C4E190810A84AFC1067320A335E9317C35A01DD9975F8CEB8197E3D86D8F6A9ACECEE6D8E804AE2EBFC8A804CECDF21093A04A3A083FD4F8153BEAB0988","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-7359","documentHash":"aee5a47c-de7d-4323-8adc-7fe11d3cf4f0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63527190409707615cc9d7da","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2022.999902","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.999902/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Response of benthic foraminifera to environmental successions of cold seeps from Vestnesa Ridge, Svalbard: Implications for interpretations of paleo-seepage environments","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Fram Strait plays a crucial role in regulating the heat and sea- ice dynamics in the\nArctic. In response to the ongoing global warming, the marine biota of this Arctic\ngateway is experiencing significant changes with increasing advection of Atlantic spe-\ncies. The footprint of this ‘Atlantification’ has been identified in isolated observations\nacross the plankton community, but a systematic, multi-decadal perspective on how\nregional climate change facilitates the invasion of Atlantic species and affects the ecol-\nogy of the resident species is lacking. Here we evaluate a series of 51 depth-resolved\nplankton profiles collected in the Fram Strait during seven surveys between 1985\nand 2015, using planktonic foraminifera as a proxy for changes in both the pelagic\ncommunity composition and species vertical habitat depth. The time series reveals a\nprogressive shift towards more Atlantic species, occurring independently of changes\nin local environmental conditions. We conclude that this trend is reflecting higher pro-\nduction of the Atlantic species in the Nordic Seas, from where they are advected into\nthe Fram Strait. At the same time, we observe the ongoing extensive sea-ice export\nfrom the Arctic and associated cooling-induced decline in density and habitat shoal-\ning of the subpolar Turborotalita quinqueloba, whereas the resident Neogloboquadrina\npachyderma persists. As a result, the planktonic foraminiferal community and vertical\nstructure in the Fram Strait shift to a new state, driven by both remote forcing of the\nAtlantic invaders and local climatic changes acting on the resident species. The strong\nsummer export of Arctic sea ice has so far buffered larger plankton transformation.\nWe predict that if the sea-ice export will decrease, the Arctic gateway will experience\nrapid restructuring of the pelagic community, even in the absence of further warming.\nSuch a large change in the gateway region will likely propagate into the Arctic proper."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6526"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1798-1808","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63527190409707615cc9d7db","63527190409707615cc9d7dc","63527190409707615cc9d7dd","63527190409707615cc9d7de","5e709347878c28a0473a6526","63527190409707615cc9d7df"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a523b2467f06a1edbdb2f","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"17b56cb2-5e8f-41ce-a89d-d4b387701e78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic","Atlantification","climate change","foraminifera","Fram Strait","marine calcifiers","plankton"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058278923"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62b2f9f7409707737cf37a43","name":"Cristian","lastName":"Araneda","documentHash":"412ae759-4da2-41de-9fbc-9c0dd4966d67"},{"objectId":"62b2f9f7409707737cf37a42","name":"María Angélica","lastName":"Larraín","documentHash":"59f6ea2e-9c91-49ca-82ca-9e6b54d0706d"},{"objectId":"62b2f9f7409707737cf37a40","name":"Anna","lastName":"Prądzińska","documentHash":"38f2bfbd-50ca-430b-af6e-f9af157cae58"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6562","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zbawicka","uuid":"C666D80AAC8D5BA5D12E1984EB7EC27BCB09A2EC676A3578D85F558B3723D8FDDCBCBDD92633678834C40C72F59AA9D924C894649D751A5551B7A7521D23E0D0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5156-6184","documentHash":"7ee294a1-069f-4943-8e4c-2b395e31af83"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654e","name":"Anita","lastName":"Poćwierz-Kotus","uuid":"50A9955B8BE3B836A4350CBBC71112A8A4779B75954296C9C09BFA115C4E6F87F09BEEEF8C06C69A45A933E17020BCB977ECD37AE93C99604D081E4BE0829D68","orcidId":"0000-0001-6667-6175","documentHash":"ee21dc22-0ea5-4054-a198-dd57a5d56104"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6509","name":"Roman","lastName":"Wenne","uuid":"6B27626EE351F0B058A10F6D9998813E0246BF28019928840556C2DAD560443A19522E4725AEC8C4370B440DB05C8836A28167755ADA23BCC0BB4E0F56749387","orcidId":"0000-0001-6994-1181","documentHash":"258fed81-bcb5-46d4-b296-92de5d2e1d1a"}],"objectId":"62b2f9f7409707737cf37a3d","doi":"10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.738135","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0044848622002514?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Provenance of Mytilus food products in Europe using SNP genetic markers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mussels of the Mytilus genus or blue mussels are cultured extensively worldwide. According to FAO statistics in 2019, the main cultured species in order of annual production are M. chilensis, M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis. Due to their morphological similarity, blue mussels may be incorrectly assigned to the species leading to the occurrence of inconsistencies in the food labeling. Molecular markers in mono-locus or multi-locus approaches have often been used for species identification.\n\nThis paper aimed to assess the information about the species and geographical origin labelled on mussel products available in European stores and markets in 2011–2015 using a multi-locus approach based on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). A total of 491 Mytilus spp. individuals from 21 food samples purchased mainly in Italy, Spain, Poland and Germany, were genotyped using a 54 SNP panel. Most of the declared information on the labels of food products was consistent with the results obtained with genetic tools (85%). However in-complete information, such as missing commercial designation, scientific name, or geographic origin was found in 11 samples. Also, incorrect information about the species origin of a few samples of fresh mussels imported from other countries to the Mediterranean was observed in fishmongers' shops. The results consistently revealed a division of the European food samples into two species: M. edulis and M. galloprovincialis (Atlantic and Mediterranean forms). The presence of M. trossulus in the food samples was not observed. Our results confirm that traditionally used single molecular diagnostic markers can provide only preliminary information on the taxonomic status of Northern hemisphere mussels included in food products. A multi-locus approach based on a set of multiple SNPs is needed for correct label assessment. The results demonstrate that a reduced panel of 34 SNP loci can be widely used to confirm the geographical origin and the identity of Mytilus taxa in food samples, verify data on food labels, and monitor the mussel trade in Europe."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6562","5e709347878c28a0473a654e","5e709347878c28a0473a6509"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"554","pagesFromTo":"738135","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6509","62b2f9f7409707737cf37a40","5e709347878c28a0473a654e","62b2f9f7409707737cf37a42","62b2f9f7409707737cf37a43","5e709347878c28a0473a6562"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547715a","mniswId":"1539","title":"Aquaculture","issn":"0044-8486","eissn":"1873-5622","documentHash":"aaff1260-3172-4786-b919-d851b47a7a44"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b2f9f7409707737cf37a46","year":"2022","volume":"554","documentHash":"74d251cf-942a-472d-a9db-ae219ad4ddea"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Marine food products","Genetic identification of Mytilus","SNP","Culture"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058282012"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62b9546f40970710ec6ee50c","name":"Maria","lastName":"Herranz","orcidId":"0000-0002-3020-6072","documentHash":"41c7106e-cd13-443a-8a7b-8ad470542cb0"},{"objectId":"62b9546f40970710ec6ee50b","name":"Reinhardt M.","lastName":"Kristensen","orcidId":"0000-0001-9549-1188","documentHash":"93de1665-91e6-451d-8598-a8e0665ec882"},{"objectId":"62b9546f40970710ec6ee509","name":"Martin V.","lastName":"Sørensen","orcidId":"0000-0002-0377-0276","documentHash":"75d78fd1-781a-4272-96cd-444caaad62fd"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"89E34998A7815703314F14609081D0B42B721BC6BC02334A524F1A72E99979BE1D2892A3F7AD68FC281490897050CAC6FC5A6472BC066A2DFADD377EF7948831","orcidId":"0000-0002-8175-575X","documentHash":"60624fd9-0ebc-49d7-8f66-5b468fb82647"}],"objectId":"62b9546f40970710ec6ee507","doi":"10.1016/j.jcz.2022.06.004","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0044523122000572?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"First account on Loricifera from New Zealand: A new species of Pliciloricus, and a Shira larva with postlarva representing the new genus and species Patuloricus tangaroa gen. et sp. nov","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present contribution provides the first exploration of the Loricifera fauna in New Zealand.

This is only the second loriciferan species with a Shira larva, and the first reporting of the life cycle stage following the Shira larva. This new life cycle stage is interpreted as a postlarva, and is characterized by a large globular head without external appendages, and a slender, highly muscular trunk. Both species descriptions are based on combined imaging from light microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy.

The advection of Atlantic Water (AW) to the Nordic Seas is decisive for the oceanography and climate of the region and beyond. Here, we present a set of sedimentary records, including two new cores from the western Nordic Seas to reconstruct the history of AW routing in the Nordic Seas over the Holocene. Our results show that the early Holocene (11.7–8 ka BP) thermal maximum, caused by an ‘overshoot’ of overturning circulation and high insolation, was limited to the eastern Nordic Seas, while the western part remained cold due to the meltwater blocking the spreading of AW. After 8 ka BP, the retreat of the freshwater lid allowed AW to reach the central Greenland Sea, where deep convection developed. After 5 ka BP, the increase in sea-ice export from the Arctic strengthened deep convection, which intensified the westward AW flow. A disruption of convectional activity around 2.7 ka BP, triggered by a minimum in solar activity, caused cooling and expansion of sea ice in the Nordic Seas and might have contributed to a global climatic deterioration. The overturning circulation in the Nordic Seas did not recover to its previous state until the present. We demonstrate that the rate of AW advection into the Nordic Seas alone is not enough to understand the oceanographic evolution of this area and its influence on regional or even global ocean and climate changes. The shifts in AW routing within the Nordic Seas and the rate of deep convection are also important."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","5e709347878c28a0473a6526","5e709469878c28a0473bc63c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1104-1116","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","5e709469878c28a0473bc63c","6375f7e340970765d462e944","5e709347878c28a0473a6526"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f35","mniswId":"7689","title":"Holocene","issn":"0959-6836","eissn":"1477-0911","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"396f5934-d85e-4cab-9c54-4d5d23d7f932"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058301103"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09b01","name":"Brad E.","lastName":"Rosenheim","documentHash":"379058bb-ccad-4c24-a25c-7417eaaafc20"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09b00","name":"Alain F.","lastName":"Plante","documentHash":"c23e0b2f-9b11-4f5a-8f30-8ce3e6b9f985"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09aff","name":"Johan C.","lastName":"Faust","documentHash":"d328fe3d-f7f2-416c-b4ce-ded3fe1228f6"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09afe","name":"Craig","lastName":"Smeaton","documentHash":"32533cd2-5592-4ee1-adf4-f51ba85a8b65"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09afd","name":"Chuning","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"a06c3f02-0888-4854-b4a2-ef738d50a452"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09afc","name":"Elizabeth K.","lastName":"Williams","documentHash":"788e1076-2b1d-4da9-ba15-c0760e9e6d8e"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09afb","name":"Derrick","lastName":"Vaughn","documentHash":"ce7c015a-12cf-4c3d-a775-84468465244e"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09afa","name":"Ding","lastName":"He","documentHash":"d9c2c1fd-fdbf-47c1-9955-324cc1ff318d"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09af9","name":"Thomas S.","lastName":"Bianchi","documentHash":"b1a3c60f-ad92-4277-8ab0-2e8fb1b2fade"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09af8","name":"Alfonso","lastName":"Mucci","documentHash":"06bbcf9c-8eef-4fb2-9b6e-fd8c82e89b64"},{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09af7","name":"Xingqian","lastName":"Cui","documentHash":"e4af7e18-d777-40b5-99f6-5d697d815ff3"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739941d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Koziorowska-Makuch","uuid":"3509723B3C9ACF6AC999AADF8F9DFFCBC59EBD1303980F82ED6C7F4BD7719E1581D1822C26EAABF3F62D27DEB38E556101B6169DCDBBF6E954F2721AB7FCCE40","orcidId":"0000-0002-9111-9597","documentHash":"f1a7632d-a947-4305-b1e3-6d63b76e893b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09af5","doi":"10.1126/sciadv.add0610","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.add0610","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Global fjords as transitory reservoirs of labile organic carbon modulated by organo-mineral interactions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"he global carbon cycle is strongly modulated by organic carbon (OC) sequestration and decomposition.\nWhereas OC sequestration is relatively well constrained, there are few quantitative estimates of its susceptibility\nto decomposition.

Once this OC is remo-\nbilized and remineralized during glacial maxima, the resulting metabolic CO2 could counterbalance up to\n50 ppm of the atmospheric CO2 decrease during glacial times, making fjords critical actors in dampening\nglacial-interglacial climate fluctuations through negative carbon cycling loops."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a04739941d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"46","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["637c85ec4097073b7db09af7","637c85ec4097073b7db09af8","637c85ec4097073b7db09af9","637c85ec4097073b7db09afa","637c85ec4097073b7db09afb","637c85ec4097073b7db09afc","637c85ec4097073b7db09afd","637c85ec4097073b7db09afe","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","637c85ec4097073b7db09aff","637c85ec4097073b7db09b00","637c85ec4097073b7db09b01"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d2b1","mniswId":"18209","title":"Science Advances","issn":"2375-2548","eissn":"2375-2548","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"be28a32a-c957-4328-b163-8bd9ee385fcb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637c85ec4097073b7db09af6","year":"2022","volume":"8","number":"46","documentHash":"006e0ae4-0fd9-45b5-a74c-2c1f1b696906"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058321726"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"631efef44097075c0bb733b4","name":"Andrew J.","lastName":"Gooday","documentHash":"0064cd82-6b05-46cf-9d80-addad9675f2d"},{"objectId":"631efef44097075c0bb733b3","name":"Maria","lastName":"Holzmann","documentHash":"47f86d82-5ec3-4c05-ba99-4e6889e14a3d"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2cac","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Majewski","uuid":"6A9A1F51F8D6B8BFF70183E8E7FC79109556E1C2325D88724491707987802B0DCFD7F637794C637E5E5E17B69988332FB7EB7D343C641A5B0886434601AB0714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5407-1782","documentHash":"852d65bf-f2be-49f4-a926-9e5ddebce95b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"631efef44097075c0bb733b2","doi":"10.1016/j.ejop.2022.125909","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0932473922000463?pes=vor","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Molecular and morphological diversity of monothalamous foraminifera from South Georgia and the Falkland Islands: Description of four new species","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Based on molecular and morphological data, we describe three new genera and four new species of monothalamids from the sublittoral zone (21–250 m) in South Georgia fjords that belong to different monothalamid clades.

The permanent positive AO phase for the 3 months of JFM 2020 was accompanied by a prevailing positive phase of the Arctic Dipole (AD) pattern. Here we analyze the sea ice thickness (SIT) distribution based on CryoSat-2/SMOS satellite-derived data augmented with results from the hindcast simulation by the fully coupled Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) from November 2019 through March 2020. A notable result of the positive AO phase during JFM 2020 was large SIT anomalies of up to 1.3 m that emerged in the Barents Sea (BS), along the northeastern Canadian coast and in parts of the central Arctic Ocean. These anomalies appear to be driven by nonlinear interactions between thermodynamic and dynamic processes. In particular, in the Barents and Kara seas (BKS), they are a result of enhanced ice growth connected with low-temperature anomalies and the consequence of intensified atmospherically driven sea ice transport and deformations (i.e., ice divergence and shear) in this area. The Davies Strait, the east coast of Greenland and the BS regions are characterized by convergence and divergence changes connected with thinner sea ice at the ice borders along with an enhanced impact of atmospheric wind forcing. Low-pressure anomalies that developed over the eastern Arctic during JFM 2020 increased northerly winds from the cold Arctic Ocean to the BS and accelerated the southward drift of the MOSAiC ice floe. The satellite-derived and simulated sea ice velocity anomalies, which compared well during JFM 2020, indicate a strong acceleration of the Transpolar Drift relative to the mean for the past decade, with intensified speeds of up to 6 km d−1. As a consequence, sea ice transport and deformations driven by atmospheric surface wind forcing accounted for the bulk of the SIT anomalies, especially in January 2020 and February 2020. RASM intra-annual ensemble forecast simulations with 30 ensemble members forced with different atmospheric boundary conditions from 1 November 2019 through 30 April 2020 show a pronounced internal variability in the sea ice volume, driven by thermodynamic ice-growth and ice-melt processes and the impact of dynamic surface winds on sea ice formation and deformation. A comparison of the respective SIT distributions and turbulent heat fluxes during the positive AO phase in JFM 2020 and the negative AO phase in JFM 2010 corroborates the conclusion that winter sea ice conditions in the Arctic Ocean can be significantly altered by AO variability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6531"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"981-1005","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["632abe9c40970732c4acc10d","632abe9c40970732c4acc10e","632abe9c40970732c4acc10f","632abe9c40970732c4acc110","632abe9c40970732c4acc111","632abe9c40970732c4acc112","632abe9c40970732c4acc113","632abe9c40970732c4acc114","632abe9c40970732c4acc115","632abe9c40970732c4acc116","632abe9c40970732c4acc117","632abe9c40970732c4acc118","5e709347878c28a0473a6531","632abe9c40970732c4acc119","632abe9c40970732c4acc11a","632abe9c40970732c4acc11b","632abe9c40970732c4acc11c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffcb1ad49b31ccecc0822","title":"THE CRYOSPHERE","issn":"1994-0416","eissn":"1994-0424","documentHash":"e058d8ff-4700-45b6-88df-4f4beb260189"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632abe9c40970732c4acc10c","year":"2022","volume":"16","number":"3","documentHash":"670b85b0-b08b-4317-9724-1765038e3352"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058367632"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce3e","name":"Adrian K.","lastName":"Turner","documentHash":"a8cab010-265e-4c7c-a16a-6cd854350834"},{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce3d","name":"Darin","lastName":"Comeau","documentHash":"041805c4-dbe2-4af5-92c8-4e99e517c1f0"},{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce3c","name":"John D.","lastName":"Wolfe","documentHash":"7a3fc3b9-07ec-4511-8cd0-c3a0e7056b66"},{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce3b","name":"Anthony P.","lastName":"Craig","documentHash":"5879d199-7139-4e1d-a225-c0313e2387aa"},{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce3a","name":"Wilbert","lastName":"Weijer","documentHash":"0edaf634-8c35-4afa-a32a-2529b7c2637f"},{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce39","name":"Mark R.","lastName":"Petersen","documentHash":"276f4950-7f0e-46c3-a6d7-1c40709b896f"},{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce38","name":"Gennaro","lastName":"D'Angelo","documentHash":"3f7e67b1-b852-4415-9d1b-83a7a244a5bc"},{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce37","name":"Younjoo J.","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"6e311ea7-5b37-41e1-9a42-d18771b57110"},{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce36","name":"Wieslaw","lastName":"Maslowski","documentHash":"a7a3c82b-766f-486d-9350-e9214c88bb75"},{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce35","name":"Milena","lastName":"Veneziani","documentHash":"bf1cc528-df8e-4f1c-845f-bc79bbb3bcfb"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6531","name":"Robert","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"2D5DB9D57FC7F36F61EC129D9952718B8EE760677732DD55A275E92756962D368291051F6920872AC1B25967C13152ED107489FCB8248776FDD5045A6623150F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8698-0799","documentHash":"5a7dc855-7273-4918-89fd-9450b6dfc8de"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce33","doi":"10.5194/gmd-15-3133-2022","publicUri":"https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/3133/2022/gmd-15-3133-2022.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"An evaluation of the E3SMv1 Arctic ocean and sea-ice regionally refined model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) is a state-of-the-science Earth system model (ESM) with the ability to focus horizontal resolution of its multiple components in specific areas. Regionally refined global ESMs are motivated by the need to explicitly resolve, rather than parameterize, relevant physics within the regions of refined resolution, while offering significant computational cost savings relative to the respective cost of configurations with high-resolution (HR) everywhere on the globe. In this paper, we document results from the first Arctic regionally refined E3SM configuration for the ocean and sea-ice components (E3SM-Arctic-OSI), while employing data-based atmosphere, land, and hydrology components. Our aim is an improved representation of the Arctic coupled ocean and sea-ice state, its variability and trends, and the exchanges of mass and property fluxes between the Arctic and the sub-Arctic. We find that E3SM-Arctic-OSI increases the realism of simulated Arctic ocean and sea-ice conditions compared to a similar low-resolution E3SM simulation without the Arctic regional refinement in ocean and sea-ice components (E3SM-LR-OSI). In particular, exchanges through the main Arctic gateways are greatly improved with respect to E3SM-LR-OSI. Other aspects, such as the Arctic freshwater content variability and sea-ice trends, are also satisfactorily simulated. Yet, other features, such as the upper-ocean stratification and the sea-ice thickness distribution, need further improvements, involving either more advanced parameterizations, model tuning, or additional grid refinements. Overall, E3SM-Arctic-OSI offers an improved representation of the Arctic system relative to E3SM-LR-OSI, at a fraction (15 %) of the computational cost of comparable global high-resolution configurations, while permitting exchanges with the lower-latitude oceans that cannot be directly accounted for in Arctic regional models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6531"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"3133-3160","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["632ac10140970732c4acce35","632ac10140970732c4acce36","632ac10140970732c4acce37","632ac10140970732c4acce38","5e709347878c28a0473a6531","632ac10140970732c4acce39","632ac10140970732c4acce3a","632ac10140970732c4acce3b","632ac10140970732c4acce3c","632ac10140970732c4acce3d","632ac10140970732c4acce3e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e27","mniswId":"7160","title":"Geoscientific Model Development","issn":"1991-959X","eissn":"1991-9603","documentHash":"f82030c1-9d69-4993-bb78-0c6c5e3784f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632ac10140970732c4acce34","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"7","documentHash":"7bea00bc-86c7-4364-97cd-1706421bdb0a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058367724"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"632ac45340970732c4ad6a0d","name":"Larry","lastName":"Stock","documentHash":"5fdb1307-9b28-49f3-9d28-da6b052b0862"},{"objectId":"632ac45340970732c4ad6a0c","name":"Jaclyn","lastName":"Clement Kinney","documentHash":"667adf1f-e1fc-4c9e-84bb-1b1f1d19f55f"},{"objectId":"632ac45340970732c4ad6a0b","name":"Karen","lastName":"Frey","documentHash":"15615834-ef9d-45af-a278-ae6234556a46"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6531","name":"Robert","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"2D5DB9D57FC7F36F61EC129D9952718B8EE760677732DD55A275E92756962D368291051F6920872AC1B25967C13152ED107489FCB8248776FDD5045A6623150F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8698-0799","documentHash":"5a7dc855-7273-4918-89fd-9450b6dfc8de"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-09","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"632ac45340970732c4ad6a09","doi":"10.5670/oceanog.2022.123","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5670/oceanog.2022.123","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Observations of Declining Primary Productivity in the Western Bering Strait","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6531"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"3-4","pagesFromTo":"140-143","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["632ac45340970732c4ad6a0b","632ac45340970732c4ad6a0c","632ac45340970732c4ad6a0d","5e709347878c28a0473a6531"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c7","mniswId":"15352","title":"OCEANOGRAPHY","issn":"1042-8275","eissn":"1042-8275","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"35174bf8-d16e-4e54-bcad-997178d13ca7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632ac45340970732c4ad6a0a","year":"2022","documentHash":"5d3b5d14-af1a-4a62-ab1d-f7c11872f422"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058368294"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63525bf6409707615cc8c922","name":"Ralf","lastName":"Schiebel","documentHash":"ecbcfa00-d7f1-45db-88c6-29166a283a00"},{"objectId":"63525bf6409707615cc8c921","name":"Gregory","lastName":"Beaugrand","documentHash":"8b061d94-0ab8-4c70-8ced-c46ea51d67fc"},{"objectId":"63525bf6409707615cc8c920","name":"Hélène","lastName":"Howa","documentHash":"ea5fdf25-d8ac-4d74-9b71-2d7dee179131"},{"objectId":"63525bf6409707615cc8c91f","name":"Azumi","lastName":"Kuroyanagi","documentHash":"780e3e41-3811-4798-af54-04a59496d73b"},{"objectId":"63525bf6409707615cc8c91e","name":"P.

The FORCIS project aims to unlock this potential by synthesizing a comprehensive global database of abundance and diversity observations of living planktonic Foraminifera in the upper ocean over more than 100 years starting from 1910. The database will allow for unravelling the impact of multiple global-change stressors acting on planktonic Foraminifera in historical times, using an approach that combines statistical analysis of

DNA metabarcoding for benthic monitoring: A review of sediment sampling and DNA extraction methods","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding (parallel sequencing of DNA/RNA for identification of whole communities within a targeted group) is revolutionizing the field of aquatic biomonitoring. To date, most metabarcoding studies aiming to assess the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems have focused on water eDNA and macroinvertebrate bulk samples. However, the eDNA metabarcoding has also been applied to soft sediment samples, mainly for assessing microbial or meiofaunal biota. Compared to classical methodologies based on manual sorting and morphological identification of benthic taxa, eDNA metabarcoding offers potentially important advantages for assessing the environmental quality of sediments. The methods and protocols utilized for sediment eDNA metabarcoding can vary considerably among studies, and standardization efforts are needed to improve their robustness, comparability and use within regulatory frameworks. Here, we review the available information on eDNA metabarcoding applied to sediment samples, with a focus on sampling, preservation, and DNA extraction steps. We discuss challenges specific to sediment eDNA analysis, including the variety of different sources and states of eDNA and its persistence in the sediment. This paper aims to identify good-practice strategies and facilitate method harmonization for routine use of sediment eDNA in future benthic monitoring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"818","pagesFromTo":"151783","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","635272c4409707615cc9e66f","635272c4409707615cc9e670","635272c4409707615cc9e671","635272c4409707615cc9e672","635272c4409707615cc9e673","635272c4409707615cc9e674","635272c4409707615cc9e675","635272c4409707615cc9e676","635272c4409707615cc9e677","635272c4409707615cc9e678","635272c4409707615cc9e679","635272c4409707615cc9e67a","635272c4409707615cc9e67b","635272c4409707615cc9e67c","635272c4409707615cc9e67d","635272c4409707615cc9e67e","635272c4409707615cc9e67f","635272c4409707615cc9e680","635272c4409707615cc9e681","635272c4409707615cc9e682","635272c4409707615cc9e683","635272c4409707615cc9e684","635272c4409707615cc9e685","635272c4409707615cc9e686","635272c4409707615cc9e687","635272c4409707615cc9e688","635272c4409707615cc9e689","635272c4409707615cc9e68a","635272c4409707615cc9e68b","635272c4409707615cc9e68c","635272c4409707615cc9e68d","635272c4409707615cc9e68e","635272c4409707615cc9e68f","635272c4409707615cc9e690"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","eissn":"1879-1026","documentHash":"9d5d9582-68d0-4fe1-bb66-a72290be66b9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"635272c4409707615cc9e66e","year":"2022","volume":"818","documentHash":"f2d4dc64-2b72-45ac-af2a-d3b5929e82a5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Environmental","DNASediments","Metabarcoding","Monitoring","Aquatic ecosystems"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058401609"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6352766f409707615cca125d","name":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Frontalini","documentHash":"83e3d6df-f664-4437-a0a3-686afe0511bb"},{"objectId":"6352766f409707615cca125c","name":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Coccioni","documentHash":"708347e4-e6cf-43b0-8349-224828e7077c"},{"objectId":"6352766f409707615cca125b","name":"Antonella","lastName":"Maccotta","documentHash":"95e14580-efc0-43c9-9e5d-4cab5a5f9c9c"},{"objectId":"6352766f409707615cca125a","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Caruso","documentHash":"42488e9d-3779-40a3-9c45-92b188b455f7"},{"objectId":"6352766f409707615cca1259","name":"Emanuela","lastName":"Reo","documentHash":"551eea99-b90c-43d8-a706-018dcb838fd6"},{"objectId":"6352766f409707615cca1258","name":"Franck","lastName":"Lejzerowicz","documentHash":"22b901dd-5433-4eea-9da7-904c60e874e0"},{"objectId":"615bb8a875234017e04eda8d","name":"Mattia","lastName":"Greco","uuid":"476734BF5B11C961C32223CB7E068E727168B16E760C3E65EA2F3EC44B69129BF9B0032DEB1211FF34D5CFC2FCB55E40881DD6805DEFB2513B12C9EE93082646","documentHash":"120e02af-f940-4384-9c8e-2f3addeb7ff7"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"objectId":"6352766f409707615cca1256","doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.134239","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0045653522007329?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Environmental RNA outperforms eDNA metabarcoding in assessing impact of marine pollution: A chromium-spiked mesocosm test","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Environmental (e)DNA metabarcoding holds great promise for biomonitoring and ecotoxicological applications. However, few studies have compared the performance of eDNA versus eRNA metabarcoding in assessing organismal response to marine pollution, in experimental conditions. Here, we performed a chromium (Cr)-spiked mesocosm experimental test on benthic foraminiferal community to investigate the effects on species diversity by analysing both eDNA and eRNA metabarcoding data across different Cr concentrations in the sediment. Foraminiferal diversity in the eRNA data showed a significant negative correlation with the Cr concentration in the sediment, while a positive response was observed in the eDNA data. The foraminiferal OTUs exhibited a higher turnover rate in eRNA than in the eDNA-derived community. Furthermore, in the eRNA samples, OTUs abundance was significantly affected by the Cr gradient in the sediment (Pseudo-R2 = 0.28, p = 0.05), while no significant trend was observed in the eDNA samples. The correlation between Cr concentration and foraminiferal diversity in eRNA datasets was stronger when the less abundant OTUs (<100 reads) were removed and the analyses were conducted exclusively on OTUs shared between eRNA and eDNA datasets. This indicates the importance of metabarcoding data filtering to capture ecological impacts, in addition to using the putatively active organisms in the eRNA dataset. The comparative analyses on foraminiferal diversity revealed that eRNA-based metabarcoding can better assess the response to heavy metal exposure in presence of subtle concentrations of the pollutant. Furthermore, our results suggest that to unlock the full potential for ecosystem assessment, eDNA and eRNA should be studied in parallel to control for potential sequence artifacts in routine ecosystem surveys."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

Rapid and cost-effective methods based on organismal DNA or environmental DNA (eDNA) now offer the opportunity to produce inventories of indicator taxa that can subsequently be used to assess biodiversity and ecological quality. However, the integration of these new DNA-based methods into current monitoring practices is not straightforward, and will require coordinated actions in the coming years at national and international levels. To plan and stimulate such an integration, the European network DNAqua-Net (COST Action CA15219) brought together international experts from academia, as well as key environmental biomonitoring stakeholders from different European countries. Together, this transdisciplinary consortium developed a roadmap for implementing DNA-based methods with a focus on inland waters assessed by the EU Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). This was done through a series of online workshops held in April 2020, which included fifty participants, followed by extensive synthesis work. The roadmap is organised around six objectives: 1) to highlight the effectiveness and benefits of DNA-based methods, 2) develop an adaptive approach for the implementation of new methods, 3) provide guidelines and standards for best practice, 4) engage stakeholders and ensure effective knowledge transfer, 5) support the environmental biomonitoring sector to achieve the required changes, 6) steer the process and harmonise efforts at the European level. This paper provides an overview of the forum discussions and the common European views that have emerged from them, while reflecting the diversity of situations in different countries. It highlights important actions required for a successful implementation of DNA-based biomonitoring of aquatic ecosystems by 2030."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

Rhizaria, are a common and highly diverse group of mainly marine protists. Despite their evolutionary and ecological importance, only limited genomic data (one partial genome and nine transcriptomic datasets) have been published for this group. Foraminiferal molecular phylogeny is largely based on 18S rRNA gene sequence analysis. However, due to highly variable evolutionary rates of substitution in ribosomal genes plus the existence of intragenomic variation at this locus, the relationships between and within foraminiferal classes remain uncertain. We analyze transcriptomic data from 28 species, adding 19 new species to the previously published dataset, including members of the strongly under-represented class Monothalamea. A phylogenomic reconstruction of Rhizaria, rooted with alveolates and stramenopiles, based on 199 genes and 68 species supports the monophyly of Foraminifera and their sister relationship to Polycystinea. The phylogenomic tree of Foraminifera is very similar to the 18S rRNA tree, with the paraphyletic single-chambered monothalamids giving rise to the multi-chambered Tubothalamea and Globothalamea. Within the Monothalamea, our analyses confirm the monophyly of the giant, deep-sea xenophyophores that branch within clade C and indicate the basal position of monothalamous clades D and E. The multi-chambered Globothalamea are monophyletic and comprise the paraphyletic Textulariida and monophyletic Rotaliida. Our phylogenomic analyses support major evolutionary trends of Foraminifera revealed by ribosomal phylogenies and reinforce their current higher-level classification."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","615bb8a875234017e04eda8d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"174","pagesFromTo":"107546","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63526513409707615cc917a9","63526513409707615cc917aa","63526513409707615cc917ab","63526513409707615cc917ac","63526513409707615cc917ad","63526513409707615cc917ae","63526513409707615cc917af","615bb8a875234017e04eda8d","63526513409707615cc917b0","63526513409707615cc917b1","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f05","mniswId":"14571","title":"MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION","issn":"1055-7903","documentHash":"1356386d-feb1-4ec0-83dc-aad9a3faba0e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63526513409707615cc917a8","year":"2022","volume":"174","documentHash":"73413456-6608-4829-be36-baf57e8b0df0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Foraminifera","Monothalamids","Globothalamea","Tubothalamea","Xenophyophores","Phylogenomics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058402228"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70949e878c28a0473c07db","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kozińska","uuid":"43F5F4EFD8C6E1E5A6508E3307F4F139299EB020E244B61CB1FD60A422B15C6A27CC596F17BBA3F2D090E5E248D471241532409D56BE7B811472164454AF3E11","orcidId":"0000-0001-6949-4860","documentHash":"9d4cb8f4-66ba-4a8b-9605-2e9334afda6c"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be97f","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Waśko","uuid":"78193E705A456C3722C26F3AE44F8092814F70AD75AFD42BEFC7AD797E979138080ACB273BCFCAEC14B123811E53F69951067A97DD7BFEEF5F2ED1A1A30F6B82","orcidId":"0000-0001-5494-3635","documentHash":"648e1cd9-9985-4668-824b-8a0ca510845f"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af938","name":"Anna","lastName":"Baraniak","uuid":"B6A14B4F518DDA12A2FA59ED7609B3FAC586C63FC9861818A0BB2627EDC0C341977C99B664DC0C92F37816397BD40CCC208F1ABC5139DBB2ADF65432154FA641","orcidId":"0000-0001-9996-8553","documentHash":"8e50be8b-c2a5-454a-8256-4e98084ed46b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6547","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kotlarska","uuid":"21C7374EE8D85591AF0BF4337FF25DA10E6C171A3B9220801ECB74ACA089F5AAC3C3CAE7E0EC6B2AFBF54E523E70E1EE92AB17A7A36AABD20CF04C155730C5C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-3122-7772","documentHash":"f26aba89-9744-4f38-af11-2a2d8da22ef9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"636397fb409707497292f621","doi":"10.3390/ijerph192113829","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/21/13829/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Clinically Relevant β-Lactam Resistance Genes in Wastewater Treatment Plants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the largest global concerns due to its influence in multiple areas, which is consistent with One Health’s concept of close interconnections between people, animals, plants, and their shared environments. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) circulate constantly in various niches, sediments, water sources, soil, and wastes of the animal and plant sectors, and is linked to human activities. Sewage of different origins gets to the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), where ARB and ARG removal efficiency is still insufficient, leading to their transmission to discharge points and further dissemination. Thus, WWTPs are believed to be reservoirs of ARGs and the source of spreading AMR. According to a World Health Organization report, the most critical pathogens for public health include Gram-negative bacteria resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems (last-choice drugs), which represent β-lactams, the most widely used antibiotics. Therefore, this paper aimed to present the available research data for ARGs in WWTPs that confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, with a particular emphasis on clinically important life-threatening mechanisms of resistance, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases (KPC, NDM)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6547"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","uid":"b21X69XXr6O_0TDjOCQ3WhA","uuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","name":"Narodowy Instytut Leków","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949e878c28a0473c07db","5e709481878c28a0473be97f","5e7093b6878c28a0473af938"],"parentId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","parentUuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","rootId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","rootUuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"13829","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709481878c28a0473be97f","5e70949e878c28a0473c07db","5e709347878c28a0473a6547","5e7093b6878c28a0473af938"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","issn":"1660-4601","eissn":"1660-4601","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"bad4d5e4-600e-403a-9e35-0edb9dd89452"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"635796264097072c1f9eebac","year":"2022","volume":"19","number":"21","documentHash":"f95a714f-56c2-478c-8da3-fe117a4d8338"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antibiotic resistance genes","wastewater treatment plant","β-lactamase","extended-spectrum β-lactamase","carbapenemases"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058407805"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"636394cf409707497292692e","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Chelchowski","documentHash":"8d04ef56-2cc5-4b89-a2d9-cab5a89cb9fe"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-19","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"636394cf409707497292692c","doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2022.108114","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0272771422003729?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Seasonal variability in macrobenthos assemblage parameters in the highly disturbed Antarctic intertidal zone – Relatively rich biodiversity year around","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To understand the impact of anthropogenically induced transformations of biological communities, their naturally occurring fluctuation must be recognized first. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the variability in Antarctic intertidal benthic assemblage faunal composition during an annual cycle (King George Island 62° S). Once a month, from December 2016 to November 2017, samples were collected at low-, mid- and high-tidal levels. Polychaetes were the most speciose group (15 species), followed by amphipods (12). Throughout the year, the most numerous taxa were gastropods (38% of the total number), followed by amphipods (23%) and bivalves (22%). The general pattern of the number of species and their abundance and biomass depended on the season and exhibited the highest values in austral autumn (April–June). Both species richness and abundance were highest in June and lowest in August. This study discovered that Antarctic intertidal macrofauna assemblages quickly respond to changes in environmental conditions and thus reflect seasonal climate fluctuations. The rapid development of these assemblages when the conditions are favourable proves their opportunistic and highly adaptable nature, which is potentially a good prognosis for survival in this ever-changing ecosystem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"278","pagesFromTo":"108114","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["636394cf409707497292692e","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","5e709347878c28a0473a6522"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff6e5ad49b31ccec45400","title":"ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE","issn":"0272-7714","eissn":"0272-7714","documentHash":"64c72aa1-680a-4d82-a501-ad88a0c3728d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636394cf409707497292692d","year":"2022","volume":"278","documentHash":"955f2777-bfe3-40b3-914c-87c7d63acf1d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Abundance","Diversity","Rocky shoresKing","George Island","Admiralty Bay"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058407838"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd59af4097073596a17675","name":"Sergej","lastName":"Olenin","documentHash":"c040244d-9a4b-4eaa-876a-2bf3d6f94045"},{"objectId":"63bd59af4097073596a17674","name":"Darius","lastName":"Daunys","documentHash":"374ee9db-1ab4-4c75-80cd-60efe0672c4c"},{"objectId":"63bd59af4097073596a17673","name":"Andrius","lastName":"Šiaulys","documentHash":"6a5da22a-9331-4412-b992-cdb9753bd4f0"},{"objectId":"63bd59af4097073596a17672","name":"Saulė","lastName":"Medelytė","documentHash":"1a308636-9322-485e-8d03-f332704deb31"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651e","name":"Maria","lastName":"Włodarska-Kowalczuk","uuid":"D47553F9A2C33D8033D8594650BFC32CC9C68EF6F3EE4CE130DBEC8BA3DF82ED9A7055BF1E4316109AD31C2E6DBEF73F3FEF158A522731E002B07E209F106EDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2757-1108","documentHash":"01d767d9-9266-45a4-bd4b-a8cf8d1e8a8e"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-11-02","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63bd59af4097073596a17670","doi":"10.1007/s00300-022-03096-3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-022-03096-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Application of underwater imagery for the description of upper sublittoral benthic communities in glaciated and ice-free Arctic fjords","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Complex bottom topography and the presence of floating ice significantly complicate the use of traditional sampling methods in Arctic coastal waters, forcing to look for alternative approaches. One such technique is underwater imagery, which has grown in popularity in recent decades based on its effectiveness in hard-to-reach places. We demonstrate that an underwater video mosaic can be a reliable method for comparative analysis of Arctic habitats under the glacier influence and glacier influence-free habitats. The filming was carried out in the upper sublittoral (2–65 m) of Hornsund and Isfjorden areas, representing two ice-free and two glaciated bays. Video footage was obtained using an ROV mounted and “drop-down” video cameras and transformed into 148 video mosaics. Based on the lowest possible taxonomic level, 31 biological features (morphospecies) were identified and ascribed to benthic functional groups based on their feeding and mobility type. The morphospecies and functional groups were used for the comparative analysis to reveal the ecologically meaningful differences in benthic community structure in different Arctic benthic habitats. We discovered greater abundances of motile scavengers in glacier-influenced bays whereas glacier influence-free bay had more sessile suspension filters and glacier influence-free riverine bay was dominated by discreetly motile and deposit feeders. Underwater imagery mosaics have proven to be a fairly reliable tool for fieldwork-efficient quantitative characterization of benthic communities in the hard-to-reach Arctic's upper sublittoral."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6500","5e709347878c28a0473a651e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1655-1671","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bd59af4097073596a17672","63bd59af4097073596a17673","63bd59af4097073596a17674","5e709347878c28a0473a651e","5e709347878c28a0473a6500","63bd59af4097073596a17675"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792ee","mniswId":"16268","title":"POLAR BIOLOGY","doi":"","issn":"0722-4060","eissn":"1432-2056","websiteLink":"https://link.springer.com/journal/300","documentHash":"4669e802-994d-4bda-8c0a-5226214ba6f5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd59af4097073596a17671","year":"2022","volume":"45","number":"12","documentHash":"20895858-041b-4434-bea6-7aa53b312d1f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Seabed","Video mosaics","Morphospecies","Functional groups","Svalbard"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058421455"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bbe86940970754861bfa05","name":"Malin","lastName":"Daase","documentHash":"faca9e18-b923-4cfd-b301-087b2bcb710d"},{"objectId":"63bbe86940970754861bfa04","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dmoch","documentHash":"a916dc6a-a53e-45cc-a169-3b3b880b3dc3"},{"objectId":"63bbe86940970754861bfa03","name":"Janne E.","lastName":"Søreide","documentHash":"7b768fad-569f-419f-88f9-4dfe922a8de7"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6520","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Błachowiak-Samołyk","uuid":"8C6AD77D97DA3D9D5230CB20B5B200FB76893BFE72A48BE0BAB6068DBB7BD96049B3C885C6414B2EF04BBFB8AFD27AC9468868A23DB7A01FB8AEBEECC4EDAD0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8076-2168","documentHash":"5036109f-207f-446c-bac6-ec8dd36677f9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bbe86940970754861bfa02","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2022.933461","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.933461/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Seasonal mesozooplankton patterns and timing of life history events in high-arctic fjord environments","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Seasonal patterns in mesozooplankton composition, vertical distribution, and timing of reproduction are challenging to study in the open sea due to ocean currents and mix of populations of different origins. Sill fjords, on the other hand, with restricted water exchange, are ideal locations for studying taxa- and community-specific adaptations to the prevailing environment. Here, we present re-occurring patterns in the mesozooplankton community structure in Billefjorden, Svalbard, a high Arctic sill fjord with extensive seasonal ice cover, based on monthly sampling from 2011 to 2013. The zooplankton community composition confirmed the Arctic character of this fjord. Predominantly herbivorous taxa, such as Calanus glacialis and Pseudocalanus spp., showed strong seasonal variation in abundance and depth distribution, with population minima in spring being compensated by a rapid population recovery during summer. Omnivorous taxa, such as Microcalanus spp. and copepods of the family Aetideidae, largely remained at depth throughout the year and had an extended or year-round reproductive period. Deep-dwelling omnivorous/carnivorous species peaked in abundance in winter–spring when herbivorous populations were severely depleted. Taxa with seasonally limited occurrences, i.e., meroplankton, peaked in spring and summer at the surface, but were largely absent for the rest of the year. The different life histories, with contrasting feeding modes, depth preferences, and timing of reproduction lead to reduced interspecies competition and allow for a rather high and stable abundance of mesozooplankton year-round despite the short primary production window at high latitudes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"933461","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bbe86940970754861bfa03","63bbe86940970754861bfa04","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","63bbe86940970754861bfa05"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a523b2467f06a1edbdb2f","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"17b56cb2-5e8f-41ce-a89d-d4b387701e78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Svalbard","seasonal migration","reproduction","Calanus glacialis","Pseudocalanus","Microcalanus","meroplankton"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058421541"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc59","name":"Kim","lastName":"Gustavson","documentHash":"f498427e-f1fb-4634-a1b2-607d6ec6c14d"},{"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc58","name":"Ole","lastName":"Geertz-Hansen","documentHash":"ef4ee00c-4b41-40e9-b661-fa7ec13df81d"},{"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc57","name":"Morten Birch","lastName":"Larsen","documentHash":"7414bdd0-8783-4f86-8f39-16e3913b2751"},{"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc56","name":"Lars","lastName":"Renvald","documentHash":"e259f61d-07f0-4170-8069-c80c40de348f"},{"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc55","name":"Lonnie Bogø","lastName":"Wilms","documentHash":"346f2e9f-b1c3-4c2b-8333-745b6a5eb0a4"},{"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc54","name":"Pia","lastName":"Lassen","documentHash":"092bef1f-8dd9-41eb-a9bc-a86b13f23639"},{"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc53","name":"Susse","lastName":"Wegeberg","documentHash":"2191e548-e3ee-4530-80d8-f1fb8081bb34"},{"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc52","name":"Janne","lastName":"Fritt-Rasmussen","documentHash":"765f47a7-65e5-4b8b-9fe2-cea2be57d4ed"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc649","name":"Józef","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"64A4CFE25246497244808707B7231F64A063B6FD2037A5C71E1073A7F8BB9156C1EA1C6A93906EF67E5F01C9417A1FDD725822A014D540B94C1EBF4AEF048E60","orcidId":"0000-0002-3468-0513","documentHash":"b0dc8dfd-3de1-479b-8b73-f0c248f5bf29"}],"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc50","doi":"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129976","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0304389422017708?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Coastline in-situ burning of oil spills, analysis of a Greenland field experiment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In-situ burning is a well-proven technology for combatting oil spills offshore. However, as a coastline oil spill response at rocky shores it is novel and investigated here for the first time. The viability and efficiency of coastline in-situ burning of oil spills and the fate of the resulting burn residue was studied through a field experiment. The experiment included a controlled release of 600 L crude oil and subsequent burn of the oil on a remote coast in Greenland. In line with other documented large-scale offshore burns, a high burn efficiency was estimated. Fate studies and chemical analysis of the burn residue diversely caught in the tidal seaweed vegetation showed varying compositions depending on the specific burn intensity. In general, however, a relative increase in high ring numbered PAHs was observed compared to fresh oil. After 4 days, waves and tidal flushing markedly reduced visible oil and burn residue from the burn area. Elevated concentrations of total hydrocarbons were found from the fresh oil in the seawater, but the impacts on the coastal water was below levels of ecotoxic concern. Overall, coastline in-situ burning proved efficient, with a high operational potential. In addition, when the oil is in place at the coast, with a possible increased operational time window compared to an offshore burn."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc649"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"441","pagesFromTo":"129976","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bd4ada40970735969fbc52","63bd4ada40970735969fbc53","63bd4ada40970735969fbc54","63bd4ada40970735969fbc55","63bd4ada40970735969fbc56","63bd4ada40970735969fbc57","63bd4ada40970735969fbc58","5e709469878c28a0473bc649","63bd4ada40970735969fbc59"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547874d","mniswId":"11283","title":"JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS","issn":"0304-3894","documentHash":"9e422f9b-3018-499d-934c-ffabaf1b5463"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd4ada40970735969fbc51","year":"2023","volume":"441","documentHash":"6bfdf1f0-5bab-49d8-a69c-feaf363ae711"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058421765"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd9d","name":"Nuria","lastName":"Sánchez","documentHash":"69e8f65d-7f37-4310-baa4-23080dbf960e"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd9c","name":"Stephen C.","lastName":"Landers","documentHash":"1583bb9e-a8b3-4bb6-9261-8d5f773a990a"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd9b","name":"Maikon","lastName":"Di Domenico","documentHash":"cf88716f-927e-4328-ab6b-380e5fa6e0ce"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd9a","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Dal Zotto","documentHash":"7572f0d7-9212-4f04-bf11-51c310a01b00"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd99","name":"Andrey","lastName":"Adrianov","documentHash":"cf6ddc07-fead-4490-b818-db5947bd54d9"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd98","name":"Anastassya","lastName":"Maiorova","documentHash":"8fc4ec41-fa45-4d5b-b65e-32742f5b037f"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd97","name":"María","lastName":"Herranz","documentHash":"f2cc82cb-6d34-4079-b183-e5c78909bbb5"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd96","name":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Yamasaki","documentHash":"0c6888e7-fb2f-4772-be2b-860266eea8f8"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd95","name":"Birger","lastName":"Neuhaus","documentHash":"17de3884-9220-4d88-9e4b-11f6a7421a5d"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd94","name":"Fernando","lastName":"Pardos","documentHash":"ee0a827b-a19c-40bf-b44a-cdb349c21dbe"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd93","name":"Diego","lastName":"Cepeda","documentHash":"2e5b25f7-faaa-4fc9-81c3-9958863c6442"},{"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd92","name":"Alberto","lastName":"González-Casarrubios","documentHash":"f956882c-ef99-4cd0-bcaa-fe305e56e5c9"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"89E34998A7815703314F14609081D0B42B721BC6BC02334A524F1A72E99979BE1D2892A3F7AD68FC281490897050CAC6FC5A6472BC066A2DFADD377EF7948831","orcidId":"0000-0002-8175-575X","documentHash":"60624fd9-0ebc-49d7-8f66-5b468fb82647"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-09","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bd530d4097073596a0cd91","doi":"10.1016/j.jcz.2022.11.015","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0044523122001188?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Towards a standardisation of morphological measurements in the phylum Kinorhyncha","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Taxonomic studies of the phylum Kinorhyncha follow a standardised structure, which is extremely useful in many aspects, such as making it easier to read and compare the different species descriptions.

Finally, a glossary that compiles and defines all the measurements that may be included in Kinorhyncha descriptions is presented."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709481878c28a0473be9a6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"302","pagesFromTo":"217-223","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bd530d4097073596a0cd92","63bd530d4097073596a0cd93","63bd530d4097073596a0cd94","63bd530d4097073596a0cd95","63bd530d4097073596a0cd96","63bd530d4097073596a0cd97","5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","63bd530d4097073596a0cd98","63bd530d4097073596a0cd99","63bd530d4097073596a0cd9a","63bd530d4097073596a0cd9b","63bd530d4097073596a0cd9c","63bd530d4097073596a0cd9d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b4c","mniswId":"20556","title":"ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER","issn":"0044-5231","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"0a71b53a-c500-4dde-87de-24221b9abbe4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd51734097073596a0b0b5","year":"2023","volume":"302","documentHash":"dcd845e0-6a65-4e9d-ad24-40b8a5026fe0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Taxonomy","Morphology","Reproducibility","Morphometrics","Mud dragons"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058422008"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655e","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Meler","uuid":"2F3E19BDA0F2EE6A613A21EFFEF27A1BC60F4AEB46F0BB7A9219CE27CAAC58E250F03C70E634CCEC4139860231895E5B061F61CFB1CC00D82DF8C993940FE3E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7112-5041","documentHash":"d0d5c686-65bf-47df-9360-d148ab143b30"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6554","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"7DC6EF7449E88C20028F95E36F2899248590FD2207946CC24EEAC57DA894C445DEA823F1DEF0C9D2E453AF0DE2D42CA22703FF05716B407C36835313CE67823A","orcidId":"0000-0001-9757-5553","documentHash":"02c62f14-ac99-4008-b257-09ecaa6160a4"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6545","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stoń-Egiert","uuid":"761936593A0A85A183D4328C890367B2F2F64EA207CBA8ABD568F50DE6BCEADC3C2ACFAC4786EF77370FE85E6437FA754AFFD2F08C89E1B051CDC877FA69B923","orcidId":"0000-0002-4274-8979","documentHash":"eef72685-4d70-4808-a6da-0ffdedc9843e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-02-21","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"637231c64097073559597fc1","doi":"10.1016/j.jmarsys.2022.103720","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0924796322000215?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Inherent optical properties of suspended particulate matter in the southern Baltic Sea in relation to the concentration, composition and characteristics of the particle size distribution; new forms of multicomponent parameterizations of optical properties","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper reports on detailed studies of the relationship between the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of suspended particulate matter populations occurring in southern Baltic Sea waters, and the basic biogeochemical and morphological quantities enabling these populations to be generally characterized. Specifically, these IOPs are the spectral absorption coefficients by all particulate matter, phytoplankton pigments and detritus, the spectral scattering and backscattering coefficients by particles, and the backscattering ratio. The biogeochemical properties of suspended matter populations are characterized by measuring concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), particulate organic matter (POM) and particulate inorganic matter (PIM), as well as concentrations of various phytoplankton pigments, including chlorophyll a (Chla). We also take particle size distributions (PSDs) into account. This diverse empirical material is used to describe how the typical relationships between the IOPs of suspended matter and the concentrations of the main water constituents (SPM or Chla) can be influenced by differences in the general composition and size distributions of the suspended matter. We statistically describe the possible impact on these relationships of the variability of composition ratios, such as POM/SPM and Chla/SPM, as well as the impact of the variability of certain characteristics calculated on the basis of PSDs: the average particle diameter weighted by the particle's projected area (DA), the average apparent density of particles (ρa), the average intracellular concentration of chlorophyll a (ci), and the corresponding products of these quantities. We also demonstrate the significant variability of the specific IOPs (SIOPs) by attempting to determine them in the classical way for our southern Baltic data, and we give a possible interpretation of this variability. On the basis of these analyses, we derive new, multicomponent IOP parameterizations that are functions of several variables. These new parameterizations enable the IOPs of suspended matter to be characterized and predicted with better accuracy than with the often-used standard one-component relationships."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655e","5e709347878c28a0473a6554","5e709347878c28a0473a6545"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"229","pagesFromTo":"103720","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6554","5e709347878c28a0473a655e","5e709347878c28a0473a6545"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478840","mniswId":"11737","title":"JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS","issn":"0924-7963","documentHash":"478f1714-1ebe-468b-bc71-d620605c9dc7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637231c64097073559597fc2","year":"2022","volume":"229","documentHash":"0a126cf7-3f5f-45e5-80f6-2ebed12775db"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Inherent optical properties (IOPs) of optically complex waters (spectral absorption, scattering and backscattering coefficients, backscattering ratio)","Suspended particulate matter composition (particulate organic and inorganic matter, chlorophyll a)","Particle size distributions (PSDs) (the average particle diameter weighted by the particle's projected area)","Apparent density of particles Intracellular concentration of chlorophyll a","Specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs)","Multicomponent parameterizations of IOPs Southern Baltic Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058425017"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6372273b409707355958b931","name":"Peter G.

The appropriate management of human activities is important not only to preserve wildlife, but also for the local communities that depend on ecotourism for employment and their economy. This study presents further insight into bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) responses to boats in New Quay Bay (West Wales) within the Cardigan Bay Special Area of Conservation. This region is heavily dependent on wildlife tourism, and marine traffic is regulated through a long-standing Code of Conduct. Based on a long-term dataset spanning the months of April to October and the years 2010–2018, the study found that compliance to a code of human behaviour increased dolphin positive responses towards boats. Dolphin responses to individual named boats and to different boat types were examined in greater detail. Speed boats, small motorboats, and kayaks were found to break the code most often, resulting in higher rates of negative response by dolphins. Visitor passenger boats formed the majority of boat traffic in the area, and showed greater compliance than other general recreational crafts. Suggestions are made for the better protection of the coastal dolphin population, as well as the role that citizen science can play to help achieve this goal through working directly with wildlife trip boats and the recruitment of local observers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc8b98c085dcb7999c2eb6f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"5185","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc8b98c085dcb7999c2eb6f","6372273b409707355958b931"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62662ab84097071c15d85102","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"4fc7b66f-ba84-4fed-a7c5-424b1db2c187"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable ocean","UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development","marine traffic management","Marine Protected Area","bottlenose dolphins","Cardigan Bay"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058425044"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6551","name":"Mirosława","lastName":"Ostrowska","uuid":"B19F1ECC6A8EEFB8503A9CAD4E91373462DDFD51C249E1F6501AC58A1EB4494AC18857F1276DC1CEF4E64AE4891F5EDB1D03B25DB68486E43C9DCA373032A9F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3738-3565","documentHash":"1121a880-5b1c-473a-a260-47f4e34c317c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6545","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stoń-Egiert","uuid":"761936593A0A85A183D4328C890367B2F2F64EA207CBA8ABD568F50DE6BCEADC3C2ACFAC4786EF77370FE85E6437FA754AFFD2F08C89E1B051CDC877FA69B923","orcidId":"0000-0002-4274-8979","documentHash":"eef72685-4d70-4808-a6da-0ffdedc9843e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-02-10","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63722dfd4097073559593d8b","doi":"10.1016/j.csr.2022.104666","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S027843432200022X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Long-term changes in phytoplankton pigment contents in the Baltic Sea: Trends and spatial variability during 20 years of investigations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The changes in phytoplankton pigment compositions and concentrations during a 20-year period of exploration of the Baltic Sea have been analysed. Both chlorophylls and carotenoids are characterized in the context of their monthly variations in the Gulf of Gdańsk and the open waters of southern Baltic Sea. It is assumed that pigment compositions are good markers of environmental changes, especially in the context of phytoplankton composition and biomass growth. Long-term trends and changes for both regions are established on the basis of marker pigment analyses for a period of two decades (1999–2018). Chlorophyll a, a marker of phytoplankton biomass, is clearly decreasing in both regions: −2.11% yr−1 (slope of trend curve −0.21) in the Gulf of Gdańsk and −2.41% yr−1 (slope −0.08) in the southern Baltic. Decreasing trends for several marker pigments have also been noted in both regions for the period in question, namely, fucoxanthin (diatom marker): −0.10% yr−1 in the Gulf of Gdańsk and the southern Baltic (respective slopes −0.0012 and −0.0003); alloxanthin (cryptophyte marker): −2.28% yr−1 (slope −0.012) in the Gulf of Gdańsk and −0.54% yr−1 (slope −0.001) in the southern Baltic; peridinin (dinoflagellate marker): −4.35% yr−1 (slope −0.05) in the Gulf of Gdańsk and −5.55% yr−1 (slope −0.02) in the southern Baltic. The decreases in the average concentrations of chlorophyll b (−1.30% yr−1, slope −0.008) and neoxanthin (−1.37% yr−1, slope −0.0014) have been slower in the Gulf of Gdańsk than in the southern Baltic (−3.31% yr−1, slope −0.013, and −3.38% yr−1, slope −0.0019 – respectively). In contrast, the yearly mean concentrations of zeaxanthin (the main cyanobacteria carotenoid) have increased significantly, to 7.16% yr−1 (slope 0.016) in the Gulf of Gdańsk and 1.45% yr−1 (slope 0.0022) in the southern Baltic. This may be the consequence of the reduced riverine supply of nutrients to these regions in recent years. The results indicate that the ecosystem of the Gulf of Gdańsk is responding more dynamically to eutrophication-related changes than the open waters of the southern Baltic Sea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6551","5e709347878c28a0473a6545"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"236","pagesFromTo":"104666","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6545","5e709347878c28a0473a6551"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777e6","mniswId":"4393","title":"CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH","issn":"0278-4343","documentHash":"b3e4e448-b14f-4600-800d-1420e5f6117d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63722dfd4097073559593d8c","year":"2022","volume":"236","documentHash":"fe8f8721-55c3-4f62-9e00-a0d957b3e3e8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Chlorophylls","Carotenoids","Baltic sea","Long-term changes","Trends"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058425235"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bbf34240970754861e022d","name":"Hannes","lastName":"Palang","documentHash":"9b4c764d-3cb5-4561-b413-8f7199d0de65"},{"objectId":"63bbf34240970754861e022c","name":"Ivo","lastName":"Vinogradovs","documentHash":"33adb8a3-85fd-40e8-b580-b718a6b02b4e"},{"objectId":"63bbf34240970754861e022b","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Zaucha","documentHash":"f2f79a11-44fb-4c14-a37f-b3d33be432e4"},{"objectId":"63bbf34240970754861e022a","name":"Kristīna","lastName":"Veidemane","documentHash":"4f81276b-fa5f-4553-85a3-e02eae45fab7"},{"objectId":"63bbf34240970754861e0229","name":"Anu","lastName":"Printsmann","documentHash":"37164895-2e85-4e06-b092-10646bef0eac"},{"objectId":"63bbf34240970754861e0228","name":"Anda","lastName":"Ruskule","documentHash":"fc4342d8-6fef-40c7-94bd-8e538f6b3095"},{"objectId":"63bbf34240970754861e0227","name":"Tarmo","lastName":"Pikner","documentHash":"1dbf65fb-ac07-46f6-936b-9400e6dc7acc"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6560","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Piwowarczyk","uuid":"599ED9A0406EA5EEAAE1F69E150C0EF3257B49B64FDC56E0F928FAB92909B8D8B19E5554952899242AF0296D865A11A5423C0A5694609848373A620AE85ED069","orcidId":"0000-0001-6864-5073","documentHash":"b4318cba-782a-4a0c-a814-c0839209fa46"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bbf34240970754861e0226","doi":"10.3390/su14042194","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/4/2194/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sociocultural Dimension of Land–Sea Interactions in Maritime Spatial Planning: Three Case Studies in the Baltic Sea Region","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Spatial planning faces challenges in addressing interactions between land and sea. This paper elaborates on land–sea interfaces, which can integrate certain socio-cultural values and related tensions into maritime spatial planning (MSP). In this article, three regional case studies from Estonia, Latvia, and Poland analysed important intersections between the formations of cultural values and spatial dynamics within MSP processes. These cases make it possible to address current challenges, contested boundaries, and spatial planning possibilities to embrace the vibrant and complex ways the sea becomes connected to societal change. The study indicates the multiplicity of land–sea interfaces, which should be involved in MSP through situated places of terraqueous interactions, means of public participation, and meaningful boundaries within mobilised co-existence. The actual and possible tensions in allocating new functions of maritime spaces indicate the importance of coastal landscapes and communities. Thus, MSP practice can employ the land–sea interfaces to advance regional planning through participatory engagements, which reveal sociocultural linkages between society and environment on coastal areas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6560"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"2194","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bbf34240970754861e0227","5e709347878c28a0473a6560","63bbf34240970754861e0228","63bbf34240970754861e0229","63bbf34240970754861e022a","63bbf34240970754861e022b","63bbf34240970754861e022c","63bbf34240970754861e022d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff3f8ad49b31ccec0f80e","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","documentHash":"4055bfb8-4fdb-408c-b314-7aa556a417fb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6214c6712467f02f1e614578","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"4","documentHash":"5c0996a8-e24a-485e-8109-cb4ab10a29a2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["maritime space","land–sea interactions","coastal landscape","cultural values","maritime spatial planning","Baltic Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058428039"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c0550","name":"Lars","lastName":"Stemmann","documentHash":"57ca12f4-a0e4-4595-8da5-77c27faec5b3"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c054f","name":"Anya","lastName":"Waite","documentHash":"5c9b715f-0a0e-4a09-8acd-02beec533fc8"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c054e","name":"Jessica S.","lastName":"Turner","documentHash":"723a66ec-0f1c-4eb0-bcc0-f0342f39778e"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c054d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Taucher","documentHash":"ea2b5ef9-1fe3-49c2-9cd7-b932439007ff"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c054c","name":"Toste","lastName":"Tanhua","documentHash":"901da1bf-1076-4a3e-b51b-0a8542fde950"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c054b","name":"Yuji","lastName":"Tanaka","documentHash":"58e3e69e-aecc-4f6f-a1af-3941263e9d24"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c054a","name":"Masashi","lastName":"Shibata","documentHash":"d704d7aa-0a11-4ce0-8541-1fee7a5cb0bd"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c0549","name":"Sarah","lastName":"Searson","documentHash":"78ea9191-fd45-4bf5-aa22-3bf5372358f4"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c0548","name":"Andreas","lastName":"Rogge","documentHash":"680600fe-e371-4d61-8937-eda2ab2a3ed2"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c0547","name":"Jessica L.","lastName":"Pretty","documentHash":"28a8c7a2-ba63-4546-9f13-3c4e52411ddc"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c0546","name":"Mark D.","lastName":"Ohman","documentHash":"a96c0139-19ed-4c45-9d82-db0bdd245405"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c0545","name":"Stephanie H.","lastName":"O'Daly","documentHash":"a98046a6-94fd-42b6-8441-f9109955e6cc"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c0544","name":"Margaux","lastName":"Noyon","documentHash":"cad02596-eb13-44e6-a488-463337bea6a4"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c0543","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Niemeyer","documentHash":"6df5f280-37b1-4d10-bf3c-2064ed1dcb29"},{"objectId":"63bbe99a40970754861c0542","name":"Andrew M.

The term “marine particles” describes detritus aggregates and fecal pellets as well as bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, zooplankton and nekton. Here, we present a global particle size distribution dataset obtained with several Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP5) camera systems. Overall, within the 64 µm to about 50 mm size range covered by the UVP5, detrital particles are the most abundant component of all marine particles; thus, measurements of the particle size distribution with the UVP5 can yield important information on detrital particle dynamics. During deployment, which is possible down to 6000 m depth, the UVP5 images a volume of about 1 L at a frequency of 6 to 20 Hz. Each image is segmented in real time, and size measurements of particles are automatically stored. All UVP5 units used to generate the dataset presented here were inter-calibrated using a UVP5 high-definition unit as reference. Our consistent particle size distribution dataset contains 8805 vertical profiles collected between 19 June 2008 and 23 November 2020. All major ocean basins, as well as the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, were sampled. A total of 19 % of all profiles had a maximum sampling depth shallower than 200 dbar, 38 % sampled at least the upper 1000 dbar depth range and 11 % went down to at least 3000 dbar depth. First analysis of the particle size distribution dataset shows that particle abundance is found to be high at high latitudes and in coastal areas where surface productivity or continental inputs are elevated. The lowest values are found in the deep ocean and in the oceanic gyres. Our dataset should be valuable for more in-depth studies that focus on the analysis of regional, temporal and global patterns of particle size distribution and flux as well as for the development and adjustment of regional and global biogeochemical models.

However, while the Barents Sea is one of the most biologically productive areas of the Arctic Ocean, carbon retention times were thought to be short. Here we present observations, complemented by numerical model simulations, that revealed a deep and widespread lateral injection of approximately 2.33 kt C d−1 from the Barents Sea shelf to some 1,200 m of the Nansen Basin, driven by Barents Sea Bottom Water transport. With increasing distance from the outflow region, the plume expanded and penetrated into even deeper waters and the sediment. The seasonally fluctuating but continuous injection increases the carbon sequestration of the Barents Sea by 1/3 and feeds the deep sea community of the Nansen Basin. Our findings combined with those from other outflow regions of carbon-rich polar dense waters highlight the importance of lateral injection as a global carbon sink. Resolving uncertainties around negative feedbacks of global warming due to sea ice decline will necessitate observation of changes in bottom water formation and biological productivity at a resolution high enough to quantify future deep carbon injection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bbeb5140970754861c2bc5","63bbeb5140970754861c2bc6","63bbeb5140970754861c2bc7","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","63bbeb5140970754861c2bc8","63bbeb5140970754861c2bc9","63bbeb5140970754861c2bca","63bbeb5140970754861c2bcb","63bbeb5140970754861c2bcc","63bbeb5140970754861c2bcd","63bbeb5140970754861c2bce","63bbeb5140970754861c2bcf","63bbeb5140970754861c2bd0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f81","mniswId":"14821","title":"Nature Geoscience","issn":"1752-0894","eissn":"1752-0908","documentHash":"b1c553e5-f37a-4e32-b5e1-5bdf05fa0907"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bbeb5140970754861c2bc4","year":"2022","documentHash":"3e453cdf-629f-43a2-8c17-e801ad780c9c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Carbon cycle","Marine biology","Physical oceanography"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058428597"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6524","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Sagan","uuid":"57C5DDEDCC8D71F0F19745E304EFC7113468B679832A0DE6E5A43977F37B36FE73537824810AECF18054AF48268ACA290026096E62E528ADA317E4DC919AE6D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4183-0337","documentHash":"aa1f9f99-b660-4bd8-8114-11a41db1685e"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6520","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Błachowiak-Samołyk","uuid":"8C6AD77D97DA3D9D5230CB20B5B200FB76893BFE72A48BE0BAB6068DBB7BD96049B3C885C6414B2EF04BBFB8AFD27AC9468868A23DB7A01FB8AEBEECC4EDAD0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8076-2168","documentHash":"5036109f-207f-446c-bac6-ec8dd36677f9"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399401","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dragańska-Deja","uuid":"F3EAA02DFAC467A0B6AA290F76F4855813CFB761111F487979FA81305FE2E9B5E73AD18BA23C0D869C46EA06D1D143048C3A13FED628746F8CCA55E63CB5B11A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5869-3167","documentHash":"da5e6d28-b24e-4231-a28b-eb6bceb7afd9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bbe52640970754861bc1b6","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2022.909457","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.909457/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Cells of matter and life – towards understanding the structuring of particles and plankton patchiness in the Arctic fjords","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As the environmental conditions are typically not homogenous, especially in coastal regions, they must provide a mosaic of distinct habitats that can be occupied by particles and plankton in a characteristic way. Here we analyze and map the spatio-temporal distribution patterns and the internal structure of 94 patches of various size fractions of particles and plankton studied by fine resolution measurements of two compatible laser counters performed in the upper epipelagial of two Arctic fjords over six summer seasons. Detected patches generally occupied only the minor part of the studied upper water column (on average 12%), and frequently occurred as multi-size-fraction forms. The observed concentrations within the patches were mostly 1.6 times higher than the background concentrations (max 4.1). The patches ranged in size horizontally from 1 to 92 km (median length 12 km) and vertically from 5 to 50 m (median 26 m). Because the designated patches varied in terms of their shapes and internal structure, a novel classification approach to of patches is proposed. Accordingly, seven types of patches were distinguished: Belt, Triangle, Diamond, Flare, Fingers, Flag, and Rosette. The particles and plankton exhibited all types of these distribution patterns, regardless of the size fraction and location. The observed steepening size spectra slopes over years implies that proliferating Atlantic water advection, triggering increasing role of the smallest size fractions, played the crucial role on compositional dynamics on temporal scale. The recurring high concentration patches of particles and plankton near glaciers suggest that their melting, together with biological production, were the strongest factors generating patchiness on the local scale. An observed under several occasions depth differentiation among size fractions building together vertically thin multi-size-fraction patches is an interesting feature for further studies. Even if distribution patterns of particles and plankton did not clearly reflect all patterns in the environmental water structuring, they happened to be related to the presence of glacier runoff, eddy, sea mountain and hot spots of chlorophyll fluorescence."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a047399401","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","5e709347878c28a0473a6524"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"909457","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e70929e878c28a047399401","5e709347878c28a0473a6524","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a523b2467f06a1edbdb2f","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"17b56cb2-5e8f-41ce-a89d-d4b387701e78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["particles","plankton","distribution","patchiness","size","Arctic","fjords"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058428625"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63760b6540970765d466fe03","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Puczko","documentHash":"baa0de54-8e9c-47bf-9489-4c6037e74878"},{"objectId":"63760b6540970765d466fe02","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Różycki","documentHash":"8c404a56-983e-4a1a-8311-bf6d532b0c94"},{"objectId":"5e7094ed878c28a0473c717f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Saniewski","uuid":"73D372462BCFCB5B5D0D49E2207DF9797C0B847808F117642642D43A49BB2C3C0E6EE4DDCC31778F9F88EF0249A6D812E7017ADAD91BE797603D5F9604825B98","orcidId":"0000-0002-2347-1660","documentHash":"974674eb-b8f5-42d1-ba40-6460bd4b3fef"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7aee","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Kontny","uuid":"0776051E730640B6608DD212CE4CB345A0E650997A7683D219956AF5D2DE0170C86FE08F86872385CF54631C9468B298DFE18D9ACF750BE07D467DB570EBEE0B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3627-046X","documentHash":"eaa46a11-2901-4131-b42a-9b5fffa10f4d"},{"objectId":"5e7092bf878c28a04739bec8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pydyn","uuid":"26B2968338A2B3D89E5B08FF4B5AC927038BA53B602BFA8DD0C8F096B4D5535186598885B4BA54F6FB0CF9323164C41C41AFABD607D551969B71B418369E3031","orcidId":"0000-0001-9478-9863","documentHash":"42f5d89c-4472-41f8-b9d5-a601f6170024"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63760b6540970765d466fdfe","doi":"10.2478/phr-2021-0018","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/phr-2021-0018","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Scientific Diving in Poland and Invitation to the Polish Committee on Scientific Diving","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Scientific diving (i.e. diving for research purposes organised  by universities and research institutes) was excluded  from the  Act on  the  performance of underwater works in 2014.

Understanding the relationship between environmental factors and the morphological response of macroalgae is essential. The main aim of this study was to investigate the impact of factors associated with glacial activity and depth on the variability of dominant kelp species in the Arctic fjord, Hornsund. A total of 347 individuals of three kelp species (Alaria esculenta, cf. Laminaria digitata, Saccharina latissima) were collected in July 2003 at three sites located at different distances from glacier outflows (two sites under the influence of active tidewater glaciers and one site without any glacial impact) and at two depths (5 and 10 m). The length and wet weight of the thallus, blade and stipe were measured. The morphological response to environmental conditions was complex and species-specific. At one glacier-proximal site, light limitations due to seasonally increasing mineral particle flux did not affect kelp morphology, while iceberg scouring could have caused a reduction in kelp size and biomass at another site. Depth had a significant effect on the morphological traits of A. esculenta and S. latissima, which tended to have longer and heavier stipes at greater depths, most likely to improve light capture. No effect of depth on morphological traits of cf. L. digitata was noted. Regression models between thallus biomass and length, constructed for the kelp species that were studied, can be used in non-destructive kelp biomass estimations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e709347878c28a0473a651e","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"268","pagesFromTo":"107802","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e709347878c28a0473a651e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff6e5ad49b31ccec45400","title":"ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE","issn":"0272-7714","eissn":"0272-7714","documentHash":"64c72aa1-680a-4d82-a501-ad88a0c3728d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd61b34097073596a26aad","year":"2022","volume":"268","documentHash":"984f0dae-ff0a-44d4-a30b-607ab4f1d328"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Macroalgae","Morphological plasticity","Arctic","Glacial impact","Global warming"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058431503"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead8a","name":"Sebastien","lastName":"Moreau","documentHash":"b3e090a4-7300-4e64-a978-026bc9b53b75"},{"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead89","name":"Thomas J.","lastName":"Ryan-Keogh","documentHash":"9250b1c8-e99a-4a0d-a99f-d52ec3897da7"},{"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead88","name":"Asmita","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"f2643b2d-4a47-43a2-8697-3e6baf62ec53"},{"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead87","name":"Gunnar","lastName":"Bratbak","documentHash":"28593bc9-68b2-470e-842e-30c9005c439e"},{"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead86","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Różańska-Pluta","documentHash":"4a90550d-6007-405b-9fbe-35a3d1e3ee21"},{"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead85","name":"Ilka","lastName":"Peeken","documentHash":"5dc9b232-a2e7-4e3c-8bc4-d8550a101140"},{"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead84","name":"Philipp","lastName":"Assmy","documentHash":"dd645f51-4754-47b6-a829-88f2ca517f79"},{"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead83","name":"Hanna M.","lastName":"Kauko","documentHash":"04eeaf25-a60c-48f4-9815-cf16f1403f97"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655c","name":"Józef","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"E8901DD6BAD74E4F0A531BC69DC86134B02AC9BDAB17361AAFA79F2ED26ABBC473DFEDC614DF70B146B917A0E212BFD4740299FB5AB0C805A789195BA88BE5E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2344-0047","documentHash":"6a141822-0a06-4fc9-83c5-d08f585c8615"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead81","doi":"10.5194/bg-19-5449-2022","publicUri":"https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/19/5449/2022/bg-19-5449-2022.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"First phytoplankton community assessment of the Kong Håkon VII Hav, Southern Ocean, during austral autumn","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We studied phytoplankton and protozooplankton community composition based on light microscopy, flow cytometry, and photosynthetic pigment data in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean during March 2019 (early austral autumn). Sampling was focused on the area east of the prime meridian in the Kong Håkon VII Hav, including Astrid Ridge, Maud Rise, and a south–north transect at 6∘ E. Phytoplankton community composition throughout the studied area was characterized by oceanic diatoms typical of the iron-depleted high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) Southern Ocean. Topography and wind-driven iron supply likely sustained blooms dominated by the centric diatom Chaetoceros dichaeta at Maud Rise and at a station north of the 6∘ E transect. For the remainder of the 6∘ E transect, diatom composition was similar to the previously mentioned bloom stations, but flagellates dominated in abundance, suggesting a post-bloom situation and likely top-down control by krill on the bloom-forming diatoms. Among flagellates, species with haptophyte-type pigments were the dominating group. At Astrid Ridge, overall abundances were lower and pennate diatoms were more numerous than centric diatoms, but the community composition was nevertheless typical of HNLC areas. The observations described here show that C. dichaeta can form blooms beyond the background biomass level and also fuels both carbon export and upper trophic levels within HNLC areas. This study is the first thorough assessment of phytoplankton communities in this region and can be compared to other seasons in future studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"5449-5482","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bbfbd740970754861ead83","63bbfbd740970754861ead84","63bbfbd740970754861ead85","63bbfbd740970754861ead86","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","63bbfbd740970754861ead87","63bbfbd740970754861ead88","63bbfbd740970754861ead89","63bbfbd740970754861ead8a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477336","mniswId":"2417","title":"Biogeosciences","issn":"1726-4189","websiteLink":"www.biogeosciences.net/12/6493/2015/","documentHash":"9312d442-03bc-4ac9-b1b5-5323c52b58fc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bbfbd740970754861ead82","year":"2022","volume":"19","number":"23","documentHash":"e02b7aa2-8096-4113-bb61-b594783c53e9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058431671"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd40e040970735969e7499","name":"Diane K.","lastName":"Adams","documentHash":"f952a012-a4f8-49d0-9fc3-ca4bbc80ee80"},{"objectId":"618353b97523400564d8208b","name":"Emily","lastName":"Chen","uuid":"6B311B4CDC9253043464ADEBC26F3967522B41174899E36A9F14EC008CDD8CD40A7944EA44CC69361554755A3803DBB1679B389881DF802EDC855330DB92C45A","documentHash":"a5b6ecec-22d5-4f99-af00-844d8d498d26"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bd40e040970735969e7498","doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-15583-y","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15583-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The evolution of neurosensation provides opportunities and constraints for phenotypic plasticity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Phenotypic plasticity is widely regarded as important for enabling species resilience to environmental change and for species evolution.

The neurosensory foundation for plasticity was ancestral within the echinoids. However, coincident development of the plastic trait and the neurosensory system was not achieved until the regular urchins, likely due to pleiotropic effects and linkages between the two colocalized systems. Plasticity continues to evolve within the urchins with numerous instances of losses associated with loss of sensory abilities and neurons, consistent with a cost of maintaining these capabilities.

Yet, little is known about biodiversity and recruitment of these hard-bottom communities or the bioeroders degrading them, and there is a demand for carbonate budgets to include respective rates of polar carbonate build-up and bioerosion. To address these issues, a 10-year settlement and bioerosion experiment was carried out at the Arctic Svalbard archipelago in and downslope of a rhodolith bed.\n\nThe calcifiers recorded on experimental settlement tiles (56 taxa) were dominated by bryozoans, serpulids and foraminiferans. The majority of the bioerosion traces (30 ichnotaxa) were microborings, followed by attachment etchings and grazing traces. Biodiversity metrics show that calcifier diversity and bioerosion ichnodiversity are both elevated in the rhodolith bed, if compared to adjacent aphotic waters, but these differences are statistically insignificant. Accordingly, there were only low to moderate dissimilarities in the calcifier community structure and bioerosion trace assemblages between the two depth stations (46 and 127 m), substrate orientations (up- and down-facing) and substrate types (PVC and limestone), in that order of relevance. In contrast, surface coverage as well as the carbonate accretion and bioerosion rates were all significantly elevated in the rhodolith bed, reflecting higher abundance or size of calcifiers and bioerosion traces. All three measures were highest for up-facing substrates at 46 m, with a mean coverage of 78.2% (on PVC substrates), a mean accretion rate of 24.6 g m−2  year−1 (PVC), and a mean bioerosion rate of −35.1 g m−2 year−1 (limestone). Differences in these metrics depend on the same order of factors than the community structure. Considering all limestone substrates of the two platforms, carbonate accretion and bioerosion were nearly in balance at a net rate of −2.5 g m−2 year−1.\n\nA latitudinal comparison with previous settlement studies in the North Atlantic suggests that despite the harsh polar environment there is neither a depletion in the diversity of hard-bottom calcifier communities nor in the ichnodiversity of grazing traces, attachment etchings and microborings formed by organotrophs. In contrast, microborings produced by phototrophs are strongly depleted because of limitations in the availability of light (condensed photic zonation, polar night, shading by sea ice). Also, macroborings were almost absent, surprisingly. With respect to carbonate production, the Svalbard carbonate factory marks the low end of a latitudinal gradient while bioerosion rates are similar or even higher than at comparable depth or photic regime at lower latitudes, although this might not apply to shallow euphotic waters (not covered in our experiment), given the observed depletion in bioeroding microphytes and macroborers. While echinoid grazing is particularly relevant for the bioerosion in the rhodolith bed, respective rates are far lower than those reported from tropical shallow-water coral reefs. The slow pace of carbonate production but relatively high rates of bioerosion (both promoted by low carbonate supersaturation states in Arctic waters), in concert with high retention of skeletal carbonates on the seafloor and no calcite cements forming in open pore space created by microborers, suggest a low fossilisation potential for polar carbonates, such as those formed in the Mosselbukta rhodolith beds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"112-136","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bd6c084097073596a36fa7","63bd6c084097073596a36fa8","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","63bd6c084097073596a36fa9","63bd6c084097073596a36faa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477de6","mniswId":"7057","title":"Geobiology","issn":"1472-4677","eissn":"1472-4669","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0667c1a8-7215-4e74-aba8-5b0c266967b6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd6c084097073596a36fa6","year":"2021","volume":"20","number":"1","documentHash":"ea3f3562-7eb1-4073-9b8c-c18b4bfcd168"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058431913"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63be8d6240970720586f3f00","name":"Pedro","lastName":"Nogueira","documentHash":"cebdde1a-2b99-447d-80c8-4e5723a44606"},{"objectId":"63be8d6240970720586f3eff","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kowalczyk","documentHash":"6beff03f-868b-42bc-a6b9-2634d53e6b18"},{"objectId":"63be8d6240970720586f3efc","name":"Klaus","lastName":"Wysujack","documentHash":"dd6c2ddf-4edc-4b77-9e1d-a4973e87d9f3"},{"objectId":"63be8d6240970720586f3efa","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Wilczynski","documentHash":"59c683cb-2b77-42df-9de5-76c802e8b374"},{"objectId":"616a392975234017e0545a19","name":"Michał","lastName":"Czub","uuid":"FCFB5B9C17405282715072B88E1F2C194F10A142DD2679F3AF7359F77C1F7615B390AB95B324B7FC5AA3847B11D08E9DCB196141287BB18D64552F69627F3205","orcidId":"0000-0001-5703-3549","documentHash":"c50db1e4-7b3e-4b5a-ab2a-e9f705da3b1b"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1a49","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Maszczyk","uuid":"F9235EED81EA5D9B600C25D4C5206E63CB3BA057358C45ECD2009370575846A7484C5EF01C1EA0EFD3219421FA230A0C0EDE4C9F6CEFD693ECE13B4CE7F60E57","orcidId":"0000-0002-1738-419X","documentHash":"f0da291d-8482-4d11-8190-4f5284f7da24"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa92","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Brzeziński","uuid":"1A67614903E6B2D1D19935D458FB79723792E3B9A1A3BC579FFFF526B453B94000AF13607B0DFF227AAC998066A6AA6956381D277691271BBADDCAA4796684E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7516-9658","documentHash":"3b8ecfbc-8124-4123-8578-ef8b308ffa5e"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a793e","name":"Monika","lastName":"Radlińska","uuid":"18F0B318078D93D662255FCC72098932AC841D273E67713011A591AC4323BC7A454F44C2619A10AFF821BFBBDADE9E6498602A3741CD3A793FF1F988663D80B4","orcidId":"0000-0001-6818-8685","documentHash":"f9ec3e11-2e56-4e9f-8612-badac327bb94"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a653d","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Bełdowski","uuid":"6324C413899A7D55052C03674F85929919743CC2BC68B3E5B4AAA45F79E47792E7A3EC3C7CC1F75C0C115EC7B074EE3974D7F11A989D51502B88F15260A2C634","orcidId":"0000-0002-2891-1901","documentHash":"2d9f6169-3657-4886-b7c4-74b2ba5045de"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63be8d6240970720586f3ef9","doi":"10.3390/toxics10050206","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6304/10/5/206/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Metagenomic Analysis of the Gastrointestinal Microbiota of Gadus morhua callarias L.

CWAs have started leaking from corroded munitions, and their presence in the environment and in organisms inhabiting dump sites has been detected. The presence of CWAs in the water negatively affects fish, macrobenthos and free-living bacteria. It can be expected that the presence of CWAs would also affect the gut-associated bacteria in fish, which are vital for their condition. The main aim of this study was to test if the microbiota of cod collected in the Baltic Bornholm Deep (highly polluted with CWAs) is dysregulated. To investigate this, we conducted metagenomic studies based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that the microbiota of cod inhabiting the dump site was significantly less taxonomically diverse compared to those from a non-polluted reference site. Moreover, taxa associated with fish diseases (e.g., Vibrionaceae, Aeromonadaceae) were more prevalent, and probiotic taxa (e.g., Actinobacteriota, Rhodobacteraceae) were less frequent in the guts of individuals from the dump site, than those from the reference site. The differences in vulnerability of various bacterial taxa inhabiting cod gastrointestinal tracts to CWAs were hypothesised to be responsible for the observed microbiota dysregulation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a793e","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa92","63be8d6240970720586f3eff","5e7094af878c28a0473c1a49","616a392975234017e0545a19"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a653d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"206","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63be8d6240970720586f3efa","5e709356878c28a0473a793e","63be8d6240970720586f3efc","616a392975234017e0545a19","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa92","63be8d6240970720586f3eff","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","63be8d6240970720586f3f00","5e7094af878c28a0473c1a49"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d4d6","mniswId":"19614","title":"Toxics","issn":"2305-6304","eissn":"2305-6304","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"371f6da5-dd09-41f5-a285-529cc77630ec"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b9a82440970710ec72f399","year":"2022","volume":"10","number":"5","documentHash":"af0b1fef-e2e5-4a8c-bdcb-52edf927356d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["16S rRNA metagenomics","eastern Baltic cod","Baltic Sea","Bornholm Deep","chemical warfare agents","CWAs","microbiome"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058434979"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63be999f40970720587082bc","name":"Willem","lastName":"Renema","documentHash":"0dea6b9b-ce2d-45ef-8e31-06d01d588509"},{"objectId":"63be999f40970720587082bb","name":"Elsa B.","lastName":"Girard","documentHash":"3194f407-ed6e-4973-ac8c-20b746d38d0d"},{"objectId":"63be999f40970720587082ba","name":"Maria","lastName":"Holzmann","documentHash":"741d2dfa-95ac-43b4-b7af-168a160db31c"},{"objectId":"63be999f40970720587082b9","name":"Dimitra Maria","lastName":"Bloska","documentHash":"50bf18f1-8983-4817-9603-4947a528d9ec"},{"objectId":"63be999f40970720587082b8","name":"Jan-Niklas","lastName":"Macher","documentHash":"c7a37485-4c9e-41e2-969a-657dd1f3075b"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63be999f40970720587082b7","doi":"10.7717/peerj.13952","publicUri":"https://peerj.com/articles/13952.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) metabarcoding of Foraminifera communities using taxon-specific primers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Foraminifera are a species-rich phylum of rhizarian protists that are highly abundant in most marine environments. Molecular methods such as metabarcoding have revealed a high, yet undescribed diversity of Foraminifera. However, so far only one molecular marker, the 18S ribosomal RNA, was available for metabarcoding studies on Foraminifera. Primers that allow amplification of foraminiferal mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and identification of Foraminifera species were recently published. Here we test the performance of these primers for the amplification of whole foraminiferal communities, and compare their performance to that of the highly degenerate LerayXT primers, which amplify the same COI region in a wide range of eukaryotes. We applied metabarcoding to 48 samples taken along three transects spanning a North Sea beach in the Netherlands from dunes to the low tide level, and analysed both sediment samples and meiofauna samples, which contained taxa between 42 µm and 1 mm in body size obtained by decantation from sand samples. We used single-cell metabarcoding (Girard et al., 2022) to generate a COI reference library containing 32 species of Foraminifera, and used this to taxonomically annotate our community metabarcoding data. Our analyses show that the highly degenerate LerayXT primers do not amplify Foraminifera, while the Foraminifera primers are highly Foraminifera- specific, with about 90% of reads assigned to Foraminifera and amplifying taxa from all major groups, i.e., monothalamids, Globothalamea, and Tubothalamea. We identified 176 Foraminifera ASVs and found a change in Foraminifera community composition along the beach transects from high tide to low tide level, and a dominance of single-chambered monothalamid Foraminifera. Our results highlight that COI metabarcoding can be a powerful tool for assessing Foraminiferal communities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"e13952","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63be999f40970720587082b8","63be999f40970720587082b9","63be999f40970720587082ba","63be999f40970720587082bb","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","63be999f40970720587082bc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454791e1","mniswId":"15841","title":"PeerJ","issn":"2167-8359","eissn":"2167-8359","documentHash":"19ef043f-10d2-400d-b8dc-7fc8f39d4358"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f795e92467f01b5a145410","year":"2022","volume":"10","documentHash":"e49a7406-3036-4d7c-beb0-21fd12ae9576"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Foraminifera","Metabarcoding","Beach","Community composition","Intertidal","Molecular biodiversity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058435549"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"637f24d040970740f0171482","name":"Michal","lastName":"Kucera","documentHash":"ec07397d-83c1-43a7-9f55-c85690cdee18"},{"objectId":"637f24d040970740f0171481","name":"Christophe J.","lastName":"Douady","documentHash":"defad35d-397b-481b-a72a-0c3414286053"},{"objectId":"637f24d040970740f0171480","name":"Sylvain","lastName":"Rigaud","documentHash":"80775c6e-4090-4f97-aefc-9718629292f7"},{"objectId":"637f24d040970740f017147f","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Fernandez-Guerra","documentHash":"4e83dda8-b959-4d7c-84ab-1be30214a76b"},{"objectId":"637f24d040970740f017147e","name":"Christiane","lastName":"Hassenrück","documentHash":"e8995616-00a2-4927-9df6-68e3e8ad8524"},{"objectId":"637f24d040970740f017147d","name":"Raphaël","lastName":"Morard","documentHash":"b7f8b55a-4b42-4f98-93e6-aad0bb075449"},{"objectId":"615bb8a875234017e04eda8d","name":"Mattia","lastName":"Greco","uuid":"476734BF5B11C961C32223CB7E068E727168B16E760C3E65EA2F3EC44B69129BF9B0032DEB1211FF34D5CFC2FCB55E40881DD6805DEFB2513B12C9EE93082646","documentHash":"120e02af-f940-4384-9c8e-2f3addeb7ff7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"637f24d040970740f017147c","doi":"10.1038/s41467-022-34794-5","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34794-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Renewal of planktonic foraminifera diversity after the Cretaceous Paleogene mass extinction by benthic colonizers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The biotic crisis following the end-Cretaceous asteroid impact resulted in a dramatic renewal of pelagic biodiversity.

Here we queried a surface ocean metabarcoding dataset to show that calcareous benthic foraminifera of the clade Globothalamea are able to disperse actively in the plankton, and we show using molecular clock phylogeny that the modern planktonic clades originated from different benthic ancestors that colonized the plankton after the end-Cretaceous crisis. We conclude that the diversity of planktonic foraminifera has been the result of a constant leakage of benthic foraminifera diversity into the plankton, continuously refueling the planktonic niche, and challenge the classical interpretation of the fossil record that suggests that Mesozoic planktonic foraminifera gave rise to the modern communities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["615bb8a875234017e04eda8d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["637f24d040970740f017147d","637f24d040970740f017147e","615bb8a875234017e04eda8d","637f24d040970740f017147f","637f24d040970740f0171480","637f24d040970740f0171481","637f24d040970740f0171482"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f7e","mniswId":"14814","title":"Nature Communications","issn":"2041-1723","eissn":"2041-1723","documentHash":"e40c6952-ce52-4407-9db9-d138811afced"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dc96392467f07650eac0d7","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"5075a1ce-6596-465d-a494-a531d8da9117"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Microbial biooceanography","Molecular ecology","Palaeoecology","Palaeontology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058453082"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be9","name":"Hailong","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"027c6585-8db6-42af-94ac-6ffe7fc69c4a"},{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be8","name":"Julienne","lastName":"Stroeve","documentHash":"17722e1c-d574-4d53-9c5d-b7e05e1435f3"},{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be7","name":"Mark W.","lastName":"Seefeldt","documentHash":"0f668c71-fe3d-4dbe-bb65-7b195a31dd13"},{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be6","name":"Samy","lastName":"Kamal","documentHash":"8287d46a-584d-4da5-8aab-3bf98fc4b93a"},{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be5","name":"Anthony P.","lastName":"Craig","documentHash":"554cb5f5-d663-4ea0-8433-e2042dce3167"},{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be4","name":"Jaclyn","lastName":"Clement Kinney","documentHash":"9d5f2cb0-1997-4afa-85ff-0fac791da6ec"},{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be3","name":"John J.","lastName":"Cassano","documentHash":"ed6404f7-a786-4656-8356-2c20d79defbd"},{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be2","name":"Wieslaw","lastName":"Maslowski","documentHash":"44353d1c-d0ff-4c60-93de-1009af50180d"},{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be1","name":"Younjoo J.","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"2ce53bf0-b977-4882-9b88-fc57f24bcdf3"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6531","name":"Robert","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"2D5DB9D57FC7F36F61EC129D9952718B8EE760677732DD55A275E92756962D368291051F6920872AC1B25967C13152ED107489FCB8248776FDD5045A6623150F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8698-0799","documentHash":"5a7dc855-7273-4918-89fd-9450b6dfc8de"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02bdf","doi":"10.5194/tc-17-233-2023","publicUri":"https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/17/233/2023/tc-17-233-2023.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Causes and evolution of winter polynyas north of Greenland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During the 42-year period (1979–2020) of satellite measurements, four major winter (December–March) polynyas have been observed north of Greenland: one in December 1986 and three in the last decade, i.e., February of 2011, 2017, and 2018. The 2018 polynya was unparalleled in its magnitude and duration compared to the three previous events. Given the apparent recent increase in the occurrence of these extreme events, this study aims to examine their evolution and causality, in terms of forced versus natural variability. The limited weather station and remotely sensed sea ice data are analyzed combining with output from the fully coupled Regional Arctic System Model (RASM), including one hindcast and two ensemble simulations. We found that neither the accompanying anomalous warm surface air intrusion nor the ocean below had an impact (i.e., no significant ice melting) on the evolution of the observed winter open-water episodes in the region. Instead, the extreme atmospheric wind forcing resulted in greater sea ice deformation and transport offshore, accounting for the majority of sea ice loss in all four polynyas. Our analysis suggests that strong southerly winds (i.e., northward wind with speeds greater than 10 m s−1) blowing persistently over the study region for at least 2 d or more were required over the study region to mechanically redistribute some of the thickest Arctic sea ice out of the region and thus to create open-water areas (i.e., a latent heat polynya). To assess the role of internal variability versus external forcing of such events, we carried out and examined results from the two RASM ensembles dynamically downscaled with output from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Decadal Prediction Large Ensemble (DPLE) simulations. Out of 100 winters in each of the two ensembles (initialized 30 years apart: one in December 1985 and another in December 2015), 17 and 16 winter polynyas were produced north of Greenland, respectively. The frequency of polynya occurrence had no apparent sensitivity to the initial sea ice thickness in the study area pointing to internal variability of atmospheric forcing as a dominant cause of winter polynyas north of Greenland. We assert that dynamical downscaling using a high-resolution regional climate model offers a robust tool for process-level examination in space and time, synthesis with limited observations, and probabilistic forecasts of Arctic events, such as the ones being investigated here and elsewhere."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6531"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"233-253","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63cfa2e14097075010f02be1","63cfa2e14097075010f02be2","63cfa2e14097075010f02be3","63cfa2e14097075010f02be4","63cfa2e14097075010f02be5","63cfa2e14097075010f02be6","5e709347878c28a0473a6531","63cfa2e14097075010f02be7","63cfa2e14097075010f02be8","63cfa2e14097075010f02be9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffcb1ad49b31ccecc0822","title":"THE CRYOSPHERE","issn":"1994-0416","eissn":"1994-0424","documentHash":"e058d8ff-4700-45b6-88df-4f4beb260189"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cfa2e14097075010f02be0","year":"2023","volume":"17","number":"1","documentHash":"8e3fab76-47b7-4a07-aafd-2246d2859cdc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058460911"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63eb44124097075ca50eaf1d","name":"Helmuth","lastName":"Thomas","documentHash":"4872bf16-a1d5-46c9-a5d1-bbe722677f7a"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szymczycha","uuid":"F594DC6E0A245A248EACAF139383FF10C32DD82FE0DACFF05A102D4A7E645FB7586B6A7F34800C8363F445238D1E4A8D328549DE8D315F239B00D5F69B7F8C87","orcidId":"0000-0002-5815-215X","documentHash":"0a8a40d0-e3be-4cb4-9e67-7af031f250d1"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kuliński","uuid":"A1362FEB3C94D210BA97D7C5FE392ED27FB4DD61D0B2476A4F5C18B20F589C7FA21F35A13EA5510511C60D24A7EAD1FC4FDC75E86C1645B920BA2AE06C994826","orcidId":"0000-0002-5403-6629","documentHash":"8009c04f-1ba9-4687-80f3-d96316801246"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739941d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Koziorowska-Makuch","uuid":"3509723B3C9ACF6AC999AADF8F9DFFCBC59EBD1303980F82ED6C7F4BD7719E1581D1822C26EAABF3F62D27DEB38E556101B6169DCDBBF6E954F2721AB7FCCE40","orcidId":"0000-0002-9111-9597","documentHash":"f1a7632d-a947-4305-b1e3-6d63b76e893b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63eb44124097075ca50eaf1b","doi":"10.1016/j.pocean.2023.102977","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0079661123000204?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The marine carbonate system variability in high meltwater season (Spitsbergen Fjords, Svalbard)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The spatial variability in hydrography (salinity and temperature) and carbonate chemistry (alkalinity - AT, total inorganic carbon concentration - CT, pH, CO2 partial pressure - pCO2, and the saturation state of aragonite - ΩAr) in high meltwater season (summer) was investigated in four Spitsbergen fjords - Krossfjorden, Kongsfjorden, Isfjorden, and Hornsund. It was found that the differences in hydrology entail spatial changes in the CO2 system structure. AT decline with decreasing salinity was evident, hence it is clear that freshwater input generally has a diluting effect and lowers AT in the surface waters of the Spitsbergen fjords. Significant surface water AT variability (1889–2261 µmol kg−1) reveals the complexity of the fjords’ systems with multiple freshwater sources having different alkalinity end-member characteristics and identifies the mean AT freshwater end-member of 595 ± 84 µmol kg−1 for the entire region. The effect of AT fluxes from sediments on the bottom water was rather insignificant, despite high AT values (2288–2666 μmol kg−1) observed in the pore waters. Low pCO2 results in surface water (200–295 μatm) points to intensive biological production, which can strongly affect the CT values, however, is less important for shaping alkalinity. It has also been shown that the freshening of the surface water in the fjords reduces significantly ΩAr (an increase in freshwater fraction contribution by 1% causes a decrease in ΩAr by 0.022). Although during the polar day, due to low pCO2, ΩAr values are still rather far from 1 (they ranged from 1.4 to 2.5), during polar night, when pCO2 values are much higher, ΩAr may drop markedly. This study highlights that the use of salinity to estimate the potential alkalinity can carry a high uncertainty, while good recognition of the surface water AT variability and its freshwater end-members is key to predict marine CO2 system changes along with the ongoing freshening of fjords waters due to climate warming."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"211","pagesFromTo":"102977","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a04739941d","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","63eb44124097075ca50eaf1d","5e709347878c28a0473a654a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"7e1c7752-65e9-429c-b429-b79645a6e04f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63eb44124097075ca50eaf1c","year":"2023","volume":"211","documentHash":"790894c0-02f1-4190-a3b4-72bb3eae9957"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Alkalinity","Saturation state of aragonite","pH","pCO2","Ocean acidification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058516207"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"640877d84097070bdc84535d","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Jankowska","documentHash":"2d21ebdb-01ab-4da4-8a1b-f410fd27c6cd"},{"objectId":"640877d84097070bdc84535c","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sokołowski","documentHash":"0ba5282c-9627-46a3-b746-8dbeafe1cc8b"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"}],"objectId":"640877d84097070bdc84535b","publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.ug.edu.pl/produkt/zatoka-pucka-tom-iii-aspekty-swiata-ozywionego/","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Siedliska dna Zatoki Puckiej","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"126-144","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["640877d84097070bdc84535c","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","640877d84097070bdc84535d"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6405e98540970761b8e23a8b","title":"Zatoka Pucka.

upwelling of iron sustains dense blooms and food webs in the eastern Weddell Gyre","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Southern Ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic CO2 and an important foraging area for top trophic level consumers. However, iron limitation sets an upper limit to primary productivity. Here we report on a considerably dense late summer phytoplankton bloom spanning 9000 km2 in the open ocean of the eastern Weddell Gyre. Over its 2.5 months duration, the bloom accumulated up to 20 g C m−2 of organic matter, which is unusually high for Southern Ocean open waters. We show that, over 1997–2019, this open ocean bloom was likely driven by anomalies in easterly winds that push sea ice southwards and favor the upwelling of Warm Deep Water enriched in hydrothermal iron and, possibly, other iron sources. This recurring open ocean bloom likely facilitates enhanced carbon export and sustains high standing stocks of Antarctic krill, supporting feeding hot spots for marine birds and baleen whales."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c","640af4434097073c0f49ff8e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1303","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["640af4434097073c0f49ff79","640af4434097073c0f49ff7a","640af4434097073c0f49ff7b","640af4434097073c0f49ff7c","640af4434097073c0f49ff7d","640af4434097073c0f49ff7e","640af4434097073c0f49ff7f","640af4434097073c0f49ff80","640af4434097073c0f49ff81","640af4434097073c0f49ff82","640af4434097073c0f49ff83","640af4434097073c0f49ff84","640af4434097073c0f49ff85","640af4434097073c0f49ff86","640af4434097073c0f49ff87","640af4434097073c0f49ff88","640af4434097073c0f49ff89","640af4434097073c0f49ff8a","640af4434097073c0f49ff8b","640af4434097073c0f49ff8c","640af4434097073c0f49ff8d","640af4434097073c0f49ff8e","640af4434097073c0f49ff8f","640af4434097073c0f49ff90","640af4434097073c0f49ff91","640af4434097073c0f49ff92","640af4434097073c0f49ff93","640af4434097073c0f49ff94","640af4434097073c0f49ff95","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","640af4434097073c0f49ff96"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f7e","mniswId":"14814","title":"Nature Communications","issn":"2041-1723","eissn":"2041-1723","documentHash":"8ac6042b-5d3a-47c7-90e7-2c25bff3698a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fb7a924097070abf6baa05","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"fe865c37-e3db-4018-9d45-5ce1bd87e54e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Carbon cycle","Marine biology","Marine chemistry","Physical oceanography"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058536542"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"640878c44097070bdc845cbc","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Jankowska","documentHash":"43b32a4f-f74c-4031-9dd1-7c56ce0ba346"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651e","name":"Maria","lastName":"Włodarska-Kowalczuk","uuid":"D47553F9A2C33D8033D8594650BFC32CC9C68EF6F3EE4CE130DBEC8BA3DF82ED9A7055BF1E4316109AD31C2E6DBEF73F3FEF158A522731E002B07E209F106EDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2757-1108","documentHash":"01d767d9-9266-45a4-bd4b-a8cf8d1e8a8e"}],"objectId":"640878c44097070bdc845cbb","publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.ug.edu.pl/produkt/zatoka-pucka-tom-iii-aspekty-swiata-ozywionego/","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Bentosowe sieci troficzne Zatoki Puckiej","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a651e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"201-207","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["640878c44097070bdc845cbc","5e709347878c28a0473a651e"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6405e98540970761b8e23a8b","title":"Zatoka Pucka.

Here, we elucidate the environmental drivers shaping the composition, abundance, biomass, trophic state and vertical flux of protists (unicellular eukaryotes), including phytoplankton, in the Barents Sea in late August 2018 and 2019. The two years were characterized by contrasting sea-ice conditions. In August 2018, the sea-ice edge had retreated well beyond the shelf break into the Nansen Basin (>82°N), while in 2019, extensive areas of the northwestern Barents Sea shelf (>79°N) were still ice-covered. These contrasting sea-ice conditions resulted in marked interannual differences in the pelagic protist community structure in this area. In August 2018, the protist community was in a post-bloom stage of seasonal succession characterized by oligotrophic surface waters and dominance of small-sized phytoplankton and heterotrophic protists (predominantly flagellates and ciliates) at most stations. In 2019, a higher contribution of autotrophs and large-celled phytoplankton, particularly diatoms, to total protist biomass compared to 2018 was reflected in higher chlorophyll a concentrations and suggested that the protist community was still in a late bloom stage at some stations. It is noteworthy that particularly diatoms contributed a considerably higher proportion to the protist biomass at the ice-covered stations in both years compared to the open-water stations. This pattern was also evident in the higher vertical protist biomass flux in 2019, dominated by dinoflagellates and diatoms, compared to 2018. Our results suggest that the predicted transition toward an ice-free Barents Sea will lengthen the oligotrophic summer period with low algal biomass and associated low vertical flux."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c","5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","5e709489878c28a0473bf359"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"213","pagesFromTo":"103018","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6422dcab4097072924c7b8f4","6422dcab4097072924c7b8f5","6422dcab4097072924c7b8f6","6422dcab4097072924c7b8f7","6422dcab4097072924c7b8f8","6422dcab4097072924c7b8f9","6422dcab4097072924c7b8fa","6422dcab4097072924c7b8fb","5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","6422dcab4097072924c7b8fc","6422dcab4097072924c7b8fd","6422dcab4097072924c7b8fe","6422dcab4097072924c7b8ff","6422dcab4097072924c7b900","6422dcab4097072924c7b901","6422dcab4097072924c7b902","6422dcab4097072924c7b903","6422dcab4097072924c7b904","6422dcab4097072924c7b905","5e709489878c28a0473bf359","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","6422dcab4097072924c7b906","6422dcab4097072924c7b907"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"4bc3bbad-0ed4-4dfe-8f62-93517ff00731"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6422dcab4097072924c7b8f3","year":"2023","volume":"213","documentHash":"311596d3-1fd1-42b6-93f7-264517e5e2ea"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Planktonic protist communities","Vertical flux","Barents Sea","Climate change","Sea ice"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058553752"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6412e7224097075d81fb1604","name":"Maycira","lastName":"Costa","documentHash":"01d9fbc0-f31a-4caf-ba8d-3a26098242ac"},{"objectId":"6412e7224097075d81fb1603","name":"Jennifer M.","lastName":"Jackson","documentHash":"a4971220-884a-45b8-839f-2a5f8721544e"},{"objectId":"6412e7224097075d81fb1602","name":"Sejal","lastName":"Pramlall","documentHash":"18c0ca0d-b910-44f5-bccf-aab15fe5c153"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993d5","name":"Marta","lastName":"Konik","uuid":"C9EFA09C8E176C789E5FEDF411C2490E92565CB72CBE1EF71C0DF2DE1AC8FCA7CA9972FDA56DD38CD1A76438D0F4D33B04273B7C66203050838BCF543B92B6E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1145-9127","documentHash":"de341dc2-90f3-4b16-96f7-18332a2e9882"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6412e7224097075d81fb1601","doi":"10.3390/rs15030687","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/3/687/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Merged Multi-Sensor Ocean Colour Chlorophyll Product Evaluation for the British Columbia Coast","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Phytoplankton phenology studies require a dataset that is continuous in time and space\nsince missing data have been shown to affect the accuracy of seasonality metrics.

The salinity of >7 throughout the transect indicated Vistula plume was possibly displaced westward by the preceding northerly and easterly winds between 5.7 and 10.7 ms–1 during the sampling campaign. Spectral analysis pointed to the highest contribution of aromatic and high molecular weight molecules (lowest spectral slope (SR) ratios and highest absorption coefficient at 254 nm (aCDOM(254)) at the first two stations near the river mouth, demonstrating a very limited influence of the river plume. Concentrations of surface-active organic substances (SAS) ranged from 0.28 to 0.60 mg L−1 in eq. Triton-X-100 in SML, and from 0.22 to 0.47 mg L−1 in eq. Triton-X-100 in the ULW, while POC concentrations ranged from 0.27 to 0.84 mg L−1 in SML and from 0.20 to 0.37 mg L−1 in ULW. Enrichment of SAS and POC detected at the highest wind speeds indicates rapid SML recovery by OM transported from the ULW. Low lipids to POC contribution, on average 5% and 7% in SML and ULW respectively, points to eutrophic conditions. Statistically significant negative correlation between SR and the Lipid:PIG ratio in SML and ULW suggests the production of lower molecular weight OM by phytoplankton living under favourable environmental conditions.

Hydrography, turbidity, suspended particulate matter and chlorophyll a were studied in July and August 2019 in West Spitsbergen waters (European Arctic). Fine-scale vertical distribution patterns of zooplankton were assessed by an optical counter (LOPC) and underwater camera (UVP) and verified by plankton nets. In waters with the shallow impact of dark plumes, Calanus spp. and gelatinous zooplankton were concentrated in the upper water layers, whereas in areas with a thick turbid layer, they were distributed evenly in the water column. However, chlorophyll a peaks were found to be restricted to the surface in the turbid waters and there were subsurface maxima in the shallow turbidity regime. Regardless of the region, the turbidity regime was a significant factor shaping the vertical distribution of Calanus spp. We speculate that similar trends might be observed in other rapidly emerging turbid ecosystems and urge that future plankton research should also include relatively simple turbidity measurements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","617a0b297523400564d4b50b","5e709469878c28a0473bc64c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"17953","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["617a0b297523400564d4b50b","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709469878c28a0473bc64c","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","documentHash":"b6d73d02-ec27-4baa-91e9-d28a7a700218"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biooceanography","Boreal ecology","Climate-change ecology","Ecosystem ecology","Marine biology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058576141"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393766","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Herman","uuid":"44B5293D87B2EFB8CF355798E377F5251631920D04E7A3E09EDA286CBD683C0530A7B5ED2F5BD7717F072D01EA9C58EA8281064069FF24ECECBD141524BB57A2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5112-7165","documentHash":"d2114a83-e13a-4055-b93a-e52ed09a78ec"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bbd15d4097075486191774","doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-25008-5","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25008-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Typical and anomalous pathways of surface-floating material in the Northern North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Surface waters of the oceans carry large amounts of material, including sediment grains, plankton organisms, and ice crystals, as well as pollutants, e.g., oil and plastic. Transport and spatio-temporal distribution of this material depend on its properties and on the dynamical processes in the ocean mixed layer—currents, waves, turbulence, and convective mixing—acting at a wide range of scales. Due to its importance for marine physics, biogeochemistry and ecology, substantial research efforts have been invested in recent years in observations and modelling of ocean material transport, especially in the context of marine plastic pollution. Nevertheless, many important questions remain unanswered. In this work, numerically simulated trajectories of surface-floating particles in the period 1993–2020 are used to analyse typical and anomalous transport pathways in the northern North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. Model validation is performed based on additional simulations of 387 buoy tracks from the International Arctic Buoy Programme in the years 2014–2020. The trajectories are computed based on surface currents from a hydrodynamic model and Stokes drift from a spectral wave model. It is shown that due to high amplitudes of Stokes drift (comparable with wind-induced currents in ice-free parts of the domain of study), combined with high directional variability, the drifting paths are substantially modified in ice-free regions, underlying the important role of wave-induced currents in surface material transport. A statistical analysis of ∼1.6108 trajectories reveals patterns of connections between nearshore locations in the domain of study, the associated drift times and path sinuosity. Seasonal variability of transport, which differs between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic, is found for typical transport routes following the larger-scale circulation patterns. Crucially, in both sub-domains episodic, but very strong transport events between otherwise isolated locations occur, associated with anomalous atmospheric circulation and, arguably, providing ‘windows of opportunity’ for dispersal of various organisms to new locations. It is shown for two examples in the North Atlantic region that an unusual combination of atmospheric circulation indices explains the anomalous transport, thus providing a predictive tool for future events. In the Arctic, analogous phenomena are modified by the state of the sea ice cover."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393766","5e709347878c28a0473a6500"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"20521","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393766","5e709347878c28a0473a6500"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","documentHash":"b6d73d02-ec27-4baa-91e9-d28a7a700218"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ocean sciences","Physical oceanography"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058576715"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd58424097073596a156a1","name":"Sergej","lastName":"Olenin","documentHash":"b09ba0f4-2d78-481a-bd27-fc2b6cea5901"},{"objectId":"63bd58424097073596a156a0","name":"Mantas","lastName":"Liutkus","documentHash":"635d53cf-df16-4295-b149-be0c43d6092a"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6541","name":"Lech","lastName":"Kotwicki","uuid":"CEECA66DAF2E358E21F839F30352004FB3521D54E17236B1E8957B809DE11A2D2B30D28C4F68C7808E1907665A1D43B8C3716FA31D8E6A80279E7C2A427E9E30","orcidId":"0000-0001-5876-5696","documentHash":"f96c8d28-5ab4-4378-a9cd-4c6e9afc9155"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"}],"objectId":"63bd58424097073596a1569f","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.113516","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0025326X22001989?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Wave fetch and distance from the ocean determine the distribution of macroplastics in the intertidal zone of central Spitsbergen, Arctic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, we estimated the variety and distribution of macroplastics in the central part of Spitsbergen, Svalbard archipelago, Arctic.

Changing environmental conditions, such as lower precipitation and snow cover duration, may affect patterns of riverine input, therefore it is crucial to know how benthic communities utilize different OM sources in areas affected by rivers. Using Bayesian stable isotope mixing models, we assessed the diet composition of common macroinvertebrates forming benthic communities in the transition zone of one of the largest river outlets in the Baltic Sea region, the Vistula River prodelta. Furthermore, we analyzed the spatial and temporal variability in the biomass-weighted resource utilization by those communities. Contribution of riverine OM to the particulate OM in Vistula prodelta decreased with increasing depth. Despite similar distances to the river mouth, the relative contribution of riverine OM to the diet of all studied taxa also decreased with increasing depth, which corresponded to organic matter composition in prodelta waters. Nevertheless, due to synchronous structural changes in benthic communities, and changes in the feeding modes of dominant species, particularly Macoma balthica and Hediste diversicolor, the riverine organic carbon share in the biomass of benthic communities often remained the highest in the deepest prodelta parts. Our study corroborates that benthic primary consumers act as a gateway for riverine organic matter into the marine food web and illustrates that sediment properties and resource partitioning affects spatial structure of benthic communities and their abilities to utilize allochthonous OM."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","5e709347878c28a0473a6546","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","624512287523402df09a215a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"974539","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["624512287523402df09a215a","5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","5e709347878c28a0473a6546"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a523b2467f06a1edbdb2f","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"17b56cb2-5e8f-41ce-a89d-d4b387701e78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058579483"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd5f5e4097073596a2242a","name":"Pedro","lastName":"Rodrigues","documentHash":"68b612f9-5b95-46f7-99c2-b20f85244e7d"},{"objectId":"63bd5f5e4097073596a22429","name":"Guðmundur","lastName":"Guðmundsson","documentHash":"a2dfd7f4-ba89-4abb-a135-e447cc90cc61"},{"objectId":"63bd5f5e4097073596a22428","name":"Sindri","lastName":"Gíslason","documentHash":"94395d61-d141-436d-bb22-0797bbf96a23"},{"objectId":"63bd5f5e4097073596a22427","name":"Nina V.","lastName":"Denisenko","documentHash":"3377f766-9b5d-4c2b-b96f-fdf4c30f7711"},{"objectId":"63bd5f5e4097073596a22426","name":"Joana","lastName":"Micael","documentHash":"b759c3df-fe85-4f70-be64-2f24fad5276b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-08-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bd5f5e4097073596a22424","doi":"10.1007/s00300-022-03078-5","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-022-03078-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Diversity of Bryozoa in Iceland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The establishment of baseline information on biodiversity is important as contemporary biodiversity might act as a\nbioindicator of environmental change. It is especially important at locations which are expected to be largely impacted by\nclimate change, such as Icelandic waters. The present study focuses on the diversity of bryozoan species in Iceland. An\nIcelandic bryozoan species list was compiled from three main data sources: species collected during the BIOICE programme, species deposited in old museum collections and from literature. A total of 288 species were recorded from the study area, 67 of which are new records in Icelandic waters and three are potentially non-indigenous species. Such diversity is relatively high in comparison to other areas and yet predicted to be even higher if more studies were to be conducted. Encrusting forms (56%) were by far the most numerous among studied bryozoans. The highest number of species (71) was recorded in the shallowest 0–100 m zone which is most likely a result of complex factors including high primary productivity of that zone. This study reveals a large proportion of new species records for the area, showing how little is known about bryozoan diversity and its ecological aspects in such important areas as Icelandic waters. It is a starting point for further in-depth investigations of this specifc group of organisms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1391-1402","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bd5f5e4097073596a22426","63bd5f5e4097073596a22427","63bd5f5e4097073596a22428","63bd5f5e4097073596a22429","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","63bd5f5e4097073596a2242a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792ee","mniswId":"16268","title":"POLAR BIOLOGY","doi":"","issn":"0722-4060","eissn":"1432-2056","websiteLink":"https://link.springer.com/journal/300","documentHash":"4669e802-994d-4bda-8c0a-5226214ba6f5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd5f5e4097073596a22425","year":"2022","volume":"45","number":"8","documentHash":"0bc91625-83db-4451-bcac-8c2b9e7ec784"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["High latitude","BIOICE","New records","Depth distribution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058579528"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd6a914097073596a35b96","name":"Janne E.","lastName":"Søreide","documentHash":"d58befe4-fa0c-49e7-bb52-532ea5641a66"},{"objectId":"63bd6a914097073596a35b95","name":"Rakesh Kumar","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"2808e9d8-7379-4d98-856a-ced5ebc30de0"},{"objectId":"63bd6a914097073596a35b94","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kruss","documentHash":"5145fe94-c141-4633-902c-acd79455a238"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf359","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tatarek","uuid":"7EE1E47D321F50DCA10E3EE8AE6B69ADAD102DD6F260B15C5FAFB4CDB18ADAB7DB98698EDA96C3F6694FEBFAE6E998A04B022F2EE8AF42B5FAA1B158F078B131","orcidId":"0000-0003-1467-6362","documentHash":"70339abc-aa35-4e2b-ab8b-296f2bba7dce"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc649","name":"Józef","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"64A4CFE25246497244808707B7231F64A063B6FD2037A5C71E1073A7F8BB9156C1EA1C6A93906EF67E5F01C9417A1FDD725822A014D540B94C1EBF4AEF048E60","orcidId":"0000-0002-3468-0513","documentHash":"b0dc8dfd-3de1-479b-8b73-f0c248f5bf29"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655c","name":"Józef","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"E8901DD6BAD74E4F0A531BC69DC86134B02AC9BDAB17361AAFA79F2ED26ABBC473DFEDC614DF70B146B917A0E212BFD4740299FB5AB0C805A789195BA88BE5E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2344-0047","documentHash":"6a141822-0a06-4fc9-83c5-d08f585c8615"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bd6a914097073596a35b93","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2022.1021675","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.1021675/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Comparison of macroalgae meadows in warm Atlantic versus cold Arctic regimes in the high-Arctic Svalbard","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A warmer Arctic with less sea ice will likely improve macroalgae growth conditions, but observational data to support this hypothesis are scarce.

Both places had similar insolation and comparable turbidity levels. Macroalgae communities at both places were similar and were formed mainly by common north Atlantic kelp species: Saccharina latissima, Alaria esculenta, Laminaria digitata and L. hyperborea. However, the density of the bottom coverage and thalli condition were strikingly different between the two sites. Algae at the warmer site were intact and fully developed and occupied most of the available hard substrate. At the colder site, only patchy macroalgae canopies were found and most thallies were physically damaged and trimmed at a uniform height due to physical ice scouring. These differences in macroalgal density and thalli condition were only found at depths down to 5 m. Deeper, no distinct differences were observed between the warm and cold sites. Sea urchins were only observed at the warm site, but in few numbers with no visible negative top-down control on macroalgae growth."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c","5e709469878c28a0473bc649","5e709489878c28a0473bf359"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1021675","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709469878c28a0473bc649","5e709489878c28a0473bf359","63bd6a914097073596a35b94","63bd6a914097073596a35b95","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","63bd6a914097073596a35b96"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a523b2467f06a1edbdb2f","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"17b56cb2-5e8f-41ce-a89d-d4b387701e78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["kelp forest","hydroacoustic","ice-scouring","Arctic","climate change"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058579613"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd60dc4097073596a256da","name":"Lee Hsiang","lastName":"Liow","documentHash":"1314b78d-993d-4620-958d-03258650d7c4"},{"objectId":"63bd60dc4097073596a256d9","name":"Rachel C.

Cheilostome bryozoans are a group of ubiquitous, species-rich, marine colonial organisms with an excellent fossil record but lack phylogenetic relationships inferred from molecular data. We present genome-skimmed data for 395 cheilostomes and combine these with 315 published sequences to infer relationships and the timing of key events among c. 500 cheilostome species. We find that named cheilostome genera and species are phylogenetically coherent, rendering fossil or contemporary specimens readily delimited using only skeletal morphology. Our phylogeny shows that parental care in the form of brooding evolved several times independently but was never lost in cheilostomes. Our fossil calibration, robust to varied assumptions, indicates that the cheilostome lineage and parental care therein could have Paleozoic origins, much older than the first known fossil record of cheilostomes in the Late Jurassic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bd60dc4097073596a256ba","63bd60dc4097073596a256bb","63bd60dc4097073596a256bc","63bd60dc4097073596a256bd","63bd60dc4097073596a256be","63bd60dc4097073596a256bf","63bd60dc4097073596a256c0","63bd60dc4097073596a256c1","63bd60dc4097073596a256c2","63bd60dc4097073596a256c3","63bd60dc4097073596a256c4","63bd60dc4097073596a256c5","63bd60dc4097073596a256c6","63bd60dc4097073596a256c7","63bd60dc4097073596a256c8","63bd60dc4097073596a256c9","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","63bd60dc4097073596a256ca","63bd60dc4097073596a256cb","63bd60dc4097073596a256cc","63bd60dc4097073596a256cd","63bd60dc4097073596a256ce","63bd60dc4097073596a256cf","63bd60dc4097073596a256d0","63bd60dc4097073596a256d1","63bd60dc4097073596a256d2","63bd60dc4097073596a256d3","63bd60dc4097073596a256d4","63bd60dc4097073596a256d5","63bd60dc4097073596a256d6","63bd60dc4097073596a256d7","63bd60dc4097073596a256d8","63bd60dc4097073596a256d9","63bd60dc4097073596a256da"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d2b1","mniswId":"18209","title":"Science Advances","issn":"2375-2548","eissn":"2375-2548","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"be28a32a-c957-4328-b163-8bd9ee385fcb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd60dc4097073596a256b9","year":"2022","volume":"8","number":"13","documentHash":"065b7232-9e6e-407e-8020-6f2404e89445"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058579983"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd4f824097073596a06d5e","name":"ANDREW N.","lastName":"OSTROVSKY","documentHash":"ab0fb2e1-bd4a-4649-9008-dc59ba692317"},{"objectId":"63bd4f824097073596a06d5d","name":"MARY E.","lastName":"SPENCER-JONES","documentHash":"7b2d49e7-c562-43ad-b1bd-d14ba9b3de9b"},{"objectId":"63bd4f824097073596a06d5c","name":"NINA V.","lastName":"DENISENKO","documentHash":"ae355274-10be-4583-a929-17c7f9010b12"},{"objectId":"63bd4f824097073596a06d5b","name":"PAUL D.","lastName":"TAYLOR","documentHash":"33839c9e-7eeb-4051-9a07-c38a19413bf4"},{"objectId":"63bd4f824097073596a06d5a","name":"DENNIS P.","lastName":"GORDON","documentHash":"756f1bda-1d25-447b-a6a5-ac8aef7edb43"},{"objectId":"63bd4f824097073596a06d59","name":"ANDREI V.","lastName":"GRISCHENKO","documentHash":"d164f4cf-4fe4-4661-8fe5-5806a2f9f16b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"objectId":"63bd4f824097073596a06d57","doi":"10.11646/zootaxa.5131.1.1","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.5131.1.1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Taxonomy, ecology and zoogeography of the Recent species of Rhamphostomella Lorenz, 1886 and Mixtoscutella n. gen.

A recurring winter polynya with large sea ice production makes it an important region of dense water formation at the scale of the Arctic Ocean. In addition, this fjord is seasonally influenced by freshwater inputs from sea ice melt and the surrounding islands of the Svalbard archipelago, which impacts the hydrography. However, the understanding of factors controlling the optical properties of the waters in Storfjorden are lacking and are crucial for the development of more accurate regional bio-optical models. Here, we present results from the first detailed optical field survey of Storfjorden conducted in early summer of 2020. Our observations are based on spectrometric analysis of water samples and in situ vertical profiles with an absorption and attenuation meter, a fluorometer, and a conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) sensor. In addition to the expected seasonal contribution from phytoplankton, we find that in early summer waters in Storfjorden are optically complex with a significant contribution from coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM, 33 %–64 % of the non-water absorption at 443 nm) despite relatively low CDOM concentrations and in the nearshore or near the seabed from non-algal particles (up to 61 % of the non-water absorption at 550 nm). In surface waters, the spatial variability of light attenuation was mainly controlled by inorganic suspended matter originating from river runoff. A distinct subsurface maximum of light attenuation was largely driven by a subsurface phytoplankton bloom, controlled by stratification resulting from sea ice melt. Lastly, the cold dense bottom waters of Storfjorden from winter sea ice production periodically overflows the sill at the mouth of the fjord and can thus reach the Fram Strait. It contained elevated levels of both non-algal particles and dissolved organic matter, which are likely caused by the dense flows of the nepheloid layer interacting with the sea bed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655f","5e709347878c28a0473a652f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"455-468","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63be7b5d40970720586d8eb1","63be7b5d40970720586d8eb2","63be7b5d40970720586d8eb3","63be7b5d40970720586d8eb4","5e709347878c28a0473a652f","5e709347878c28a0473a655f","63be7b5d40970720586d8eb5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c4","mniswId":"15346","title":"Ocean Science","issn":"1812-0784","eissn":"1812-0792","documentHash":"dd653668-e554-422b-a610-6ebf954eb164"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63be7b5d40970720586d8eb0","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"2","documentHash":"98307788-a546-4e89-97e4-c7e0fa461437"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058583028"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63be9d6d409707205870caed","name":"Danna","lastName":"Titelboim","documentHash":"919b6576-5ee6-4509-b5d4-d5fb5abe7a3f"},{"objectId":"63be9d6d409707205870caec","name":"Sigal","lastName":"Abramovich","documentHash":"2672623b-009f-4d58-a275-a93c839a76dd"},{"objectId":"63be9d6d409707205870caeb","name":"Raphael","lastName":"Morard","documentHash":"086fdcd6-fde1-464b-a2b1-f5861f34a6ae"},{"objectId":"63be9d6d409707205870caea","name":"Laure","lastName":"Apothéloz-Perret-Gentil","documentHash":"8f9b3804-c70b-40d7-9347-041184c301d5"},{"objectId":"63be9d6d409707205870cae9","name":"Johann","lastName":"Hohenegger","documentHash":"fffcbb43-4006-49ca-abcb-12bce0e48b03"},{"objectId":"63be9d6d409707205870cae8","name":"Maria","lastName":"Holzmann","documentHash":"bbf2a915-3f4b-493a-be03-f3e23666d851"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63be9d6d409707205870cae6","doi":"10.1007/s12583-021-1595-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12583-021-1595-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Operculina and Neoassilina: A Revision of Recent Nummulitid Genera Based on Molecular and Morphological Data Reveals a New Genus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The genus Operculina, a large symbiont-bearing benthic foraminifer, is characterized by high morphological variability showing thick involute to intermediate semi-involute to flat evolute tests. Different morphotypes are either considered as ecophenotypes or distinct species. In order to test the hypothesis of ecophenotypes versus different species, a single cell high throughput sequencing approach was applied to assess the interspecific diversity of Operculina. This results in two groups of ribotypes, one corresponding to Operculina ammonoides/Operculina discoidalis, the other containing Operculina complanata/Operculina elegans. These groups can also be separated morphologically. Therefore, O. complanata and O. elegans represent a single species and the latter can be regarded as a junior synonym of O. complanata. Operculina ammonoides and O. discoidalis also form a single species, which makes the latter a junior synonym of O. ammonoides. Because generic differences in Operculina species are manifested in morphology and molecular genetics, the genus Neoassilina with the designated species Neoassilina ammonoides is installed. Additional analysis of ribosomal SSU rDNA data of eight recent nummulitid genera confirms the obtained high troughput sequencing results and further shows that Palaeonummulites venosus builds a clade with O. complanata that branches at the base of other Nummulitidae containing Planostegina, Planoperculina, Cycloclypeus, Heterostegina, Operculinella and Neoassilina."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1411-1424","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63be9d6d409707205870cae8","63be9d6d409707205870cae9","63be9d6d409707205870caea","63be9d6d409707205870caeb","63be9d6d409707205870caec","63be9d6d409707205870caed","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478629","mniswId":"10825","title":"Journal of Earth Science","issn":"1674-487X","eissn":"1867-111X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e06fbdb2-3d9d-4584-b868-e8dbafc7a7a6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63be9d6d409707205870cae7","year":"2022","volume":"33","number":"6","documentHash":"3164e652-1083-40da-9b15-e672e4052e5d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Operculina","Neoassilina","Nummulitidae","interspecific diversity","SSU rDNA","morphology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058583170"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067d8","name":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Frontalini","documentHash":"75dc22e6-9064-4e48-a49a-f48bbd7cd123"},{"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067d7","name":"Ahmad","lastName":"Boota Anwar","documentHash":"72a37640-8e27-46ee-8158-0bb03f23ccbd"},{"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067d6","name":"Fadila","lastName":"Al-Salameen","documentHash":"70ee2fd6-0687-42a7-bbac-53e0f2e3cebd"},{"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067d5","name":"Shaker","lastName":"Al-Hazeem","documentHash":"93e40b10-b3a8-4945-a728-2e2634517c49"},{"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067d4","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Borderie","documentHash":"f4858e7c-78e4-4ee9-92b4-7bc804f20947"},{"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067d3","name":"Eszter","lastName":"Balassi","documentHash":"f27b1be3-767b-4b82-9215-d7b3897e9950"},{"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067d2","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Francescangeli","documentHash":"7badf299-9744-4258-968d-8f9342806114"},{"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067d1","name":"Eqbal","lastName":"Al-Enezi","documentHash":"644078e9-ef39-458e-a395-e5220cb36cdb"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-11","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067cf","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155093","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969722021866?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Benthic foraminifera as proxies for the environmental quality assessment of the Kuwait Bay (Kuwait, Arabian Gulf): Morphological and metabarcoding approaches","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The rapid urbanization and industrialization of Kuwait and the consequent effluent discharges into marine environments have resulted in a degradation of water and sediment quality in the coastal marine ecosystems such as in the Kuwait Bay. This study investigates the ecological response of benthic foraminifera (protists) to environmental stress in the Kuwait Bay. The traditional morphological approach was compared to the innovative environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding to evaluate the ecological quality status (EcoQS). Forty-six surface sediment samples were collected from selected stations in the Kuwait Bay. To detect the pollution gradient, environmental parameters from water (e.g., salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen) and sediment (e.g., grain-size, trace metals, total organic carbon, total petroleum hydrocarbons) were measured at each station. Although the foraminiferal assemblages were different in the morphological and molecular datasets, the species turnover was congruent and statistically significant. Diversity-based biotic indices derived from both morphological and metabarcoding approaches, reflect the environmental stress gradient (i.e., organic and metal contaminations) in the Kuwait Bay. The lowest values of EcoQS (i.e., bad to poor) are found in the innermost part (i.e., Sulaibikhat Bay and Ras Kazmah), while higher EcoQS values occur in the outer part of the bay. This study constitutes the first attempt to apply the foraminiferal metabarcoding to assess the EcoQS within the Arabian Gulf and presents its advantages compared to the conventional morphological approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"833","pagesFromTo":"155093","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63be97fc40970720587067d1","63be97fc40970720587067d2","63be97fc40970720587067d3","63be97fc40970720587067d4","63be97fc40970720587067d5","63be97fc40970720587067d6","63be97fc40970720587067d7","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","63be97fc40970720587067d8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0048-9697","documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63be97fc40970720587067d0","year":"2022","volume":"833","documentHash":"21f32245-eaf1-4b64-9768-8928e293bf06"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Benthic foraminifera","Metabarcoding","Coastal areas","Environmental quality assessment","Kuwait Bay"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058583372"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c29503","name":"Robert","lastName":"Suydam","documentHash":"3cb512f7-4dc7-4e53-b4e8-f41a82228e53"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c29502","name":"Ellen V.","lastName":"Lea","documentHash":"688f1314-d350-4c62-89c9-b4fd04660d65"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c29501","name":"Justin","lastName":"Olnes","documentHash":"a32c9781-af73-4dda-907e-030b3fd7ab44"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c29500","name":"Wieslaw","lastName":"Maslowski","documentHash":"e0eb4d2c-d942-4644-aa6c-71cbab814c47"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c294ff","name":"Billy","lastName":"Adams","documentHash":"16afe665-e0df-4075-8437-ce5476d3d61c"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c294fe","name":"John C.","lastName":"George","documentHash":"6e51fbd1-ff22-4e03-b44c-713fdd3feee6"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c294fd","name":"Lori","lastName":"Quakenbush","documentHash":"05a812ad-1bc4-4b8c-977f-d3e481550891"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c294fc","name":"Matthew L.","lastName":"Druckenmiller","documentHash":"cd5e2be1-f7f9-4220-9fd6-476e678a5689"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c294fb","name":"Stephen R.","lastName":"Okkonen","documentHash":"3fd6f5fa-3ac9-47c8-8b89-a6adb0144613"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c294fa","name":"Greg A.","lastName":"Breed","documentHash":"f5d32d55-403e-4f39-bc71-2ae2d554d3e6"},{"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c294f9","name":"John J.","lastName":"Citta","documentHash":"f309e4dd-e7e8-4404-bc5e-d370c1681bc2"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6531","name":"Robert","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"2D5DB9D57FC7F36F61EC129D9952718B8EE760677732DD55A275E92756962D368291051F6920872AC1B25967C13152ED107489FCB8248776FDD5045A6623150F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8698-0799","documentHash":"5a7dc855-7273-4918-89fd-9450b6dfc8de"}],"objectId":"6422a58e4097072924c294f7","doi":"10.1016/j.csr.2023.104959","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0278434323000365?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Shifts in bowhead whale distribution, behavior, and condition following rapid sea ice change in the Bering sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Prior to 2017, the winter (January–March) distribution of the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort (BCB) Sea population of bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) was centered in western Bering Sea shelfwaters characterized by high concentrations of sea ice. This area was largely devoid of sea ice during the winters of 2017–19 and satellite tagging studies show that the distribution of whales shifted northwards into the Chukchi Sea during 2018 and 2019 (no winter data were available for 2017). Here, we examine how bowhead whale movements and behavior changed in response to potential ecological drivers by linking satellite tag data, collected during 2009–2019, with contemporaneous sea ice concentration data and numerical simulations of regional oceanography. We used step selection and resource selection functions to examine how whales responded to changes in sea ice concentration, modeled ocean temperature, salinity, velocity, and the local gradients in these variables. Analyses indicated that whales selected areas of intermediate ice concentrations (∼65–85%) at distances ∼150–250 km from the southern ice edge. Dive data suggest that, prior to the ice decline, whales spent more time near the seafloor and less time near the surface. Interestingly, we found evidence that whales may track the diel vertical migration (DVM) of krill, but only after sea ice declined. We found no change in body condition of yearling or subadult whales harvested at Utqiaġvik following 2017; however, post-weaning whales had a statistically significant decline in body condition, which could be due to changes in sea ice or could reflect negative density dependence given increases in whale abundance and density. The BCB bowhead whale population may be approaching carrying capacity and abundance is thought to have reached or surpassed what existed prior to commercial whaling. At present, overwintering in the Chukchi Sea has few negative consequences for this population and we expect over wintering within the Chukchi Sea will become more common as winter sea ice declines in the Bering Sea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

as Molecular Markers with Applications in Exploitation and Conservation of Aquatic Animal Populations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A large number of species and taxa have been studied for genetic polymorphism. Microsatellites have been known as hypervariable neutral molecular markers with the highest resolution power in comparison with any other markers. However, the discovery of a new type of molecular marker—single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has put the existing applications of microsatellites to the test. To ensure good resolution power in studies of populations and individuals, a number of microsatellite loci from 14 to 20 was often used, which corresponds to about 200 independent alleles. Recently, these numbers have tended to be increased by the application of genomic sequencing of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and the choice of the most informative loci for genotyping depends on the aims of research. Examples of successful applications of microsatellite molecular markers in aquaculture, fisheries, and conservation genetics in comparison to SNPs are summarized in this review. Microsatellites can be considered superior markers in such topics as kinship and parentage analysis in cultured and natural populations, the assessment of gynogenesis, androgenesis and ploidization. Microsatellites can be coupled with SNPs for mapping QTL. Microsatellites will continue to be used in research of genetic diversity in cultured stocks, and also in natural populations as an economically advantageous genotyping technique."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6509"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"808","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6509"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477dc4","mniswId":"7014","title":"Genes","doi":"","issn":"2073-4425","eissn":"2073-4425","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"34f376ee-13e8-4905-b3a7-815ceb8fd0c2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biodiversity","conservation genetics","aquaculture","molecular population genetics","microsatellite DNA","SNP","allozymes and mtDNA","selection","aquatic organisms"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058673609"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"648838b94097072fd76b94a3","name":"Nicole","lastName":"Nawrot","documentHash":"2bcc1ef1-ee60-4799-a0f4-8913e1c38c7d"},{"objectId":"648838b94097072fd76b94a2","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kolerski","documentHash":"dd3ef375-608d-4328-9fdd-c537a92cd9c2"},{"objectId":"648838b94097072fd76b94a1","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wojciechowska","documentHash":"65371196-ec35-448b-82ad-be6bbdb22ff5"},{"objectId":"648838b94097072fd76b94a0","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Matej-Łukowicz","documentHash":"44aa723b-b208-4694-8d08-33457466e121"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Winogradow","uuid":"D50057AD40012BE33D95DBDE17AFF8252F4D4C8BE533331AE47A267772A7AF1EA340927A58A08E00BF25C00BEE718EC87BAB202495DEBA6319C1787B88209CC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6214-9017","documentHash":"5ac9951c-6a34-42af-b699-05492c580241"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kuliński","uuid":"A1362FEB3C94D210BA97D7C5FE392ED27FB4DD61D0B2476A4F5C18B20F589C7FA21F35A13EA5510511C60D24A7EAD1FC4FDC75E86C1645B920BA2AE06C994826","orcidId":"0000-0002-5403-6629","documentHash":"8009c04f-1ba9-4687-80f3-d96316801246"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"648838b94097072fd76b949f","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-35568-9","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-35568-9.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Sources of contamination in sediments of retention tanks and the influence of precipitation type on the size of pollution load","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Densification of cities and urban population contributes to increased runoff and suspended solids and alteration of the urban water cycle. Nowadays, Blue-Green Infrastructure is promoted to increase a city’s resilience to floods; however, stormwater drainage systems, supported with retention tanks are still important in protecting urban areas against floods. Sediment accumulation in stormwater infrastructure relates to an issue of pollutants such as heavy metals, nutrients etc. Research on the origin of the pollutants associated with the suspension and ultimately sediment accumulated in sewage can bring new insights about processes in urban catchment areas. This is the first study, which is focused on the analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in bottom sediments collected from municipal retention tanks to verify the origin of the deposited pollutants immediately after pluvial floods. The research was additionally extended with water quality analyzes immediately after three types of weather: a dry period, typical precipitation (< 30 mm) and torrential rainfalls (2 events with daily precipitation over 30 mm which caused pluvial flooding of the city area). Analyses of sediments indicated that the main source of carbon and nitrogen in the bottom of the retention tanks had been brought with stormwater runoff from the city area. Organic nitrogen fertilizers appeared to be the main source of nitrogen, while the sources of organic carbon were mixed: C3 land plants, wood, and oil. Additionally, it was found that torrential rainfall caused a 23-fold increase of N-NO3 concentration, a sevenfold increase of P-PO4 concentration, and an over fivefold increase of concentration of organic matter, in comparison to typical precipitation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"8884","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["648838b94097072fd76b94a0","648838b94097072fd76b94a1","648838b94097072fd76b94a2","648838b94097072fd76b94a3","5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"3ee113d7-e583-4a13-8002-d0395774636a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Environmental chemistry","Environmental impact","Environmental sciences","Hydrology","Natural hazards"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677799"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"640880e84097070bdc84ca60","name":"Aldo","lastName":"Indacochea","documentHash":"35358c69-49bb-42ec-ae92-46df6d3da9fd"},{"objectId":"640880e84097070bdc84ca5f","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Thorne","documentHash":"837d5b5f-579e-40fb-b2f7-3eb44fe54864"},{"objectId":"61c14a387523404d4a912f17","name":"Bernabe","lastName":"Moreno Leveroni","uuid":"36FA6EE05AD27586A36BA1525B92E9AAD5E4F42B9A77DAD6DAB3BCCEAD1532FFCEBDA7C315B2CAFF88513C5875A69EE85865276D9F50BE3B6B707C2A750E40FD","documentHash":"8f6e77cb-f129-4cfb-94a1-14bcf5f9f6e6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"640880e84097070bdc84ca5e","doi":"10.24425/ppr.2022.140364","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Growth form classification for sessile suspension feeders and their distribution in Antarctic fjord, King George Island","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sessile suspension feeders depend primarily on availability of a space to settle and access to the water column. Their sessile nature incapacitates displacement during disturbances thus they rely on their morphology to overcome selective processes. We classified the assemblage of SSF from Mackellar Inlet (King George Island, Antarctica) according to their growth forms (GF) and epibiotic association type, the latter based on direct observation of the epibiotic behaviour of every individual. Organisms that did not comply with any previously established GF were grouped into ‘other GF’. Sampling stations were distributed across the fjord following a gradient based primarily on the distance to Domeyko Glacier (inner, middle, outer sections). Seven GF were recognised in the glaciomarine fjord: tree, bush, stalk, mound, flat, runner, and sheet. Four types of epibiotic associations were identified: basibiont, both facultative epibiont and basibiont, facultative epibiont (non-basibiont), and epibiont. Our results showed that the tree GF were found in the inner and middle sections, mound in middle and outer, and flat across all fjord sections. These GF enhanced GF-diversity since they constituted additional substrate for most of the ‘other GF’ which had primarily an epibiotic strategy. Contrastingly, bush, runner and stalk GF were only found in the outer section of the fjord, thus the most distanced from periglacial disturbances. The GF distribution was consistent with distance to glacier, both in number and strategies. These results highlight the potentialities of the morpho-functional classification applied to Antarctic sessile suspension feeders to help understand their distribution based on adaptive capabilities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61c14a387523404d4a912f17"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"267-289","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["640880e84097070bdc84ca5f","61c14a387523404d4a912f17","640880e84097070bdc84ca60"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479306","mniswId":"16309","title":"Polish Polar Research","issn":"0138-0338","eissn":"2081-8262","websiteLink":"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/popore","documentHash":"81e58de4-37b7-4e45-bc40-acee2ad2db77"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antarctica","macrozoobenthos","functional morphology","life strategies","soft bottom"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058681092"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64087a404097070bdc84729e","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Łuczkiewicz","documentHash":"aebbea22-5909-4dcb-a72d-852ea143ef3d"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6547","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kotlarska","uuid":"21C7374EE8D85591AF0BF4337FF25DA10E6C171A3B9220801ECB74ACA089F5AAC3C3CAE7E0EC6B2AFBF54E523E70E1EE92AB17A7A36AABD20CF04C155730C5C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-3122-7772","documentHash":"f26aba89-9744-4f38-af11-2a2d8da22ef9"}],"objectId":"64087a404097070bdc84729d","publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.ug.edu.pl/produkt/zatoka-pucka-tom-iii-aspekty-swiata-ozywionego/","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Vibrio cholerae w wodach Zatoki Puckiej – incydent czy codzienność?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6547"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"377-382","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6547","64087a404097070bdc84729e"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6405e98540970761b8e23a8b","title":"Zatoka Pucka.

As a result, organoarsenic CWAs continue to leak from corroding munitions into sediments and their environmental concentrations are expected to peak over the next few decades. There remains, however, a lack of knowledge about their potential toxicity to aquatic vertebrates, such as fish. The aim of this study was to fill in this gap in research, by investigating the acute toxicity of organoarsenic CWAs on fish embryos, using the model species, Danio rerio. To estimate the acute toxicity thresholds of organoarsenic CWAs (Clark I, Adamsite, PDCA), a CWA-related compound (TPA), as well as four organoarsenic CWA degradation products (Clark I[ox], Adamsite[ox], PDCA[ox], TPA[ox]), standardized tests were performed following the OECD no. 236 Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test guidelines. Additionally, the detoxification response in D. rerio embryos was investigated by analysing the mRNA expression of five genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GPx, GR and GST). During the 96 h of exposure, organoarsenic CWAs induced lethal effects in D. rerio embryos at very low concentrations (classified as 1st category pollutants according to GHS categorization), and were therefore deemed to be serious environmental hazards. Although TPA and the four CWA degradation products caused no acute toxicity even at their maximum solubility, the transcription of antioxidant-related genes was altered upon exposure to these compounds, indicating the need for further testing for chronic toxicity. Incorporating the results of this study into ecological risk assessments will provide a more accurate prediction of the environmental hazards posed by CWA-related organoarsenicals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a793e","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa92","648cb27540970738371459f6","5e7094af878c28a0473c1a49","616a392975234017e0545a19"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709477878c28a0473bdd54","5e709390878c28a0473ace8e","5e7092a5878c28a047399cc0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a653d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"262","pagesFromTo":"115116","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["648cb27540970738371459f6","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa92","5e7094af878c28a0473c1a49","648cb27540970738371459f7","616a392975234017e0545a19","5e709390878c28a0473ace8e","5e7092a5878c28a047399cc0","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","648cb27540970738371459fb","5e709356878c28a0473a793e","5e709477878c28a0473bdd54"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a30","mniswId":"5410","title":"Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety","issn":"0147-6513","eissn":"1090-2414","documentHash":"c945d49a-d7e5-4884-90b5-1792d5f61292"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"648cb27540970738371459f5","year":"2023","volume":"262","documentHash":"6df13cde-0ecb-4444-97a6-ab042303414b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sea-dumped munitions","Zebrafish","Clark I","Adamsite","DCA","TPA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058685000"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646202f840970734435a954c","name":"Michal","lastName":"Kucera","documentHash":"643b2f83-5e0e-4c73-8ca8-02e4e015bfe1"},{"objectId":"646202f840970734435a954b","name":"Kate","lastName":"Darling","documentHash":"c27721cc-c651-4cda-9861-c99aad403fa0"},{"objectId":"646202f840970734435a954a","name":"Raphaël","lastName":"Morard","documentHash":"764c4edd-3c47-459a-94a6-5fdd46385724"},{"objectId":"615bb8a875234017e04eda8d","name":"Mattia","lastName":"Greco","uuid":"476734BF5B11C961C32223CB7E068E727168B16E760C3E65EA2F3EC44B69129BF9B0032DEB1211FF34D5CFC2FCB55E40881DD6805DEFB2513B12C9EE93082646","documentHash":"120e02af-f940-4384-9c8e-2f3addeb7ff7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646202f840970734435a9549","doi":"10.7717/peerj.15255","publicUri":"https://peerj.com/articles/15255.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Macroevolutionary patterns in intragenomic rDNA variability among planktonic foraminifera","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ribosomal intragenomic variability in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is a genomic feature commonly studied for its inflationary impact on molecular diversity assessments. However, the evolutionary mechanisms and distribution of this phenomenon within a microbial group are rarely explored. Here, we investigate the intragenomic variability in 33 species of planktonic foraminifera, calcifying marine protists, by inspecting 2,403 partial SSU sequences obtained from single-cell clone libraries. Our analyses show that polymorphisms are common among planktonic foraminifera species, but the number of polymorphic sites significantly differs among clades. With our molecular simulations, we could assess that most of these mutations are located in paired regions that do not affect the secondary structure of the SSU fragment.

by dramatic ecosystem changes driven by human activities. The impact of these activities can be assessed by different geochemical and paleontological proxies. However, each of these proxies provides only a fragmentary insight into the effects of anthropogenic impacts. It is highly challenging to reconstruct, with a holistic view, the state of the ecosystems from the preindustrial period to the present day, covering all biological components, from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we used sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) archives encompassing all trophic levels of biodiversity to reconstruct the two century-natural history in Bagnoli-Coroglio (Gulf of Pozzuoli, Tyrrhenian Sea), one of the most polluted marine-coastal sites in Europe. The site was characterized by seagrass meadows and high eukaryotic diversity until the beginning of the 20th century. Then, the ecosystem completely changed, with seagrasses and associated fauna as well as diverse groups of planktonic and benthic protists being replaced by low diversity biota dominated by dinophyceans and infaunal metazoan species. The sedaDNA analysis revealed a five-phase evolution of the area, where changes appear as the result of a multi-level cascade effect of impacts associated with industrial activities, urbanization, water circulation and land-use changes. The sedaDNA allowed to infer reference conditions that must be considered when restoration actions are to be implemented."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"172","pagesFromTo":"107738","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6461ffd440970734435a7824","6461ffd440970734435a7825","6461ffd440970734435a7826","6461ffd440970734435a7827","6461ffd440970734435a7828","6461ffd440970734435a7829","6461ffd440970734435a782a","6461ffd440970734435a782b","6461ffd440970734435a782c","6461ffd440970734435a782d","6461ffd440970734435a782e","6461ffd440970734435a782f","6461ffd440970734435a7830","6461ffd440970734435a7831","6461ffd440970734435a7832","6461ffd440970734435a7833","6461ffd440970734435a7834","6461ffd440970734435a7835","6461ffd440970734435a7836","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","6461ffd440970734435a7837"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aeb","mniswId":"5788","title":"Environment International","issn":"0160-4120","documentHash":"e42c68b4-e7ec-4de9-8156-4431dcd21bf8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6461ffd440970734435a7823","year":"2023","volume":"172","documentHash":"51915d1c-e255-4486-b4e1-50157ac33d59"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Metabarcoding","Biota","Human impact","Contaminated marine sediments","Biodiversity reconstruction","Mediterranean Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058688127"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6544","name":"Agata","lastName":"Zaborska","uuid":"FE40EF42F9E848E1D09D278DBA4FECC8CD79F3BC581694CBDEC7B3EE47F2AC0C2688E35AC59379BC3BC9C53F432C7CF089A8C0E8D1D11ACB2050D908A2E6CF9E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1432-7421","documentHash":"f9a20830-9869-4364-97d8-deb620a80580"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a653a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Legeżyńska","uuid":"193CFEEDC8268B971EDE18C39B04B100A6E21C09227CA4EF5C3138CE98064EB2C0141A09C0F80AE7A635D51CC7C61B42FD3DCCE7B385C46DD9743E4877B51B33","orcidId":"0000-0001-7718-0335","documentHash":"ea3f9865-cb35-4227-b0b2-cc02bf444637"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b20","name":"Ksenia","lastName":"Pazdro","uuid":"6538DFA042434F944EC3F934E8085434F2F9A5F7DA28C2F322EFC9FCA07523B4807443385DC8947D7F1AC9EA4A37393C4041BA2DDE8C79642BF66690FA9FB669","orcidId":"0000-0003-0283-1468","documentHash":"870f628d-167d-4246-99f6-00e6c1024232"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739945b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pouch","uuid":"9D8E0E331A2E1554B9833195757F665FCB9551025B4D9DC772A41CA36D50F685CDA5AAF4F26E7415651E9F3B10B980DD557F43CBF11D50F88AE0078596519343","orcidId":"0000-0002-2898-8896","documentHash":"4ebf3f5f-2242-46bc-b69c-77d5b603ac61"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739940b","name":"Kajetan","lastName":"Deja","uuid":"9D662B5DB9D9989CA2118EDEC7988EF7D4D3980D2C609A38B7C9587CFC9D6D5B787097E27010CA8550182A7210D7D7626DAA6E7FFF1C7E0FD28C9FB88D4072BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6707-3883","documentHash":"2fb48e59-8c28-4aaa-9364-256c74d01e4d"}],"objectId":"64a554e44097077a613559e9","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165262","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969723038858?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Assessment of exposure of benthic organisms to selected organochlorine pollutants in the west Spitsbergen fjords","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate-related changes in environmental conditions, such as reduction of sea ice, intensive glacier retreat, and increasing\nsummer precipitation, directly influence the arctic marine environment and, therefore, the organisms living\nthere. Benthic organisms, being an important food source for organisms from higher trophic levels, constitute an important\npart of the Arctic trophic network. Moreover, the long lifespan and limited mobility of some benthic species\nmake them suitable for the study of the spatial and temporal variability of contaminants. In this study, organochlorine\npollutants (polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hexachlorobenzene (HCB)) were measured in benthic organisms collected\nin three fjords of western Spitsbergen. Two of these were recommended by the Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem\nFunctioning (MARBEF) Network of Excellence as European flagship sites, namely Hornsund as the Biodiversity\nInventory and Kongsfjorden as the Long-Term Biodiversity Observatory. Adventfjorden, with notable human activity,\nwas also studied. Ʃ7 PCB and HCB concentrations in sediments were up to 2.4 and 0.18 ng/g d.w. respectively. Concentrations\nof Ʃ7 PCBs and HCB measured in collected benthic organisms were up to 9.1 and 13 ng/g w.w., respectively.\nIn several samples (41 of 169) the concentrations of Σ7 PCBs were below the detection limit values, yet\nnevertheless the results of the research show effective accumulation of target organochlorine contaminants by many\nArctic benthic organisms. Important interspecies differences were observed. Free-living, mobile taxa, such as shrimp\nEualus gaimardii, have accumulated a large quantity of contaminants, most probably due to their predatory lifestyle.\nΣ7 PCB and HCB concentrations were both significantly higher in Hornsund than in Kongsfjorden. Biomagnification\noccurred in 0 to 100 % of the predator-prey pairs, depending on the congener analyzed. Although the sampled organisms\nwere proved to have accumulated organochlorine contaminants, the measured levels can be considered low, and\nnot posing a substantial threat to the

the seasonal impact of optically significant water constituents on surface heating rates in the western Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Heating rates induced by optically significant water constituents (OSCs), e.g. phytoplankton and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), contribute to the seasonal modulation of thermal energy fluxes across the ocean–atmosphere interface in coastal and regional shelf seas. This is investigated in the western Baltic Sea, a marginal sea characterised by considerable inputs of freshwater carrying nutrients and CDOM and by complex bio-optical and hydrodynamic processes. Using a coupled bio-optical ocean model (ROMS–Bio-Optic), the inherent optical properties of different OSCs are modelled under varying environmental conditions, and the underwater light field is spectrally resolved in a dynamic ocean. We estimate the relative contribution of these OSCs to the divergence of the heat flux and heating rates and find that, while phytoplankton and CDOM both contribute to surface heating in summer, phytoplankton dominates the OSC contribution to heating in spring, and CDOM dominates the OSC contribution to heating in autumn. The study shows that seasonal and spatial changes in OSCs in the western Baltic Sea have a small but noticeable impact on radiative heating in surface waters and consequences for the exchange of energy fluxes across the air–sea interface and the distribution of heat within the water column. In the Pomeranian Bight, where riverine influx of CDOM is strongest, water-constituent-induced heating rates in surface waters in 2018 are estimated to be between 0.8 and 0.9 K m−1 d−1 in spring and summer, predominantly as a result of increased absorption by phytoplankton and CDOM. Further offshore, OSC-induced heating rates during the same periods are estimated to be between 0.4 and 0.8 K m−1 d−1. Warmer surface waters are balanced by cooler subsurface waters. Surface heat fluxes (latent, sensible and longwave) respond to warmer sea surface temperatures, with a small increase in heat loss to the atmosphere of 5 W m−2 during the period April to September. We find relatively good agreement between our modelled water constituent absorption and in situ and satellite observations. More rigorous co-located heating-rate calculations using an atmosphere–ocean radiative transfer model provide evidence of the suitability of the ROMS–Bio-Optic model for estimating heating rates."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a652f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"2743-2768","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64b522064097071d472520f1","5e709347878c28a0473a652f","64b522064097071d472520f2","64b522064097071d472520f3","64b522064097071d472520f4","64b522064097071d472520f5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477336","mniswId":"2417","title":"Biogeosciences","issn":"1726-4189","websiteLink":"www.biogeosciences.net/12/6493/2015/","documentHash":"9312d442-03bc-4ac9-b1b5-5323c52b58fc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64b522064097071d472520f0","year":"2023","volume":"20","number":"13","documentHash":"db0cf44c-1fad-40f6-b806-71da816b0171"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058779712"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64b501fb4097071d4722f0fb","name":"Ingrid","lastName":"Wiedmann","documentHash":"e808c994-089a-4eb2-aedd-9bf89f36e6df"},{"objectId":"64b501fb4097071d4722f0fa","name":"Ilka","lastName":"Peeken","documentHash":"49395a84-e210-4347-953c-4ded552f56a3"},{"objectId":"64b501fb4097071d4722f0f9","name":"Christine","lastName":"Dybwad","documentHash":"ba10a630-d82e-4cbc-ae3b-14e35f8913b2"},{"objectId":"5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","name":"Marc","lastName":"Silberberger","uuid":"E363DD7660B6F1967F260E77F0DEF03CA3C92DBDD2009A5DBC438FB3DAEB66FD9BD2F93626269E3F1CFEEB33857F9B6DB8B35FB96FCEC7ADE22AD4C7FDCB76B5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8819-4388","documentHash":"5c5d0ad5-b173-4b3e-82f6-be9607003a7e"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"89E34998A7815703314F14609081D0B42B721BC6BC02334A524F1A72E99979BE1D2892A3F7AD68FC281490897050CAC6FC5A6472BC066A2DFADD377EF7948831","orcidId":"0000-0002-8175-575X","documentHash":"60624fd9-0ebc-49d7-8f66-5b468fb82647"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Winogradow","uuid":"D50057AD40012BE33D95DBDE17AFF8252F4D4C8BE533331AE47A267772A7AF1EA340927A58A08E00BF25C00BEE718EC87BAB202495DEBA6319C1787B88209CC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6214-9017","documentHash":"5ac9951c-6a34-42af-b699-05492c580241"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6546","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kędra","uuid":"B950AFC0394B7FA11EB92F7D86E8B739E8F8E7879A82119B50736842491ECD0E305659B79802EAF50951C7A11F3F4453F898F95EE3550F2986DCF421440D2324","orcidId":"0000-0002-2223-5850","documentHash":"dc1fef89-bd48-43c8-8077-d9cff1028c90"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993cf","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"BACE9E820844C505745871AB1E069A3FE871A0AA597DB695946ABCEDABDAE239968DE9050390480EE9C612EF6607DE8183FD2AFDFD78CEDEECA17F889594D919","documentHash":"3bc43de3-b90c-4854-8782-492442b45a2c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-07-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64b501fb4097071d4722f0f7","doi":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110487","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1470160X23006295?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Macrofauna and meiofauna food-web structure from Arctic fjords to deep Arctic Ocean during spring: A stable isotope approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The knowledge on benthic trophic relations is particularly important for understanding the functioning of still pristine and less studied Arctic Ocean ecosystems. This study examines the benthic food-web structure in the European sector of the Arctic Ocean and assesses if and how it differs along depth gradients in the marginal sea-ice zone during spring. Samples of the sediment organic matter were collected in May/June 2015 and May 2016 at stations representing different sedimentary habitats (fjord, shelf, slope/basin), and stable isotopes of δ13C and δ15N were used to determine macro- and meiofauna food-web structure. Our results show that the food-web structure differed both among the three studied habitat types and between macro- and meiofauna components of benthic communities, and that these differences were related to the quality and quantity of organic matter. Meiofauna in fjords and on the shelf mainly relied on the reworked sediment organic matter while macrofauna utilized more fresh organic matter, sedimenting to the sea floor. In fjords and on the shelf, benthos displayed a high degree of omnivory and non-selective feeding while on the slope and in deep basins feeding on higher trophic levels dominated. In the latter, benthos seemed also to have utilized highly reworked organic matter. As the organic matter quantity and quality were major drivers of trophic relations in all studied areas, the benthic food webs will likely face cascading effects following the modification of pelagic food webs due to climatic changes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","5e709347878c28a0473a6546","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d","5e709481878c28a0473be9a6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"154","pagesFromTo":"110487","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a0473993cf","5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d","64b501fb4097071d4722f0f9","64b501fb4097071d4722f0fa","64b501fb4097071d4722f0fb","5e709347878c28a0473a6546"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779f6","mniswId":"5322","title":"Ecological Indicators","issn":"1470-160X","eissn":"1470-160X","documentHash":"807f288a-7088-4fdc-9c91-78a88af56bcf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64b4e2c44097071d472117b0","year":"2023","volume":"154","documentHash":"6ec75473-1fb2-4d19-9f53-7921aa3a9220"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Benthos","Depth gradient","European Arctic Ocean","δ13C","δ15N","Organic matter mixtures"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058779786"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6462045940970734435aa899","name":"Jutta","lastName":"Wollenburg","documentHash":"718583fa-91f8-4542-8a5b-49f83c12da6b"},{"objectId":"6462045940970734435aa898","name":"Maria","lastName":"Holzmann","documentHash":"641535ca-2a14-4f4f-8ca6-6f33553fb079"},{"objectId":"6462045940970734435aa897","name":"Bruce W.","lastName":"Hayward","documentHash":"a5065360-b139-4c40-93c1-de6808e8f491"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2cac","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Majewski","uuid":"6A9A1F51F8D6B8BFF70183E8E7FC79109556E1C2325D88724491707987802B0DCFD7F637794C637E5E5E17B69988332FB7EB7D343C641A5B0886434601AB0714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5407-1782","documentHash":"852d65bf-f2be-49f4-a926-9e5ddebce95b"}],"objectId":"6462045940970734435aa895","doi":"10.47894/mpal.69.3.01","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.47894/mpal.69.3.01","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Taxonomy and biogeography of living species of the Family Notorotaliidae (Notorotalia, Parrellina, Porosorotalia, Buccella, Cristatavultus)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"DNA sequencing shows that species of the genera Notorotalia, Porosorotalia and Buccella form a distinct branch (Notorotaliidae) of Rotaloidea, and cluster as sister to Elphidiidae.

This information has been combined with all the morphological descriptive information on species of these genera plus the genera Cristatavultus and Parrellina to provide a global synthesis of living species of the Notorotaliidae. We recognize 11 species of the southern hemisphere genus Notorotalia, which has a centre of diversity around New Zealand (8 species). A second southern-hemisphere-restricted genus, restricted to eastern Australia is Parrellina (3 species) although specimens (possibly introduced) have been recorded from the Mediterranean Sea. Cristatavultus has a single species, with a tropical west Pacific distribution.We synonymize Cribrorotalia under Porosorotalia, which has a disjunct distribution with one species in the northwest Pacific and a second around the southern parts of South America. Buccella is the most diverse and widespread genus (16 species recognized) with its greatest abundance in the Arctic Ocean and around subantarctic-temperate South America. Five species of Buccella live in a belt along the west coast of central America, from USA to Peru, with some spillage into the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. Two new species of Buccella are recognized: B. dejardini (from South Georgia) and Buccella n. sp.

We sampled the Beagle Channel and five tributary fjords, with and without glaciers, to explore modern foraminifera of this little studied region. Surface sediments (mud, sand, pebbles, and shell debris) were collected at 45 stations from water depths 15 to 250 m, along with four short cores. The soft bottom recovered at 35 stations was analyzed for grain size, Loss-on-ignition reflecting content of organic matter, and Rose-Bengal-stained foraminifera. The benthic fauna consisted of 86 attached and free-living species. Uvigerina bifurcata, Alveolophragmium orbiculatum, Ammobaculites americanus, Stainforthia fusiformis, Globobulimina notovata, and Nonionoides grateloupii were dominant. As shown by downcore distribution, U. bifurcata and A. orbiculatum occupied epifaunal and G. notovata and S. fusiformis infaunal microhabitats. Distribution of the dominant foraminifera showed no clear pattern, with the exception of S. fusiformis, which formed a monospecific assemblage in sediments enriched with organic matter. Certain subdominant species, including Cassidulinoides parkerianus, Pullenia subcarinata, and Cibicides fletcheri, showed environmental affinity to more sandy sediments, whereas the assemblage from more muddy sediments had no inherent taxa. Foraminiferal standing crop in size fraction >125 μm was mostly 100 to 500 specimens per 10 cm3 but dropped to <1 specimen near glacier fronts, where foraminifera varied greatly between stations and did not constitute a single, unified assemblage. This patchy pattern seems to result from environmental instability caused by rapidly settling mineral fines and from random dispersal and activation of propagules. It helps to interpret records of other meltwater-dominated events."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"181","pagesFromTo":"102248","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6462057f40970734435aba72","6462057f40970734435aba73","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2cac","6462057f40970734435aba75","6462057f40970734435aba76","6462057f40970734435aba77","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d71","mniswId":"13921","title":"Marine Micropaleontology","issn":"0377-8398","documentHash":"aa32512a-1300-4ee0-b0f8-60e231353023"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6462057f40970734435aba71","year":"2023","volume":"181","documentHash":"21b586f7-f6ba-410d-ba71-3dcab06d8910"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058779953"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf339","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gozdowska","uuid":"0095819996D9E12A4CCB68D7603511E52342E40B4DD0B4A75469CCF3319E539B2A9712E9EE4A28E25E3A06A0359E59AFBD109B8577D9086D92BC8A4B090F0E96","orcidId":"0000-0002-7927-2230","documentHash":"718e83b3-8dea-4887-8d81-8a236189fd4f"},{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b145c","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Pomianowski","uuid":"603CADF218161162F9EE0EF5FF649F72A209F2C892AB9FB544620799FE6468D66393864961B218B455F861A60B8C17AA3B3307CD49FD2BDB3248A8BB20226796","orcidId":"0000-0002-5256-3847","documentHash":"4eac7e58-e247-4e83-af17-ac064891ffde"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6540","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Sokołowska","uuid":"D6944E39F11647B9CB39D76C875F189E054DB1D541E7D46FDB7EA92C47490CC1DA169945BD5055E6F569553E6911FAF27656D4C1D49251AE978AB14B1DD041C9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6576-8238","documentHash":"3e9be6ee-04ef-4230-84f5-3c624c45153c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a650f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kulczykowska","uuid":"856B07BDA8ABD3060D5000D705193A7D38A1150782FA1BCC8AF1C8253AC8ED7804B7E4E0308C1B5B61504F79D590C22B401EEA1B5757A14951EE90881A585932","orcidId":"0000-0002-3979-9310","documentHash":"e7b053a3-a963-4c82-9964-cd686c8db387"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-08-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64e49e7e40970741dcc8ac6b","doi":"10.1016/j.cbpa.2023.111493","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2023.111493","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The cutaneous stress response system in three-spined stickleback and European flounder exposed to oxidative stress: Different mode of action","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In fish, the skin is directly exposed to multiple environmental stressors and provides the first line of defense against harmful external factors. It turned out that cortisol and melatonin (Mel) are involved in fish cutaneous stress response system (CSRS) similar to mammalian. This study investigates the mode of action of CSRS in two teleost species of different biology and skin characteristics, the three-spined stickleback and the European flounder, after exposure to oxidative stress induced by a potassium dichromate solution. The cutaneous stress response system presents different ways of action in two studied species: Mel concentration increases in the skin of both species, but cortisol concentration increases in the skin only in sticklebacks. Data suggest that stickleback skin cells can produce cortisol. However, cortisol is not involved in the response to oxidative stress in flounders. In stickleback skin, two genes encoding AANAT and ASMT/HIOMT (enzymes involved in Mel synthesis), aanat1a and asmt2, are expressed, but in flounder skin, only one, asmtl. Because gene expression does not change in stickleback skin after exposure to stress, the source of increased Mel is probably outside the skin. A lack of expression of the gene encoding AANAT in flounder skin strongly suggests that Mel is transported to the skin by the bloodstream from other sites of synthesis. Pigment dispersion in the skin after exposure to oxidative stress is found only in sticklebacks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6540","5e709489878c28a0473bf339","5e709347878c28a0473a650f","5e7093d1878c28a0473b145c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"285","pagesFromTo":"111493","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d1878c28a0473b145c","5e709489878c28a0473bf339","5e709347878c28a0473a6540","5e709347878c28a0473a650f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477752","mniswId":"4125","title":"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

However, its marine ecosystem is extremely complex. In this study, we analyze modern assemblages of dinoflagellate cysts (dinocysts) and benthic foraminifera from surface sediment samples around Svalbard. We use multivariate statistical analyses to examine relationships between environmental conditions (summer and winter sea surface temperature and salinity, sea-ice cover, etc.) and both microfossil groups to evaluate their use as proxies for reconstructions of the marine environment in the region. Our results show that the most important factor controlling the environment around Svalbard is the Atlantic Water which mostly impacts the western coast, but its influence reaches as far as the eastern coast of Nordaustlandet. However, on a local scale, such factors as the sea-ice cover, the presence of tidewater glaciers, or even the morphology and hydrology of fjords become increasingly important. We found that two dinocyst species, cysts of Polarella glacialis and Echinidinium karaense, can be considered regional winter drift ice indicators. The relationships between environmental parameters and benthic foraminiferal assemblages are much more difficult to interpret. Although statistical analysis shows a correlation of benthic foraminiferal species with various environmental parameters, this correlation might be somewhat coincidental and caused by other factors not analyzed in this study. Nevertheless, the use of two complementary microfossil groups as (paleo)environmental indicators can provide a more comprehensive picture of the environmental conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","5e709347878c28a0473a6526"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"65","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"571-594","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","64f99b0b40970774badf0dbe","64f99b0b40970774badf0dbf","64f99b0b40970774badf0dc0","5e709347878c28a0473a6526"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f99b0b40970774badf0dbd","year":"2023","volume":"65","number":"4","documentHash":"cc7dfba5-2b78-451b-87ce-be4ff7a64cd7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["North Atlantic","Nordic Seas","Sea ice","Primary productivity","Fjords","Sediments","Chlorophyll-a"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058825390"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64a7dd374097074cfbc809f0","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Litwicka","documentHash":"60721e5f-0d11-4827-93b9-55480baddb5e"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655f","name":"Monika","lastName":"Zabłocka","uuid":"58E70D68D4B9FE617EDFA003AA14C9D0A51015AC1DABC1CF4A226E6321ADA8A39282E694843E243857E0D6C8361BC3158D3964E2C2972AFBE2F582251BE479B0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1803-7042","documentHash":"fccb5939-114b-4195-8ef6-aeeaa2d9f5cc"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655e","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Meler","uuid":"2F3E19BDA0F2EE6A613A21EFFEF27A1BC60F4AEB46F0BB7A9219CE27CAAC58E250F03C70E634CCEC4139860231895E5B061F61CFB1CC00D82DF8C993940FE3E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7112-5041","documentHash":"d0d5c686-65bf-47df-9360-d148ab143b30"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64a7dd374097074cfbc809ee","doi":"10.5194/bg-20-2525-2023","publicUri":"https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/20/2525/2023/bg-20-2525-2023.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Variability of light absorption coefficients by different size fractions of suspensions in the southern Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Measurements of light absorption coefficients by particles suspended in seawater (ap(λ)), by phytoplankton (aph(λ)) and detritus (ad(λ)) were carried out in the southern Baltic Sea for the original seawater samples and four size fractions: pico-particles (0.2–2 µm), ultra-particles (2–5 µm), nano-particles (5–20 µm) and micro-particles (20–200 µm).

UDN affects primarily an epidermal and\ndermal layer of the skin lesion, which in the early stages, occurs in the head area\nof migratory adult salmonids entering freshwater for upstream river migration.\nStudies show that acid-base water properties in estuaries are exceptionally\ndynamic, which results from the variability of the CO 2 system. The carbonate\nsystem is shaped by the net effect of mineralization and primary production\nenhanced by: i) the constant inflow of nutrients and organic matter from the land\nand ii) the horizontal and vertical mixing of the two end-members of the total\nalkalinity, dissolved organic carbon and pCO 2 ; both cause high acid-base\ngradients between the river and the ocean. Climate change affects the\nbiogeochemical characteristics of estuaries. We show a strong positive\ncorrelation between local temperature anomalies along the Polish coast and\nthe occurrence of UDN in Salmo trutta sp. spawners in the Słupia River, Poland.\nThe results suggest that the biogeochemical processes associated with climate\nchange may be at least one component of the UDN aetiology.

In particular, there is only limited knowledge on the development of ocean currents after the last deglaciation. Here, to better understand past water mass dynamics and their effects on sea ice cover and the environment throughout the Holocene, we present a multiproxy record from core OCE2019-HR7-GC retrieved from the southwestern Svalbard inner shelf, a highly dynamic frontal area influenced by different ocean currents and local water masses. For sea ice reconstructions, we focus on the specific sea ice biomarker IP25 in combination with the phytoplankton biomarkers dinosterol and brassicasterol. We further reconstruct surface and bottom water temperatures using alkenones and Mg/Ca and prevailing water masses using foraminifera assemblages. Finally, we compare our sea ice and temperature records with published marine sediment and ice core data from the area. We observe extensive sea ice cover between 11 and 10.2 kyr BP, which was likely linked to the Preboreal Oscillation. Based on our reconstructions, the period between 10 and 7 kyr BP was characterized by the warmest Holocene conditions on the SW Svalbard shelf. This interval is also associated with high surface water productivity and an enhanced AW influx that drove strong erosive activity at the bottom. After 6.5 kyr BP, the SW Svalbard shelf was characterized by a dynamic environment with cold and unstable conditions that lasted until 3.5 kyr BP. After 3.5 kyr BP, we observed an increase in sea ice cover and iceberg rafting over our site once more, which likely indicated seasonally fluctuating ice margins, with low AW influx, which lasted until 2.2 kyr BP. A brief warm period accompanied by strong bottom currents occurred between 2.2 and 1.8 kyr BP. The environment returned to a colder state with the presence of sea ice until 1.5 kyr BP, which was followed by warmer conditions between 1.5 and 1 kyr BP."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac216","60c2fe8e9543c7233654386e","5e709347878c28a0473a6543","5e709347878c28a0473a6526","6018f0599543c74f83155203","5e709469878c28a0473bc63c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"228","pagesFromTo":"104213","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fe8e9543c7233654386e","5e709469878c28a0473bc63c","6018f0599543c74f83155203","5e709347878c28a0473a6543","5e709388878c28a0473ac216","651563474097070bf2a05c47","651563474097070bf2a05c48","651563474097070bf2a05c49","5e709347878c28a0473a6526"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e4d","mniswId":"7241","title":"GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE","issn":"0921-8181","documentHash":"08b96e6b-9739-4b62-820d-32070dcbbac0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"651563474097070bf2a05c46","year":"2023","volume":"228","documentHash":"b44a1135-47d5-494a-bf6c-5a9a5c5b47bf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic","Hornsund","Atlantic Water","Arctic Water","Foraminifera","Stable isotopes","Biomarker","Holocene"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058861940"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64e5f402409707485e7ab7ed","name":"W.

Seasonal and year-to-year variations in terminus position act on all tidewater glaciers, but the key controls on those changes vary from region to region. Here, we examined seasonal and decadal changes in termini positions of seven tidewater glaciers in the inner part of Hornsund, the southernmost fjord of Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago), based on a variety of data from 1992 to 2020. Combining satellite imagery, basic meteorological data (air temperature, positive degree day index (PDD), liquid precipitation), sea surface temperature (SST), mean temperature in the glacier forefield bays, fast sea ice cover, and bathymetry near the glacier front, we examined the influence of potential controlling parameters on interannual and seasonal variability of the glacier termini. We found regional synchrony between terminus advance/retreat and climate variables. At a regional scale, annual fluctuation changes are related to PDD and SST, while summer fluctuations are linked to PDD, although individual glaciers are shown to have differing sensitivities to potential climate drivers. We also found that the retreat period in Hornsund generally lasts from June to October-December. Onset of the retreat is related to sea and air temperature, and in some cases follows the disappearance of the ice cover. These results indicate that the expected increase in meltwater runoff in Svalbard, the input of relatively warm Atlantic water to the fjord, and the increasing trend of longer summer and warmer winter periods will have implications for glacier velocity and frontal ablation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e7878c28a04739f076","5e7092eb878c28a04739f39a","5e7092ea878c28a04739f1d3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6525","5e70943f878c28a0473b8d4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"128","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f1d3","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","5e7092eb878c28a04739f39a","5e7092e7878c28a04739f076","5e709347878c28a0473a6525","5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","5e70943f878c28a0473b8d4d","64e5f402409707485e7ab7eb","64e5f402409707485e7ab7ec","64e5f402409707485e7ab7ed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c848","mniswId":"11228","title":"JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE","issn":"2169-9003","eissn":"2169-9011","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ab983f3b-1fb8-4ca6-a33e-e1600c727eeb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64e5f402409707485e7ab7e9","year":"2023","volume":"128","number":"5","documentHash":"895f7360-b19d-462c-91a5-11b331a38915"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058871905"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64c8bc834097073b97da6776","name":"Adrian H.","lastName":"Callaghan","documentHash":"e5a1b9bc-7942-4713-8d5e-5ffe5ec97fb2"},{"objectId":"64c8bc834097073b97da6775","name":"Christa A.","lastName":"Marandino","documentHash":"5e177317-4a47-4389-a4ab-51494a067e23"},{"objectId":"64c8bc834097073b97da6774","name":"Ryan","lastName":"Pereira","documentHash":"36cd2684-5e7c-4d98-a5ce-a96c75a66e0b"},{"objectId":"64c8bc834097073b97da6773","name":"David K.","lastName":"Woolf","documentHash":"c6ce8ad9-ab47-4a99-bf40-8291ee8c486a"},{"objectId":"64c8bc834097073b97da6772","name":"Lonneke","lastName":"Goddijn-Murphy","documentHash":"61944ccd-dc36-42c8-9ec2-3ce5c6428309"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6516","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Piskozub","uuid":"F6CDFD38B1C79615F0E0B20F3365ADD4B1200329EA42AC8AB53AB7E23D15B94E0649AE8F62EF4883789E83DA9ED8CAC69BBD68B558F56384A5E1528EA9B5C86D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3386-6604","documentHash":"59cdfcf5-844a-466b-9794-c7ac52086fa5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64c8bc834097073b97da6770","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2023.1180761","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1180761/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The links between marine plastic litter and the air-sea flux of greenhouse gases","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate change and plastic pollution are two of the most pressing environmental challenges caused by human activity, and they are directly and indirectly linked. We focus on the relationship between marine plastic litter and the air-sea flux of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Marine plastic litter has the potential to both enhance and reduce oceanic GHG fluxes, but this depends on many factors that are not well understood. Different kinds of plastic behave quite differently in the sea, affecting air-sea gas exchange in different, largely unknown, ways. The mechanisms of air-sea exchange of GHGs have been extensively studied and if air-sea gas transfer coefficients and concentrations of the gas in water and air are known, calculating the resulting GHG fluxes is reasonably straightforward. However, relatively little is known about the consequences of marine plastic litter for gas transfer coefficients, concentrations, and fluxes. Here we evaluate the most important aspects controlling the exchange of GHGs between the sea and the atmosphere and how marine plastic litter could change these. The aim is to move towards improving air-sea GHG flux calculations in the presence of plastic litter and we have largely limited ourselves to identifying processes, rather than estimating relative importance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

of marine microbiome sampling protocols","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Research on marine microbial communities is growing, but studies are hard to compare because of variation in seawater sampling protocols. To help researchers in the inter-comparison of studies that use different seawater sampling methodologies, as well as to help them design future sampling campaigns, we developed the EuroMarine Open Science Exploration initiative (EMOSE). Within the EMOSE framework, we sampled thousands of liters of seawater from a single station in the NW Mediterranean Sea (Service d'Observation du Laboratoire Arago [SOLA], Banyuls-sur-Mer), during one single day. The resulting dataset includes multiple seawater processing approaches, encompassing different material-type kinds of filters (cartridge membrane and flat membrane), three different size fractionations (>0.22 µm, 0.22–3 µm, 3–20 µm and >20 µm), and a number of different seawater volumes ranging from 1 L up to 1000 L. We show that the volume of seawater that is filtered does not have a significant effect on prokaryotic and protist diversity, independently of the sequencing strategy. However, there was a clear difference in alpha and beta diversity between size fractions and between these and “whole water” (with no pre-fractionation). Overall, we recommend care when merging data from datasets that use filters of different pore size, but we consider that the type of filter and volume should not act as confounding variables for the tested sequencing strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a publicly available dataset effectively allows for the clarification of the impact of marine microbiome methodological options across a wide range of protocols, including large-scale variations in sampled volume."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86eb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"3","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"84","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64f5c9aa40970725b31067bb","64f5c9aa40970725b31067bc","64f5c9aa40970725b31067bd","64f5c9aa40970725b31067be","64f5c9aa40970725b31067bf","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c0","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c1","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c2","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c3","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c4","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c5","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c6","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c7","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c8","64f5c9aa40970725b31067c9","64f5c9aa40970725b31067ca","5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","64f5c9aa40970725b31067cb","64f5c9aa40970725b31067cc","64f5c9aa40970725b31067cd","64f5c9aa40970725b31067ce","64f5c9aa40970725b31067cf","64f5c9aa40970725b31067d0","64f5c9aa40970725b31067d1","64f5c9aa40970725b31067d2","64f5c9aa40970725b31067d3","64f5c9aa40970725b31067d4","64f5c9aa40970725b31067d5","64f5c9aa40970725b31067d6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"64f5c9aa40970725b31067ba","title":"ISME Communications","eissn":"2730-6151","websiteLink":"https://www.nature.com/ismecomms","documentHash":"08f761a5-b1df-47d1-be22-5399a621c96d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Metagenomics","Microbial ecology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058881424"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd869","name":"Rolf","lastName":"Gradinger","documentHash":"dee34d21-507c-4980-bcde-25ba4f569fc3"},{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd868","name":"Bente","lastName":"Edvardsen","documentHash":"e46abd57-e331-43ec-8e77-a8b812a6d38e"},{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd867","name":"Evan","lastName":"Patrohay","documentHash":"9cb95630-5937-492e-b484-4a4abb7c083c"},{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd866","name":"Emily","lastName":"Down","documentHash":"67714d10-cc18-4705-8b18-ff0d12346f67"},{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd865","name":"Signe","lastName":"Aaboe","documentHash":"49f861d3-3b78-4cf6-bedd-a6d49cec1236"},{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd864","name":"Bodil A.","lastName":"Bluhm","documentHash":"acca09b3-c994-4cd6-9a4b-9eca9544b378"},{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd863","name":"Philipp","lastName":"Assmy","documentHash":"1a37d6c7-41df-435e-81e2-42b4b5968de5"},{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd862","name":"Lucie","lastName":"Goraguer","documentHash":"9fbd9116-966e-47ff-9500-26783679a7f3"},{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd861","name":"Miriam","lastName":"Marquardt","documentHash":"f617b927-2890-426c-bcd1-1eb459ea8581"},{"objectId":"60d2e5559543c723365445bd","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Smoła","uuid":"214E8AB79C782002DCD9A9A96BBBEBCD25C22A0A1CB7BADFEB42F339F9FC134D3950648AC3DC66B2634B9020230687648DF3337428758ED2B1DE626778B93163","documentHash":"5dda202c-44be-4af1-84d5-40bbd1c26b79"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf359","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tatarek","uuid":"7EE1E47D321F50DCA10E3EE8AE6B69ADAD102DD6F260B15C5FAFB4CDB18ADAB7DB98698EDA96C3F6694FEBFAE6E998A04B022F2EE8AF42B5FAA1B158F078B131","orcidId":"0000-0003-1467-6362","documentHash":"70339abc-aa35-4e2b-ab8b-296f2bba7dce"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655c","name":"Józef","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"E8901DD6BAD74E4F0A531BC69DC86134B02AC9BDAB17361AAFA79F2ED26ABBC473DFEDC614DF70B146B917A0E212BFD4740299FB5AB0C805A789195BA88BE5E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2344-0047","documentHash":"6a141822-0a06-4fc9-83c5-d08f585c8615"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-27","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd85f","doi":"10.1016/j.pocean.2023.103128","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0079661123001714?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Seasonal dynamics of sea-ice protist and meiofauna in the northwestern Barents Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The rapid decline of Arctic sea ice makes understanding sympagic (ice-associated) biology a particularly urgent task. Here we studied the poorly known seasonality of sea-ice protist and meiofauna community composition, abundance and biomass in the bottom 30 cm of sea ice in relation to ice properties and ice drift trajectories in the northwestern Barents Sea. We expected low abundances during the polar night and highest values during spring prior to ice melt. Sea ice conditions and Chlorophyll a concentrations varied strongly seasonally, while particulate organic carbon concentrations were fairly stable throughout the seasons. In December to May we sampled growing first-year ice, while in July and August melting older sea ice dominated. Low sea-ice biota abundances in March could be related to the late onset of ice formation and short time period for ice algae and uni- and multicellular grazers to establish themselves. Pennate diatoms, such as Navicula spp. and Nitzschia spp., dominated the bottom ice algal communities and were present during all seasons. Except for May, ciliates, dinoflagellates, particularly of the order Gymnodiales, and small-sized flagellates were co-dominant. Ice meiofauna (here including large ciliates and foraminifers) was comprised mainly of harpacticoid copepods, copepod nauplii, rotifers, large ciliates and occasionally acoels and foraminifers, with dominance of omnivore species throughout the seasons. Large ciliates comprised the most abundant meiofauna taxon at all ice stations and seasons (50–90 %) but did not necessarily dominate the biomass. While ice melt might have released and reduced ice algal biomass in July, meiofauna abundance remained high, indicating different annual cycles of protist versus meiofauna taxa. In May highest Chlorophyll a concentrations (29.4 mg m−2) and protist biomass (107 mg C m−2) occurred, while highest meiofauna abundance was found in August (23.9 × 103 Ind. m−2) and biomass in December (0.6 mg C m−2). The abundant December ice biota community further strengthens the emerging notion of an active biota during the dark Arctic winter. The data demonstrated a strong and partially unexpected seasonality in the Barents Sea ice biota, indicating that changes in ice formation, drift and decay will significantly impact the functioning of the ice-associated ecosystem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60d2e5559543c723365445bd","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","5e709489878c28a0473bf359"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"218","pagesFromTo":"103128","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651d16f840970737b83fd861","651d16f840970737b83fd862","651d16f840970737b83fd863","651d16f840970737b83fd864","651d16f840970737b83fd865","651d16f840970737b83fd866","651d16f840970737b83fd867","651d16f840970737b83fd868","5e709489878c28a0473bf359","60d2e5559543c723365445bd","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","651d16f840970737b83fd869"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"4bc3bbad-0ed4-4dfe-8f62-93517ff00731"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"651d16f840970737b83fd860","year":"2023","volume":"218","documentHash":"d2be84b6-bfa0-4b52-8d46-ee08aa9e77ff"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sympagic","Sea-ice biota","Seasonality","Foraminifers","First-year ice","Ice drift","Barents Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058887677"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac37a","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Kosek","uuid":"580974CB932CB9CB9F745E04EA8FDCC73A6416953BF93826231A8DB6AEADD3D7FCF80210B3DFE1C8D733CC02FB1884641FBCEA604F9998EF3FE0E4797C11F887","orcidId":"0000-0003-1372-6567","documentHash":"11f2f9cc-0a47-42b4-a859-1339732ed7d8"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"objectId":"652cf473409707703df6fa97","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115655","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0025326X23010901?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Impact of kelp forest on seawater chemistry – A review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Kelp forests, globally distributed in cool temperate and polar waters, are renowned for their pivotal role in supporting species diversity and fostering macroalgae productivity. These high-canopy algal ecosystems dynamically influence their surroundings, particularly by altering the physicochemical properties of seawater. This review article aims to underscore the significance of kelp forests in modifying water masses. By serving as effective carbon sinks through the absorption of bicarbonate (HCO3−) and carbon dioxide (CO2) for photosynthesis, kelp forests mitigate nearby acidity levels while enhancing dissolved oxygen concentrations, essential for sustaining diverse marine communities. Additionally, kelp beds have exhibited the need to use inorganic ions (NO3−, NO2−, PO43−) from seawater in order to grow, albeit with associated increases in NH4+ concentrations. Specific examples and findings from relevant studies will be presented to illustrate the profound impact of kelp forests on seawater chemistry, emphasizing their vital role in marine ecosystems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e709389878c28a0473ac37a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"196","pagesFromTo":"115655","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709389878c28a0473ac37a","5e709347878c28a0473a6522"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d73","mniswId":"13923","title":"MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN","issn":"0025-326X","documentHash":"660ed6d4-6a65-41f7-86f9-b65deb221d1c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"652cf473409707703df6fa98","year":"2023","volume":"196","documentHash":"74ff181c-dc2e-47ab-ab55-48ec7907aa5b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Coastal zone","Environmental changes","Kelp forest","Marine environment modifications","Seawater chemistry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058921641"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61bd55b87523404d4a8fb735","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Świrad","uuid":"118C55086299242EB0FE154506AB4D2F71EA2D033D3C766F63142F846E784403975854F4974BA2A8C8AA0C22B7830DC2A10A25BE58A31FFB5418A873809D8C09","documentHash":"15dc3d29-c743-41f9-8cf3-4fdaeafd5cd5"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Moskalik","uuid":"7089D643B2594CC57D59DE2700FC187DBB9C4D62E0328B409B12232373FF164ED96D4B648D07CC92EF366549051735987A73E346A7B7CAB38ED8A2FACEA2C173","orcidId":"0000-0002-0615-9528","documentHash":"312a8722-20f8-4f71-88a9-6b2d058d4efe"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393766","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Herman","uuid":"44B5293D87B2EFB8CF355798E377F5251631920D04E7A3E09EDA286CBD683C0530A7B5ED2F5BD7717F072D01EA9C58EA8281064069FF24ECECBD141524BB57A2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5112-7165","documentHash":"d2114a83-e13a-4055-b93a-e52ed09a78ec"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"652fb7874097077f8aa8083a","doi":"10.5194/essd-15-2623-2023","publicUri":"https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2623/2023/essd-15-2623-2023.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Wind wave and water level dataset for Hornsund, Svalbard (2013–2021)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Underwater pressure sensors were deployed near-continuously at various locations of the nearshore\n(8–23 m depth) Hornsund fjord, Svalbard, between July 2013 and February 2021.

These water types require a local approach when developing bio-optical algorithms that combine the inherent and the apparent properties of seawater. Well-established local algorithms are of great value for understanding and addressing rapid changes in water quality related mostly to human activities in coastal and near-shore zones, as well as in optically similar lakes. Our research analyses the possibility of using the multi-parameter algorithms of absorption a(λ), backscattering bb(λ) and remote sensing reflectance Rrs(λ), originally developed for the coastal waters of the Southern Baltic Sea, for three selected Pomeranian lakes. Our multi-parameter algorithms are based on the input concentrations of the biogeochemical components measured in the lake waters, i.e., chlorophyll a (Chl a), suspended particulate matter (SPM), inorganic suspended particulate matter (SPMinorg), the sum of the surface concentrations of accessory pigments (ΣC) and coloured dissolved organic matter with a wavelength of 400 nm (aCDOM(400)). Rrs(λ) and a(λ) output values were compared with independent measurements of these parameters conducted in the lake waters at 20 sampling stations. Our algorithm output values of bb(λ) were compared to the values obtained based on the algorithm provided by Ficek, previously developed and validated for Pomeranian lakes, at the same stations. The statistical analyses conducted afterwards showed that the multi-parameter algorithms of Rrs(λ) and a(λ) for the Southern Baltic Sea are sufficient to be used for the stations investigated in the aforementioned three lakes. Specifically, the correlations between the bb(λ) values obtained based on the Ficek algorithm and the bb(λ) values obtained using our multi-parameter algorithm reveal a statistical error rate of less than 20%."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709489878c28a0473bf331"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de47","uid":"b9NOtn1zRuLii9te8l8urZA","uuid":"c2e40008-ad66-4712-8be8-e06fa7235fd2","name":"Uniwersytet Pomorski w Słupsku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934c878c28a0473a6bc3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de47","parentUuid":"c2e40008-ad66-4712-8be8-e06fa7235fd2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de47","rootUuid":"c2e40008-ad66-4712-8be8-e06fa7235fd2","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de67","uid":"bWBrnt-YEpFwbYpgNBHTwJw","uuid":"f52e68ce-dec2-43cf-a874-16b7005d6932","name":"Uniwersytet Morski w Gdyni","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094da878c28a0473c562b","5e709307878c28a0473a1615","5e709347878c28a0473a655d","5e709307878c28a0473a15f1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de67","parentUuid":"f52e68ce-dec2-43cf-a874-16b7005d6932","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de67","rootUuid":"f52e68ce-dec2-43cf-a874-16b7005d6932","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"art. no. 2843, s. 1-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a655d","5e7094da878c28a0473c562b","5e709307878c28a0473a15f1","5e709307878c28a0473a1615","5e70934c878c28a0473a6bc3","5e709489878c28a0473bf331"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water (Switzerland)","issn":"2073-4441","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f45dfe6a-c51f-4cba-a665-a984d2f35671"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["jeziora","wody wewnętrzne","reflektancja zdalna","współczynnik absorpcji","współczynnik reflektancji","materia zawieszona"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["suspended particulate matter","backscattering coefficient","inland waters","lakes","absorption coefficient","remote sensing reflectance","optically complex waters","bio-optical algorithm"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058950639"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64f5a7a540970725b30d9dac","name":"Jaclyn Clement","lastName":"Kinney","documentHash":"30985ded-7900-402c-bd59-53785cb9e2de"},{"objectId":"64f5a7a540970725b30d9dab","name":"Wieslaw","lastName":"Maslowski","documentHash":"67f93e12-d9f0-4348-8080-a6ed079c61dd"},{"objectId":"64f5a7a540970725b30d9daa","name":"Matthew","lastName":"Watts","documentHash":"d39de563-6f3a-441b-a14d-8ddfca871092"},{"objectId":"64f5a7a540970725b30d9da9","name":"Younjoo J.","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"92e03aa4-0fb4-45b1-8e48-94ef7686b89d"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6531","name":"Robert","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"2D5DB9D57FC7F36F61EC129D9952718B8EE760677732DD55A275E92756962D368291051F6920872AC1B25967C13152ED107489FCB8248776FDD5045A6623150F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8698-0799","documentHash":"5a7dc855-7273-4918-89fd-9450b6dfc8de"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-11","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64f5a7a540970725b30d9da7","doi":"10.1175/jcli-d-21-0539.1","publicUri":"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/36/17/JCLI-D-21-0539.1.xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Assessment of the Pan-Arctic Accelerated Rate of Sea Ice Decline in CMIP6 Historical Simulations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Arctic sea ice loss in response to a warming climate is assessed in 42 models participating in phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Sea ice observations show a significant acceleration in the rate of decline commencing near the turn of the twenty-first century. It is our assertion that state-of-the-art climate models should qualitatively reflect this accelerated trend within the limitations of internal variability and observational uncertainty. Our analysis shows that individual CMIP6 simulations of sea ice depict a wide range of model spread on biases and anomaly trends both across models and among their ensemble members. While the CMIP6 multimodel mean captures the observed sea ice area (SIA) decline relatively well, an individual model’s ability to represent the acceleration in sea ice decline remains a challenge. Seventeen (40%) out of 42 CMIP6 models and 37 (13%) out of the total 286 ensemble members reasonably capture the observed trends and acceleration in SIA decline. In addition, a larger ensemble size appears to increase the odds for a model to include at least one ensemble member skillfully representing the accelerated SIA trends. Simulations of sea ice volume (SIV) show much larger spread and uncertainty than SIA; however, due to limited availability of sea ice thickness data, these are not as well constrained by observations. Finally, we find that models with more ocean heat transport simulate larger sea ice declines, which suggests an emergent constraint in CMIP6 ensembles. This relationship points to the need for better understanding and modeling of ice–ocean interactions, especially with respect to frazil ice growth."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6531"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"36","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"6069-6089","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64f5a7a540970725b30d9da9","64f5a7a540970725b30d9daa","64f5a7a540970725b30d9dab","64f5a7a540970725b30d9dac","5e709347878c28a0473a6531"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547855f","mniswId":"10493","title":"JOURNAL OF CLIMATE","issn":"0894-8755","eissn":"1520-0442","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"5a1dc8b9-d645-4cd5-9179-278734125b78"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f5a7a540970725b30d9da8","year":"2023","volume":"36","number":"17","documentHash":"f881be8f-35ca-43f9-abec-15aba02addf4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic","Sea ice","Climate models","Model comparison","Ocean","Climate variability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058960829"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5efff22e7523404d1000eb0a","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Dybowski","uuid":"44456DCF7D40E94D0FCE26CF34A563C163D0D5A3505B9C65B35D18B0274C07EDB22D88A27478304A5BBAD40962598E80410A2F835A227AE3F94627A54AC4818D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6878-8250","documentHash":"59e8156c-f9d8-46c5-aa6f-948bebe96e8f"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Janecki","uuid":"0124EB42B550538B6EEEBE8AD570F2C5891BD81F4B2BE5A01771E72F4E699EC92BD4BBF74E613E973495B437D8B01EC430475EE98F9B81A06171565FE7E04415","orcidId":"0000-0002-8784-2862","documentHash":"c4d146e1-e71b-4582-b065-e8a216de65a8"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6519","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Dzierzbicka-Głowacka","uuid":"FDC01B0A03DACF40B86B8C76A6A5733A190D116F34DE41E026356499D64643AF86AFC24DF2A76B418A86F7BD2FBFE787F2EDEC5EF089D54B41C4018FFF1CD7CE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6151-2390","documentHash":"04fde4ef-26c2-4f72-87ad-b9283d779642"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-06-07","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64f99c1e40970774badf16d0","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2023.05.001","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0078323423000313?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The influence of biochemical parameters on primary production in the Gulf of Gdańsk region: A model study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Understanding the changing levels of biochemical parameters and the factors that influence them throughout the seasons is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of marine ecosystems.

Furthermore, we investigated how limiting factors impact primary phytoplankton production and demonstrated how the intensity of spring diatom blooms influences the nature of cyanobacterial blooms in the summer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5efff22e7523404d1000eb0a","5e709347878c28a0473a654f","5e709347878c28a0473a6519"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"65","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"517-533","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a654f","5efff22e7523404d1000eb0a","5e709347878c28a0473a6519"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f99b0b40970774badf0dbd","year":"2023","volume":"65","number":"4","documentHash":"cc7dfba5-2b78-451b-87ce-be4ff7a64cd7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Gulf of Gdańsk","Biochemical parameters","Primary production","Phytoplankton","Numerical modelling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058964525"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6509459b4097077d09732324","name":"Cátia Milene Ehlert","lastName":"von Ahn","documentHash":"76ed94f0-f694-44b2-8d37-07ac0a01fd7f"},{"objectId":"6509459b4097077d09732323","name":"Michael Ernst","lastName":"Böttcher","documentHash":"33dd0b36-a288-4596-ad42-71f04eaf13c4"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf377","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"85FD817EC7A87F03F838855336B25207286B8767235FEC849DD4568444510725B2225280529810C7754A21DDEE8BCA4353F3BD29A41F34EEFEA5967457C303A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9132-1990","documentHash":"311369bd-713f-4e50-ad69-8c04ac3dcea3"},{"objectId":"5e70945b878c28a0473bb3af","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Diak","uuid":"42031D146CCB43240D8580DD5CF2F0F79D6EAE47F399F25FDBFC2B8875035CC6E99B64640008C7C19A18DBF42F13AAA48C96CCE4EF3ECF4BB9A28D314A55EF65","orcidId":"0000-0002-7740-608X","documentHash":"fcdd195f-5b59-49a5-8e68-2222b6b17afe"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szymczycha","uuid":"F594DC6E0A245A248EACAF139383FF10C32DD82FE0DACFF05A102D4A7E645FB7586B6A7F34800C8363F445238D1E4A8D328549DE8D315F239B00D5F69B7F8C87","orcidId":"0000-0002-5815-215X","documentHash":"0a8a40d0-e3be-4cb4-9e67-7af031f250d1"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Winogradow","uuid":"D50057AD40012BE33D95DBDE17AFF8252F4D4C8BE533331AE47A267772A7AF1EA340927A58A08E00BF25C00BEE718EC87BAB202495DEBA6319C1787B88209CC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6214-9017","documentHash":"5ac9951c-6a34-42af-b699-05492c580241"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kuliński","uuid":"A1362FEB3C94D210BA97D7C5FE392ED27FB4DD61D0B2476A4F5C18B20F589C7FA21F35A13EA5510511C60D24A7EAD1FC4FDC75E86C1645B920BA2AE06C994826","orcidId":"0000-0002-5403-6629","documentHash":"8009c04f-1ba9-4687-80f3-d96316801246"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739941d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Koziorowska-Makuch","uuid":"3509723B3C9ACF6AC999AADF8F9DFFCBC59EBD1303980F82ED6C7F4BD7719E1581D1822C26EAABF3F62D27DEB38E556101B6169DCDBBF6E954F2721AB7FCCE40","orcidId":"0000-0002-9111-9597","documentHash":"f1a7632d-a947-4305-b1e3-6d63b76e893b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6509459b4097077d09732322","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2023.1218245","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2023.1218245/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The benthic-pelagic coupling affects the surface water carbonate system above groundwater-charged coastal sediments","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) can be a significant source of dissolved\nnutrients, inorganic and organic carbon, and trace metals in the ocean and\ntherefore can be a driver for the benthic-pelagic coupling. However, the\ninfluence of hypoxic or anoxic SGD on the carbonate system of coastal\nseawater is still poorly understood. In the present study, the production of\ndissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity (AT ) in coastal sediments has\nbeen investigated under the impact of oxygen-deficient SGD and was estimated\nbased on the offset between the measured data and the conservative mixing of\nthe end members. Production of A T and DIC was primarily caused by\ndenitrification and sulphate reduction. The AT and DIC concentrations in SGD\ndecreased by approximately 32% and 37% mainly due to mixing with seawater\ncounterbalanced by reoxidation and CO 2 release into the atmosphere. Total\nSGD-A T and SGD-DIC fluxes ranged from 0.1 to 0.2mol m -2 d -1 and from 0.2 to\n0.3mol m -2 d -1 , respectively. These fluxes are probably the reason why the\nseawater in the Bay of Puck is enriched in A T and DIC compared to the open\nwaters of the Baltic Sea. Additionally, SGD had low pH and was undersaturated\nwith respect to the forms of the aragonite and calcite minerals of CaCO 3 . The\nseawater of the Bay of Puck also turned out to be undersaturated in summer\n(Inner Bay) and fall (Outer Bay). We hypothesize that SGD can potentially\ncontribute to ocean acidification and affect the functioning of the\ncalcifying invertebrates."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

interactions\nbetween permafrost and groundwater. In its content, the paper focuses mainly on\ngroundwater recharge and discharge in the Arctic and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.\nThe study revealed that the geochemical composition of groundwater is site-\nspecific and varies significantly within the depth of the aquifers reflecting the\nwater-rock interactions and related geological history. All reviewed studies clearly\nindicated that the permafrost thaw causes an increase in groundwater discharge\non land. Furthermore, progressing climate warming is likely to accelerate\npermafrost degradation and thus enhance hydrological connectivity due to\nincreased subpermafrost groundwater flow through talik channels and higher\nsuprapermafrost groundwater flow. In the case of submarine groundwater\ndischarge (SGD), permafrost thaw can either reinforce or reduce SGD,\ndepending on how much pressure changes affecting the aquifers will be\ncaused by the loss of permafrost. Finally, this comprehensive assessment\nallowed also for identifying the lack of long-term and interdisciplinary in situ\nmeasurements that could be used in sophisticated computational simulations\ncharacterizing the current status and predicting groundwater flow and permafrost\ndynamics in the future warmer climate."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5e709347878c28a0473a6541","5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","5e709347878c28a0473a6546","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","5e70945b878c28a0473bb3af"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1254309","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70945b878c28a0473bb3af","6564986e409707538508c130","6564986e409707538508c131","6564986e409707538508c132","5e709347878c28a0473a6546","5e709347878c28a0473a6541","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","5e709347878c28a0473a654a","6564986e409707538508c133","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","6564986e409707538508c134","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d","5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1ad","mniswId":"6835","title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","issn":"2296-6463","eissn":"2296-6463","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"feafee17-dd8d-41eb-b9f4-ab129e7a61fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64e32fca4097073a3770a19c","year":"2023","volume":"11","documentHash":"249cc724-3c7c-4ab9-8a87-2f054c41a38e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["groundwater discharge","groundwater recharge","climate change","groundwater hydrochemistry","submarine groundwater discharge"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059028627"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739940b","name":"Kajetan","lastName":"Deja","uuid":"9D662B5DB9D9989CA2118EDEC7988EF7D4D3980D2C609A38B7C9587CFC9D6D5B787097E27010CA8550182A7210D7D7626DAA6E7FFF1C7E0FD28C9FB88D4072BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6707-3883","documentHash":"2fb48e59-8c28-4aaa-9364-256c74d01e4d"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399401","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dragańska-Deja","uuid":"F3EAA02DFAC467A0B6AA290F76F4855813CFB761111F487979FA81305FE2E9B5E73AD18BA23C0D869C46EA06D1D143048C3A13FED628746F8CCA55E63CB5B11A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5869-3167","documentHash":"da5e6d28-b24e-4231-a28b-eb6bceb7afd9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65670bbf40970767abd58b66","doi":"10.1007/s00300-023-03171-3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-023-03171-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"New strategies for the new environment in Spitsbergen fjords (Arctic).

In situ observations were made using a 16-h and 45 min time-lapse sequence showing the decompositions of Atlantic cod. During the exposure, apart from typical organisms such as carrion crustaceans, crabs, and starfish, three individuals of crinoids were observed. One of the crinoids was clinging to the edge of the platform for most of the exposure. The remaining two individuals were observed attached to the carapace of Hyas sp. crabs for 6 h 55 min. It was also found, based on analysis of the video material from 202 locations examined in the summer season between 2015 and 2020 using a drop camera, two additional locations showing comatulid crinoids. Both locations in the Ekmanfjorden and in the interior of the Vanmijenfjorden are areas under the strong influence of a glacier meltwater plum or a glacial river runoff. So far, comatulid crinoids have been found mainly in locations outside of the influence of turbid waters from fjords. We interpret this new behavior within comatulid crinoids as an adaptation that help colonize new regions gradually exposed by the retreating glaciers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a04739940b","5e70929e878c28a047399401","5e709347878c28a0473a6500"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"46","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1137-1143","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a04739940b","5e70929e878c28a047399401","5e709347878c28a0473a6500"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792ee","mniswId":"16268","title":"POLAR BIOLOGY","doi":"","issn":"0722-4060","eissn":"1432-2056","websiteLink":"https://link.springer.com/journal/300","documentHash":"4669e802-994d-4bda-8c0a-5226214ba6f5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65670bbf40970767abd58b67","year":"2023","volume":"46","number":"10","documentHash":"133cc33f-9004-4594-9b4d-bcbbb476941f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic","Spitsbergen","Fjords","Dispersal strategy","Unstalked Crinoidea","Heliometra"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059031490"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb59005b","name":"M.L.","lastName":"Druckenmiller","documentHash":"44f0a405-abd0-487b-997e-9684fc967eb3"},{"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb59005a","name":"W.","lastName":"Maslowski","documentHash":"1bed5965-e744-4a63-a657-0317d939e396"},{"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb590059","name":"A.L.","lastName":"Von Duyke","documentHash":"163015a3-8bef-4127-9518-1d238a7d4b7b"},{"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb590058","name":"L.","lastName":"Quakenbush","documentHash":"723e7de5-515f-4344-bfbb-9e09d578a224"},{"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb590057","name":"J.J.","lastName":"Citta","documentHash":"35f46e84-1853-4d5c-98a4-a2aee3ca3e8c"},{"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb590056","name":"S.","lastName":"Okkonen","documentHash":"a0246645-8d1b-472d-b533-8ebacfda8124"},{"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb590055","name":"J.","lastName":"Crawford","documentHash":"77507011-404a-460e-bf5c-95d965d49af6"},{"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb590054","name":"J.","lastName":"Olnes","documentHash":"3c136773-4cfa-4032-aede-26fc675ac237"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6531","name":"Robert","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"2D5DB9D57FC7F36F61EC129D9952718B8EE760677732DD55A275E92756962D368291051F6920872AC1B25967C13152ED107489FCB8248776FDD5045A6623150F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8698-0799","documentHash":"5a7dc855-7273-4918-89fd-9450b6dfc8de"}],"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb590052","doi":"10.1016/j.csr.2023.105136","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0278434323002133?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Oceanographic influences on spotted seal foraging in the Pacific Arctic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Satellite Relay Data Loggers that are equipped with Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth sensors (CTD-SRDLs) are an important tool for identifying how oceanography influences an animal's foraging behavior and how foraging may be affected by environmental change. Spotted seals (Phoca largha) are one of four species of sea ice-associated seals that occur in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas of the Pacific Arctic. Between 2016 and 2020, 23 spotted seals were equipped with CTD-SRDLs, which collected temperature and salinity profiles as the seals dove through the water column. We first examined the oceanographic characteristics along seal tracks using data from the CTD-SRDLs, and then modeled seal behavioral state (resident or transiting) as a function of sea ice and oceanographic conditions extracted from the inferred oceanographic space. We then related these findings to habitat associated with the predominant fish prey species identified from seal stomach contents, which included Arctic cod, saffron cod, Pacific herring, rainbow smelt, and capelin. Spotted seals mostly dove to near-bottom depths, including frequent dives to the sea floor. During the ice-free season in the Chukchi Sea, pups were mostly likely to be in the resident state (i.e., possible foraging) when near-bottom conditions were colder and less saline. Seals were also more likely to be in the resident state when far offshore and in areas with colder bottom temperatures. Behavior related to possible offshore foraging was more associated with non-pup seals and possible nearshore foraging was more associated with pups. During the ice-covered season, seals were more likely to be in the resident state when bottom temperatures were colder, and this relationship was stronger for non-pups than for pups and for females than for males. Our use of satellite telemetry, oceanographic modeling, and biological sampling support the understanding that spotted seals are generalists in both prey species and foraging habitat."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6531"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"269","pagesFromTo":"105136","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["655c9d0c4097071dcb590054","655c9d0c4097071dcb590055","655c9d0c4097071dcb590056","655c9d0c4097071dcb590057","655c9d0c4097071dcb590058","655c9d0c4097071dcb590059","655c9d0c4097071dcb59005a","5e709347878c28a0473a6531","655c9d0c4097071dcb59005b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777e6","mniswId":"4393","title":"Continental Shelf Research","issn":"0278-4343","eissn":"1873-6955","documentHash":"c5cb66a0-77b1-451d-ad35-f73cc6785807"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655c9d0c4097071dcb590053","year":"2023","volume":"269","documentHash":"3eea4983-e749-4bd8-9cf7-c006ad2fefc1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059032093"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656709bd40970767abd53ffb","name":"Kit M.","lastName":"Kovacs","documentHash":"2122cfa3-4a4f-4cc0-bb33-458122d6ca9d"},{"objectId":"656709bd40970767abd53ffa","name":"Guttorm","lastName":"Christensen","documentHash":"ec430c0d-d023-4695-8b33-b2a36699cbac"},{"objectId":"656709bd40970767abd53ff9","name":"Christian","lastName":"Lydersen","documentHash":"cedc39c3-c5bf-4776-826e-4de3120316c2"},{"objectId":"656709bd40970767abd53ff8","name":"Olof","lastName":"Bengtsson","documentHash":"66e85486-0124-488c-91d5-531bcc8cfcee"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"656709bd40970767abd53ff6","doi":"10.1007/s00300-023-03196-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-023-03196-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Marine diets of anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) in Svalbard, Norway","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During summer, native anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) and the alien species pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) now coexist in marine environments in Svalbard, following the introduction of the latter in the Barents Region. To investigate potential dietary competition between these two salmonid species, stomach contents from Arctic char (n = 301) and pink salmon (n = 28) were sampled from different areas within the archipelago. The most important prey in terms of biomass for both salmonid species were amphipods; Themisto libellula (B = 26.0%) for Arctic char and Onisimus litoralis\n(B = 35.0%) for pink salmon. Pianka’s niche overlap revealed that dietary overlap between the two species was moderately\nhigh (Oobs = 0.59); both species had strong associations with intertidal invertebrates in areas where direct comparisons were possible (Kongsfjorden/Krossfjorden). However, both salmonid species did also eat some fish, with Arctic char consuming more offshore pelagic fish, while the small number of fish eaten by pink salmon were primarily coastal demersal fish species. Arctic char was a more generalist feeder, while pink salmon was more of a dietary specialist. Furthermore, the diet composition of the Arctic char consisted of 32.9% Atlantic prey while the pink salmon, surprisingly, ate only Arctic species, likely due to their tightly coastal feeding habits. Even though the sample size for pink salmon was low, this study contributes new insights into salmonid diets in Svalbard and the potential for introduced species to compete with native Arctic endemics, particularly in the expected warmer Arctic of the

In this study, an oligonucleotide microarray was applied to identify transcriptional changes in the skin of rainbow trout individuals in response to a bacterial infection. Overall, 656 and 434 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 2 and 6 days after a bacterial challenge (dpi), respectively. A comparison of moribund (2 dpi) and survivor fish (6 dpi) revealed 169 DEGs. Between these were many genes involved in immune response, including lysozymes, pattern recognition receptors (c-type lectins), antimicrobial peptides (cathelicidin and hepcidin), acute-phase proteins (serum amyloids and haptoglobin), complement cascade proteins (c3, c4, c6 and c7), interleukins (il11 and il1b) and chemokines (ccl19 and cxcl8). Alterations of leptin, eicosanoids and prostaglandins have been found, which suggest metabolic remodeling in conjunction with immune response. Further, the regulation of programmed cell death genes (caspase 8, bcl2 apoptosis regulator, nfkb inhibitor alpha and heme oxygenase) and structural proteins (collagens, myosins, keratins and metalloproteinases) was observed. This study provides, for the first time, a gene expression analysis of rainbow trout skin in response to A. salmonicida infection, revealing the complexity of defense strategies in response to furunculosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709306878c28a0473a15be","5e709347878c28a0473a6509"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"12793","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709306878c28a0473a15be","656d995f40970718551a2bbe","656d995f40970718551a2bbf","5e709347878c28a0473a6509"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8a20a31f-8131-4357-899d-7b8f694df717"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["microarray","rainbow trout","Aeromonas salmonicida","furunculosis","infection","skin"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059068326"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656f154340970720e1ff03e3","name":"Rozalia","lastName":"Motoc","documentHash":"fa9961fe-4722-4bf6-8483-09aea4940cb2"},{"objectId":"656f154340970720e1ff03e2","name":"Alin","lastName":"Enache","documentHash":"2737ccf4-faba-42e0-a774-415e942f86d1"},{"objectId":"656f154340970720e1ff03e1","name":"Maria","lastName":"Holzmann","documentHash":"6f7f4441-6143-4391-88a6-fc10298e4ccf"},{"objectId":"656f154340970720e1ff03e0","name":"Sylvain","lastName":"Kreuter","documentHash":"f6e66a63-e320-421d-b287-a3b459e8ba6c"},{"objectId":"656f154340970720e1ff03df","name":"Ana Bianca","lastName":"Pavel","documentHash":"65c50c72-caa0-4afa-a4c5-42e4165b575f"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"656f154340970720e1ff03dd","doi":"10.3390/jmse11081546","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/11/8/1546/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Psammophaga secriensia sp. nov., a New Monothalamid Foraminifera (Protista, Rhizaria) from the Romanian Black Sea Shelf","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Based on molecular and morphological characters, we describe a new species of monothalamous foraminifera, Psammophaga secriensia sp. nov., that was sampled from two coastal locations (48 m and 53 m depth) on the Romanian Black Sea continental shelf.

The first sequences for the monothalamid genus Storthosphaera were obtained, while specimens assigned to Gloiogullmia, Hippocrepinella and Vanhoeffenella yielded new sequences. Among multichambered taxa, high-throughput Illumina sequencing (HTS) revealed a second haplotype of the calcareous rotaliid Oridorsalis umbonatus, possibly representing a distinct species. Additional HTS sequences were obtained from the rotaliids Nuttallides umbonifer and Globocassidulina subglobosa, confirming their wide distributions. We also obtained the first sequences for Cribrostomoides subglobosa, showing that it branches separately from other members of this genus. The fact that many sequences did not correspond to known morphospecies reflects the scarcity of reference barcodes for deep-sea Foraminifera, particularly the poorly known but highly diverse monothalamids. We recommend using HTS of single specimens to reveal further unknown species. Despite extensive research, much remains to be learnt about the true scale of foraminiferal biodiversity in the CCZ."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"2038","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656f182b40970720e1ff2609","656f182b40970720e1ff260a","656f182b40970720e1ff260b","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","656f182b40970720e1ff260c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c925","mniswId":"11734","title":"Journal of Marine Science and Engineering","doi":"10.3390/jmse","issn":"2077-1312","eissn":"2077-1312","documentHash":"edcb89a0-e925-4fa7-bd52-7548b4265d6d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656f182b40970720e1ff2608","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"11","documentHash":"0269ff53-6758-49a9-b4a5-81c0ee702d8f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["benthic foraminifera","monothalamids","biodiversity","single-cell barcoding","Clarion-Clipperton Zone","seabed mining"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059076023"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea74","name":"Thilina","lastName":"Munasinghe","documentHash":"82067f49-add1-4a0c-b781-f148aea58dc5"},{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea73","name":"Zijie","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"4e30713e-c3ed-43fd-887a-686f4d2ea192"},{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea72","name":"Gayan","lastName":"Bandara","documentHash":"d9e4d715-6720-4f70-917f-a35e821e13bc"},{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea71","name":"Vidusanka","lastName":"Thilakanayaka","documentHash":"651c5194-73ee-4033-9982-9ec9d5a59d22"},{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea70","name":"Rong","lastName":"Xiang","documentHash":"dc41b142-68a5-47d7-b071-b48283831e11"},{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea6f","name":"Shuhuan","lastName":"Du","documentHash":"df469b40-50e0-4b52-b5d3-2509c68d833f"},{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea6e","name":"Chixin","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"db733a63-016f-4911-a256-814105f1c79b"},{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea6d","name":"Chuanxiu","lastName":"Luo","documentHash":"da59b917-fa40-41b9-bf2f-0149ca8a87a7"},{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea6c","name":"Dileep B.","lastName":"Herath","documentHash":"42f7f547-a5fe-455e-9319-b47f7c711538"},{"objectId":"60c2fe8e9543c7233654386e","name":"Dhanushka","lastName":"Devendra","uuid":"6F6E3F168F5DFCF506BF0BD3B40129E25B30582F6FC8FD5D0E364892119698ECD0FE99F397217724802AFFC7AA22638E1413B2D39CE2BB6EE62AEBC43953452A","documentHash":"561e8e72-cf7d-445e-95f3-ee490e44ec4f"}],"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea6a","doi":"10.1016/j.marmicro.2023.102210","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0377839823000099?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"High-resolution palynology signals in surface sediments of coastal Hainan Island of China","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Studies on pollen in marine surface sediments are important for understanding the distribution mechanisms of pollen and spores into the ocean, and they are also useful in micro-paleontological studies. In this study, high-resolution palynological analysis of marine surface sediment samples from the south and southeastern inner-shelf regions of Hainan Island was performed to understand the distribution mechanism of marine surface pollen and its relationship with terrestrial vegetation. The results indicated that fern spores are the most common type, followed by tree pollen and herbaceous pollen. A majority of total pollen and spore concentrations are dominated by fern spores because the sample sites are highly concentrated with Microlepia and Polypodiaceae spores, mainly due to anthropogenic activities. The variation in tree pollen concentrations (especially for Pinus, Quercus, and Castanopsis) suggested that these pollen grains were transported mainly by wind patterns and rivers from Hainan Island. The pollen concentrations and percentage analysis in the study area showed that the inner-shelf sites have higher values than far offshore sites, reflecting a relationship between modern pollen distribution patterns and nearby landmass vegetation. Based on the principal component analysis of the resulting pollen and spore percentages, there are two main factors affecting the pollen distribution around the study area: possible human activities that have modified Hainan Island and wind–river transport toward the study area. This is the first study to discover that the presence of fern spores across the shelf is unusual, implying widespread lateral mixing in the south and southeastern Hainan Island inner-shelf region."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fe8e9543c7233654386e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"179","pagesFromTo":"102210","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656f227a40970720e1ffea6c","656f227a40970720e1ffea6d","656f227a40970720e1ffea6e","656f227a40970720e1ffea6f","656f227a40970720e1ffea70","656f227a40970720e1ffea71","656f227a40970720e1ffea72","60c2fe8e9543c7233654386e","656f227a40970720e1ffea73","656f227a40970720e1ffea74"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d71","mniswId":"13921","title":"Marine Micropaleontology","issn":"0377-8398","documentHash":"aa32512a-1300-4ee0-b0f8-60e231353023"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656f227a40970720e1ffea6b","year":"2023","volume":"179","documentHash":"d2a0e0de-c464-457a-b8b2-bd0a6add516d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059078778"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfb6","name":"Patrizia","lastName":"Ziveri","documentHash":"239059c7-0650-4a3c-92b7-c3bc2d46e3e8"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfb5","name":"Makoto","lastName":"Yamasaki","documentHash":"0b64da47-09d7-4d2f-9e6d-39b39e1ebf40"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfb4","name":"Igor","lastName":"Venancio","documentHash":"79ea10ee-dda2-465c-8b90-b79b8f62a71f"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfb3","name":"Adi","lastName":"Torfstein","documentHash":"32a35085-7e59-4887-8861-1f67462ecdea"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfb2","name":"Kunio T.","lastName":"Takahashi","documentHash":"9396c0e8-1c32-46d2-b524-10e4609847b2"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfb1","name":"Francisco","lastName":"Sierro","documentHash":"0d47b8af-8185-4f74-8478-61df2a7b0273"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfb0","name":"Takuya","lastName":"Sagawa","documentHash":"7d688aa8-90f1-4e8f-be45-0766a96e3f12"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfaf","name":"Karen","lastName":"Robinson","documentHash":"bb10f33d-e8cf-4bc7-abd5-0a5fd9ff787f"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfae","name":"Marina C.","lastName":"Rillo","documentHash":"8187e4d5-9b2c-47a2-a28f-981c1a4ac8ab"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfad","name":"Andres","lastName":"Rigual-Hernandez","documentHash":"f4e1eeed-0d91-4f51-8ff1-ed89b1c65b65"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfac","name":"Alexandra","lastName":"Post","documentHash":"67e5dbd7-4bd3-44e6-9896-898f16ff8d56"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfab","name":"Joseph D.","lastName":"Ortiz","documentHash":"3f19ed19-fa83-43f9-8441-86b2dffaafa1"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfaa","name":"Siri","lastName":"Ofstad","documentHash":"aa19be25-988d-435d-85e9-21eec3546b42"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfa9","name":"Margarita","lastName":"Marchant","documentHash":"190372c4-381a-48d6-a841-d20bd1a6a112"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfa8","name":"Clara","lastName":"Manno","documentHash":"e2ea8f58-5df0-401d-9a6a-ad119bffb91b"},{"objectId":"656f214840970720e1ffdfa7","name":"Douglas V.

Their distribution and diversity are affected by different environmental factors including anthropogenically forced ocean and climate change. Until now, historical changes in their distribution have not been fully assessed at the global scale. Here we present the FORCIS (Foraminifera Response to Climatic Stress) database on foraminiferal species diversity and distribution in the global ocean from 1910 until 2018 including published and unpublished data. The FORCIS database includes data collected using plankton tows, continuous plankton recorder, sediment traps and plankton pump, and contains ~22,000, ~157,000, ~9,000, ~400 subsamples, respectively (one single plankton aliquot collected within a depth range, time interval, size fraction range, at a single location) from each category. Our database provides a perspective of the distribution patterns of planktonic Foraminifera in the global ocean on large spatial (regional to basin scale, and at the vertical scale), and temporal (seasonal to interdecadal) scales over the past century."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["615bb8a875234017e04eda8d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656f214840970720e1ffdf88","656f214840970720e1ffdf89","656f214840970720e1ffdf8a","656f214840970720e1ffdf8b","656f214840970720e1ffdf8c","656f214840970720e1ffdf8d","656f214840970720e1ffdf8e","615bb8a875234017e04eda8d","656f214840970720e1ffdf90","656f214840970720e1ffdf91","656f214840970720e1ffdf92","656f214840970720e1ffdf93","656f214840970720e1ffdf94","656f214840970720e1ffdf95","656f214840970720e1ffdf96","656f214840970720e1ffdf97","656f214840970720e1ffdf98","656f214840970720e1ffdf99","656f214840970720e1ffdf9a","656f214840970720e1ffdf9b","656f214840970720e1ffdf9c","656f214840970720e1ffdf9d","656f214840970720e1ffdf9e","656f214840970720e1ffdf9f","656f214840970720e1ffdfa0","656f214840970720e1ffdfa1","656f214840970720e1ffdfa2","656f214840970720e1ffdfa3","656f214840970720e1ffdfa4","656f214840970720e1ffdfa5","656f214840970720e1ffdfa6","656f214840970720e1ffdfa7","656f214840970720e1ffdfa8","656f214840970720e1ffdfa9","656f214840970720e1ffdfaa","656f214840970720e1ffdfab","656f214840970720e1ffdfac","656f214840970720e1ffdfad","656f214840970720e1ffdfae","656f214840970720e1ffdfaf","656f214840970720e1ffdfb0","656f214840970720e1ffdfb1","656f214840970720e1ffdfb2","656f214840970720e1ffdfb3","656f214840970720e1ffdfb4","656f214840970720e1ffdfb5","656f214840970720e1ffdfb6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d2c1","mniswId":"18267","title":"Scientific Data","issn":"2052-4463","eissn":"2052-4463","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d8a60e3b-a63b-4267-9804-7df82e819a66"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b546264097076e4793b177","year":"2023","volume":"10","number":"1","documentHash":"325ab5ce-561b-4632-8f82-ffa55a8d6d1a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biodiversity","Climate change"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059079444"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac216","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":"4BA4B1D5A7E61EED979F25C39972B025679B97E0AF7F4F4CF8AE30F4FF80B1E5A655A84A88DF2D9DF0FE5316C297FD0FD1DF39EFFF12AF04D5040D7D11740376","orcidId":"0000-0003-4867-7240","documentHash":"1740d700-5a59-41a9-b9b6-bad844bfbf39"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6549","name":"Ludwik","lastName":"Lubecki","uuid":"7F5F8ADDE4002A9EED392608D7530488D094B4606967FBF9A8CCD534F09AD0518FABD880F12868297A92239D26C5CF35BB6EE01C26B019A554FAD0153A6B2537","orcidId":"0000-0001-7661-6539","documentHash":"591baa3c-fab4-4790-9c9e-d98d2eda1291"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6543","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Szymczak-Żyła","uuid":"F9D47FAA6EF2BE16FA942D8AD3526A0F7CFCF9AA95A8769FD985E69DBD9ADBB72CBD2A4384FFB8FD0AE1CDF4C3A1296A8E9AB8D21BC9BB4BF6BBEA910CB44F28","orcidId":"0000-0003-2294-3870","documentHash":"accbe7cb-5a2a-4233-a75b-f67a90ade011"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-06-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"654cca3d40970739eeeaf27b","doi":"10.1016/j.csr.2023.105053","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0278434323001309?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Sources of sedimentary organic matter in Arctic fjords: Evidence from lipid molecular markers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The identification of the origin of organic matter in Arctic fjord systems is especially challenging due to complex and highly variable environmental settings, which are impacted by ongoing rapid climate changes. In this study we use a multiproxy approach based on various lipid biomarkers to investigate the provenance of organic matter deposited in surface sediments in the four high-Arctic fjords located in the western part of Spitsbergen (Hornsund, Adventfjorden, Kongsfjorden, and Raudfjorden). This work focuses on the analyses of several classes of lipid biomarkers such as n-alkanes, saturated cyclic hydrocarbons (hopanes, steranes), highly branched isoprenoid (IP25 – ice proxy), alkenones and polar steroids, including sterols and stanols. The findings of this research indicate the occurrence of sedimentary organic matter derived from multiple marine and land-based sources in the studied fjords. The analysis of biomarkers reveals pronounced differences between fjords located in southern and northern parts of western Spitsbergen with regard to contributions of sedimentary organic matter derived from biogenic sources (phytoplankton, animal-derived material as well as terrestrial vascular plants), relative abundances of specific phytoplankton genera (diatoms vs. dinoflagellates), and intensity of bio-advection (Emiliania huxleyi) related to inflows of warm Atlantic Water. The uncommon n-alkane profiles, especially in the short-chain range, reported for investigated sediments are likely to reflect probable contributions related to ancient organic matter and/or microbial sources/activities. To our knowledge, this is the first such comprehensive research on the origin of organic matter deposited in surface sediments from the western Spitsbergen fjords, based on lipid molecular biomarkers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac216","5e709347878c28a0473a6543","5e709347878c28a0473a6549"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"264","pagesFromTo":"105053","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac216","5e709347878c28a0473a6549","5e709347878c28a0473a6543"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777e6","mniswId":"4393","title":"Continental Shelf Research","issn":"0278-4343","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"75ab7b08-e6eb-4397-86ad-544a8e0c0feb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"654cca3d40970739eeeaf27c","year":"2023","volume":"264","documentHash":"ffb7fb85-8d54-4272-bd52-7396250e6367"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic","Svalbard fjords","Lipid biomarkers","Sediments","Organic matter","Alkanes","Hopanes","Sterols","Alkenones","IP25"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059085682"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c35107","name":"Chiara","lastName":"Lombardi","documentHash":"0645e10a-d63e-4994-b203-7c39006e8a82"},{"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c35106","name":"Giancarlo","lastName":"Raiteri","documentHash":"898355bd-0389-4113-9439-0ea50b567d0a"},{"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c35105","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Mazzoli","documentHash":"179e54c0-3544-4c9d-91df-f5126d6fcc8f"},{"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c35104","name":"Katrin","lastName":"Hurle","documentHash":"6da0845c-f8a9-4b8a-9a5a-1d48c6a753f2"},{"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c35103","name":"Felix B.","lastName":"Engel","documentHash":"2ae772b1-fb21-4a80-805b-ab2ae89f7fac"},{"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c35102","name":"Salvador","lastName":"Cazorla Vázquez","documentHash":"54df5712-6b85-47f6-8a3d-ad3e800bbc75"},{"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c35101","name":"Federica","lastName":"Ragazzola","documentHash":"23508862-922a-46ab-ac3d-670f601b809f"},{"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c35100","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Teichert","documentHash":"2348b535-6a87-4d28-a405-67771e154659"},{"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c350ff","name":"Matthias","lastName":"López Correa","documentHash":"82c7734c-3e23-400c-8374-349f86a0379c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6571c0d040970741e5c350fe","doi":"10.3390/min13020215","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/2/215/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Structural and Geochemical Assessment of the Coralline Alga Tethysphytum antarcticum from Terra Nova Bay, Ross Sea, Antarctica","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Crustose coralline algae (CCA) occur from the tropics to the poles in photic benthic environments. Here, we report on some of the world’s southernmost and coldest CCA sites in Terra Nova, Ross Sea, Antarctica at 74°41′ S. The recently described red alga Tethysphytum antarticum is investigated for its skeletal architecture, its mineralogical and geochemical composition, as well as for its taxonomic classification. A phylogenetic analysis based on molecular genetics and the sequencing of the photosystem II protein D1 (psbA) gave a perfect match with T. antarcticum. Histological sections and micro-CT-scans provide new diagnostic details for the conceptacles (the reproductive organs of the alga). X-ray diffractometry and electron-microprobe measurements yielded a clear high-Mg calcite (~8 mol%) composition of the skeletal parts. Detailed back-scattered electron imaging of polished petrographic thin sections revealed a two-layered thallus (vegetative plant tissue), comprising an organic-rich irregularly calcified basal layer with rectangular cells, overlain by the main thallus. Elemental maps show relatively increased sulphur in the basal layer, clearly tied to organic cell walls. MgCO3 and SrCO3 were targeted with semiquantitative elemental mappings and in an ontogenetic quantitative spot transect. Compared with temperature (−1.95 °C to +1.08 °C), the MgCO3 (mol%) reflects this world’s coldest CCA site temperature with the lowest MgCO3 content of 7.9 ± 1.6 mol%. The along transect variability, however, shows with ~6 mol% a larger MgCO3 variability than expected for the 3 °C intra-annual temperature amplitude in Terra Nova Bay. This implies that in low amplitude settings the biomineralisation control on Mg/Ca ratios can outcompete its temperature sensitivity. Mark-recapture studies, next to the environmental logger station La Zecca are suggested, to perform a detailed growth rate and biomineralisation quantification."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"215","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6571c0d040970741e5c350ff","6571c0d040970741e5c35100","6571c0d040970741e5c35101","6571c0d040970741e5c35102","6571c0d040970741e5c35103","6571c0d040970741e5c35104","6571c0d040970741e5c35105","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","6571c0d040970741e5c35106","6571c0d040970741e5c35107"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ea0","mniswId":"14412","title":"Minerals","issn":"2075-163X","eissn":"2075-163X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2af82f59-2491-4ec3-9a2c-01d952e85824"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6406d9db4097073534984789","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"2","documentHash":"53c9d040-683f-4dd2-bba6-4661ee180bbb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crustose coralline algae","Antarctica","taxonomy","phylogeny","thallus structure","biomineralization","geochemistry","climate change"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059088385"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6571b50b40970741e5c0ddeb","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Schwaha","documentHash":"18b51b31-d782-4e16-bbfc-c8ae21841a1f"},{"objectId":"6571b50b40970741e5c0ddea","name":"Abigail M.","lastName":"Smith","documentHash":"4d6656f2-253f-4260-b30d-5567d25cf2c2"},{"objectId":"6571b50b40970741e5c0dde9","name":"Hamish G.","lastName":"Spencer","documentHash":"4223d088-a74d-401f-8be8-cc52ead1dd64"},{"objectId":"6571b50b40970741e5c0dde8","name":"Sarah","lastName":"Lemer","documentHash":"5d913769-a421-44c2-ae54-9966c442bdeb"},{"objectId":"6571b50b40970741e5c0dde7","name":"Masato","lastName":"Hirose","documentHash":"b9a977a0-c72b-43e4-a8d6-e6c10ece4e76"},{"objectId":"6571b50b40970741e5c0dde6","name":"Sebastian H.","lastName":"Decker","documentHash":"e96ef4ef-d0f1-42e3-829b-e0417230b5c7"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6571b50b40970741e5c0dde5","doi":"10.1007/s13127-023-00612-z","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13127-023-00612-z.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Boring bryozoans: an investigation into the endolithic bryozoan family Penetrantiidae","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An endolithic lifestyle in mineralized substrates has evolved multiple times in various phyla including Bryozoa. The family\nPenetrantiidae includes one genus with ten extant and two fossil species. They predominantly colonize the shells of molluscs and establish colonies by chemical dissolution of calcium carbonate. Based on several morphological characters, they were described to be either cheilostome or ctenostome bryozoans. For more than 40 years, neither the characters of species identity and systematics nor the problem of their phylogeny was approached. Consequently, the aim of this study is to reevaluate species identities and the systematic position of the genus Penetrantia by analyzing at least six different species from eight regions with the aid of modern methods such as confocal laser scanning microscopy and 3D-reconstruction techniques. This study demonstrates that the musculature associated with the operculum and brood chamber shows significant differences from the cheilostome counterparts and seems to have evolved independently. Together with the presence of other ctenostome-like features such as true polymorphic stolons and uncalcified body wall, this finding supports a ctenostome affinity. Operculum morphology reveals many new species-specific characters, which, together with information about gonozooid morphology, tentacle number, and zooid size ranges, will enhance species identification.

Fresh, sediment-rich sub-glacial meltwater is discharged at the glacier grounding line, where it mixes with deep marine water resulting in an upwelling of a plume visible in front of the glacial wall. Zooplankton may suffer increased mortality within the plume due to osmotic shock when brought in contact with the rising meltwater. The constant replenishment of zooplankton and juvenile fish to the surface areas attracts surface-foraging seabirds. Because access to other feeding areas, such as the marginal ice zone, has become energetically costly due to reduced sea-ice extent, glacial plumes may become increasingly important as “climate refugia” providing enhanced prey availability. Here, we investigated zooplankton concentrations within the plume and adjacent waters of four tidewater glaciers in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, in early August 2016 and late July 2017. Our aim was to compare the zooplankton composition, abundance, and isotopic signatures within the plumes to those in adjacent fjord and shelf waters. Our hypothesis was that the plumes resulted in increased zooplankton mortality through osmotic shock and increased prey availability to predators. The mortality due to osmotic shock in the glacial plume was low (<5% dead organisms in samples), although slightly higher than in surrounding waters. This indicates that plumes are inefficient “death traps” for zooplankton. However, the high abundance and biomass of zooplankton within plume areas suggest that the “elevator effect” of rising glacial water supplies zooplankton to the sea surface, thereby enhancing prey availability for surface-feeding seabirds. Thus, our study provides evidence that glacial plumes are important as “climate refugia” for foraging seabirds. Stable isotope signatures showed that the glacial bay zooplankton and fish community represent a distinct isotopic niche. Additionally, zooplankton mortality associated with the plume estimated over 100-days of melt season supports a flux of 12.8 tonnes of organic carbon to benthic communities in the glacial bays. Benthic scavengers, such as Onisimus caricus and Anonyx nugax, were abundant in the glacial bay, where they feed on sinking organic matter."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e70940f878c28a0473b5907"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1161912","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6571b93340970741e5c11799","6571b93340970741e5c1179a","6571b93340970741e5c1179b","6571b93340970741e5c1179c","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","6571b93340970741e5c1179d","6571b93340970741e5c1179e","6571b93340970741e5c1179f","6571b93340970741e5c117a0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64c8bc834097073b97da6771","year":"2023","volume":"10","documentHash":"4cc4d5d3-b807-4bda-a423-3b3a1ee95f9a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["zooplankton","death trap","meltwater","tidewater glaciers","Kongsfjorden","Arctic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059088897"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656d97db40970718551a05d5","name":"Aleksei","lastName":"Krasnov","documentHash":"6e3d017c-9b9b-4be3-a227-487c3cfc527d"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6509","name":"Roman","lastName":"Wenne","uuid":"6B27626EE351F0B058A10F6D9998813E0246BF28019928840556C2DAD560443A19522E4725AEC8C4370B440DB05C8836A28167755ADA23BCC0BB4E0F56749387","orcidId":"0000-0001-6994-1181","documentHash":"258fed81-bcb5-46d4-b296-92de5d2e1d1a"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a15be","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Małachowicz","uuid":"31D5CC10067CD8B4D56D2FEC60E8C2491A2AB02ACFF06104C164B34E8B4838EC2AD4ABCFC0EE274A2C3B3ED7549362D07A90D45D6A42A7247FF2A3698D3F4FD8","orcidId":"0000-0002-3088-9619","documentHash":"3d01a73c-080e-406d-978e-d880b90d6a68"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"656d97db40970718551a05d4","doi":"10.3390/cells12232760","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/12/23/2760/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Diverse Transcriptome Responses to Salinity Change in Atlantic Cod Subpopulations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Adaptation to environmental variation caused by global climate change is a significant aspect of fisheries management and ecology. A reduction in ocean salinity is visible in near-shore areas, especially in the Baltic Sea, where it is affecting the Atlantic cod population. Cod is one of the most significant teleost species, with high ecological and economical value worldwide. The population of cod in the Baltic Sea has been traditionally divided into two subpopulations (western and eastern) existing in higher- and lower-salinity waters, respectively. In recent decades, both Baltic cod subpopulations have declined massively. One of the reasons for the poor condition of cod in the Baltic Sea is environmental factors, including salinity. Thus, in this study, an oligonucleotide microarray was applied to explore differences between Baltic cod subpopulations in response to salinity fluctuations. For this purpose, an exposure experiment was conducted consisting of salinity elevation and reduction, and gene expression was measured in gill tissue. We found 400 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the immune response, metabolism, programmed cell death, cytoskeleton, and extracellular matrix that showed a subpopulation-dependent pattern. These findings indicate that osmoregulation in Baltic cod is a complex process, and that western and eastern Baltic cod subpopulations respond differently to salinity changes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709306878c28a0473a15be","5e709347878c28a0473a6509"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"2760","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709306878c28a0473a15be","656d97db40970718551a05d5","5e709347878c28a0473a6509"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bca9","mniswId":"3385","title":"Cells","issn":"2073-4409","eissn":"2073-4409","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3f0f9fd0-584c-4a82-9bc2-3080deec3a36"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656099da4097073c06983c9b","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"23","documentHash":"9b2f1593-7135-463e-bd2c-c92b1b65e4e8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Gadus morhua","osmoregulation","gene expression","microarray","gill tissue"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059147102"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656d9aec40970718551a54f4","name":"Cristián","lastName":"Araneda","documentHash":"e3670f22-0eb6-4309-89ff-6242eb356b1d"},{"objectId":"656d9aec40970718551a54f3","name":"María Angélica","lastName":"Larraín","documentHash":"506db7ad-c1c0-4b0b-821c-6f9f0c57f950"},{"objectId":"656d9aec40970718551a54f2","name":"Felipe","lastName":"Jilberto","documentHash":"99a6aef2-8c66-4904-bba7-61403db8d6b6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6562","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zbawicka","uuid":"C666D80AAC8D5BA5D12E1984EB7EC27BCB09A2EC676A3578D85F558B3723D8FDDCBCBDD92633678834C40C72F59AA9D924C894649D751A5551B7A7521D23E0D0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5156-6184","documentHash":"7ee294a1-069f-4943-8e4c-2b395e31af83"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6509","name":"Roman","lastName":"Wenne","uuid":"6B27626EE351F0B058A10F6D9998813E0246BF28019928840556C2DAD560443A19522E4725AEC8C4370B440DB05C8836A28167755ADA23BCC0BB4E0F56749387","orcidId":"0000-0001-6994-1181","documentHash":"258fed81-bcb5-46d4-b296-92de5d2e1d1a"}],"objectId":"656d9aec40970718551a54f0","doi":"10.1111/mec.17211","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/mec.17211","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"SNP genotyping revealed a hybrid zone between Mytilus chilensis and M. platensis in southern South America (the Strait of Magellan, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hybrid  zones  among  mussel  species  have  been  extensively  studied  in  the  northern  hemisphere.

The widespread stability in stage-specific sex ratio and its subtle changes, especially in the interannual context, show that marine Ostracoda has the potential to be a model organism for more comprehensive sex ratio research, but deeper investigation into their ecology and reproduction is necessary."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["618353b97523400564d8208b","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"763-776","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["618353b97523400564d8208b","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789b8","mniswId":"12311","title":"Journal of Plankton Research","issn":"0142-7873","eissn":"1464-3774","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0f1b90cd-02ae-4beb-803e-4e60835547b6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658049714097073e4d224476","year":"2023","volume":"45","number":"5","documentHash":"6c2ec65b-163d-40d2-8354-d52c1f1626b6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059147382"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656f172a40970720e1ff1dfd","name":"G.J.","lastName":"Reichart","documentHash":"fb58b273-9fab-4ae2-b019-1430d49f6654"},{"objectId":"656f172a40970720e1ff1dfc","name":"D.","lastName":"Dissard","documentHash":"774407a5-ce1d-4c91-a4c7-abd0d56887d4"},{"objectId":"656f172a40970720e1ff1dfb","name":"Y.","lastName":"Rosenthal","documentHash":"5cb26f0b-29c5-4214-ab48-d15db62e0ced"},{"objectId":"656f172a40970720e1ff1dfa","name":"F.J.","lastName":"Jorissen","documentHash":"8a5db3ca-7acb-4530-abe9-a9f3151ed94c"},{"objectId":"656f172a40970720e1ff1df9","name":"L.","lastName":"Pacho Sampedro","documentHash":"58e7354c-c751-4543-9d2b-cda58c68097b"},{"objectId":"656f172a40970720e1ff1df8","name":"L.J.","lastName":"de Nooijer","documentHash":"5d9c973e-38e9-4e31-a2fb-2ab99c489020"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-17","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"656f172a40970720e1ff1df7","doi":"10.1016/j.earscirev.2023.104484","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0012825223001733?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"500 million years of foraminiferal calcification","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ongoing ocean acidification affects marine calcification, although the scope and magnitude of this impact is essentially unknown.

Differences between orders reflect the different physiological controls employed by foraminifera to take up Ca2+ and inorganic carbon from seawater for CaCO3 precipitation. With the long timespan involved, variability in seawater chemistry provided contrasting environments for calcification to arise, resulting in the diverse calcification strategies that exist today. This, in turn, explains the opposite responses of shell building to carbon perturbations. Our results call for adopting an evolutionary perspective when predicting the impact of perturbations on marine calcification and thereby, on the global carbon cycle."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"243","pagesFromTo":"104484","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656f172a40970720e1ff1df8","656f172a40970720e1ff1df9","656f172a40970720e1ff1dfa","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","656f172a40970720e1ff1dfb","656f172a40970720e1ff1dfc","656f172a40970720e1ff1dfd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779e2","mniswId":"5279","title":"EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS","issn":"0012-8252","documentHash":"12f28f4b-0a7c-4b61-8151-b4641dd4a10b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64d0c44a40970760b68ce5b1","year":"2023","volume":"243","documentHash":"9f567fe8-6d2b-4280-a830-54c84f8924e4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Foraminifera","Evolution","Paleoclimate"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059156772"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6582c47640970751d8f0760c","name":"Sakina‐Dorothée","lastName":"Ayata","documentHash":"f547c44c-c318-4b1e-8f7e-2dae79bc63cc"},{"objectId":"6582c47640970751d8f0760b","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Niehoff","documentHash":"627d3348-5483-4dbf-b3a6-11a3da1b4944"},{"objectId":"6582c47640970751d8f0760a","name":"Mohammed‐Amin","lastName":"Madoui","documentHash":"d1971c8f-ffbd-439d-a2eb-cf1a4ae85687"},{"objectId":"6582c47640970751d8f07609","name":"Sünnje","lastName":"Basedow","documentHash":"22c76de0-bc83-4a90-903c-34c00a426ca5"},{"objectId":"6582c47640970751d8f07608","name":"Frédéric","lastName":"Maps","documentHash":"91427d97-5e8b-4e2b-8a19-5ed271fbaec4"},{"objectId":"6582c47640970751d8f07607","name":"Laure","lastName":"Vilgrain","documentHash":"1c97f7d8-afb1-4a0f-8ce9-ed7d13875a03"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6582c47640970751d8f07605","doi":"10.1002/ecs2.4489","publicUri":"https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ecs2.4489","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Copepods' true colors: astaxanthin pigmentation as an indicator of fitness","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pigmentation is often overlooked in zooplankton, since these organisms are mostly colorless to fit the translucid water medium. However, one of the dominant zooplankton taxa in aquatic ecosystems—copepods—often show a bright red-orange or blue coloration owing to the accumulation of carotenoid pigments in some parts of their bodies. Even though there are many functional traits describing copepod's performance (e.g., size, feeding, and reproductive modes), it is surprising that the role of such a simple and visible trait as coloration has not been studied in a coherent manner yet. Here, by reviewing 95 studies, we demonstrate that carotenoid-based pigmentation (mainly caused by astaxanthin molecules) is a widespread functional trait in freshwater and marine copepods. We propose a way to disentangle the complex and thus intriguing patterns of pigment expression along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, addressing its relationship to diet quality and quantity, temperature, ultraviolet radiation stress, predation pressure, lipid metabolism, and reproduction. We show that large-scale variations in pigmentation are difficult to tackle because of the fundamental plasticity of this trait at short time scales (i.e., hours, days), and the most recent information about carotenoid bioconversion are addressed (genes and enzyme identification, and influence of microbiota). From this literature review, we hypothesize that pigments play a “Swiss-army knife” role for copepod's fitness, useful in various ecosystem conditions owing to the strong antioxidant power and the finely-tuned metabolism of astaxanthin. With larger antioxidant capacities (survival), higher metabolisms (growth), and more offspring in better condition (reproduction), red morphs appear more successful than their uncolored siblings. Also, the potential camouflage strategies allowed by red and blue pigmentation are discussed. We finally formulate new directions and future research fields from molecular to ecosystem scales. Routine quantifications of copepod's pigmentation through trait-based approaches could be useful (1) to obtain an accurate copepod fitness indicator and (2) to better estimate the transfer of antioxidant to higher trophic levels in ecosystems, including humans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"6","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6582c47640970751d8f07607","6582c47640970751d8f07608","6582c47640970751d8f07609","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","6582c47640970751d8f0760a","6582c47640970751d8f0760b","6582c47640970751d8f0760c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a2c","mniswId":"5406","title":"Ecosphere","issn":"2150-8925","eissn":"2150-8925","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"db973074-d404-4cd2-b477-5c319637404f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6582c47640970751d8f07606","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"6","documentHash":"aa9937be-feac-4bec-8a7d-aa39a455fb43"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059160141"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6582d2fe40970751d8f1b3ab","name":"Yvette","lastName":"Heimbrand","documentHash":"43d0a13f-53f7-4193-9308-4be86d2d4bac"},{"objectId":"6582d2fe40970751d8f1b3aa","name":"Karin E.","lastName":"Limburg","documentHash":"fe45085a-3354-40b5-a114-965d71c52fd7"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kuliński","uuid":"A1362FEB3C94D210BA97D7C5FE392ED27FB4DD61D0B2476A4F5C18B20F589C7FA21F35A13EA5510511C60D24A7EAD1FC4FDC75E86C1645B920BA2AE06C994826","orcidId":"0000-0002-5403-6629","documentHash":"8009c04f-1ba9-4687-80f3-d96316801246"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6582d2fe40970751d8f1b3a8","doi":"10.5194/bg-20-4751-2023","publicUri":"https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/20/4751/2023/bg-20-4751-2023.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Marked recent declines in boron in Baltic Sea cod otoliths –  a bellwether of incipient acidification in a vast hypoxic system?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ocean acidification is spreading globally as a result of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, but the Baltic Sea has until recently been thought to be relatively well-buffered by terrigenous inputs of alkalinity from its watershed. We discovered a 3- to 5-fold decline in boron (as B : Ca) in otoliths of eastern Baltic cod (EBC) between the late 1990s and 2021. Examining a time series of EBC otoliths, we found varying levels of B : Ca starting in the 1980s, with the most recent years showing an all-time low for this period. This trend correlates with declines in pH and dissolved oxygen but not with changes in salinity. We examined possible physiological influences on B : Ca by including a collection of Icelandic cod as an “out-group”. Icelandic cod otoliths showed strongly positive correlations of B : Ca with physiologically regulated P : Ca; this was not the case for EBC. Finally, B : Ca in EBC otoliths is negatively correlated, to some extent, with Mn : Mg, a proposed proxy for hypoxia exposure. This negative relationship is hypothesized to reflect the dual phenomena of hypoxia and acidification as a result of decomposition of large algal blooms. Taken together, the otolith biomarkers Mn : Mg and B : Ca in cod suggest a general increase in both hypoxia and acidification within the Baltic intermediate and deep waters in the last decade."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"4751-4760","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6582d2fe40970751d8f1b3aa","6582d2fe40970751d8f1b3ab","5e709347878c28a0473a654a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477336","mniswId":"2417","title":"Biogeosciences","issn":"1726-4189","websiteLink":"www.biogeosciences.net/12/6493/2015/","documentHash":"9312d442-03bc-4ac9-b1b5-5323c52b58fc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6582d2fe40970751d8f1b3a9","year":"2023","volume":"20","number":"23","documentHash":"40c6ed38-6608-43fa-aa13-acf1b6d675ec"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059160260"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6582c36340970751d8f0596e","name":"Lars","lastName":"Stemmann","documentHash":"9166b88b-e6df-4dc9-88c5-1be70e30757b"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6520","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Błachowiak-Samołyk","uuid":"8C6AD77D97DA3D9D5230CB20B5B200FB76893BFE72A48BE0BAB6068DBB7BD96049B3C885C6414B2EF04BBFB8AFD27AC9468868A23DB7A01FB8AEBEECC4EDAD0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8076-2168","documentHash":"5036109f-207f-446c-bac6-ec8dd36677f9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6582c36340970751d8f0596d","doi":"10.1525/elementa.2023.00010","publicUri":"https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article-pdf/doi/10.1525/elementa.2023.00010/793546/elementa.2023.00010.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Structures of coexisting marine snow and zooplankton in coastal waters of Svalbard (European Arctic)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"How plankton and particles are arranged spatially and the configurations of their co-occurrence shape the rates of organic matter production, utilization, and export within marine systems. The aim of this study was to examine whether the composition of marine snow (particles and aggregates >500 µm) and its coexistence with zooplankton change with depth layer, level of zooplankton dominance, chlorophyll fluorescence, and turbidity across the coastal–offshore gradients of hydrographically different Arctic fjords. The distribution and concentrations of zooplankton and marine snow were assessed in situ using an underwater vision profiler (UVP) in Svalbard waters during summer 2019. UVP counts of marine snow drastically outnumbered zooplankton at glacial stations, whereas zooplankton dominated offshore and in upper water layers, even in coastal waters. The most common compositional structure was dominance by an elongated morphotype of marine snow, often co-occurring with small dark (opaque) particles below 40 m depth, implying that these were the typical forms exported directly from surface layers. The other widespread type of structuring was dominance of UVP counts by copepods. They often coexisted with a flake morphotype of marine snow associated with high chlorophyll fluorescence. Structuring dominated by dark morphotypes was observed mainly near glaciers and in deep fjord basins. The highest amount of marine snow, represented by a high degree of dark morphotype, was observed in Hornsund, the most Arctic-type fjord. A Phaeocystis-associated agglomerated morphotype of marine snow occurred scarcely and only in more Atlantic-influenced fjords. A bimodal distribution pattern, with one abundance peak at the surface and another in deeper layers (>80 m) was observed offshore and in Kongsfjorden. This study emphasizes the high potential of UVPs for tracking links between plankton and detritus directly in their natural environment, and that variation in their co-occurrence may provide a proxy for the state of a pelagic ecosystem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","6582c36340970751d8f0596e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bff3","mniswId":"5590","title":"Elementa-Science of the Anthropocene","issn":"2325-1026","eissn":"2325-1026","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"62b408a3-f2ab-48d6-bd03-ec10365e773c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic","Marine snow","Zooplankton","Morphology","Underwater imaging","Environmental gradients","UVP","Coastal waters","Coexistence"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059160531"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65819024409707482c27b7e6","name":"Henning","lastName":"Reiss","documentHash":"bafc1e95-83ab-4daa-ab6b-da246dfc7ca5"},{"objectId":"65819024409707482c27b7e5","name":"Paul E.","lastName":"Renaud","documentHash":"222864ab-105b-4f47-9f88-309f669d38a0"},{"objectId":"65819024409707482c27b7e4","name":"Bodil A.","lastName":"Bluhm","documentHash":"32e9184d-c7de-4cf6-b7c0-c94c21dd5cc7"},{"objectId":"65819024409707482c27b7e3","name":"Arunima","lastName":"Sen","documentHash":"019c9836-525b-409d-a0f6-70abc3a918a5"},{"objectId":"65819024409707482c27b7e2","name":"Èric","lastName":"Jordà-Molina","documentHash":"d98d5bc9-296a-4cd3-a5a3-13fdc8d427c4"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a653a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Legeżyńska","uuid":"193CFEEDC8268B971EDE18C39B04B100A6E21C09227CA4EF5C3138CE98064EB2C0141A09C0F80AE7A635D51CC7C61B42FD3DCCE7B385C46DD9743E4877B51B33","orcidId":"0000-0001-7718-0335","documentHash":"ea3f9865-cb35-4227-b0b2-cc02bf444637"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651e","name":"Maria","lastName":"Włodarska-Kowalczuk","uuid":"D47553F9A2C33D8033D8594650BFC32CC9C68EF6F3EE4CE130DBEC8BA3DF82ED9A7055BF1E4316109AD31C2E6DBEF73F3FEF158A522731E002B07E209F106EDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2757-1108","documentHash":"01d767d9-9266-45a4-bd4b-a8cf8d1e8a8e"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993cf","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"BACE9E820844C505745871AB1E069A3FE871A0AA597DB695946ABCEDABDAE239968DE9050390480EE9C612EF6607DE8183FD2AFDFD78CEDEECA17F889594D919","documentHash":"3bc43de3-b90c-4854-8782-492442b45a2c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65819024409707482c27b7e1","doi":"10.1016/j.pocean.2023.103150","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0079661123001933?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Lack of strong seasonality in macrobenthic communities from the northern Barents Sea shelf and Nansen Basin","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Barents Sea has been coined ‘the Arctic hotspot’ of climate change due to the rapidity with which environmental changes are taking place. This transitional domain from Atlantic to Arctic waters is home to highly productive benthic communities. This system strongly fluctuates on a seasonal basis in its sympagic-pelagic-benthic coupling interactions, with potential effects on benthic standing stocks and production. Recent discoveries have questioned the marked seasonality for several high Arctic seafloor communities in coastal waters of Svalbard. Still, the seasonal variability of benthic process in the extensive Barents Sea open shelf remains poorly understood. Therefore, we studied the seasonality of macrofauna communities along a transect in the northwestern Barents Sea comprising two hydrographic domains (Arctic vs. Atlantic Water, across the Polar Front) and three geomorphological settings (shelf, continental slope and abyssal plain). Overall, we did not find strong signs of seasonal variation in taxonomic community structure and functional diversity. However, we found some weak signs of seasonality when examining each station separately, especially at a station close to the Polar Front, with high seasonal fluctuations in abiotic drivers indicating a stronger pelagic-benthic coupling. The lack of seasonality found both at the shelf stations south and north of the Polar Front could be related to organic matter stored in the sediments, reflected in constant levels of total organic carbon in surface sediment across time for all stations. We did observe, as expected, highly spatially structured environmental regimes and macrofauna communities associated to them from shelf to slope and basin locations. Understanding the underlying spatio-temporal mechanisms by which soft-bottom benthic communities are structured along environmental gradients is necessary to predict future impacts of climate change in this area. Our results indicate that short-term climate driven changes in the phenology of pelagic ecosystem components might not be directly reflected in the Arctic benthic system, as seafloor processes seem to be partially decoupled from those in the overlying water."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a0473993cf","5e709347878c28a0473a653a","5e709347878c28a0473a651e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"219","pagesFromTo":"103150","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65819024409707482c27b7e2","65819024409707482c27b7e3","65819024409707482c27b7e4","65819024409707482c27b7e5","5e709347878c28a0473a651e","5e709347878c28a0473a653a","5e70929e878c28a0473993cf","65819024409707482c27b7e6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"4bc3bbad-0ed4-4dfe-8f62-93517ff00731"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a366","year":"2023","volume":"219","documentHash":"8effe1a0-7a21-41e5-a632-7a4ae52006f2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Benthic community dynamics","Phenology","Arctic","Functional traits","Taxonomic structure","Continental Shelf"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059164007"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6582bdc240970751d8efc633","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Zeppilli","documentHash":"f0bc69f6-a218-496b-8ce1-4de0fefc863a"},{"objectId":"6582bdc240970751d8efc632","name":"Reinhardt M.","lastName":"Kristensen","documentHash":"b4156e50-79fc-4bb7-a2bc-6b37c74ee454"},{"objectId":"6582bdc240970751d8efc631","name":"Mauricio","lastName":"Shimabukuro","documentHash":"c5386c7f-4f00-440b-abf7-984b23e0cbbf"},{"objectId":"6582bdc240970751d8efc630","name":"Maria","lastName":"Herranz","documentHash":"5b8e8c09-93a8-4615-9b79-a98a9d08ef17"},{"objectId":"6582bdc240970751d8efc62f","name":"Martin V.","lastName":"Sørensen","documentHash":"23fefdab-41bb-4df7-b4ae-9a2198adb397"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"89E34998A7815703314F14609081D0B42B721BC6BC02334A524F1A72E99979BE1D2892A3F7AD68FC281490897050CAC6FC5A6472BC066A2DFADD377EF7948831","orcidId":"0000-0002-8175-575X","documentHash":"60624fd9-0ebc-49d7-8f66-5b468fb82647"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6582bdc240970751d8efc62d","doi":"10.5852/ejt.2023.879.2169","publicUri":"https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt/article/download/2169/9269","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Living on the edge – first survey of loriciferans along the Atacama Trench","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The fauna of Loricifera along a north-south longitudinal transect following the Atacama Trench was explored.

Members of this colonial invertebrate phylum display an exceptional degree ofdivision of labor in the form of specialized modules, which allows for the inference of individual allocationof resources to reproduction, defense, and growth using simple morphometric tools. However, morphometriccharacterizations of bryozoans are notoriously labored. Here, we introduce DeepBryo, a web application for deep-learning-based morphometric characterization of cheilostome bryozoans. DeepBryo is capable of detecting objectsbelonging to six classes and outputting 14 morphological shape measurements for each object. The users can visu-alize the predictions, check for errors, and directlyfilter model outputs on the web browser. DeepBryo was trainedand validated on a total of 72,412 structures in six different object classes from images of 109 different families ofcheilostome bryozoans. The model shows high (> 0.8) recall and precision for zooid-level structures. Its mis-classification rate is low (\u00184%) and largely concentrated in two object classes. The model’s estimated structure-level area, height, and width measurements are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained via manualannotation. DeepBryo reduces the person-hours required for characterizing individual colonies to less than 1% ofthe time required for manual annotation. Our results indicate that DeepBryo enables cost-, labor,- and time-efficient morphometric characterization of cheilostome bryozoans. DeepBryo can greatly increase the scale of mac-roevolutionary, ecological, taxonomic, and paleobiological analyses, as well as the accessibility of deep-learningtools for this emerging model system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"542-551","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6571b75240970741e5c0f884","6571b75240970741e5c0f885","6571b75240970741e5c0f886","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","6571b75240970741e5c0f887","6571b75240970741e5c0f888","6571b75240970741e5c0f889","6571b75240970741e5c0f88a","6571b75240970741e5c0f88b","6571b75240970741e5c0f88c","6571b75240970741e5c0f88d","6571b75240970741e5c0f88e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cf7","mniswId":"13651","title":"LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS","issn":"1541-5856","eissn":"1541-5856","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8ec5d732-4749-407e-b161-d16e042cdc4b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6571b75240970741e5c0f883","year":"2023","volume":"21","number":"9","documentHash":"48d72c1a-8b60-4bf5-b655-533fd5084625"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059170120"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e82","name":"Frédéric","lastName":"Marin","documentHash":"1ec9f1dc-556c-4f00-8e4b-8693885e7f03"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e81","name":"Jérôme","lastName":"Thomas","documentHash":"ee30923a-18a7-4d27-9653-94fb9cbea3b5"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e80","name":"Laurent","lastName":"Plasseraud","documentHash":"ed7c5fe7-eb48-4921-92d9-8dc2f2b26c89"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e7f","name":"Robert","lastName":"van Geldern","documentHash":"80d966a3-9d39-417f-8ba7-4d24c45d9d4a"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e7e","name":"Matthias","lastName":"López Correa","documentHash":"2b888f5c-5d08-42eb-9097-67a918993296"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e7d","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Mazzoli","documentHash":"d159a84b-b09d-401d-90de-03bcc563fc98"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e7c","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Bordone","documentHash":"8e2df39f-f88b-430c-92a0-bed0efab2d7e"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e7b","name":"Giancarlo","lastName":"Raiteri","documentHash":"c25b6d60-3c88-4bfd-b562-0e5e9086378f"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e7a","name":"Giorgio","lastName":"Bruzzone","documentHash":"9752652c-3a3f-4bd7-bb32-40bf799e7b52"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e79","name":"Edoardo","lastName":"Spirandelli","documentHash":"60752277-257e-42e2-9778-e210317d9777"},{"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e78","name":"Chiara","lastName":"Lombardi","documentHash":"1d760926-a268-4abf-8c47-10ba26fe5d47"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6571be2c40970741e5c32e77","doi":"10.3390/min13020246","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/2/246/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Antarctic Bioconstructional Bryozoans from Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea): Morphology, Skeletal Structures and Biomineralization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Among Antarctic bryozoans, some species are able to develop calcitic bioconstructions promoting habitat complexity, but the processes leading to biomineral formation are mostly unknown. The present work investigated three Antarctic bryozoans, from morphological to skeletal features, including the organic matrix associated with the skeleton (SOM). Cellarinella nutti Rogick, 1956 and Reteporella frigida Waters, 1904 were collected in November 2018 from a shallow site (25 m) and Cellarinella njegovanae Rogick, 1956 from a deep site (110 m) at Terra Nova Bay (Ross Sea, Antarctica). Both Cellarinella species showed 5–6 “growth check lines” (gcl) on their laminae. The morphometrical characterization conducted on the growth bands (gb) and zooids, within the band across bands, revealed a variability in length with time (C. nutti: from 4099 µm for gb1 to 1449 µm for gb6; C. njegovanae: from 1974 µm for gb 3 to 7127 µm for gb2). Zooid length varied within gb, from the proximal to the distal part of the bands, but differences also occurred across bands. The shortest zooids (~625 µm) were found at the proximal part and the longest (~ 1190 µm) in the middle part of the gb in C. nutti, whereas in C. njegovanae the shortest zooids (~ 660 µm) were found in the distal part and the longest (~1190 µm) in the proximal part of the gb. Micro-CT analyses indicated the ratio of basal zooidal walls (RbwT gcl/gb) ranged from 3.0 to 4.9 in C. nutti and from 2.3 to 5.9 in C. njegovanae, whereas Reteporella frigida did not form any gcl on either side of the colony. Preliminary characterizations of the SOM for the three species evidenced a mixture of proteins and polysaccharides with properties similar to those of better-known biominerals, in terms of quantity and electrophoretic behavior. In addition, a “lectin fingerprint” has been established for the first time in bryozoans, displaying the presence of chitin or chitin-related saccharides. Understanding the complexity of the processes regulating skeleton formation is a key aspect in comprehending the adaptation of bioconstructional ecosystems and the survival of the associated biodiversity under the future ocean."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii

is a phylogeographical study of Juxtacribrilina mutabilis, a recently described bryozoan from Japan with sightings in Sweden, Norway, and Maine (US), to test how fast and far it has expanded across Europe in recent years. J. mutabilis settles easily on ship hulls, making it a useful model organism for studying long-distance invasion pathways. The study was conducted using Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) to monitor the entire European coastline and Svalbard for J. mutabilis using DNA metabarcoding. During the time between its first sighting in Europe 2008 and the last ARMS retrieval 2020, the data shows how J. mutabilis has gained a pan-European distribution, being genetically identified in 14 new distinct locations. Presence/absence of barcodes were confirmed by image-based identification in 74% of the samples. Fourteen haplotypes never reported before were discovered in a 264 bp region of the cytochrome oxidase I gene. Two haplotypes (HP1 and HP3) occurred frequently and geographically widely dispersed, indicating intercontinental connectivity. Two locations, Koster and Getxo showed particularly high genetic diversity with similar haplotype networks suggesting continuous gene flow across oceanographically unlinked regions. Given the recent description of J. mutabilis and the relatively few historical encounters, the genetic diversity described here suggests an unusually fast range expansion within the last two decades. Such global spreading events of fouling organisms may become more common in the future as a result of more frequent and interconnected ship traffic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"850","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"4115-4126","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6571c27640970741e5c36e9c","6571c27640970741e5c36e9d","5e709347878c28a0473a6522"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffac6ad49b31ccec855e2","title":"HYDROBIOLOGIA","issn":"0018-8158","eissn":"0018-8158","documentHash":"128195fd-7e0f-44d3-9491-ec1afbd8c328"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6571c27640970741e5c36e9b","year":"2023","volume":"850","number":"19","documentHash":"b516337f-c5c9-4b06-8e6f-1884be7413ff"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cribrilina mutabilis","Metabarcoding","ARMS","Northeast passage","Suez channel","Non- indigenous species"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059170783"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6572dfbc4097074b3777586d","name":"Romero‐Ramirez","lastName":"Alicia","documentHash":"30ce9f9f-bac1-409c-81fe-ea315b7b4aac"},{"objectId":"618353b97523400564d81fba","name":"Laura","lastName":"Morales Luna Hadryś","uuid":"4779BECDD7883CEBEEF8FAF3042BEBDF8C8722018CE9A5102E51A32CD4E4AA8922FBE2CD33525D02173C5ECCFCEABD8D82D0A70AA026B5CEF9C099926C61D3AC","documentHash":"873b38fb-00a4-48d4-96bb-b0e89ff9923a"},{"objectId":"5fb3d234085dcb64f926a04c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Chełchowski","uuid":"8982566CAA5F2DCAB641551A6B17D8DCC5C0423387B46BA093D666110EAB76A9D715885B5A38AF585ADA8361B656016CCD69FC8A2D4366E678DCF78B92125A02","documentHash":"1c4d3a6d-e0db-47ec-9619-4cbe6c7159bc"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-02-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6572dfbc4097074b3777586b","doi":"10.1002/lom3.10537","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lom3.10537","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Image analysis and benthic ecology: Proceedings to analyze in situ long‐term image series","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Long time series of underwater images have become a tool widely used within the benthic ecology research community.

This paper focuses on the first steps of analyzing large numbers of underwater images, which involves assessing the amount of valid data while assuming no technical problems. The question here addressed is how many of the in situ images can reliably be really used for benthic ecology purposes. To answer this question, we propose a method to eliminate nonvalid images and use it with four different sets of time-lapsed images acquired for long periods ranging from 73 to 371 ds in a row. The results show that elimination of between 8% and 22% of the images is possible depending on the data set. The main advantage of the method is easing and accelerating automation of subsequent

the atmosphere by heating it. Their effect in the Arctic was investigated during two summer Arctic oceanographic campaigns (2018 and 2019) around the Svalbard Archipelago in order to unravel the differences between the Arctic background and the local anthropic settlements. Therefore, the LAA heating rate (HR) was experimentally determined. Both the chemical composition and high-resolution measurements highlighted substantial differences between the Arctic Ocean background (average eBC concentration of 11.7 ± 0.1 ng/m3) and the human settlements, among which the most impacting appeared to be Tromsø and Isfjorden (mean eBC of 99.4 ± 3.1 ng/m3). Consequently, the HR in Isfjorden (8.2 × 10−3 ± 0.3 × 10−3 K/day) was one order of magnitude higher than in the pristine background conditions (0.8 × 10−3 ± 0.9 × 10−5 K/day). Therefore, we conclude that the direct climate impact of local LAA sources on the Arctic atmosphere is not negligible and may rise in the future due to ice retreat and enhanced marine traffic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6530","5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","5e70929e878c28a04739941f","5e709347878c28a0473a651c","5e709489878c28a0473bf343","5e709489878c28a0473bf377"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1768","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6573225a4097074b3780b0ed","5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","6573225a4097074b3780b0ee","6573225a4097074b3780b0ef","6573225a4097074b3780b0f0","5e709347878c28a0473a6530","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","5e709347878c28a0473a651c","5e70929e878c28a04739941f","5e709489878c28a0473bf343","6573225a4097074b3780b0f1","6573225a4097074b3780b0f2","6573225a4097074b3780b0f3","6573225a4097074b3780b0f4","6573225a4097074b3780b0f5","6573225a4097074b3780b0f6","6573225a4097074b3780b0f7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e99bbe2c-fe08-4cb7-999f-c3a55335bedc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6573225a4097074b3780b0ec","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"12","documentHash":"f64da381-70d8-4515-bdee-f28f94d3c892"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["black carbon","Arctic","heating rate","direct radiative forcing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059177324"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658beddd4097070a21ebbe01","name":"Joan","lastName":"Cerdà","documentHash":"8815cb0a-4317-40ce-98a9-3303614f84eb"},{"objectId":"658beddd4097070a21ebbe00","name":"Roderick Nigel","lastName":"Finn","documentHash":"eaa3b01f-c8fa-4449-a9c2-ca7eff18f511"},{"objectId":"658beddd4097070a21ebbdff","name":"François","lastName":"Chauvigné","documentHash":"4d97dfa9-ffab-4094-b3ef-19f8a682cbca"},{"objectId":"658beddd4097070a21ebbdfe","name":"Alba","lastName":"Ferré","documentHash":"5ad6e3c9-1c5d-45d2-ac18-7275b62bb09d"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf339","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gozdowska","uuid":"0095819996D9E12A4CCB68D7603511E52342E40B4DD0B4A75469CCF3319E539B2A9712E9EE4A28E25E3A06A0359E59AFBD109B8577D9086D92BC8A4B090F0E96","orcidId":"0000-0002-7927-2230","documentHash":"718e83b3-8dea-4887-8d81-8a236189fd4f"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a650f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kulczykowska","uuid":"856B07BDA8ABD3060D5000D705193A7D38A1150782FA1BCC8AF1C8253AC8ED7804B7E4E0308C1B5B61504F79D590C22B401EEA1B5757A14951EE90881A585932","orcidId":"0000-0002-3979-9310","documentHash":"e7b053a3-a963-4c82-9964-cd686c8db387"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"658beddd4097070a21ebbdfd","doi":"10.3389/fendo.2023.1222724","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2023.1222724/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Neurohypophysial and paracrine vasopressinergic signaling regulates aquaporin trafficking to hydrate marine teleost oocytes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The dual aquaporin (Aqp1ab1/Aqp1ab2)-mediated hydration of marine teleost eggs, which occurs during oocyte meiosis resumption (maturation), is considered a key adaptation underpinning their evolutionary success in the oceans. However, the endocrine signals controlling this mechanism are almost unknown. Here, we investigated whether the nonapeptides arginine vasopressin (Avp, formerly vasotocin) and oxytocin (Oxt, formerly isotocin) are involved in marine teleost oocyte hydration using the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) as a model. We show that concomitant with an increased systemic production of Avp and Oxt, the nonapeptides are also produced and accumulated locally in the ovarian follicles during oocyte maturation and hydration. Functional characterization of representative Avp and Oxt receptor subtypes indicates that Avpr1aa and Oxtrb, expressed in the postvitellogenic oocyte, activate phospholipase C and protein kinase C pathways, while Avpr2aa, which is highly expressed in the oocyte and in the follicular theca and granulosa cells, activates the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) cascade. Using ex vivo, in vitro and mutagenesis approaches, we determined that Avpr2aa plays a major role in the PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the aquaporin subdomains driving membrane insertion of Aqp1ab2 in the theca and granulosa cells, and of Aqp1ab1 and Aqp1ab2 in the distal and proximal regions of the oocyte microvilli, respectively. The data further indicate that luteinizing hormone, which surges during oocyte maturation, induces the synthesis of Avp in the granulosa cells via progestin production and the nuclear progestin receptor. Collectively, our data suggest that both the neurohypophysial and paracrine vasopressinergic systems integrate to differentially regulate the trafficking of the Aqp1ab-type paralogs via a common Avp-Avpr2aa-PKA pathway to avoid competitive occupancy of the same plasma membrane space and maximize water influx during oocyte hydration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

plankton dynamics in Kongsfjorden during two years of contrasting environmental conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Seasonal plankton time-series data are presented from Kongsfjorden from two years with contrasting environmental conditions. Kongsfjorden (west coast of Spitsbergen – 79°N) integrates inputs from Atlantic and Arctic waters, and glacier run-off, and is thus a prime location to study impacts on ecosystem dynamics of key environmental drivers that are relevant across the Arctic. Despite extensive research in Kongsfjorden, seasonally-resolved data are scarce. From late April/early May to early September 2019 and 2020, we conducted pelagic sampling at a mid-fjord station at mostly weekly to bi-weekly resolution investigating the environmental drivers of phyto- and zooplankton community composition and phenology. During spring 2019, Atlantic water masses with temperatures > 1 °C were found throughout the upper 250 m of the water column, and little sea ice occurred in the fjord. Spring 2020, in turn, was characterized by the presence of local water masses with sub-zero temperatures and relatively extensive sea-ice cover. The most striking contrast between the two years was the difference in phytoplankton spring bloom composition. In 2019, the spring bloom was dominated by the colonial stage of the haptophyte Phaeocystis pouchetii and diatoms played a minor role, while the spring bloom in 2020 was dominated by diatoms of the genus Thalassiosira succeeded by P. pouchetii. Selective grazing by large copepods and water mass structure seem to have been the decisive factors explaining the marked difference in diatom spring bloom biomass between the years while similar spring abundances of P. pouchetii in both years indicated that this species was less impacted by those factors. Our data suggest that differences in spring bloom composition impacted trophic transfer and carbon export. Recruitment of the dominant copepods Calanus finmarchicus and C. glacialis, Cirripedia and euphausiid larvae as well as the export of carbon to the seabed was more efficient during the diatom-dominated compared to the P. pouchetii–dominated spring bloom. In summer, the plankton composition shifted towards a flagellate-dominated community characterized by mixo- and heterotrophic taxa adapted to a lower nutrient regime and strong top-down control by copepod grazers. However, residual silicic acid after the P. pouchetii–dominated spring bloom fueled a late summer diatom bloom in 2019.\n\nOur data provide a first glimpse into the environmental drivers of plankton phenology and underline that high-resolution monitoring over many annual cycles is required to resolve the ephemeral variations of plankton populations against the backdrop of climate change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c","5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","60c344919543c723365442f5","5e709489878c28a0473bf359"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"213","pagesFromTo":"102996","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6580478d4097073e4d220f12","6580478d4097073e4d220f13","6580478d4097073e4d220f14","6580478d4097073e4d220f15","6580478d4097073e4d220f16","6580478d4097073e4d220f17","6580478d4097073e4d220f18","6580478d4097073e4d220f19","6580478d4097073e4d220f1a","60c344919543c723365442f5","5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","6580478d4097073e4d220f1b","6580478d4097073e4d220f1c","5e709489878c28a0473bf359","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","6580478d4097073e4d220f1d","6580478d4097073e4d220f1e","6580478d4097073e4d220f1f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"4bc3bbad-0ed4-4dfe-8f62-93517ff00731"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6422dcab4097072924c7b8f3","year":"2023","volume":"213","documentHash":"311596d3-1fd1-42b6-93f7-264517e5e2ea"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arctic Ocean","Kongsfjorden","Seasonality","Protist plankton","Zooplankton","Phaeocystis","Diatoms"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059210897"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659693664097074a3902b64c","name":"Henning","lastName":"Reiss","documentHash":"00856482-9907-4ab3-9560-c8bb01dc6020"},{"objectId":"659693664097074a3902b64b","name":"Marc J.","lastName":"Silberberger","documentHash":"db01706f-ba4b-4c2f-8f15-d057e96d10e2"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6546","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kędra","uuid":"B950AFC0394B7FA11EB92F7D86E8B739E8F8E7879A82119B50736842491ECD0E305659B79802EAF50951C7A11F3F4453F898F95EE3550F2986DCF421440D2324","orcidId":"0000-0002-2223-5850","documentHash":"dc1fef89-bd48-43c8-8077-d9cff1028c90"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739941d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Koziorowska-Makuch","uuid":"3509723B3C9ACF6AC999AADF8F9DFFCBC59EBD1303980F82ED6C7F4BD7719E1581D1822C26EAABF3F62D27DEB38E556101B6169DCDBBF6E954F2721AB7FCCE40","orcidId":"0000-0002-9111-9597","documentHash":"f1a7632d-a947-4305-b1e3-6d63b76e893b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"659693664097074a3902b64a","doi":"10.1111/gcb.17100","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.17100","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Trophic niches of macrobenthos: Latitudinal variation indicates climate change impact on ecosystem functioning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Benthic food-web structure and organic matter (OM) utilization are important for marine ecosystem functioning. In response to environmental changes related to the ongoing climate change, however, many benthic species are shifting their ranges to colder regions, which may lead to altered community composition, but it remains largely unknown how it will affect ecosystem functioning. Here, stable isotope analysis was used to study benthic OM utilization and food-web structure and to assess whether their spatial patterns reflect today's community differentiation among biogeographic regions and depth zones. Benthic fauna and OM mixtures were collected from two depth zones (100–150 m vs. 200–250 m) within a temperate, two sub-Arctic, and an Arctic fjord along a latitudinal gradient (59–78° N) that was used as a space-for-time substitution to assess the impact of climate change. Our results showed that Arctic and temperate communities are functionally different. Arctic communities were characterized by a strong resource partitioning among different feeding types, irrespective of depth zone. In contrast, all feeding types in temperate communities seemed to rely on sedimentary OM. The sub-Arctic presented a transition zone. In the sub-Arctic, shallower communities resembled Arctic communities, suggesting a functional transition between temperate and sub-Arctic regions. Deeper sub-Arctic communities resembled temperate communities, suggesting a functional transition between the sub-Arctic and Arctic regions. This implies that the regions north of the current transitions (deep Arctic and shallow sub-Arctic) are most likely to experience functional changes related to an altered OM utilization in benthic food webs in response to climate change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6546","5e70929e878c28a04739941d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"e17100","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659693664097074a3902b64b","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","659693664097074a3902b64c","5e709347878c28a0473a6546"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e4f","mniswId":"7245","title":"GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY","issn":"1354-1013","eissn":"1365-2486","documentHash":"5c9da737-f24b-45cc-8cf7-b567a143645c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65801f194097073e4d1edf4b","year":"2023","volume":"30","number":"1","documentHash":"2b0bba40-9b3d-4609-a483-202ecb0299d7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059217682"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a36e","name":"Marit","lastName":"Reigstad","documentHash":"39f01cf2-9528-4360-9564-2efec7291032"},{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a36d","name":"Angelika H.H.","lastName":"Renner","documentHash":"93008a75-4036-41b7-9c3d-21e0e09ae156"},{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a36c","name":"Miriam","lastName":"Marquardt","documentHash":"2c906d16-49ec-4f40-a67b-407e46c352cb"},{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a36b","name":"Philipp","lastName":"Assmy","documentHash":"7b6a7cc9-3920-4e57-9030-ab522b292a83"},{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a36a","name":"Martí","lastName":"Amargant-Arumí","documentHash":"15667c22-cf82-486d-b149-32656e1ed0eb"},{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a369","name":"Lucie","lastName":"Goraguer","documentHash":"f0e6eb37-b2c1-4bb3-8c81-6e0bdb2801e8"},{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a368","name":"Paul E.","lastName":"Renaud","documentHash":"261fc021-4fad-445d-8c6e-eac962a81f87"},{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a367","name":"Yasemin V.","lastName":"Bodur","documentHash":"6f8058f5-64cc-4155-8e76-dd42fb40bd95"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf359","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tatarek","uuid":"7EE1E47D321F50DCA10E3EE8AE6B69ADAD102DD6F260B15C5FAFB4CDB18ADAB7DB98698EDA96C3F6694FEBFAE6E998A04B022F2EE8AF42B5FAA1B158F078B131","orcidId":"0000-0003-1467-6362","documentHash":"70339abc-aa35-4e2b-ab8b-296f2bba7dce"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"EEF890B1E5D83511CFF757CBCF10CA2BD7991D3807A5C930A1FE7E612F46F8C684536138A249461DB575FC1B980CA1B886292FD94C3FEBB57329BF6C05122B7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0911-3082","documentHash":"6cad81c7-1414-4d5a-958e-f2eaeda4b528"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a365","doi":"10.1016/j.pocean.2023.103132","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0079661123001751?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Seasonal patterns of vertical flux in the northwestern Barents Sea under Atlantic Water influence and sea-ice decline","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The northern Barents Sea is a productive Arctic inflow shelf with a seasonal ice cover and as such, a location with an efficient downward export of particulate organic matter through the biological carbon pump. The region is under strong influence of Atlantification and sea-ice decline, resulting in a longer open water and summer period. In order to understand how these processes influence the biological carbon pump, it is important to identify the seasonal and spatial dynamics of downward vertical flux of particulate organic matter. In 2019 and 2021, short-term sediment traps were deployed between 30 and 200 m depth along a latitudinal transect in the northwestern Barents Sea during March, May, August and December. Vertical flux of particulate organic carbon, δ13C and δ15N values, Chl-a, protists and fecal pellets were assessed. We identified a clear seasonal pattern, with highest vertical flux in May and August (178 ± 202 and 159 ± 79 mg C m−2 d−1, respectively). Fluxes in December and March were < 45 mg C m−2 d−1. May was characterized by diatom- and Chl a-rich fluxes and high spatial variability, while fluxes in August had a higher contribution of fecal pellets and small flagellates, and were spatially more homogenous. Standing stocks of suspended particulate organic matter were highest in August, suggesting a more efficient retention system in late summer. The strong latitudinal sea-ice gradient and the influence of Atlantic Water probably led to the high spatial variability of vertical flux in spring, due to their influence on primary productivity. We conclude that the efficiency of the biological carbon pump in a prolonged open-water period depends on the reworking of small, slow sinking material into efficiently sinking fecal pellets or aggregates, and the occurrence of mixing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","5e709489878c28a0473bf359"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"219","pagesFromTo":"103132","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65817a40409707482c24a367","65817a40409707482c24a368","65817a40409707482c24a369","65817a40409707482c24a36a","65817a40409707482c24a36b","5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","65817a40409707482c24a36c","65817a40409707482c24a36d","5e709489878c28a0473bf359","65817a40409707482c24a36e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"4bc3bbad-0ed4-4dfe-8f62-93517ff00731"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65817a40409707482c24a366","year":"2023","volume":"219","documentHash":"8effe1a0-7a21-41e5-a632-7a4ae52006f2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Carbon export","Polar Front","Marginal ice zone (MIZ)","Seasonal ice zone (SIZ)","Seasonality","Attenuation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059217696"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280b02","name":"Yensi","lastName":"Flores Bueso","documentHash":"c7aec212-bdfa-428f-9260-068f30dd7e05"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280b01","name":"Velia","lastName":"Siciliano","documentHash":"5c2aa58b-268d-48e8-92d2-417e1ee49e23"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280b00","name":"Myrtani","lastName":"Pieri","documentHash":"b33c19e6-9214-44c6-827c-d17127d3ecfd"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280aff","name":"Stanislav","lastName":"Rybtsov","documentHash":"1b325065-9a21-406f-bd32-3d90c605c7e3"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280afe","name":"Pierre-Marie","lastName":"Allard","documentHash":"ae3c83d0-68d1-493d-910d-460fb42996ab"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280afd","name":"Rigers","lastName":"Bakiu","documentHash":"5891e6c7-0672-468a-94bf-4eefa74d9689"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280afc","name":"Uttam","lastName":"Shrestha","documentHash":"50e82a6e-db9e-4fd9-8ecc-7e02af98b9ad"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280afb","name":"Milica","lastName":"Pešić","documentHash":"f56f5d9a-dcd2-41fe-ac70-2448a072f234"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280afa","name":"Yusuf","lastName":"Baran","documentHash":"75ce033f-965a-4adf-aeb6-62e45d30e314"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280af9","name":"Thomas Edison","lastName":"dela Cruz","documentHash":"99dedffc-0756-4561-876f-ddc3644e9330"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280af8","name":"Lahcen","lastName":"El-Youssf","documentHash":"a6fa1435-2875-4b5a-8936-cae97eea766e"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280af7","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Wahajuddin","documentHash":"c33b2d07-a563-4626-8e4f-33d3e8976fd7"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280af6","name":"Bartlomiej","lastName":"Kolodziejczyk","documentHash":"a54a3374-4b90-4523-8d2c-7bb137e71976"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280af5","name":"Vidushi","lastName":"Neergheen","documentHash":"631dbec5-f361-48f1-bedc-7313989164e1"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280af4","name":"Isil A.","lastName":"Kurnaz","documentHash":"38cdfed1-e41f-448b-b601-4d3e3d267139"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280af3","name":"Christian","lastName":"Agyare","documentHash":"542ca5eb-49cf-44b4-9fdf-c858761d83ec"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280af2","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Kaganski","documentHash":"9028a603-fae2-46b6-b50c-740cf1f51b7f"},{"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280af1","name":"Yuliya","lastName":"Linhares","documentHash":"ea6f699f-5b27-450d-ad79-8f7b6f4d50f6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6546","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kędra","uuid":"B950AFC0394B7FA11EB92F7D86E8B739E8F8E7879A82119B50736842491ECD0E305659B79802EAF50951C7A11F3F4453F898F95EE3550F2986DCF421440D2324","orcidId":"0000-0002-2223-5850","documentHash":"dc1fef89-bd48-43c8-8077-d9cff1028c90"}],"objectId":"6581934f409707482c280aef","doi":"10.1016/j.molmed.2022.12.002","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1471491422003173?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Biodiversity: the overlooked source of human health","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biodiversity is the measure of the variation of lifeforms in a given ecological system.

While such changes have already been documented in the southern and central Barents Sea, less is known about the degree of Atlantification in the northern Barents Sea and Arctic Ocean. In this seasonal study, we identified the mesozooplankton biodiversity, abundance and biomass in the Northern Barents Sea along a transect with seven stations stretching from the central Barents Sea (76°N) across the shelf break and into the Arctic Ocean (82°N) in August and December 2019, and March, May and July 2021. The broad range of mesozooplankton taxa and sizes were collected by conducting duplicate depth-stratified tows using alternate nets of mesh-sizes 64 µm and 180 µm. The majority of zooplankton taxa were ubiquitous in the study area, but the abundances and life stages varied depending on the season, region and the dominant water mass. We identified three distinct biogeographical regions with different zooplankton diversity and seasonal dynamics; (i) south of the Polar Front, (ii) northern Barents Sea shelf, and (iii) shelf slope and Arctic Ocean. During summer, high abundances of Atlantic/boreal and cosmopolitan zooplankton, mainly Calanus finmarchicus, Metridia longa, Oithona similis and Microsetella norvegica were found just south of the Polar Front in the central Barents Sea. On the shelf, Arctic species, such as Calanus glacialis, Pseudocalanus spp., and Limacina helicina dominated year-round with relatively high and stable biomass. At the northernmost stations, peaks of C. finmarchicus and Oncaeidae (Triconia borealis and Oncaea spp.) occurred in winter, combined with bathypelagic species such as Paraeuchaeta spp., Scaphocalanus brevicornis, Spinocalanus spp., Gaetanus brevispinus and Heterorhabdus norvegicus. Hence, when comparing the mesozooplankton communities at the different locations and seasons, four distinct communities were identified: shelf winter, shelf spring, shelf summer, and Arctic Ocean. Stronger advection and increased northward expansion of Atlantic zooplankton species are anticipated in the future, which could impact the diversity of the more endemic and energy-richer Arctic zooplankton communities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej

and perspectives: Land–ocean connectivity through groundwater","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For millennia, humans have gravitated towards coastlines for their resource potential and as geopolitical centres for global trade. A basic requirement ensuring water security for coastal communities relies on a delicate balance between the supply and demand of potable water. The interaction between freshwater and saltwater in coastal settings is, therefore, complicated by both natural and human-driven environmental changes at the land–sea interface. In particular, ongoing sea-level rise, warming and deoxygenation might exacerbate such perturbations. In this context, an improved understanding of the nature and variability of groundwater fluxes across the land–sea continuum is timely yet remains out of reach. The flow of terrestrial groundwater across the coastal transition zone and the extent of freshened groundwater below the present-day seafloor are receiving increased attention in marine and coastal sciences because they likely represent a significant yet highly uncertain component of (bio)geochemical budgets and because of the emerging interest in the potential use of offshore freshened groundwater as a resource. At the same time, “reverse” groundwater flux from offshore to onshore is of prevalent socio-economic interest, as terrestrial groundwater resources are continuously pressured by over-pumping and seawater intrusion in many coastal regions worldwide. An accurate assessment of the land–ocean connectivity through groundwater and its potential responses to future anthropogenic activities and climate change will require a multidisciplinary approach combining the expertise of geophysicists, hydrogeologists, (bio)geochemists and modellers. Such joint activities will lay the scientific basis for better understanding the role of groundwater in societally relevant issues such as climate change, pollution and the environmental status of the coastal oceans within the framework of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Here, we present our perspectives on future research directions to better understand land–ocean connectivity through groundwater, including the spatial distributions of the essential hydrogeological parameters, highlighting technical and scientific developments and briefly discussing the societal relevance of that connectivity in rapidly changing coastal oceans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"647-662","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6582cc0d40970751d8f11950","6582cc0d40970751d8f11951","6582cc0d40970751d8f11952","6582cc0d40970751d8f11953","6582cc0d40970751d8f11954","6582cc0d40970751d8f11955","6582cc0d40970751d8f11956","6582cc0d40970751d8f11957","6582cc0d40970751d8f11958","6582cc0d40970751d8f11959","6582cc0d40970751d8f1195a","6582cc0d40970751d8f1195b","6582cc0d40970751d8f1195c","6582cc0d40970751d8f1195d","6582cc0d40970751d8f1195e","6582cc0d40970751d8f1195f","6582cc0d40970751d8f11960","6582cc0d40970751d8f11961","6582cc0d40970751d8f11962","6582cc0d40970751d8f11963","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","6582cc0d40970751d8f11964","6582cc0d40970751d8f11965","6582cc0d40970751d8f11966","6582cc0d40970751d8f11967"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477336","mniswId":"2417","title":"Biogeosciences","issn":"1726-4189","websiteLink":"www.biogeosciences.net/12/6493/2015/","documentHash":"9312d442-03bc-4ac9-b1b5-5323c52b58fc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64770af04097071bcb570c5f","year":"2023","volume":"20","number":"3","documentHash":"3cd2178a-cfc9-4597-b87b-9ab19e676dac"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059221615"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec6311","name":"Rebecca","lastName":"Woodgate","documentHash":"b9fcfa3a-1231-4193-a347-8476fa87b268"},{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec6310","name":"Gunnar","lastName":"Spreen","documentHash":"9caffbfe-b21a-4f4e-88b0-3124b85a8691"},{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec630f","name":"Øystein","lastName":"Skagseth","documentHash":"57e01b79-759b-493b-ac72-d6fc73909ed1"},{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec630e","name":"Christine","lastName":"Provost","documentHash":"8fbb92c5-da9e-4379-9084-cd9c94330409"},{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec630d","name":"Igor V.","lastName":"Polyakov","documentHash":"0589498e-ffb9-4a3c-a480-658058f722bb"},{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec630c","name":"Paul G.","lastName":"Myers","documentHash":"427798c0-e52e-42b5-b2ab-370bf9655d60"},{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec630b","name":"Craig M.","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"ddb06d0a-bf62-41e6-a466-b8af24686b61"},{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec630a","name":"Michael","lastName":"Karcher","documentHash":"05ca166c-e020-4d40-9a21-2647c1e59ccb"},{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec6309","name":"Thomas W.

We reviewed past studies on Arctic–Subarctic ocean linkages and examined their changes and driving mechanisms. Our review highlights that radical changes occurred in the inflows and outflows of the Arctic Ocean during the 2010s. Specifically, the Pacific inflow temperature in the Bering Strait and Atlantic inflow temperature in the Fram Strait hit record highs, while the Pacific inflow salinity in the Bering Strait and Arctic outflow salinity in the Davis and Fram straits hit record lows. Both the ocean heat convergence from lower latitudes to the Arctic and the hydrological cycle connecting the Arctic with Subarctic seas were stronger in 2000–2020 than in 1980–2000. CMIP6 models project a continuing increase in poleward ocean heat convergence in the 21st century, mainly due to warming of inflow waters. They also predict an increase in freshwater input to the Arctic Ocean, with the largest increase in freshwater export expected to occur in the Fram Strait due to both increased ocean volume export and decreased salinity. Fram Strait sea ice volume export hit a record low in the 2010s and is projected to continue to decrease along with Arctic sea ice decline. We quantitatively attribute the variability of the volume, heat, and freshwater transports in the Arctic gateways to forcing within and outside the Arctic based on dedicated numerical simulations and emphasize the importance of both origins in driving the variability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a653c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658bf8514097070a21ec6304","658bf8514097070a21ec6305","658bf8514097070a21ec6306","5e709347878c28a0473a653c","658bf8514097070a21ec6307","658bf8514097070a21ec6308","658bf8514097070a21ec6309","658bf8514097070a21ec630a","658bf8514097070a21ec630b","658bf8514097070a21ec630c","658bf8514097070a21ec630d","658bf8514097070a21ec630e","658bf8514097070a21ec630f","658bf8514097070a21ec6310","658bf8514097070a21ec6311"]},"journal":{"objectId":"658bf8514097070a21ec6303","title":"Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research","eissn":"2771-0378","websiteLink":"https://spj.science.org/page/olar/about","documentHash":"56691235-ac51-4bdc-8600-4ab1a5ec4655"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059234898"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709467878c28a0473bc51c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Szubska","uuid":"062ACC65E87986B93D5605269122BB49784820812CDDBC9682B3AD8850AE7C63C099C26BB85C910D0F1CA045FE42E8903B4BE2127DCB23692505772D27825003","orcidId":"0000-0003-0716-5177","documentHash":"3ec85d79-d997-487f-a44a-80852d221148"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a653d","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Bełdowski","uuid":"6324C413899A7D55052C03674F85929919743CC2BC68B3E5B4AAA45F79E47792E7A3EC3C7CC1F75C0C115EC7B074EE3974D7F11A989D51502B88F15260A2C634","orcidId":"0000-0002-2891-1901","documentHash":"2d9f6169-3657-4886-b7c4-74b2ba5045de"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-04","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"658be36f4097070a21eb3a75","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2022.12.002","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0078323422001087?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Spatial distribution of arsenic in surface sediments of the southern Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Arsenic is a ubiquitous chemical element, occurring naturally worldwide. Yet due to its global cycle, its concentrations in the marine environment are manifold higher than the terrestrial background and may pose harm to biota. This is especially relevant for the Baltic Sea, which is very susceptible to any kind of pollution. Arsenic transported to the sea is adsorbed on iron oxides or precipitating as flocculating particulates and finally bounded in sediments. Therefore, despite the contemporary emission cuts, the existing pollution remains or constantly circulates in marine habitats. The purpose of the research was to recognize the spatial distribution of arsenic in the surface sediments of the southern parts of the Baltic Sea. The number of 483 samples allowed us to prepare reliable interpolation of arsenic contents in surface sediments. Although arsenic concentrations in the Baltic Sea can be considered low, in particular areas the levels are significantly higher. The observed arsenic concentrations distribution pattern could be mostly explained by natural transportation and accumulation bottom-type distribution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

atmosphere; an accurate quantification of their absorption coefficient is mandatory. However, standard reference instruments (CAPS, MAAP, PAX, PTAAM) are not always available at each measuring site around the world.\n\nBy integrating all previous published studies concerning the Aethalometers, the AE33 filter loading parameter, provided by the dual-spot algorithm, were used to determine the multiple scattering enhancement factor from the Aethalometer itself (hereinafter CAE) on an yearly and a monthly basis. The method was developed in Milan, where Aethalometer measurements were compared with MAAP data; the comparison showed a good agreement in terms of equivalent black carbon (R2 = 0.93; slope = 1.02 and a negligible intercept = 0.12 μg m−3) leading to a yearly experimental multiple scattering enhancement factor of 2.51 ± 0.04 (hereinafter CMAAP). On a yearly time base the CAE values obtained using the new approach was 2.52 ± 0.01, corresponding to the experimental one (CMAAP). Considering the seasonal behavior, higher experimental CMAAP and computed CAE values were found in summer (2.83 ± 0.12) whereas, the lower ones in winter/early-spring (2.37 ± 0.03), in agreement with the single scattering albedo behavior in the Po Valley.\n\nOverall, the agreement between the experimental CMAAP and CAE showed a root mean squared error (RMSE) of just 0.038 on the CMAAP prediction, characterized by a slope close to 1 (1.001 ± 0.178), a negligible intercept (−0.002 ± 0.455) and a high degree of correlation (R2 = 0.955). From an environmental point of view, the application of a dynamic (space/time) determination of CAE increases the accuracy of the aerosol heating rate (compared to applying a fixed C value) up to 16 % solely in Milan, and to 114 % when applied in the Arctic at 80°N."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"917","pagesFromTo":"170221","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65c0d342409707280ba2d95f","65c0d342409707280ba2d960","65c0d342409707280ba2d961","65c0d342409707280ba2d962","65c0d342409707280ba2d963","65c0d342409707280ba2d964","65c0d342409707280ba2d965","65c0d342409707280ba2d966","65c0d342409707280ba2d967","65c0d342409707280ba2d968","65c0d342409707280ba2d969","65c0d342409707280ba2d96a","65c0d342409707280ba2d96b","5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","65c0d342409707280ba2d96c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0048-9697","documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c0d342409707280ba2d95e","year":"2024","volume":"917","documentHash":"a53e97ab-99c9-4f82-8f37-0fea9a477b79"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aethalometer","C factor","Loading parameter","MAAP","Heating rate","Po Valley","Arctic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059337775"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc8b98c085dcb7999c2eb6f","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Koroza","uuid":"D1E99AC325D97653C57895BAE8F854A3D3ED64CA973EA91155E56DC3D18D761E78BF17A9FBDECD0FB37F57B5E167B3306B6B35CC5BEE59B91DBE9FC4F66FD939","documentHash":"37d18356-bf16-4e38-99fb-fc024947e667"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6560","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Piwowarczyk","uuid":"599ED9A0406EA5EEAAE1F69E150C0EF3257B49B64FDC56E0F928FAB92909B8D8B19E5554952899242AF0296D865A11A5423C0A5694609848373A620AE85ED069","orcidId":"0000-0001-6864-5073","documentHash":"b4318cba-782a-4a0c-a814-c0839209fa46"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651c","name":"TYMON","lastName":"ZIELIŃSKI","uuid":"C324D30030FFB1D821F13CA4C438B654B82F5050D3298D1A50BB41185EF70CD31FD4DA77DE03586D1C0F5FC8FC0F39ECDC58D1956839D195025A90DA5E2BE1BE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4712-8899","documentHash":"f0c26ff7-1742-409b-aa86-c0253dfa2a66"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65c0a6c0409707280b9dd258","doi":"10.24425/jwld.2023.147246","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/129992/2023-04-JWLD-25.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Coastal zone, key area for adaptation to sea level rise.

Isotopically, evaporation does not impact recharged water significantly. However, shallow aquifers are slightly enriched than deep aquifers of the study area. The estimated recharge was 20.17% and 22.52% of annual rainfall based on the CMB and δ18O values, respectively. The recharge mainly occurs during the wet season and is influenced mostly by the amount of rain. Aquifers clustered in distinct groups based on their isotopic signatures and hydrochemical results.

The Fish Module utilizes data from the EcoFish ecohydrodynamic model and then uses fuzzy logic and fish preference data to calculate the Habitat Suitability Index (HSI). Data on fish preference were determined based on 587 expeditions during which physicochemical parameters of the sea were recorded. Our analysis determined threshold HSI values below which successful catches are unlikely for sprat, herring, and cod, confirming the system's effectiveness in identifying locations with favorable environmental conditions for these species. Fishermen are advised to select routes with specific HSI thresholds to achieve greater efficiency in fishing. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that fishing durations do not necessarily correlate with higher catches, emphasizing the importance of selecting suitable routes based on favorable environmental conditions for fish habitat. We expect the Fish Module to be the most demanded product of the FindFISH project."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654f","5e709347878c28a0473a6519"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"153","pagesFromTo":"111302","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a654f","5e709347878c28a0473a6519"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff3dcad49b31ccec0dd7c","title":"Applied Soft Computing","issn":"1568-4946","eissn":"1872-9681","documentHash":"01aef941-bb62-4ee7-a900-da898359fcd0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d5b26b4097076bd54b09ef","year":"2024","volume":"153","documentHash":"cf538e55-74d8-4bcd-b33d-f3fdbbfd292f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059392869"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65cca6364097073ccbc797ae","name":"Martin","lastName":"Sørensen","documentHash":"feb9ddcd-3b54-486d-acc9-37d9e7187ee8"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"89E34998A7815703314F14609081D0B42B721BC6BC02334A524F1A72E99979BE1D2892A3F7AD68FC281490897050CAC6FC5A6472BC066A2DFADD377EF7948831","orcidId":"0000-0002-8175-575X","documentHash":"60624fd9-0ebc-49d7-8f66-5b468fb82647"}],"objectId":"65cca6364097073ccbc797ad","doi":"10.1080/03014223.2024.2308020","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A new deep-sea Cristaphyes (Kinorhyncha: Allomalorhagida: Pycnophyidae) from the continental rise of South Island, New Zealand","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A new kinorhynch species, Cristaphyes microtubuliferus sp. nov., is described from the continental rise of South Island, New Zealand. The new species is recognised by the presence of very poorly developed lateral terminal spines, combined with its considerable trunk length, which can exceed 1 mm. In addition, the new species is characterised by morphologically dimorphic setae, i.e. the regular long and slender setae found in most pycnophyid species, and much shorter and more rigid ‘minute setae’. Besides the new species, the presence of two additional undescribed Cristaphyes species is reported. The material is insufficient to support formal species descriptions for the latter two, but short diagnoses are provided for the species. The description of Cristaphyes microtubuliferus sp. nov. brings the total number of described and identified kinorhynch species in New Zealand up to 19.

These measurements were taken during commercial pelagic fishing for herring (Clupea harengus) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus). These species are currently the main target of commercial fishing in the Baltic Sea. Research was carried out throughout the years 2018–2022 in the south-eastern Baltic Sea, mainly in the Gdańsk Deep, mostly during the daytime. The main factor that influenced both, fishing strategy and the increase in catch per unit effort throughout each year, was temperature. Regardless of the season, the most frequent temperature measured was around 5.8°C during fishing, and 5°C in the most abundant winter season. This is the value occurring within the boundaries of the formation of the thermocline and the hypolimnion layer in the Baltic Sea. The formed shoals of fish moved dynamically with this layer in the daytime and occurred throughout the year at various depths in a range of up to 65.7 m. A stronger reaction to temperature changes was also observed for sprat, which is the most exploited fish in the Baltic Sea. This species was observed to be more numerous in the deeper layers of the water column and at lower temperatures than herring. In the winter, shoals of fish were observed at the level of the halocline, which may be strongly related to the presence of a preferred optimal food base in this season."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

Here, we present the first edition of a global database (CoastDOM v1; available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.964012, Lønborg et al., 2023) compiling previously published and unpublished measurements of DOC, DON, and DOP in coastal waters. These data are complemented by hydrographic data such as temperature and salinity and, to the extent possible, other biogeochemical variables (e.g. chlorophyll a, inorganic nutrients) and the inorganic carbon system (e.g. dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity). Overall, CoastDOM v1 includes observations of concentrations from all continents. However, most data were collected in the Northern Hemisphere, with a clear gap in DOM measurements from the Southern Hemisphere. The data included were collected from 1978 to 2022 and consist of 62 338 data points for DOC, 20 356 for DON, and 13 533 for DOP. The number of measurements decreases progressively in the sequence DOC > DON > DOP, reflecting both differences in the maturity of the analytical methods and the greater focus on carbon cycling by the aquatic science community. The global database shows that the average DOC concentration in coastal waters (average ± standard deviation (SD): 182±314 µmol C L−1; median: 103 µmol C L−1) is 13-fold higher than the average coastal DON concentration (13.6±30.4 µmol N L−1; median: 8.0 µmol N L−1), which is itself 39-fold higher than the average coastal DOP concentration (0.34±1.11 µmol P L−1; median: 0.18 µmol P L−1). This dataset will be useful for identifying global spatial and temporal patterns in DOM and will help facilitate the reuse of DOC, DON, and DOP data in studies aimed at better characterizing local biogeochemical processes; closing nutrient budgets; estimating carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous pools; and establishing a baseline for modelling future changes in coastal waters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

spray emissions from the Baltic Sea: comparison of aerosol eddy covariance fluxes and chamber-simulated sea spray emissions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To compare in situ and laboratory estimates of sea spray aerosol (SSA) production fluxes, we conducted two research campaigns in the vicinity of an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower on the island of Östergarnsholm in the Baltic Sea during May and August 2021. To accomplish this, we performed EC flux measurements for particles with diameters between 0.25 and 2.5 µm simultaneously with laboratory measurements using a plunging jet sea spray simulation chamber containing local seawater sampled close to the footprint of the flux tower. We observed a log-linear relationship between wind speed and EC-derived SSA emission fluxes, a power-law relationship between significant wave height and EC-derived SSA emission fluxes, and a linear relationship between wave Reynolds number and EC-derived SSA emission fluxes, all of which are consistent with earlier studies. Although we observed a weak negative relationship between particle production in the sea spray simulation chamber and seawater chlorophyll-α concentration and a weak positive relationship with the concentration of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in seawater, we did not observe any significant impact of dissolved oxygen on particle production in the chamber.\n\nTo obtain an estimate of the size-resolved emission spectrum for particles with dry diameters between 0.015 and 10 µm, we combined the estimates of SSA particle production fluxes obtained using the EC measurements and the chamber measurements in three different ways: (1) using the traditional continuous whitecap method, (2) using air entrainment measurements, and (3) simply scaling the chamber data to the EC fluxes. In doing so, we observed that the magnitude of the EC-derived emission fluxes compared relatively well to the magnitude of the fluxes obtained using the chamber air entrainment method as well as the previous flux measurements of Nilsson et al. (2021) and the parameterizations of Mårtensson et al. (2003) and Salter et al. (2015). As a result of these measurements, we have derived a wind-speed-dependent and wave-state-dependent SSA parameterization for particles with dry diameters between 0.015 and 10 µm for low-salinity waters such as the Baltic Sea, thus providing a more accurate estimation of SSA production fluxes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1895-1918","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eef67440970749973fa609","65eef67440970749973fa60a","5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","65eef67440970749973fa60b","65eef67440970749973fa60c","65eef67440970749973fa60d","65eef67440970749973fa60e","65eef67440970749973fa60f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724d","mniswId":"2026","title":"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","issn":"1680-7316","eissn":"1680-7324","documentHash":"767f0fa0-a1ba-4887-b209-a40652902fe4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eef67440970749973fa608","year":"2024","volume":"24","number":"3","documentHash":"b67fa108-4a8b-433b-b64a-0c44a662e054"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059488221"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"660284344097071d5ba0e8dd","name":"Chang","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"005aa5b5-0192-4a04-bd1b-c09ccbb1c6ae"},{"objectId":"660284344097071d5ba0e8dc","name":"Jingling","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"54f82fb2-5880-4d96-8c6e-88e66ccc3524"},{"objectId":"660284344097071d5ba0e8db","name":"Bin","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"880590c1-f9f8-468c-b572-aba68866fb40"},{"objectId":"660284344097071d5ba0e8da","name":"Yang","lastName":"Ni","documentHash":"3661365c-3089-4fdb-b896-e4fd73f707c9"},{"objectId":"660284344097071d5ba0e8d9","name":"Haimei","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"551d123f-ef5e-4e81-a178-88d7e33b5543"},{"objectId":"660284344097071d5ba0e8d8","name":"Xinyi","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"9eb28ef3-7a33-4021-a234-5fda0f53c1a3"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6529","name":"Artur","lastName":"Burzyński","uuid":"43AAABE43BBCAE37243B45A30414FA9EDDD7130BE28712FB77B49CB2BC251D18241BEAA42B0C066A1262448D4A375CC8A0590D41EBD5151C61805AB7EAD58A4D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0185-197X","documentHash":"0555d7bd-6f83-414a-ac09-21d18398977f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"660284344097071d5ba0e8d6","doi":"10.1111/1755-0998.13952","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1755-0998.13952","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Plant mitochondrial genome map (PMGmap): A software tool for the comprehensive visualization of coding, noncoding and genome features of plant mitochondrial genomes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tools for visualizing genomes are essential for investigating genomic features and their interactions. Currently, tools designed originally for animal mitogenomes and plant plastomes are used to visualize the mitogens of plants but cannot accurately display features specific to plant mitogenomes, such as nonlinear exon arrangement for genes, the prevalence of functional noncoding features and complex chromosomal architecture. To address these problems, a software package, plant mitochondrial genome map (PMGmap), was developed using the Python programming language. PMGmap can draw genes at exon levels; draw cis- and trans-splicing gene maps, noncoding features and repetitive sequences; and scale genic regions by using the scaling of the genic regions on the mitogenome (SAGM) algorithm. It can also draw multiple chromosomes simultaneously. Compared with other state-of-the-art tools, PMGmap showed better performance in visualizing 405 plant mitogenomes, showing potential as an invaluable tool for plant mitogenome research. The web and container versions and the source code of PMGmap can be accessed through the following link: http://www.1kmpg.cn/pmgmap."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6529"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"e13952","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["660284344097071d5ba0e8d8","660284344097071d5ba0e8d9","660284344097071d5ba0e8da","660284344097071d5ba0e8db","660284344097071d5ba0e8dc","5e709347878c28a0473a6529","660284344097071d5ba0e8dd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478eed","mniswId":"14545","title":"Molecular Ecology Resources","issn":"1755-098X","eissn":"1755-0998","documentHash":"899c8774-8cb0-4415-8f3f-735539b56a73"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"660284344097071d5ba0e8d7","year":"2024","documentHash":"fb192685-6a1b-44f0-9294-e82dfe405d35"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cis-splicing gene","plant mitochondrial genome","recombination-associated repetitive sequence","RNA-editing site","trans-splicing gene"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059508769"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf359","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tatarek","uuid":"7EE1E47D321F50DCA10E3EE8AE6B69ADAD102DD6F260B15C5FAFB4CDB18ADAB7DB98698EDA96C3F6694FEBFAE6E998A04B022F2EE8AF42B5FAA1B158F078B131","orcidId":"0000-0003-1467-6362","documentHash":"70339abc-aa35-4e2b-ab8b-296f2bba7dce"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655c","name":"Józef","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"E8901DD6BAD74E4F0A531BC69DC86134B02AC9BDAB17361AAFA79F2ED26ABBC473DFEDC614DF70B146B917A0E212BFD4740299FB5AB0C805A789195BA88BE5E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2344-0047","documentHash":"6a141822-0a06-4fc9-83c5-d08f585c8615"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-03-12","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"660d11cc409707034651e14b","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2024.02.004","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0078323424000150?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Apparent return of free-living Fucus vesiculosus to the Polish Baltic waters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The underwater meadows of the Puck Bay, once thriving with eelgrass Zostera marina, bladderwrack Fucus vesiculosus and black carrageen Furcellaria lumbricalis, experienced a decline in water quality during the 1960s and 1970s due to untreated sewage pollution. This, together with commercial exploitation, led to the disappearance of bladderwrack in 1977, with unsuccessful attempts at reintroduction in the early 2000s. In December 2023, a SCUBA survey near Rzucewo revealed a numerous bladderwrack in a benthic free-living form after 46 years of absence. The algae were found between 1.7 and 2.7 m depth, loosely positioned on the seabed, often within Z. marina beds, and with blue mussels Mytilus edulis attached. This reappearance suggests a positive trend in seawater quality and overall state of the Puck Bay, especially when combined with recent recovery of other algae species. The apparent return of bladderwrack could enhance ecosystem functionality, benefiting fish recruitment, grazer and algal biomass.

In this paper, a specific approach to using Argo floats as ‘virtual moorings’ within the conditions of the Baltic Sea is presented. Following a series of successful deployments with standard configurations, it was decided that the settings forcing the float to stay at the bottom between profiles should be tested. This significantly reduced the drift of the float and allowed measurements to be made in a limited water area for a longer time. The data obtained from Argo floats used as virtual mooring can be a valuable source for monitoring and analysing the hydrology of individual basins of the Baltic Sea. The results show that the temporal and spatial variability of the observed fields of temperature, salinity, and other properties of seawater is very high. More data are needed to correctly determine the mean properties of the basins and their temporal variability. Therefore, Argo floats can be a source of efficient and inexpensive hydrographic data for shallow seas such as the Baltic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655a","5e709347878c28a0473a6525","5e709467878c28a0473bc51a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"99-110","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709467878c28a0473bc51a","5e709347878c28a0473a6525","5e709347878c28a0473a655a","660d0db7409707034651c7fa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c5ee9c4097077130326026","year":"2024","documentHash":"b4974e0a-540a-4aab-a369-1431857015e1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Argo floats","Virtual mooring","Baltic Sea","Temperature","Salinity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059529495"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"660d0bb2409707034651c067","name":"Malgorzata","lastName":"Stramska","documentHash":"8a701609-9275-43b3-abd5-5487abbac2d5"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6542","name":"Jaromir","lastName":"Jakacki","uuid":"30C04EE488139DF403DDBF2146E56B2ECF0A32F46A26BA504331D7F2A88CF495FE61B45FF24A1D986A449AD284F97959E095ECF35F68892BADC7B0AA7A85B2B7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7376-3090","documentHash":"b52ce02a-ad14-4790-b8df-705ba3fa0705"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-03-12","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"660d0bb2409707034651c066","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2024.02.003","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0078323424000162?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Variability of chlorophyll a concentration in surface waters of the open Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In situ, satellite and reanalysis data from numerical models were used to study the characteristic features of Chl variability in the Baltic Sea. The analysis is focused on the years 2003–2020 when regular observations of ocean color with the MODIS AQUA are available. In the Baltic Sea, there is a pronounced annual cycle in physical conditions in the water column, driven by seasonal cycles in atmospheric forcing. The seasonal cycle of Chl concentration does not conform to the picture known from classical models, with low phytoplankton concentration when nutrients are low. In contrast, in the Baltic Sea, the concentration of Chl is high even during the summer months when nutrients are depleted. This can be explained by a continuous supply of nutrients by runoff from land, as well as by a significant contribution to primary production by phytoplankton able to survive in environment poor in dissolved nutrients.

The concentrations of the total mass of particles (TSM) in suspended sediment as well as particular organic matter (POM) and particular inorganic matter mass (PIM) together with mineralogical composition and particular size distribution (PSD) were determined.\nIn this study, we investigated the PSD properties and variability in the front of different tidewater glaciers based, laser diffractometer measurements (LISST-100x), and XRD – techniques to obtain the mineralogical composition of the particles. The sampled sites are under the strong influence of freshwater discharge from the glacier. At each station, inorganic particulate matter contributed up to 98% to total suspended matter with the particle concentration of the particle reaches up to 111 mg/l with mean surface PSD slopes ranging from 3.24 to 3.85.

Parameters of breaking waves influence bubble entrainment depth and associated noise, which is why they differ in semi-enclosed sea compared to open waters. While the established noise-wind speed relationship holds in oceanic conditions, it differs in land-constrained basins like the Baltic Sea. To explore noise level, bubble entrainment depth and wind speed relationships, we conducted noise and sub-surface bubble measurements, coupled with wind observations, in the selected area of the Baltic Sea during two consecutive summers. A novel method was employed to estimate bubble entrainment depth under conditions of strong backscatter. Model data of wave field parameters were employed to assess their influence on noise level and bubble entrainment depth. Results suggest stronger connections between noise level and wind speed, as well as wave height, compared to wave age and wind sea steepness. The same patterns hold true for the correlation between bubble entrainment depth and both wind speed and wave field parameters. The parameterized noise level-wind speed relationship differs from that obtained for oceanic conditions and also varies across measurement periods.

Sampling campaigns took place in Puck Bay and the Gulf of Gdańsk, southern Baltic Sea encompassing years between 2009 and 2021. The methodological approach combined geophysical characterization of the surface sediments with detailed spatial and temporal (isotope) biogeochemical investigations of pore and surface waters, and was supported by nearshore groundwater and river surveys. Acoustic investigations identified areas of disturbance that may indicate zones of preferential SGD release. The composition of porewater and the differences in the bay's surface waters disclosed SGD as common phenomenon in the study area. Regional SGD was estimated through a radium mass balance. Local estimation of SGD, based on porewater profiles, revealed highest SGD fluxes at the sandy shoreline, but relatively low elemental fluxes. Though SGD was low at the muddy sites corresponding elemental fluxes of nutrients and dissolved carbon exceeded those determined at the sandy sites due to intense diagenesis in the top sediments. SGD appears to be sourced from different freshwater endmembers; however, diagenesis in surface sediments substantially modified the composition of the mixed solutions that are finally discharged to coastal waters. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the SGD dynamics in the region by a multi-approach and emphasizes the need to understand the processes occurring at the sediment-water interface when estimating SGD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6541","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","5e70945b878c28a0473bb3af"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"111-138","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["661cfe8a40970734e772a684","661cfe8a40970734e772a685","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","5e709347878c28a0473a6541","661cfe8a40970734e772a686","661cfe8a40970734e772a687","661cfe8a40970734e772a688","661cfe8a40970734e772a689","661cfe8a40970734e772a68a","5e70945b878c28a0473bb3af","661cfe8a40970734e772a68b","661cfe8a40970734e772a68c","661cfe8a40970734e772a68d","661cfe8a40970734e772a68e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"661cfe8a40970734e772a683","year":"2024","volume":"66","number":"1","documentHash":"8f2490e1-9549-4109-89fa-542a1955f045"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Stable isotopes","Radium isotopes","Acoustic survey","Diagenesis Gulf of Gdańsk","Puck Bay"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059550453"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6517","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Schlichtholz","uuid":"C141F0A6D2D32280DABECED9644903172747D5EAA123953D2EBD52C237F21FF322418856504214476F44423788567EE678760C49DE4F40C61EDDF9FDC40368B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9774-5372","documentHash":"b89229c2-904e-4408-b69c-5bf34b5d8d0c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6639d0314097077c1aa156e1","doi":"10.1007/s00382-023-07091-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00382-023-07091-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Winter “warm Arctic-cold Eurasia” pattern and its statistical linkages to oceanic precursors during the era of satellite observations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A striking recurrent feature of winter climate variability is the “warm Arctic-cold Eurasia” (WACE) pattern of opposite sign\nanomalies of surface air temperature (SAT) in the Barents Sea region and midlatitude Eurasia. Its origins and mechanisms are hotly debated, and its predictability remains unknown. This study investigates statistical relationships of the winter WACE dipole with concurrent anomalies of atmospheric circulation and oceanic precursors during the era of satellite observations. The results reveal a high potential for seasonal predictability of not only the WACE dipole but also several related indicators of winter climate variability, including the Arctic and Eurasian SAT anomalies. During subperiods of extreme covariability between the Arctic and Eurasian SATs around the early 1980s and late 2000s, most of the WACE variability is explained by ocean temperature and surface turbulent heat flux anomalies in the Barents Sea region during the preceding months. Anomalies in summer Atlantic water temperature (AWT) and autumnal sea surface temperature (SST) in this region explain about 70–80% of the variance of the following winter WACE variability during all events of strong Arctic-Eurasian SAT covariability. Analysis of SST variability in the Arctic-North Atlantic region suggests that the winter WACE link to the summer AWT anomalies reflects an atmospheric response to a large-scale surface reemergence of ocean temperature anomalies. However, this linkage had been robust only until the early 2000s. Since then, the winter WACE variability has been strongly related to autumnal SST anomalies in the Barents Sea region and the North Pacific."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6517"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6517"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547767a","mniswId":"3760","title":"CLIMATE DYNAMICS","issn":"0930-7575","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"79c88379-6d62-463a-88a6-26ab7be11ff0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6639d0314097077c1aa156e2","year":"2024","documentHash":"9ddecfcc-cba1-430f-91af-3b9c0f5df940"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Interannual variability","Air temperature anomalies","Barents Sea","Eurasia","Winter WACE pattern","Oceanic predictors"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059585451"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6540","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Sokołowska","uuid":"D6944E39F11647B9CB39D76C875F189E054DB1D541E7D46FDB7EA92C47490CC1DA169945BD5055E6F569553E6911FAF27656D4C1D49251AE978AB14B1DD041C9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6576-8238","documentHash":"3e9be6ee-04ef-4230-84f5-3c624c45153c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a650f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kulczykowska","uuid":"856B07BDA8ABD3060D5000D705193A7D38A1150782FA1BCC8AF1C8253AC8ED7804B7E4E0308C1B5B61504F79D590C22B401EEA1B5757A14951EE90881A585932","orcidId":"0000-0002-3979-9310","documentHash":"e7b053a3-a963-4c82-9964-cd686c8db387"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66389efb4097076e57a5ef9b","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1401537","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1401537/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A new insight into the pigmentation of the three-spined stickleback exposed to oxidative stress: day and night study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The diverse and changing pigmentation of the skin allows fish to adapt to\nenvironmental conditions for survival and communication with conspecifics.\nHowever, various physical and chemical environmental factors, including\npollutants, affect fish coloration.

The analyses were carried out based on a 20-year database of empirical data from 1999 to 2018 obtained using the HPLC method. The proportion of chlorophyll a in the total content of pigments was stable irrespective of the season and region (62% ± 5%). In summer and autumn, a higher total amount of photoprotective carotenoids (about 15–17% in total pigment content) than photosynthetic ones was recorded. The concentrations of marker pigments are related to periodic increases in the corresponding algal classes. The spring bloom dominated by diatoms and dinoflagellates results in 40% of fucoxanthin and 70% of peridinin in relation to their total content throughout all seasons. The highest percentage of chlorophyll b (up to 10% in open waters) and other pigments specific to green algae (neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein) were observed during summer and autumn. The 30% percentage of fucoxanthin confirms the occurrence of diatoms in autumn. The concentrations of groups and individual pigments have been determined as a function of chlorophyll a concentration. The best approximation results were obtained for the seasonal dependence of marker pigments for specific classes of algae.

The research was carried out in Admiralty Bay (AB) in the South Shetland Islands, a wide bay adjacent to twenty marine-terminating glaciers. From December 2018 until February 2023, AB water properties were measured on 136 days. This dataset showed that a maximally two-layered stratification occurs in AB and that glacial water is always the most buoyant water mass. Using the Delft3D Flow, a three-dimensional hydrodynamical model of AB was developed. During tests, the vertical position and initial velocity of glacial discharges have been shown to be insignificant for the overall bay circulation. Fourteen model scenarios have been calculated with an increasing glacial influx added. The AB general circulation pattern consists of two cyclonic cells. Even in scenarios with significant glacial input, water level shifts and circulation are predominantly controlled by the ocean. Glacial freshwater is carried out of AB along its eastern boundary in a surface layer. Freshwater thickness in this outflow current is maximally 0.27-0.35 m. Within the inner AB inlets, significant glacial influx produces buoyancy-driven vertical circulation. Using an approach combining hydrographic and modeling data, a four-year timeseries of glacial influx volumes into AB has been produced. On average, glacial influx in summer is 10 times greater than in spring and winter and 3 times higher than in autumn. The annual glacial influx into AB was estimated at 0.434-0.632 Gt. Overall, the study demonstrated the unique characteristics of the topography and forcings that influence the hydrodynamics of an Antarctic glacial bay."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393766"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1365157","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66602c4c40970740074e3c05","5e70924f878c28a047393766"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66389efb4097076e57a5ef9c","year":"2024","volume":"11","documentHash":"495f74cb-874c-429f-a6f6-dd45c3fddca6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Admiralty Bay","South Shetland Islands","West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP)","numerical modeling","glacial discharge","coastal hydrodynamics","glacial fjord"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059611677"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393766","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Herman","uuid":"44B5293D87B2EFB8CF355798E377F5251631920D04E7A3E09EDA286CBD683C0530A7B5ED2F5BD7717F072D01EA9C58EA8281064069FF24ECECBD141524BB57A2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5112-7165","documentHash":"d2114a83-e13a-4055-b93a-e52ed09a78ec"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6666cc0b40970767cfbb06fb","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1413116","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1413116/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"From apparent attenuation towards physics-based source terms – a perspective on spectral wave modeling in ice-covered seas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Numerical modeling of waves in sea ice covered regions of the oceans is important for many applications, from short-term forecasting and ship route planning up to climate modeling.

RASM is a fully coupled atmosphere–land–ocean–sea ice regional Earth system\nmodel. Nudging to the forcing data is applied to approximately the top half of the atmospheric domain. RASM simulations were also completed with a modification to the atmospheric physics for evaluating changes to the modeling system. The results show that for the top half of the atmosphere, the RASM simulations follow closely to that of the forcing data, regardless of the forcing data. The results for the lower half of the atmosphere, as well as the surface, show a clustering of atmospheric state and surface fluxes based on the modelingsystem.  At all levels of the atmosphere the imprint of the weather from the forcing data is present as indicated in the pattern of the annual means. Biases, in comparison to reanalyses, are evident in the Earth system model forced simulations for the top half of the atmosphere but are not present in the lower atmosphere. This suggests that bias correction is not needed for fully coupled dynamical downscaling simulations. While the RASM simulations tended to go to the same mean state for the lower atmosphere, there are a differences in the variability and changes of weather patterns across the ensemble of simulations. These differences in the weather result in variances in the sea ice and oceanic states."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6531"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1392031","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["667d50a2fdbe830171736c88","667d50a2fdbe830171736c89","667d50a2fdbe830171736c8a","667d50a2fdbe830171736c8b","667d50a2fdbe830171736c8c","5e709347878c28a0473a6531"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1ad","mniswId":"6835","title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","issn":"2296-6463","eissn":"2296-6463","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"feafee17-dd8d-41eb-b9f4-ab129e7a61fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"661ced8d40970734e771b2b8","year":"2024","volume":"12","documentHash":"39ad347d-7348-4a12-b23d-a8cb2f87cd5f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dynamical downscaling","regional earth system model","fully coupled","nudging","Arctic","atmospheric state","sea ice"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059648149"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f1878c28a0473c77d3","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Smajdor","uuid":"79AD06A14681660DA3A8D88FD63DA09FB5F7867FB9460652BDDE67F92D8572807AB88A7F28F49EC4F8BB364E951773A29E00379B34A42B568AE0E24726E9113A","documentHash":"a0ba77b5-46cf-478d-9b73-1a731760a693"},{"objectId":"5e709456878c28a0473babb4","name":"Michał","lastName":"Tomczak","uuid":"40EA0DC3346C8CFAF10A9F2ABBFE0F585A9DE45FB8D9E78C311FB6458ABD28846738305A218A64C4C19A9D016DF54A727762EE640F20DCBAC0A1A5140A3EF586","orcidId":"0000-0003-0437-0255","documentHash":"f1e4c25e-6bba-4d28-951c-962bedcb2ee9"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6524","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Sagan","uuid":"57C5DDEDCC8D71F0F19745E304EFC7113468B679832A0DE6E5A43977F37B36FE73537824810AECF18054AF48268ACA290026096E62E528ADA317E4DC919AE6D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4183-0337","documentHash":"aa1f9f99-b660-4bd8-8114-11a41db1685e"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a5f5","name":"TERESA","lastName":"RADZIEJEWSKA","uuid":"FBFFADF1A87403E791BF8B02B64128E2D2FE4162C0CEDAC6D24CC62437CDB20DC69CEBBF1A1CC52F9FD8DBADD98FFAA467028934E3433D027B52087E55F154F0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4759-1306","documentHash":"2693dbb8-d14a-476b-825c-77e2c5a44abc"}],"objectId":"667052444097073d0018a4b2","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-51865-2_7","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-51865-2_7","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Deep Sea Research Methods to Be Used During the Exploration of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge Polymetallic Sulphide Areas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Deep sea research and monitoring belong to the most expensive and technically challenging marine operations.

As a result of analyses, we focus on 2019, since unusually high values of aerosol optical depth were recorded in several stations around the Baltic. We match the high aerosol levels with an unusually high number of wildfires across Europe in spring and summer, which emitted large quantities of aerosols into the atmosphere that were distributed over vast European areas in part by the wind. We then connect this case with the climate change consequences. Since aerosols influence the radiative budget of the planet by directly affecting the atmospheric radiation budget, it is obvious that human well-being is in danger due to wildfires, as well as from the atmospheric perspective. Climate change will lead to more frequent fires; thus,\nhumans need to develop solutions to decrease the risk of fire outbreaks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a651c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"5633","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a651c","667e65d4fdbe836b51978456","667e65d4fdbe836b51978457"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff33dad49b31ccec0104f","title":"Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"96f827ef-c2c8-4b76-ab17-c7357fffee4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667d0f12fdbe8301716cfeac","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"13","documentHash":"94380690-eb15-4517-94c0-28ec74fceb2c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climate change","anthropogenic impact","wildfire","biomass burning","AOD","Baltic Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059665655"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660cf","name":"Maycira","lastName":"Costa","documentHash":"4f351641-0dea-4a20-9b4f-9afc42548664"},{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660ce","name":"Christian","lastName":"Marchese","documentHash":"a857f047-8243-4f33-a269-e75c05799997"},{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660cd","name":"Hongyan","lastName":"Xi","documentHash":"4f219113-8cf0-490f-b475-dedeba556338"},{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660cc","name":"Astrid","lastName":"Bracher","documentHash":"4a44acb9-d21f-4d76-8654-6f0d5ed40565"},{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660cb","name":"Lisa B.","lastName":"Eisner","documentHash":"630d7b9f-2175-4070-a2bf-97649d84f536"},{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660ca","name":"Perumthuruthil","lastName":"Suseelan Vishnu","documentHash":"ac745510-21c9-421d-a15f-ff7cb8463ee7"},{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660c9","name":"Brian P.V.","lastName":"Hunt","documentHash":"1e624b52-98d8-4412-aee3-85588e30dd4a"},{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660c8","name":"Toru","lastName":"Hirawake","documentHash":"c2546481-0fde-4862-b358-b3ceac6b5148"},{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660c7","name":"M.","lastName":"Angelica Peña","documentHash":"bdade3a7-e818-413d-a752-64512f728369"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993d5","name":"Marta","lastName":"Konik","uuid":"C9EFA09C8E176C789E5FEDF411C2490E92565CB72CBE1EF71C0DF2DE1AC8FCA7CA9972FDA56DD38CD1A76438D0F4D33B04273B7C66203050838BCF543B92B6E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1145-9127","documentHash":"de341dc2-90f3-4b16-96f7-18332a2e9882"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-07-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660c5","doi":"10.1016/j.pocean.2024.103315","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0079661124001216?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Bioregionalization of the subarctic Pacific based on phytoplankton phenology and composition","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The subarctic Pacific is generally perceived as relatively homogeneous since the North Pacific Subpolar Gyre dominates the water circulation in the area.

To this end, satellite GlobColour time series observations and an extensive in situ phytoplankton pigment dataset were used in the analysis. Five bioregions were identified, based on the Self-Organized Mapping technique, using a greater than 20-year satellite data series. The bioregions in the open Pacific waters were dominated by green algae, haptophytes, and pelagophytes and were divided into the areas affected by the North Pacific Transition Zone and beyond. The other bioregions were defined around the Pacific basin margins where the diatom contribution was generally higher, with a particular distinction of waters surrounding the Kuril and the Aleutian Islands. Our bioregion designations allow for future evaluation of the processes controlling the physical and biological dynamics within each bioregion, which has direct implications for foraging conditions available to higher trophic levels, including potential food resource competition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a0473993d5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"228","pagesFromTo":"103315","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a0473993d5","66d96914fdbe832d5eb660c7","66d96914fdbe832d5eb660c8","66d96914fdbe832d5eb660c9","66d96914fdbe832d5eb660ca","66d96914fdbe832d5eb660cb","66d96914fdbe832d5eb660cc","66d96914fdbe832d5eb660cd","66d96914fdbe832d5eb660ce","66d96914fdbe832d5eb660cf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"4bc3bbad-0ed4-4dfe-8f62-93517ff00731"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d96914fdbe832d5eb660c6","year":"2024","volume":"228","documentHash":"48ce06c4-2b2d-4dcb-a428-48dcdcf98a2d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ocean colour","Biogeochemical regions","Phytoplankton phenology","Self-Organized Maps","Subarctic Pacific Ocean"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059759860"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f3c5f2fdbe8326af94750c","name":"T.","lastName":"Merzi","documentHash":"06cba351-7c1f-4d76-b1c7-e9101ac77873"},{"objectId":"66f3c5f2fdbe8326af94750b","name":"L.","lastName":"Apothéloz-Perret-Gentil","documentHash":"fa4773c2-95f4-41a6-bea8-6d87803262f1"},{"objectId":"66f3c5f2fdbe8326af94750a","name":"F.","lastName":"Frontalini","documentHash":"106134c0-3f26-4f8d-a019-6393845ba076"},{"objectId":"66f3c5f2fdbe8326af947509","name":"T.","lastName":"Cordier","documentHash":"cc71b480-6453-4322-ab07-ae339090598e"},{"objectId":"66f3c5f2fdbe8326af947508","name":"K.","lastName":"Cermakova","documentHash":"2cf024d5-a9b3-4b65-bd87-806751f73e38"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"objectId":"66f3c5f2fdbe8326af947506","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173092","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S004896972403239X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Assessing the potential of nematode metabarcoding for benthic monitoring of offshore oil platforms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Environmental DNA metabarcoding is gaining momentum as a time and cost-effective tool for biomonitoring and environmental impact assessment. Yet, its use as a replacement for the conventional marine benthic monitoring based on morphological analysis of macrofauna is still challenging. Here we propose to study the meiofauna, which is much better represented in sediment DNA samples. We focus on nematodes, which are the most numerous and diverse group of meiofauna. Our aim is to assess the potential of nematode metabarcoding to monitor impacts associated with offshore oil platform activities. To achieve this goal, we used nematode-optimized marker (18S V1V2-Nema) and universal eukaryotic marker (18S V9) region to analyse 252 sediment DNA samples collected near three offshore oil platforms in the North Sea. For both markers, we analysed changes in alpha and beta diversity in relation to distance from the platforms and environmental variables. We also defined three impact classes based on selected environmental variables that are associated with oil extraction activities and used random forest classifiers to compare the predictive performance of both datasets. Our results show that alpha- and beta-diversity of nematodes varies with the increasing distance from the platforms. The variables directly related to platform activity, such as Ba and THC, strongly influence the nematode community. The nematode metabarcoding data provide more robust predictive models than eukaryotic data. Furthermore, the nematode community appears more stable in time and space, as illustrated by the overlap of nematode datasets obtained from the same platform three years apart. A significative negative correlation between distance and Shannon diversity also advocates for higher performance of the V1V2-Nema over the V9. Overall, these results suggest that the sensitivity of nematodes is higher compared to the eukaryotic community.

Groundwater-derived nutrients drive coastal water quality, primary production, and eutrophication. We determined how dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) are transformed within subterranean estuaries and estimated submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) nutrient loads compiling > 10,000 groundwater samples from 216 sites worldwide. Nutrients exhibited complex, nonconservative behavior in subterranean estuaries. Fresh groundwater DIN and DIP are usually produced, and DON is consumed during transport. Median total SGD (saline and fresh) fluxes globally were 5.4, 2.6, and 0.18 Tmol yr−1 for DIN, DON, and DIP, respectively. Despite large natural variability, total SGD fluxes likely exceed global riverine nutrient export. Fresh SGD is a small source of new nutrients, but saline SGD is an important source of mostly recycled nutrients. Nutrients exported via SGD via subterranean estuaries are critical to coastal biogeochemistry and a significant nutrient source to the oceans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"411-422","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97703c","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97703d","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97703e","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97703f","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977040","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977041","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977042","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977043","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977044","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977045","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977046","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977047","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977048","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977049","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97704a","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97704b","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97704c","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97704d","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97704e","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97704f","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977050","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977051","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977052","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977053","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977054","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977055","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977056","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977057","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977058","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977059","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97705a","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97705b","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97705c","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97705d","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97705e","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97705f","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977060","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977061","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977062","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977063","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977064","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977065","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977066","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977067","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977068","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977069","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97706a","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97706b","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97706c","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97706d","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97706e","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97706f","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977070","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977071","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977072","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977073","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977074","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977075","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977076","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977077","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977078","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977079","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97707a","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97707b","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97707c","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97707d","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97707e","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97707f","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977080","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977081","66f3f6f4fdbe8326af977082"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed75","mniswId":"27419","title":"Limnology and Oceanography Letters","issn":"2378-2242","eissn":"2378-2242","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"446a891a-e104-4efd-b715-23ff0184de78"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f3f6f4fdbe8326af97703b","year":"2024","volume":"9","number":"4","documentHash":"9bdd54e2-78e5-4931-b6df-1ed654ced3c0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059769579"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f3cb2dfdbe8326af94bfe3","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kucharska","documentHash":"63f54a94-bb00-4513-a819-07deac41a0cc"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Telesiński","uuid":"489C4C47EF921C95D0F87CFB076DC6C5FACC4929FD769C245D474C0500CA9B758985ED1B7EDED36C930624568C2BE3B13EE087C9ACE1A45D7EF7EE4A6418A876","orcidId":"0000-0002-5765-2849","documentHash":"261899e6-0135-4cb7-b067-e1e7e987ab86"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc63c","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Łącka-Wojciechowska","uuid":"513BE42A7BB96A082AF947DB45BCB3F2EE649339900A5CA10FE32D0060C1D79E43F98015792F579A5D61DA6E387056AF1A4DF99520BA392238DE0916A503F463","orcidId":"0000-0001-8976-8806","documentHash":"2b4384f1-b95b-430c-8aa1-7799792b1cf6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6526","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zajączkowski","uuid":"61768C4E190810A84AFC1067320A335E9317C35A01DD9975F8CEB8197E3D86D8F6A9ACECEE6D8E804AE2EBFC8A804CECDF21093A04A3A083FD4F8153BEAB0988","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-7359","documentHash":"aee5a47c-de7d-4323-8adc-7fe11d3cf4f0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66f3cb2dfdbe8326af94bfe2","doi":"10.1177/09596836241247305","publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/09596836241247305","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A late response of the sea-ice cover to Neoglacial cooling in the western Barents Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In high northern latitudes, the Middle to Late-Holocene was a time of orbitally-induced atmospheric cooling. This led to increased sea-ice production in the Arctic Ocean and its export southward, a decrease in sea surface temperatures (SST), and glacier advances at least since 5–4 ka BP. However, the response of the ocean-climate system to decreasing insolation was not uniform. Our research shows that the sea-ice cover in the northwestern Barents Sea experienced a late response to Neoglacial cooling. We analyzed dinoflagellate cyst assemblages from a sediment core from Storfjordrenna, south of Svalbard. We found that the area experienced ice-free conditions throughout most of the Mid- and Late-Holocene. It was only after 2.3 ka BP that the study site became covered with winter drift ice and primary productivity decreased subsequently. Other regional data support the decrease in SST, the expansion of the sea-ice cover, and the deterioration of the environmental conditions around that time. Our findings indicate that the sea-ice cover in the northwestern Barents Sea required a significant amount of time to respond to the general cooling trend in the region. These results have important implications for present-day environmental changes. Even if the current warming trend is revoked in the future, the observed sea-ice loss in the Barents Sea may be incredibly challenging to reverse."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

food web, representing the primary carbon source prior to pelagic phytoplankton blooms. Here we investigate community dynamics of sea ice microalgal communities in land-fast sea ice across six different fjords in high-Arctic Svalbard, Norway, during Spring (April – May). We found that light (0.1 – 23% incoming PAR / 0.1 – 193 μmol photons m-2s-1) played a central role in determining community composition, with more diverse assemblages observed in sites with more light transmitted to the bottom ice community. In April, microalgal assemblages were similar when under-ice light transmittance was similar, independent of geographical location, however this light-derived separation of community structure was not evident in May. At all sites, assemblages were dominated by pennate diatoms, with the most abundant taxon being Nitzschia frigida. However, with increasing under-ice light transmittance, we saw an increase in the relative abundance of Dinophyceae, Navicula spp. and Thalassiosira spp.. A positive relationship between light and δ13C enrichment and C:N ratios in the ice algal biomass demonstrated the effect of light on the biochemical composition of ice algae. Light did not correlate with cell abundance or chlorophyll a concentration. With anticipated changes to Arctic sea ice extent and snow cover as a result of climate change, we will see shifts in the light transmitted to the bottom ice community. These shifts, whether caused by reduced light transmittance from increased snow cover or increased light transmittance from thinning ice, snow depth or increased rainfall, will likely alter sea ice microalgal community composition, which in turn, may influence the success of secondary production and biogeochemical cycling in polar waters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"224","pagesFromTo":"103248","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f3f105fdbe8326af973b09","66f3f105fdbe8326af973b0a","66f3f105fdbe8326af973b0b","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","66f3f105fdbe8326af973b0c","66f3f105fdbe8326af973b0d","66f3f105fdbe8326af973b0e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"4bc3bbad-0ed4-4dfe-8f62-93517ff00731"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f3f105fdbe8326af973b08","year":"2024","volume":"224","documentHash":"c6dd7081-6b24-48a1-a33f-30096400a090"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sea ice microalgae","Svalbard","Nitzschia frigida","biogeochemical cycling","under ice light transmittance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059769866"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f3c902fdbe8326af94b442","name":"Aurelija","lastName":"Samuilovienė","documentHash":"131cedb0-facf-43b5-85e8-ade8118ca3d4"},{"objectId":"66f3c902fdbe8326af94b441","name":"Dan","lastName":"Minchin","documentHash":"e644bf21-9d63-4f3a-8a3d-12abb6943299"},{"objectId":"66f3c902fdbe8326af94b440","name":"Sergej","lastName":"Olenin","documentHash":"ab3b779c-4c64-4907-bd11-0f29a4c652df"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6541","name":"Lech","lastName":"Kotwicki","uuid":"CEECA66DAF2E358E21F839F30352004FB3521D54E17236B1E8957B809DE11A2D2B30D28C4F68C7808E1907665A1D43B8C3716FA31D8E6A80279E7C2A427E9E30","orcidId":"0000-0001-5876-5696","documentHash":"f96c8d28-5ab4-4378-a9cd-4c6e9afc9155"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"}],"objectId":"66f3c902fdbe8326af94b43f","doi":"10.1007/s00300-024-03225-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-024-03225-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"First record of mussel larvae occurring in the mantle cavity of littoral-dwelling Mytilus spp. in Svalbard, Arctic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Blue mussels Mytilus have returned to the high Arctic region of Svalbard in the beginning of twenty-first century after being\nabsent for almost a 1000 years.

Here, we report viable larvae that were recovered from within the mantle cavity of mussels from the lower intertidal shore collected in late July 2019 and 2021 in Trygghamna, Isfjorden. The identity of larval and adult mussels was confirmed by sequencing of barcode region. Larvae ranged in size from 178 to 376 μm, from mussels 21 to 57 mm in shell length, and estimated to range over 3 to 12 years. It remains unclear whether the larval retention within the mantle cavity results from an intake of near shore concentrations and whether this may lead to larviphagy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6541","5e709347878c28a0473a6500"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"47","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"239-245","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f3c902fdbe8326af94b440","66f3c902fdbe8326af94b441","66f3c902fdbe8326af94b442","5e709347878c28a0473a6541","5e709347878c28a0473a6500"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792ee","mniswId":"16268","title":"POLAR BIOLOGY","doi":"","issn":"0722-4060","eissn":"1432-2056","websiteLink":"https://link.springer.com/journal/300","documentHash":"4669e802-994d-4bda-8c0a-5226214ba6f5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66177d19409707791fca82b8","year":"2024","volume":"47","number":"3","documentHash":"3c630561-d767-4035-92ca-0f7e88bfbab2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Larval retention","Intertidal","Population","Size structure","Fjord","Arctic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059769963"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6704ea46fdbe8356457759b8","name":"Marja","lastName":"Koski","documentHash":"a6e5b332-a914-4cd6-a3c1-6db7cc0ab6c9"},{"objectId":"6704ea46fdbe8356457759b7","name":"Coralie","lastName":"Barth‐Jensen","documentHash":"fa096354-3100-4112-98f6-18b5908ee32a"},{"objectId":"6704ea46fdbe8356457759b6","name":"Jofrid","lastName":"Skarðhamar","documentHash":"2e74812a-cba5-4d5b-ac58-45ca2e951b26"},{"objectId":"6704ea46fdbe8356457759b5","name":"Ingrid","lastName":"Wiedmann","documentHash":"c45cf519-ad6d-406a-b81c-746433f143d2"},{"objectId":"6704ea46fdbe8356457759b4","name":"Klas Ove","lastName":"Möller","documentHash":"4de1bc5a-572c-4f5e-9163-b68bc5e5975b"},{"objectId":"6704ea46fdbe8356457759b3","name":"Fredrika","lastName":"Norrbin","documentHash":"549fb0b8-38ae-4789-b621-45911b7b8797"},{"objectId":"6704ea46fdbe8356457759b2","name":"Morten","lastName":"Iversen","documentHash":"5e68ab95-bf54-4159-bd07-4a01aff9e73c"},{"objectId":"6704ea46fdbe8356457759b1","name":"Camilla","lastName":"Svensen","documentHash":"78ae42a4-ae10-4907-a7bb-cc134b4466cd"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"EEF890B1E5D83511CFF757CBCF10CA2BD7991D3807A5C930A1FE7E612F46F8C684536138A249461DB575FC1B980CA1B886292FD94C3FEBB57329BF6C05122B7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0911-3082","documentHash":"6cad81c7-1414-4d5a-958e-f2eaeda4b528"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kwaśniewski","uuid":"8365CC02046923AD10F327E0A9DF80A2A87646DD41F10E1B4BA9B189ECBDAF4BC4DDB9C2AE001CE03926A8551D8319BB4076255C7C53DDF5522FBDA2313D5552","orcidId":"0000-0003-3104-0761","documentHash":"8b17d9b8-6501-443c-a119-2fcad7a66046"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399412","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Ormańczyk","uuid":"28B4DC8E520F0E03AC8C1A1E83782BD4AEC44AF54A34D1A0AC82FE089F00047523DFC2BBBE0F078CD2C7E7B0153E15FEE6B117099FABAD104C75A6546A211997","orcidId":"0000-0003-2343-6694","documentHash":"33aaf417-aeea-4aa6-8501-eb28d6f6bb70"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6704ea46fdbe8356457759af","doi":"10.1002/lno.12641","publicUri":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lno.12641","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Impact of aggregate‐colonizing copepods on the biological carbon pump in a high‐latitude fjord","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Zooplankton consumption of sinking aggregates affects the quality and quantity of organic carbon exported to the deep ocean. Increasing laboratory evidence shows that small particle-associated copepods impact the flux attenuation by feeding on sinking particles, but this has not been quantified in situ. We investigated the impact of an abundant particle-colonizing copepod, Microsetella norvegica, on the attenuation of the vertical carbon flux in a sub-Arctic fjord. This study combines field measurements of vertical carbon flux, abundance, and size-distribution of marine snow and degradation rates of fecal pellets and algal aggregates. Female M. norvegica altered their feeding behavior when exposed to aggregates, and ingestion rates were 0.20 μg C ind.−1 d−1 on marine snow and 0.11 μg C ind.−1 d−1 on intact krill fecal pellets, corresponding to 48% and 26% of the females' body carbon mass. Due to high sea surface abundance of up to ~ 50 ind. L−1, the population of M. norvegica had the potential to account for almost all the carbon removal in the upper 50 m of the water column, depending on the type of the aggregate. Our observations highlight the potential importance of abundant small-sized copepods for biogeochemical cycles through their impact on export flux and its attenuation in the twilight zone."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

1994–2019","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This comprehensive study examines primary production (PP) within the Spitsbergen fjords, Hornsund, and Kongsfjord, over a 25-year period (1994–2019), across 45 stations and 348 incubation levels at various depths. PP and hydrological parameters were measured at 28 sampling stations in Kongsfjorden and 17 in Hornsund, with the locations of “Glacier,” “Inner,” and “Outer” zones defined to reflect the varying influence of glacial meltwater. Our study revealed spatial and temporal variability in PP, both at the surface and within the water column with very high depth resolution. The highest PP values were observed in the Glacier and Inner zones of Hornsund, particularly in the water layer up to 3 m depth, exceeding 20 mgC m−3 h−1. A notable decline in PP with increasing depth was observed in both fjords, with the Glacier zones displaying the highest productivity at the surface. The study also highlights the influence of glacial meltwater on surface water conditions, affecting the PP in the upper layers of both fjords. The observed gradient in the depth of maximum PP toward the mouth of the fjord varied between the two fjords, with Kongsjord displaying more dynamic variations. The spatial distribution of integrated primary production (Pi) suggested lower productivity in the glacial regions, likely due to light limitation caused by high concentrations of mineral particulate matter. The values of Pi were considerably higher in Hornsund, approximately twice as high overall, with specific emphasis on the Glacier and Inner zones where Pi values were about 6.5 and 2.5 times higher, respectively, when compared to those observed in Kongsfjord."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6551","5e70929e878c28a047399401","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","5e709347878c28a0473a6545"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"e11607","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a047399401","5e709347878c28a0473a6545","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","5e709347878c28a0473a6551"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779fd","mniswId":"5330","title":"Ecology and Evolution","issn":"2045-7758","eissn":"2045-7758","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"73ae90c2-19e2-4cc3-b598-264f4e3bd23c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"668282d8fdbe83250240fe28","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"6","documentHash":"e82d3ff7-4870-45a2-9885-ba38b5405569"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chlorophyll a","14C isotope method","Hornsund","Kongsfiord","primary production","Spitsbergen fjords"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059796946"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf734","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bulczak","uuid":"B7C97E94A3B62B5D13849F753E9A6A6D8B5FD5E1441122DF0EBED1650184CB7E085A9BE7A95BC47F3F12DB6610A1423349363F766E4D65658C4067831CD70A8D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6870-1290","documentHash":"9c5da26d-2b01-4372-838b-877315fbd381"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655a","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Rak","uuid":"93CA76011F426FF61AEABACB4C39A1FCEA26445E7E566D8189103F6DE570DC61CF4574AAD54D873D6D6610ECF941ED23F01E28B96CB7EAC8DE7E052EB1E4F454","orcidId":"0000-0002-3432-1924","documentHash":"ee738ad1-4418-4fff-8cfc-0fe52785bb5c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6556","name":"Anna","lastName":"Przyborska","uuid":"3E19638CF37846E94B19CA05A0811841DB6D48F6EC3B749702E29490D16228D2D4B22C28801E19E266F269A77C71EB9DBA67EF4072A7D75F687FCDEDF0596439","orcidId":"0000-0002-2791-6372","documentHash":"0e36dfbf-413c-4bd6-8691-415cef190976"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6519","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Dzierzbicka-Głowacka","uuid":"FDC01B0A03DACF40B86B8C76A6A5733A190D116F34DE41E026356499D64643AF86AFC24DF2A76B418A86F7BD2FBFE787F2EDEC5EF089D54B41C4018FFF1CD7CE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6151-2390","documentHash":"04fde4ef-26c2-4f72-87ad-b9283d779642"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67162e69fdbe8302c75df4fd","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1365759","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1365759/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Energy fluxes and vertical heat transfer in the Southern Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigates the dynamics of energy fluxes and vertical heat transfer in the Southern Baltic Sea, emphasizing the significant role of the dicothermal layer in modulating the penetration of the thermocline and the propagation rates of thermal energy.

This pathway requires the activity\nof the enzymes: the first is of the category of N-acetyltransferases (AANAT, SNAT, or NAT) and the second is N-\nacetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (ASMT; also known as HIOMT). However, quite recently, new information\nhas been provided on the possibility of an alternative Mel synthesis pathway; it would include a two-step action\nby these enzymes, but in reverse order, where ASMT (or ASMTL, the enzyme related to ASMT) methylates 5-HT\nto 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MT), and then the last compound is acetylated by an enzyme of the category of N-\nacetyltransferases to Mel. In our study on the activity of enzymes in the Mel biosynthesis pathway in flounder\nskin, we have found an increase in 5-MT level, as a result of the increase in 5-HT concentration, which is followed\nby a growing concentration of Mel. However, we have not found any increase in Mel concentration, despite an\nincrease in NAS in the samples.

In this study, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the influent of wastewater treatment plant located in Poland was analyzed November–December 2020, while other parameters important for the water/wastewater sector (e.g.: water usage and wastewater quality) were monitored in long-term period (2015–2020) during the working days, and holidays, including the 2020 lockdowns. In all tested wastewater samples, the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 was detected, which confirmed the utility of wastewater monitoring to analyse the COVID-19 trends in local communities. Another important issue was the elevated presence of surfactants and the observed change in the organic matter structure in raw wastewater generated during lockdowns. Also the NGS approach and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing confirmed the changes of functional diversity and heterogeneity in activated sludge bacterial community, especially in terms of nutrients removal and biomass separation. Thus, it is crucial to a baseline understanding of how the water-wastewater sector can serve to control disease transmission among the community and which tools should be adopted as countermeasures not only for new water consumption patterns but also for keeping safe and effective wastewater treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","uid":"b21X69XXr6O_0TDjOCQ3WhA","uuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","name":"Narodowy Instytut Leków","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ac878c28a0473c16aa","5e7093b6878c28a0473af938"],"parentId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","parentUuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","rootId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","rootUuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6547"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66eac5bbfdbe836650b0ccef","66eac5bbfdbe836650b0ccf0","66eac5bbfdbe836650b0ccf1","5e7093b6878c28a0473af938","5e709347878c28a0473a6547","66eac5bbfdbe836650b0ccf3","66eac5bbfdbe836650b0ccf4","5e7094ac878c28a0473c16aa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781ea","mniswId":"8893","title":"International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology","issn":"1735-1472","eissn":"1735-2630","documentHash":"5b97da1d-0457-4915-b3bb-424d854d6171"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66eac5bbfdbe836650b0ccee","year":"2024","documentHash":"44374141-89ce-4623-9147-b636db8440ae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Genetic material of SARS-CoV-2","Fecal indicators","Water distribution pattern","Effectiveness of wastewater treatment","Activated sludge community","Covid-19 pandemic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059821755"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f3ef1cfdbe8326af973140","name":"Karley","lastName":"Campbell","documentHash":"50c4bdd4-b0d9-4081-bdc0-fddc8621fa0a"},{"objectId":"66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313f","name":"Agneta","lastName":"Fransson","documentHash":"409d168e-f896-4f47-be03-0573ae7b6a5b"},{"objectId":"66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313e","name":"Melissa","lastName":"Chierici","documentHash":"8010c360-241f-40c6-952f-91a8034c0e03"},{"objectId":"66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313d","name":"Natacha","lastName":"Brion","documentHash":"c0bfd8f3-d6f3-42ac-8740-d647ec304f4e"},{"objectId":"66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313c","name":"Philippe","lastName":"Claeys","documentHash":"5c2a02eb-0381-413f-93d8-d485703d1d2f"},{"objectId":"66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313b","name":"Tore","lastName":"Hattermann","documentHash":"12a3126c-b256-4236-8500-a47e008e0157"},{"objectId":"66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313a","name":"Sebastien","lastName":"Moreau","documentHash":"02d27c58-3ee9-4d6a-b367-89cac46d04d0"},{"objectId":"66f3ef1cfdbe8326af973139","name":"Megan","lastName":"Lenss","documentHash":"f36095fd-b72e-4b76-b9bf-f99ce48671d3"},{"objectId":"642b8bab40e3ff13873c8248","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Różańska-Pluta","uuid":"781F98A57B075E4ABAD193856BE9C6456A39AB4787E7B620E196D84A71F1F0A6BD1B927FFF8F2DAF234789BD0CEA131085534C7F88BF800886A2F81BD12E3D2C","documentHash":"e9202820-c680-4496-ac99-e6d97a03faad"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655c","name":"Józef","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"E8901DD6BAD74E4F0A531BC69DC86134B02AC9BDAB17361AAFA79F2ED26ABBC473DFEDC614DF70B146B917A0E212BFD4740299FB5AB0C805A789195BA88BE5E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2344-0047","documentHash":"6a141822-0a06-4fc9-83c5-d08f585c8615"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66f3ef1cfdbe8326af973138","doi":"10.1525/elementa.2023.00122","publicUri":"https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article-pdf/doi/10.1525/elementa.2023.00122/830635/elementa.2023.00122.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Phytoplankton bloom distribution and succession driven by sea-ice melt in the Kong Håkon VII Hav","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The existence of ice-edge phytoplankton blooms in the Southern Ocean is well described, yet direct observations of the mechanisms of phytoplankton bloom development following seasonal sea-ice melt remain scarce. This study constrains such responses using biological and biogeochemical datasets collected along a coastal-to-offshore transect that bisects the receding sea-ice zone in the Kong Håkon VII Hav (off the coast of Dronning Maud Land). We documented that the biogeochemical growing conditions for phytoplankton vary on a latitudinal gradient of sea-ice concentration, where increased sea-ice melting creates optimal conditions for growth with increased light availability and potentially increased iron supply. The zones of the study area with the least ice cover were associated with diatom dominance, the greatest chlorophyll a concentrations, net community production, and dissolved inorganic carbon drawdown, as well as lower sea surface fugacity of CO2. Together, these associations imply higher potential for an oceanic CO2 sink due, at least in part, to more advanced bloom phase and/or larger bloom magnitude stemming from a relatively longer period of light exposure, as compared to the more ice-covered zones in the study area. From stable oxygen isotope fractions, sea-ice meltwater fractions were highest in the open ocean zone and meteoric meltwater fractions were highest in the coastal and polynya zones, suggesting that potential iron sources may also change on a latitudinal gradient across the study area. Variable phytoplankton community compositions were related to changing sea-ice concentrations, with a typical species succession from sympagic flagellate species (Pyramimonas sp. and Phaeocystis antarctica) to pelagic diatoms (e.g., Dactyliosolen tenuijunctus) observed across the study area. These results fill a spatiotemporal gap in the Southern Ocean, as sea-ice melting plays a larger role in governing phytoplankton bloom dynamics in the future Southern Ocean due to changing sea-ice conditions caused by anthropogenic global warming."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c","642b8bab40e3ff13873c8248"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f3ef1cfdbe8326af973139","66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313a","66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313b","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","642b8bab40e3ff13873c8248","66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313c","66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313d","66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313e","66f3ef1cfdbe8326af97313f","66f3ef1cfdbe8326af973140"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bff3","mniswId":"5590","title":"Elementa-Science of the Anthropocene","issn":"2325-1026","eissn":"2325-1026","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"62b408a3-f2ab-48d6-bd03-ec10365e773c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Phytoplankton","Sea ice","Light","Iron","Seeding","Southern Ocean"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059827776"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f3d3c9fdbe8326af955c65","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Reginia","documentHash":"e766db8a-563a-4977-a0f7-0206dbe42c0f"},{"objectId":"61c14a387523404d4a912f17","name":"Bernabe","lastName":"Moreno Leveroni","uuid":"36FA6EE05AD27586A36BA1525B92E9AAD5E4F42B9A77DAD6DAB3BCCEAD1532FFCEBDA7C315B2CAFF88513C5875A69EE85865276D9F50BE3B6B707C2A750E40FD","documentHash":"8f6e77cb-f129-4cfb-94a1-14bcf5f9f6e6"},{"objectId":"60c338749543c72336544161","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sowa","uuid":"6B261D801D2B51814D6C4EE36D61D78FA83965553B8A8433388705DA1B781338246700512BB71E6878F41245334C34BD843477316B51ABCB6BB4FA943644AF26","documentHash":"0f93daaf-0ad4-46d3-9829-1ccf98c99519"},{"objectId":"5fb3d234085dcb64f926a04c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Chełchowski","uuid":"8982566CAA5F2DCAB641551A6B17D8DCC5C0423387B46BA093D666110EAB76A9D715885B5A38AF585ADA8361B656016CCD69FC8A2D4366E678DCF78B92125A02","documentHash":"1c4d3a6d-e0db-47ec-9619-4cbe6c7159bc"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda","name":"MARTA","lastName":"RONOWICZ","uuid":"A12BD0AEECF4F7FD3C28D29DBAFC1BCC4FB4821C697A9C3870D029B46A87F78F286EC78CCEDFA8B73418C66DE888C52FFE9A9BB6EB89D9B701ADD57682C49148","orcidId":"0000-0001-8703-9132","documentHash":"c9083290-9530-45cf-b1ca-c1e3f397a474"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66f3d3c9fdbe8326af955c64","doi":"10.1038/s41597-024-03054-0","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03054-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Sea water temperature and light intensity at high-Arctic subtidal shallows – 16 years perspective","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Manifestations of climate change in the Arctic include an increase in water temperatures and massive loss of sea ice enabling more light penetration.

The nutritional quality of microalgae as a food source depends on their biomolecular (lipid:protein:carbohydrate) composition. In this study, we used synchrotron-based Fourier transform infra-red microspectroscopy (s-FTIR) to measure the biomolecular content of a dominant sea-ice taxa, Nitzschia frigida, from natural land-fast ice communities throughout the Arctic spring season. Repeated sampling over six weeks from an inner (relatively stable) and an outer (relatively dynamic) fjord site revealed high intra-specific variability in biomolecular content, elucidating the plasticity of N. frigida to adjust to the dynamic sea ice and water conditions. Environmental triggers indicating the end of productivity in the ice and onset of ice melt, including nitrogen limitation and increased water temperature, drove an increase in lipid and fatty acids stores, and a decline in protein and carbohydrate content. In the context of climate change and the predicted Atlantification of the Arctic, dynamic mixing and abrupt warmer water advection could truncate these important end-of-season environmental shifts, causing the algae to be released from the ice prior to adequate lipid storage, influencing carbon transfer through the polar marine system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f3f448fdbe8326af97563a","66f3f448fdbe8326af97563b","66f3f448fdbe8326af97563c","66f3f448fdbe8326af97563d","5e709347878c28a0473a655c","66f3f448fdbe8326af97563e","66f3f448fdbe8326af97563f","66f3f448fdbe8326af975640"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Microalgae","Svalbard","Nitzschia frigida","Biogeochemical cycling","Sea ice","Arctic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059828023"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f2a35afdbe832f6801858a","name":"Monika","lastName":"Lengier","documentHash":"ecad13a6-e5d5-4545-99a2-552c544ba9de"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szymczycha","uuid":"F594DC6E0A245A248EACAF139383FF10C32DD82FE0DACFF05A102D4A7E645FB7586B6A7F34800C8363F445238D1E4A8D328549DE8D315F239B00D5F69B7F8C87","orcidId":"0000-0002-5815-215X","documentHash":"0a8a40d0-e3be-4cb4-9e67-7af031f250d1"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kuliński","uuid":"A1362FEB3C94D210BA97D7C5FE392ED27FB4DD61D0B2476A4F5C18B20F589C7FA21F35A13EA5510511C60D24A7EAD1FC4FDC75E86C1645B920BA2AE06C994826","orcidId":"0000-0002-5403-6629","documentHash":"8009c04f-1ba9-4687-80f3-d96316801246"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739941d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Koziorowska-Makuch","uuid":"3509723B3C9ACF6AC999AADF8F9DFFCBC59EBD1303980F82ED6C7F4BD7719E1581D1822C26EAABF3F62D27DEB38E556101B6169DCDBBF6E954F2721AB7FCCE40","orcidId":"0000-0002-9111-9597","documentHash":"f1a7632d-a947-4305-b1e3-6d63b76e893b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66f2a35afdbe832f68018589","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1359563","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1359563/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Bioavailability and remineralization rates of sediment-derived dissolved organic carbon from a Baltic Sea depositional area","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This pilot study investigated the bioavailability and remineralization kinetics of the sediment-derived dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the Gdańsk Deep, a depositional area in the Baltic Sea. This was assessed in the long-lasting (126 d) incubation experiment, in which the mixture of DOC from sediment pore water and bottom water was exposed to oxic microbial respiration with incubation of bottom water as a control run. The obtained decay curves allowed us to distinguish three DOC fractions: labile (DOCL), semi-labile (DOCSL), and refractory (DOCR). In bottom water, the refractory fraction was predominant and amounted to almost 85% of total DOC, whereas about 15% of DOC was bioavailable: 6% labile and 9% semi-labile. In contrast, DOC from pore water was much more bioavailable DOC (~55% of total DOC) and contained 11% DOCL and 44% DOCSL. The remineralization rate constants recalculated to the in situ temperature of 6°C for labile and semi-labile DOC in pore water were 0.025 d−1 and 0.002 d−1, respectively, whereas, in bottom water, 0.026 d−1 and 0.004 d−1. The half-life times for DOCL were comparable for both bottom water and pore water and amounted to 26.2 d and 27.6 d, respectively. For DOCSL, the half-life time was shorter for bottom water (165.5 d) than for pore water (322.9 d)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f2a35afdbe832f6801858a","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","5e709347878c28a0473a654a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66389efb4097076e57a5ef9c","year":"2024","volume":"11","documentHash":"495f74cb-874c-429f-a6f6-dd45c3fddca6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DOC","bioavailability","pore water","remineralization rate constant","half-life","Gdańsk Basin"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059828255"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f3d5c4fdbe8326af957d3f","name":"Héctor","lastName":"Aponte","documentHash":"bbaa743c-ead2-42d3-abc0-6c34db3fa536"},{"objectId":"66f3d5c4fdbe8326af957d3e","name":"Oscar","lastName":"Aller-Rojas","documentHash":"0cf226f9-27b0-4549-9047-93c2c234ba8d"},{"objectId":"66f3d5c4fdbe8326af957d3d","name":"Bruno","lastName":"Cevallos","documentHash":"e9d398a2-7c55-4a28-84ff-957cdf3031e9"},{"objectId":"61c14a387523404d4a912f17","name":"Bernabe","lastName":"Moreno Leveroni","uuid":"36FA6EE05AD27586A36BA1525B92E9AAD5E4F42B9A77DAD6DAB3BCCEAD1532FFCEBDA7C315B2CAFF88513C5875A69EE85865276D9F50BE3B6B707C2A750E40FD","documentHash":"8f6e77cb-f129-4cfb-94a1-14bcf5f9f6e6"}],"objectId":"66f3d5c4fdbe8326af957d3b","doi":"10.1007/s10811-024-03269-z","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10811-024-03269-z.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Carbon capture by stipitate kelp forests in Peru: insights from population assessment of Lessonia trabeculata at 15°S","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Marine forests are key providers of ecosystem services globally with increasing recognition of their relevance in the context of climate adaptation and mitigation. Along the Southeast Pacific, these forests sustain productive and intricate trophic webs, serving as crucial sustenance for coastal systems and subsidies for deeper habitats. This study aimed to estimate the contribution of Lessonia trabeculata to the local blue carbon pathways within the southern sector of the largest coastal protected area in Peru, Reserva Nacional San Fernando (RNSF). By integrating remote sensing, scientific diving, and the traditional knowledge of artisanal divers, we conducted a comprehensive assessment and conservative estimates of carbon captured by these forests during the austral winter of 2021 using the least destructive assessment methods. We conservatively estimated ~1300 t C captured as standing stock by L. trabeculata in the southern sector of RNSF. Said biomass-held carbon assimilation would annually release ~1300 t C m2 y-1 as detritus, of which, once exported could potentially yield to ~130 t C m2 y-1 sequestered in deep-sea sediments. Detrital productivity of L. trabeculata was calculated for the first time in Peru, along with the social and environmental cost of emissions equivalent to the amount of carbon captured (855.8k US$) and potentially removed by the standing stock (85.7k US$). In addition, we present an overview of the conservation state of the kelp population in the coastal protected area, along with allometric equations for estimating biomass based on biometric measurements easily attainable underwater. This study represents the continuation of a pioneering effort towards the understanding of blue carbon in marine forests of Peru. Our study contributes to advancing the understanding and management of these ecosystems in the face of climate challenges. The implications for the rapidly growing blue carbon field in the region's socioecological context are further discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61c14a387523404d4a912f17"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f3d5c4fdbe8326af957d3d","66f3d5c4fdbe8326af957d3e","66f3d5c4fdbe8326af957d3f","61c14a387523404d4a912f17"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478488","mniswId":"10177","title":"Journal of Applied Phycology","issn":"0921-8971","documentHash":"5c431d03-b6ab-40b8-9e84-178a91f017ef"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f3d5c4fdbe8326af957d3c","year":"2024","documentHash":"bbcecccc-2d07-436b-91d0-4f7f498f942e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Macroalgae","Lessoniaceae","Marine forests","Blue carbon","Humboldt Current","Outwelling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059828270"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed94","name":"Camille","lastName":"Saurel","documentHash":"af62c9d7-8412-4d16-a5ec-86dd5c0668a2"},{"objectId":"6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed93","name":"Marie","lastName":"Maar","documentHash":"4d4f7307-db4c-4ed3-af5b-762306b03cf2"},{"objectId":"6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed92","name":"Mortimer","lastName":"Werther","documentHash":"61559980-3d9c-4993-8749-6f10866ed5e2"},{"objectId":"6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed91","name":"Maren Moltke","lastName":"Lyngsgaard","documentHash":"51228638-963b-47bd-81ba-0fc18be3794e"},{"objectId":"6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed90","name":"Hans","lastName":"Jakobsen","documentHash":"a9e21fa2-8de1-4664-adee-20510fbda79d"},{"objectId":"6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed8f","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Taylor","documentHash":"98b06f56-64e0-4ead-8ebc-40e0bca7fe30"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6553","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Darecki","uuid":"3755ABFC91B9E5A4F1AE0A7678119D08E03F290D86F7F0652A5312D20FE39F687D1A53AC6EDA03F9ECCAA1B4F03ECEA0646A362FF8EA959243FCD42C5D7DD4BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4326-5212","documentHash":"767e4626-6c39-4ef7-aec0-2c18b6ea089b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-09-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed8d","doi":"10.1002/lno.12680","publicUri":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lno.12680","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Quantifying bivalve phytoplankton depletion in a eutrophic system: an integrated approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The removal of organic particulate matter, predominantly phytoplankton, in eutrophic coastal seas and estuaries is considered an ecosystem service performed by large bivalve assemblages. Mussel farming has been proposed as a measure to mitigate eutrophication, as filtration directly reduces the concentration of chlorophyll a (Chl a), a primary ecological indicator. Seston depletion is typically assessed by in situ investigation, which generally lacks spatiotemporal coverage of features relative to greater ecosystem dynamics. To assess the scale and structure of this service, the present study couples multiple measurement approaches, including moored stations, synoptic transect surveys, flow cytometry, a preliminary drone survey technique, and satellite remote sensing within and around a large mussel farm. Significant depletion patterns were observed with all methods, and mixing gradients could be detected hundreds of meters beyond the farm, with repeatable patterns but distinct findings between methods. The intensity of the depletion signal was correlated with mussel biomass loads, ambient conditions, and hydrodynamic regimes, ranging from 5% to 91% relative Chl a depletion and Secchi depth increases of up to 2 m. Changes in particle size distributions were impacted in all downstream areas, as well as phytoplankton diversity. Observed depletion gradients with satellite imagery were consistent with other measurements and can be used to complement in situ field measurements. The findings of this study, will inform carrying capacity assessments, farm configuration, and development of impact assessment programs on seston removal for bivalve aquaculture."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6553"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"69","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"2436-2452","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed8f","6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed90","6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed91","5e709347878c28a0473a6553","6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed92","6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed93","6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed94"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cf6","mniswId":"13650","title":"LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY","issn":"0024-3590","documentHash":"c17962d9-0f64-4611-8165-2a6856d816c5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6718a0cefdbe8353f757ed8e","year":"2024","volume":"69","number":"10","documentHash":"021584a6-a8e7-4d39-b2aa-29d922fd6153"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059844396"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"672a0391fdbe837837695d63","name":"Brian S.","lastName":"Leander","documentHash":"6857ead5-2ffc-4bcf-8bf6-b0366e3ab2a9"},{"objectId":"672a0391fdbe837837695d62","name":"María","lastName":"Herranz","documentHash":"c98df2ca-f92b-4696-aa25-c04bb33fd7e0"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"89E34998A7815703314F14609081D0B42B721BC6BC02334A524F1A72E99979BE1D2892A3F7AD68FC281490897050CAC6FC5A6472BC066A2DFADD377EF7948831","orcidId":"0000-0002-8175-575X","documentHash":"60624fd9-0ebc-49d7-8f66-5b468fb82647"}],"objectId":"672a0391fdbe837837695d61","doi":"10.1016/j.jcz.2024.10.010","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0044523124001013?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"First evidence of cryptic diversity in mud dragons (kinorhyncha) and description of Echinoderes quasae sp. nov. from the northeastern pacific coast","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"he genus Echinoderes, currently consisting of over 150 known species, has seen a surge in new descriptions since 2015.

We describe a new species, Echinoderes quasae sp. nov., using a molecular and morphological approach and provide the first evidence of cryptic diversity in kinorhynchs, revealing at least two new species within a previously unrecognized cryptic complex."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709481878c28a0473be9a6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"313","pagesFromTo":"241-254","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["672a0391fdbe837837695d62","672a0391fdbe837837695d63","5e709481878c28a0473be9a6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b4c","mniswId":"20556","title":"ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER","issn":"0044-5231","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"0a71b53a-c500-4dde-87de-24221b9abbe4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6729f0c6fdbe837837683223","year":"2024","volume":"313","documentHash":"11112632-ae9f-4972-97e6-6fe2c2208882"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Meiofauna","Kinorhynchs","Echinoderidae","Nuclear ribosomal internal transcriber spacer (ITS)","Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059851022"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"670f734ffdbe8317edce170b","name":"Arunas","lastName":"Valiulis","documentHash":"8b80a6f4-6aad-4652-b0ef-dc1eb803b5d9"},{"objectId":"670f734ffdbe8317edce170a","name":"Marina","lastName":"Kostantinova","documentHash":"63a9bfd2-e80b-4207-9376-200f698ddbdf"},{"objectId":"670f734ffdbe8317edce1709","name":"Algirdas","lastName":"Valiulis","documentHash":"1c3632f1-86a5-4866-88bd-9692466330ba"},{"objectId":"670f734ffdbe8317edce1708","name":"Dean Ernest","lastName":"Schraufnagel","documentHash":"11139daa-38cd-407a-8284-2a4e2caba108"},{"objectId":"670f734ffdbe8317edce1707","name":"Ulrich","lastName":"Franck","documentHash":"a813f6b6-6abc-4530-aab5-3cbe2739a5ef"},{"objectId":"670f734ffdbe8317edce1706","name":"Nikolaj","lastName":"Tarasiuk","documentHash":"8e7d1bd1-765f-48ab-ac35-d4f13e17e7f4"},{"objectId":"670f734ffdbe8317edce1705","name":"Nina","lastName":"Prokopciuk","documentHash":"3e0e4c67-e3fd-4448-bb48-c6682c64ca18"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651c","name":"TYMON","lastName":"ZIELIŃSKI","uuid":"C324D30030FFB1D821F13CA4C438B654B82F5050D3298D1A50BB41185EF70CD31FD4DA77DE03586D1C0F5FC8FC0F39ECDC58D1956839D195025A90DA5E2BE1BE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4712-8899","documentHash":"f0c26ff7-1742-409b-aa86-c0253dfa2a66"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"670f734ffdbe8317edce1703","doi":"10.3390/atmos15101216","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/15/10/1216/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"On the Possible Climatic Consequences of the Large Oil Spills in Oceans","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the North Atlantic and the Northern Ocean, from the second half of 2010 to 2014, satellite imagery data showed increased surface water temperatures (in the Icelandic Depression area in September–October 2010, it was 1.3 °C higher than in 2009). The peak of the annual sum of mean monthly ocean surface temperatures near the Icelandic Depression in 2010 (109.3 °C), as well as the negative values of the monthly averaged North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) indices, estimated in the second half of 2010 and until March 2011, can be explained by the appearance of an additional film of oil origin on the water surface, formed after an oil spill accident at the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico. Insufficient evaporative cooling of surface waters near the Icelandic Depression related to the formation of an additive film due to the influence of pollution of the North Sea by oil can explain the earlier peak in the annual sum of mean monthly ocean surface temperatures near the Icelandic Depression in 2003 (107.2 °C). Although global warming is usually ascribed to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, ocean surface water pollution could increase the heat content of the ocean and explain the steady temperature stratification and desalination of these waters due to the melting of Greenland’s glaciers. Thus, when analyzing the concept of global warming, it is necessary to take into account the aspects of pollution of the ocean surface waters to assess the changes in their capacity to accumulate solar radiation, as well as the changes in the heat content of the ocean mixing zone (~200 m)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a651c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1216","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["670f734ffdbe8317edce1705","670f734ffdbe8317edce1706","670f734ffdbe8317edce1707","670f734ffdbe8317edce1708","670f734ffdbe8317edce1709","670f734ffdbe8317edce170a","5e709347878c28a0473a651c","670f734ffdbe8317edce170b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e99bbe2c-fe08-4cb7-999f-c3a55335bedc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"670f734ffdbe8317edce1704","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"10","documentHash":"d90fe779-a2e5-4cd6-9049-30f3bf8d53b3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climate warming","oil spills","North Atlantic Oscillation","surface film","ocean pollution","production water"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059858059"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67162c2cfdbe8302c75da8ba","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Nowak","documentHash":"d3050c2e-18ed-4523-b3bc-652ad16cb7a1"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf734","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bulczak","uuid":"B7C97E94A3B62B5D13849F753E9A6A6D8B5FD5E1441122DF0EBED1650184CB7E085A9BE7A95BC47F3F12DB6610A1423349363F766E4D65658C4067831CD70A8D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6870-1290","documentHash":"9c5da26d-2b01-4372-838b-877315fbd381"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b64bd","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Muzyka","uuid":"6A98C7759C3EE5B883418B457B16FA53B7728267BCD41943B10DC614F678683EED1643C021346302DF2A0A89A34EE33E7DC6BCF8D53FFA3C02AE4D8BEA22B2AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1193-2386","documentHash":"b8a5dc3f-465b-4276-bc48-a87077e1c5af"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655a","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Rak","uuid":"93CA76011F426FF61AEABACB4C39A1FCEA26445E7E566D8189103F6DE570DC61CF4574AAD54D873D6D6610ECF941ED23F01E28B96CB7EAC8DE7E052EB1E4F454","orcidId":"0000-0002-3432-1924","documentHash":"ee738ad1-4418-4fff-8cfc-0fe52785bb5c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6542","name":"Jaromir","lastName":"Jakacki","uuid":"30C04EE488139DF403DDBF2146E56B2ECF0A32F46A26BA504331D7F2A88CF495FE61B45FF24A1D986A449AD284F97959E095ECF35F68892BADC7B0AA7A85B2B7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7376-3090","documentHash":"b52ce02a-ad14-4790-b8df-705ba3fa0705"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6525","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Walczowski","uuid":"3C05D7E2F324D389685EB67F5114F749AEDBE4240E429C16EF3E6C1CD8838EB626FB22887985BFB823C2E45775D6558649B8943F3877BC967D69D19F5411A29D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0243-3307","documentHash":"601253a2-b41f-4f16-9e10-04aa9485efb2"}],"objectId":"67162c2cfdbe8302c75da8b9","doi":"10.1016/j.csr.2024.105232","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0278434324000621?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Seasonal variability and long-term winter shoaling of the upper mixed layer in the southern Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The upper ocean mixed layer plays a crucial role in regulating the exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere. The Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) is a key parameter affecting the air-sea exchanges of momentum and heat and determining the upper ocean temperature. Numerous previous studies have investigated MLD variability in the global ocean or regional seas but no such studies were carried in the Baltic Sea. In this study, we present the first observational assessment of the MLD and its properties in the Southern Baltic Sea including quantification of its seasonal and long-term changes and identification of the multi-year winter shoaling. We calculated monthly maps of MLD in the southern Baltic Sea using a large number of historical CTD profiles collected in 1995–2021 from a combination of different data sets. To test the robustness of the results we compared the MLDs calculated using different threshold methods. Throughout the southern Baltic Sea, across its three basins, a distinct seasonality is evident in the MLD, with values varying from 12 m in July to 60 m in December–March. During winter the water column is well mixed down to the upper halocline depth and the MLD reaches about 45 m in the Bornholm Basin, 50 m in the Slupsk Furrow, and 60 m in the Gdansk Basin. The observed global warming and decadal changes in the salty inflows from the North Sea to the Baltic have had an impact on stratification by increasing water densities in the intermediate and deep layers. Consequently, density gradients have strengthened with depth while the upper ocean mixing has weakened during the winter season. The results reveal a significant winter shoaling of the mixed layer by 4 m per decade, driven by the increased stratification due to rising temperatures and salinity. These changes could have significant impacts on the dynamics and productivity of marine ecosystems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655a","5e70948d878c28a0473bf734","5e709347878c28a0473a6542","5e709347878c28a0473a6525","5e70941b878c28a0473b64bd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"276","pagesFromTo":"105232","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70948d878c28a0473bf734","67162c2cfdbe8302c75da8ba","5e709347878c28a0473a6542","5e70941b878c28a0473b64bd","5e709347878c28a0473a655a","5e709347878c28a0473a6525"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777e6","mniswId":"4393","title":"Continental Shelf Research","issn":"0278-4343","eissn":"1873-6955","documentHash":"c5cb66a0-77b1-451d-ad35-f73cc6785807"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664741604097071861ea3c48","year":"2024","volume":"276","documentHash":"8c5dec2c-79da-432d-99b6-3db254dc7a3d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059861240"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b145c","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Pomianowski","uuid":"603CADF218161162F9EE0EF5FF649F72A209F2C892AB9FB544620799FE6468D66393864961B218B455F861A60B8C17AA3B3307CD49FD2BDB3248A8BB20226796","orcidId":"0000-0002-5256-3847","documentHash":"4eac7e58-e247-4e83-af17-ac064891ffde"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6529","name":"Artur","lastName":"Burzyński","uuid":"43AAABE43BBCAE37243B45A30414FA9EDDD7130BE28712FB77B49CB2BC251D18241BEAA42B0C066A1262448D4A375CC8A0590D41EBD5151C61805AB7EAD58A4D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0185-197X","documentHash":"0555d7bd-6f83-414a-ac09-21d18398977f"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a650f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kulczykowska","uuid":"856B07BDA8ABD3060D5000D705193A7D38A1150782FA1BCC8AF1C8253AC8ED7804B7E4E0308C1B5B61504F79D590C22B401EEA1B5757A14951EE90881A585932","orcidId":"0000-0002-3979-9310","documentHash":"e7b053a3-a963-4c82-9964-cd686c8db387"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67330585fdbe8343db1850a7","doi":"10.1038/s41597-024-04004-6","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-04004-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Genome guided, organ-specific transcriptome assembly of the European flounder (P. flesus) from the Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although the European flounder is frequently used in research and has economic importance, there is still lack of comprehensive transcriptome data for this species.

This productive region is\ncharacterized by its complex hydrographic and sea ice dynamics, providing an ideal set\nup to study their influence on the variability of the marine carbonate system. Different\nvariables of the marine CO2 system: Total Alkalinity (TA), Dissolved Inorganic Carbon\n(DIC), partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), and pH, were analysed together with temperature,\nsalinity, sea ice extension, and chlorophyll a distribution during three consecutive\nsummers (2019, 2020 and 2021), each of them having a unique oceanographic\nsetting. The data revealed that TA and DIC are mostly controlled by the mixing of\nAtlantic water and sea ice meltwater. The combined effects of organic matter production/\nremineralization, calcium carbonate precipitation/dissolution, and air/sea CO2 gas\nexchange cause deviations from this salinity-related mixing. The scale of these\ndeviations and the proportion between the effects observed for TA and DIC suggest\ninterannual shifts in net primary production and dominant phytoplankton species in the\narea. These shifts are correlated with the sea ice extent and the spread of the Polar\nSurface Waters in the region. Net primary production is the main factor controlling the\ntemporal and spatial variability of pH and pCO2 in the study area followed by the influence\nof temperature and, mixing of water masses expressed with salinity (seawater freshening).\nSurface waters of the Fram Strait area were generally undersaturated in CO2. The lowest\npCO2 values, coinciding with an increase in oxygen saturation, were observed in areas of\nmixing of Arctic and Atlantic-derived water masses. However, as shown for 2021, a\nreduction of the sea ice extent may induce a westward shift of the chlorophyll maximum,\nresulting in pCO2 increase and pH decrease in the eastern part. This indicates that sea ice\nextent and associated spread of Polar Surface Waters may be important factors shaping\nprimary production, and thus pCO2 and pH, in the Fram Strait area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5fa2ba43085dcb2ecfccf3df","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e709347878c28a0473a653c","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","60c332f19543c7233654404b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1464653","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c332f19543c7233654404b","5fa2ba43085dcb2ecfccf3df","5e70929e878c28a04739941d","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","5e709347878c28a0473a653c","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e709347878c28a0473a654a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66389efb4097076e57a5ef9c","year":"2024","volume":"11","documentHash":"495f74cb-874c-429f-a6f6-dd45c3fddca6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Marine CO2 system","Arctic","Fram Strait","ocean acidification","pCO2","pH","sea ice"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059887883"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"672a019dfdbe837837692d1c","name":"Inés","lastName":"Barrenechea Angeles","documentHash":"82a703e5-aa85-48bd-b6ed-1307132e1450"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"89E34998A7815703314F14609081D0B42B721BC6BC02334A524F1A72E99979BE1D2892A3F7AD68FC281490897050CAC6FC5A6472BC066A2DFADD377EF7948831","orcidId":"0000-0002-8175-575X","documentHash":"60624fd9-0ebc-49d7-8f66-5b468fb82647"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc64b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pawłowska-Tomkowicz","uuid":"ECA96C4DAEF44CEAAFDCA927360B56292B27A39C3FA3260073AF7F30015E6FC0D280644416C38211573FC5B5D1F01D3EACDC574C132CC2529ED24ED08335C602","orcidId":"0000-0001-9383-9785","documentHash":"cf25fc77-a1b7-49f4-b99e-88374287930d"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6544","name":"Agata","lastName":"Zaborska","uuid":"FE40EF42F9E848E1D09D278DBA4FECC8CD79F3BC581694CBDEC7B3EE47F2AC0C2688E35AC59379BC3BC9C53F432C7CF089A8C0E8D1D11ACB2050D908A2E6CF9E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1432-7421","documentHash":"f9a20830-9869-4364-97d8-deb620a80580"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651e","name":"Maria","lastName":"Włodarska-Kowalczuk","uuid":"D47553F9A2C33D8033D8594650BFC32CC9C68EF6F3EE4CE130DBEC8BA3DF82ED9A7055BF1E4316109AD31C2E6DBEF73F3FEF158A522731E002B07E209F106EDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2757-1108","documentHash":"01d767d9-9266-45a4-bd4b-a8cf8d1e8a8e"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739940b","name":"Kajetan","lastName":"Deja","uuid":"9D662B5DB9D9989CA2118EDEC7988EF7D4D3980D2C609A38B7C9587CFC9D6D5B787097E27010CA8550182A7210D7D7626DAA6E7FFF1C7E0FD28C9FB88D4072BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6707-3883","documentHash":"2fb48e59-8c28-4aaa-9364-256c74d01e4d"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399408","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Mazurkiewicz","uuid":"02A0720C4DB7D495D30D78C17E89284B4CB30C34D8A129A2DADEDC0B48677C1A39962BA95793418B1B32013B98B02B5CFCC63435E3140FB2F2A0E4C6CAD0CD35","orcidId":"0000-0001-5253-1020","documentHash":"13e0196d-f4a9-449a-b93b-79aebe42fcb9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"672a019dfdbe837837692d1a","doi":"10.1016/j.marenvres.2024.106552","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0141113624002137?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Sediment DNA metabarcoding and morphology provide complementary insight into macrofauna and meiobenthos response to environmental gradients in an Arctic glacial fjord","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Arctic fjords ecosystems are highly dynamic, with organisms exposed to various natural stressors along with productivity clines driven by advection of water masses from shelves. The benthic response to these environmental clines has been extensively studied using traditional, morphology-based approaches mostly focusing on macroinvertebrates. In this study we analyse the effects of glacially mediated disturbance on the biodiversity of benthic macrofauna and meiobenthos (meiofauna and Foraminifera) in a Svalbard fjord by comparing morphology and eDNA metabarcoding. Three genetic markers targeting metazoans (COI), meiofauna (18S V1V2) and Foraminifera (18S 37f) were analyzed. Univariate measures of alpha diversity and multivariate compositional dissimilarities were calculated and tested for similarities in response to environmental gradients using correlation analysis. Our study showed different taxonomic composition of morphological and molecular datasets for both macrofauna and meiobenthos. Some taxonomic groups while abundant in metabarcoding data were almost absent in morphology-based inventory and vice versa. In general, species richness and diversity measures in macrofauna morphological data were higher than in metabarcoding, and similar for the meiofauna. Both methodological approaches showed different patterns of response to the glacially mediated disturbance for the macrofauna and the meiobenthos. Macrofauna showed an evident distinction in taxonomic composition and a dramatic cline in alpha diversity indices between the outer and inner parts of fjord, while the meiobenthos showed a gradual change and more subtle responses to environmental changes along the fjord axis. The two methods can be seen as complementing rather than replacing each other. Morphological approach provides more accurate inventory of larger size species and more reliable quantitative data, while metabarcoding allows identification of inconspicuous taxa that are overlooked in morphology-based studies. As different taxa may show different sensitivities to environmental changes, both methods shall be used to monitor marine biodiversity in Arctic ecosystems and its response to dramatically changing environmental conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","5e70929e878c28a04739940b","5e709347878c28a0473a6544","5e709347878c28a0473a651e","5e70929e878c28a047399408","5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","5e709469878c28a0473bc64b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"198","pagesFromTo":"106552","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a047399408","5e709469878c28a0473bc64b","672a019dfdbe837837692d1c","5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","5e70929e878c28a04739940b","5e709347878c28a0473a6544","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","5e709347878c28a0473a651e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d6a","mniswId":"13913","title":"Marine Environmental Research","issn":"0141-1136","eissn":"1879-0291","documentHash":"012bdfa6-7dee-4932-9499-e43cd369ba29"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"672a019dfdbe837837692d1b","year":"2024","volume":"198","documentHash":"29923e40-d22e-4332-9461-68a6e23b31ec"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Macrobenthos","Meiofauna","Foraminifera","Environmental clines","Community ecology","Environmental DNA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059890028"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6729f0c6fdbe837837683226","name":"Martin V.","lastName":"Sørensen","documentHash":"54758bf9-63ec-4d51-98ad-fae8e809a4b6"},{"objectId":"6729f0c6fdbe837837683225","name":"María","lastName":"Herranz","documentHash":"e6c245a9-ba00-4e70-807c-4b9d5097be5f"},{"objectId":"6729f0c6fdbe837837683224","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Zalewska","documentHash":"ba45a7eb-ad32-41b6-8c5c-d870e2d7e502"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be9a6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"89E34998A7815703314F14609081D0B42B721BC6BC02334A524F1A72E99979BE1D2892A3F7AD68FC281490897050CAC6FC5A6472BC066A2DFADD377EF7948831","orcidId":"0000-0002-8175-575X","documentHash":"60624fd9-0ebc-49d7-8f66-5b468fb82647"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac2ba","name":"Marek","lastName":"Lubośny","uuid":"BCCE25C1AD2634686D73062F6CABB978C50DF6A1DACBF6FA375380C32D1FB59DB75034F7CCC1F1EEE78E019A5A811C7AA2370719C6D307748AF74BBBF4C89DF1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6370-8880","documentHash":"4d42ad1e-e518-42d0-804f-bf5e9ef51aa3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6729f0c6fdbe837837683222","doi":"10.1016/j.jcz.2024.10.013","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0044523124001049?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"To be, or not tu-be? Population structure and connectivity in three Arctic kinorhynch species: Echinoderes aquilonius, Echinoderes eximus and Echinoderes remanei","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Arctic, despite being profoundly affected by global climate change, remains largely understudied. Its local ecosystems and fauna are undergoing significant changes, including marine meiobenthic invertebrates, such as kinorhynchs. However, although they are an important component of the benthic meiofauna, our understanding of their communities remains relatively limited. The present study focuses on the structure and connectivity of the populations of three Echinoderes species: Echinoderes aquilonius, Echinoderes eximus and Echinoderes remanei, inhabiting the coastal area of Disko Island (Western Greenland). A hypothesis of low population diversity was tested through analyses based on both morphology and the molecular cox1 marker. For the first time the distribution and relationships between and within species were described. Phylogenetic analysis and haplotype networks reflected the results of population statistics (nucleotide and haplotype diversity, Tajima's D and Fu's Fs), revealing expected homogeneity and low diversity, without any noticeable patterns of geographical distribution. The results indicate that Arctic kinorhynchs form progressively developing and expanding communities. Additionally, the analyses revealed a taxonomically important example of intraspecific polymorphism. Presence or absence of tubes are usually considered to be species diagnostic characters, and the finding an isolated population of E. eximus-like specimens with sublateral tubes on segment 9, suggested that this could be a new, yet undescribed species. However, the genetic divergence between these specimens and other populations of E. eximus without tubes on segment 9 was so low that they all have to be considered conspecific. This is the first time molecular sequence data has provided evidence for intraspecific tube polymorphism among kinorhynchs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac2ba","5e709481878c28a0473be9a6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"313","pagesFromTo":"289-297","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6729f0c6fdbe837837683224","6729f0c6fdbe837837683225","5e709389878c28a0473ac2ba","6729f0c6fdbe837837683226","5e709481878c28a0473be9a6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b4c","mniswId":"20556","title":"ZOOLOGISCHER ANZEIGER","issn":"0044-5231","documentHash":"6f8b7e2d-4dbc-419d-9979-830358fb96af"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6729f0c6fdbe837837683223","year":"2024","volume":"313","documentHash":"11112632-ae9f-4972-97e6-6fe2c2208882"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Population genetics","Haplotype network","Cytochrome-C-Oxidase-I","Meiofauna","Echinoderidae","Phylogeography"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059890043"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f29706fdbe832f680111f6","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Licznar","documentHash":"b7ad5d25-529f-4c48-8418-b8e75660a6a0"},{"objectId":"66f29706fdbe832f680111f3","name":"Alfred","lastName":"Stach","documentHash":"7bc2ae57-27b5-45c0-a4bf-2f98ff25b26f"},{"objectId":"602b53779543c7410626dc4c","name":"Karol","lastName":"Mikołajewski","uuid":"E4924E8732E0DA090BB02F57A09646B4F6E40E8867FEDE580AA7A7C59D31DD63CA4134127E0E39A56594A83761423222CE14AB1026DCB1B32337F0976E1BDC23","documentHash":"d69f4a65-bdaa-44b3-a3d0-4626b0bd99a4"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4848","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Kundzewicz","uuid":"17C1BBFDDF36F21EEDCE347944080DC76013D907A8943F447819496D52D0CA2C82B3E2932CFA75DBE15E50771D2FFD581D51F1172FDF6936170FB8BD2CA727C2","orcidId":"0000-0002-3579-5072","documentHash":"0937a87a-aca3-45bd-afeb-014812c0e553"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac37a","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Kosek","uuid":"580974CB932CB9CB9F745E04EA8FDCC73A6416953BF93826231A8DB6AEADD3D7FCF80210B3DFE1C8D733CC02FB1884641FBCEA604F9998EF3FE0E4797C11F887","orcidId":"0000-0003-1372-6567","documentHash":"11f2f9cc-0a47-42b4-a859-1339732ed7d8"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f3fb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Ruman","uuid":"98ED11210A34E93704E2682BB61980A8DD720FE78F4FFB5D1CE848B5A521A5E60AA36150C71DC9F2676530D649F578147FA3C8BD6B60C71B0F7F5DE4D53150E7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9424-7589","documentHash":"3b16b106-7123-4d0c-aa88-3cfb1da97be0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66f29706fdbe832f680111f1","doi":"10.1007/s13280-024-02069-6","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13280-024-02069-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Heavy rainfalls in Poland and their hyetographs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the light of observed variability in precipitation patterns, there is a growing need for comprehensive data mining of regularly updated rainfall recording databases. Therefore, an analysis of heavy rainfall and hyetographs was conducted using a 30-year high-resolution dataset from 100 rain gauges across Poland, covering 31 646 rainfall events. Distributions of rainfall depths, durations, and intensities were explored, and maxima were compared to global records. Spatial analysis revealed significant variations in the frequency, depths, and durations of extreme rainfall across different regions. Cluster analysis determined model hyetographs for each station. The likelihood of regions belonging to clusters with three to five model hyetographs was assessed using Indicator Kriging. Findings underscore the importance of using local, characteristics rainfalls in hydrodynamic modelling of drainage systems and future rainfall scenarios. These results provide a foundational step towards understanding and monitoring the impacts of climate change on rainfall characteristics, especially extremes, in future decades."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac37a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fd878c28a0473b4848"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ec878c28a04739f3fb","602b53779543c7410626dc4c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"54","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"86-104","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602b53779543c7410626dc4c","66f29706fdbe832f680111f3","5e7092ec878c28a04739f3fb","5e709389878c28a0473ac37a","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4848","66f29706fdbe832f680111f6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f66","mniswId":"830","title":"Ambio","issn":"0044-7447","eissn":"1654-7209","websiteLink":"http://link.springer.com/journal/13280","documentHash":"8e336668-dab9-4a14-8a50-90da82f16e7b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f720cfdbe835856b4170c","year":"2025","volume":"54","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"826ea2a6-5d61-47d8-97bb-b345eac5ec83"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Classification quality assessment indices","Cluster analysis","Heavy rainfalls","Model hyetographs","Poland","Precipitation modelling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060392554"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679357fdfdbe835f61f44d97","name":"Roman","lastName":"Wenne","documentHash":"bda3a7d5-89a2-4e54-abc2-a57b11daeb7c"},{"objectId":"679357fdfdbe835f61f44d96","name":"Marek R.","lastName":"Lipinski","documentHash":"b3c2069d-f311-47e2-97b3-f16c1dc1e43b"},{"objectId":"679357fdfdbe835f61f44d95","name":"Christopher D.","lastName":"McQuaid","documentHash":"f66089aa-a2f5-49bd-89bf-1def49890da3"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6562","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zbawicka","uuid":"C666D80AAC8D5BA5D12E1984EB7EC27BCB09A2EC676A3578D85F558B3723D8FDDCBCBDD92633678834C40C72F59AA9D924C894649D751A5551B7A7521D23E0D0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5156-6184","documentHash":"7ee294a1-069f-4943-8e4c-2b395e31af83"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654e","name":"Anita","lastName":"Poćwierz-Kotus","uuid":"50A9955B8BE3B836A4350CBBC71112A8A4779B75954296C9C09BFA115C4E6F87F09BEEEF8C06C69A45A933E17020BCB977ECD37AE93C99604D081E4BE0829D68","orcidId":"0000-0001-6667-6175","documentHash":"ee21dc22-0ea5-4054-a198-dd57a5d56104"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"679357fdfdbe835f61f44d94","doi":"10.3390/ani14213080","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/14/21/3080/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"SNPs Analysis Indicates Non-Uniform Origins of Invasive Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819) on the Southern African Coast","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Understanding the origins of invasive species is necessary to manage them and predict their potential for spreading. The mussel genus Mytilus forms an important component of coastal ecosystems in the northern and southern hemispheres. M. galloprovincialis is an important invasive species globally, first appearing on the South African coast in the 1970s. Studies using nuclear and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the invasion probably originated from the north-east Atlantic. We used fifty-five polymorphic SNPs to genotype mussels from sites across the coast of South Africa with reference samples from the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, and New Zealand to test for possible introgression of the northern and southern taxa. Low levels of genetic differentiation were confirmed, and all samples grouped with reference samples of the Atlantic form of M. galloprovincialis, supporting previous studies. The SNP genotyping, however, allowed the detection of some individuals with genotypes typical of the Mediterranean, indicating that introduced populations in South Africa do not have a uniform origin. The initial population introduced to South Africa may have been genetically heterogenous from the start, coming from a region influenced by both the Atlantic and Mediterranean.

Recommendations from the first 4 years of SESS reporting represent the point of view of the wide scientific community operating the large observing system implemented in Svalbard (SIOS) since 2018 and aim to identify the scientific potential to further develop the observing system. The recommendations are bottom-up inputs for a continuous process that aims to accomplish the vision and mission of SIOS: optimizing, integrating and further developing the observing system in an Earth system science (ESS) perspective. The primary outcome of the synthesis work is the evidence that ESS in SIOS has, during the first 4 years of operation, naturally developed from individual scientists or smaller groups of scientists to larger disciplinary international groups of scientists working together within the different environments (the atmosphere, the cryosphere, and marine and terrestrial environments). It is clear that strategic efforts towards interdisciplinarity are necessary for operating fully at ESS scale in Svalbard. As Svalbard is experiencing the largest ongoing warming in the Arctic and worldwide, SIOS is in a unique position to perform a full-scale study of all processes impacting ESS dynamics and controlling the water cycle using all parts of the SIOS observation network, with a large potential for increasing the understanding of key mechanisms in the Earth system. We also identify the potential to upscale Svalbard-based observations collected in SIOS to pan-Arctic and global scales, contributing to full-scale ESS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6544"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"933-946","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd485","679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd486","679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd487","679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd488","679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd489","679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd48a","679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd48b","679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd48c","5e709347878c28a0473a6544","679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd48d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779db","mniswId":"5271","title":"Earth System Dynamics","issn":"2190-4979","eissn":"2190-4987","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f71f48a0-a236-4168-916e-dc33338082c8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a1c45fdbe831aedcbd484","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"4","documentHash":"114219e5-41ae-440a-a073-54b35a752039"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060447603"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6615f9a940e3ff2524a62632","name":"NGOC","lastName":"Nguyen","uuid":"AA1E5844A4E7FC87DBE8CFF0663AFCB5D6C6EA4B715251671DC581BE467D5E3924D0C059F461F1E6421EDF0333640662C3D4B429D6F0F8B0805FB3C9E47E4300","documentHash":"219277c1-338f-4bd3-b3c0-9b37d1278722"},{"objectId":"63526358409707615cc906cd","name":"Inès Barrenechea","lastName":"Angeles","documentHash":"2069dab3-b9b2-4968-b7dc-823176f0f7a5"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc64b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pawłowska-Tomkowicz","uuid":"ECA96C4DAEF44CEAAFDCA927360B56292B27A39C3FA3260073AF7F30015E6FC0D280644416C38211573FC5B5D1F01D3EACDC574C132CC2529ED24ED08335C602","orcidId":"0000-0001-9383-9785","documentHash":"cf25fc77-a1b7-49f4-b99e-88374287930d"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6526","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zajączkowski","uuid":"61768C4E190810A84AFC1067320A335E9317C35A01DD9975F8CEB8197E3D86D8F6A9ACECEE6D8E804AE2EBFC8A804CECDF21093A04A3A083FD4F8153BEAB0988","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-7359","documentHash":"aee5a47c-de7d-4323-8adc-7fe11d3cf4f0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-19","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63526358409707615cc906cb","doi":"10.1111/gbi.12530","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gbi.12530","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Metabarcoding reveals high diversity of benthic foraminifera linked to water masses circulation at coastal Svalbard","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Arctic marine biodiversity is undergoing rapid changes due to global warming and\nmodifications of oceanic water masses circulation. These changes have been dem-\nonstrated in the case of mega- and macrofauna, but much less is known about their\nimpact on the biodiversity of smaller size organisms, such as foraminifera that rep-\nresent a main component of meiofauna in the Arctic. Several studies analyzed the\ndistribution and diversity of Arctic foraminifera. However, all these studies are based\nexclusively on the morphological identification of specimens sorted from sediment\nsamples. Here, we present the first assessment of Arctic foraminifera diversity based\non metabarcoding of sediment DNA samples collected in fjords and open sea areas\nin the Svalbard Archipelago. We obtained a total of 5,968,786 reads that represented\n1384 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). More than half of the ASVs (51.7%) could\nnot be assigned to any group in the reference database suggesting a high genetic\nnovelty of Svalbard foraminifera. The sieved and unsieved samples resolved compa-\nrable communities, sharing 1023 ASVs, comprising over 97% of reads. Our analyses\nshow that the foraminiferal assemblage differs between the localities, with commu-\nnities distinctly separated between fjord and open sea stations. Each locality was\ncharacterized by a specific assemblage, with only a small overlap in the case of open\nsea areas. Our study demonstrates a clear pattern of the influence of water masses\non the structure of foraminiferal communities. The stations situated on the western\ncoast of Svalbard that are strongly influenced by warm and salty Atlantic water (AW)\nare characterized by much higher diversity than stations in the northern and eastern\npart, where the impact of AW is less pronounced. This high diversity and specific-\nity of Svalbard foraminifera associated with water mass distribution indicate that the\nforaminiferal metabarcoding data can be very useful for inferring present and past\nenvironmental conditions in the Arctic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut

a globally recognised benchmark for democratic environmental governance. However, no assessment exists on whether European MPAs comply with the legal standards set out by the Convention. Here, we focus on public authorities’ websites on MPAs as tools for promoting transparency, public involvement, and democratic processes. We assessed the websites of 61 European MPAs in thirteen countries using a survey structured by the three pillars of the Convention: access to information, participation in decision-making, and access to justice. We show that while most websites are used to disseminate information, they do not serve yet as participatory instruments. Very few have an area dedicated to public participation in decision-making and, when available, they provide scarce information on the outcomes of public involvement. Most websites provide general information on the MPA conservation objectives, but less than half provide access to reports on the results of management. Few websites provide information on available means to challenge unlawful acts. Websites’ potential as one of the most widely used, easily accessible, cost-effective sources of information and means for interaction with the general public should be better exploited. Increasing and facilitating the ability of the public to participate in MPA processes is key to ensure MPA success and environmental justice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

Utilizing paleoceanographic proxies and advanced modeling, we unveil a distinct subsurface water cooling, associated with a stepwise increase in sea-ice cover in the eastern Fram Strait. Our findings emphasize the role of Greenland Sea deep convection onset and the subsequent westward shift in Atlantic Water flow, enabling sea-ice advection from the Barents Sea. The heightened sea-ice cover weakened Atlantic Water advection, perturbing thermohaline circulation in the eastern Nordic Seas. These perturbations propagated worldwide, affecting North Atlantic deep-water circulation, inducing widespread hemispheric cooling, shifting the Intertropical Convergence Zone southward, and weakening the East Asian monsoon. Incorporating results from the Transient simulations of Climate Evolution of the last 21,000 years (TraCE-21ka) supports and augments proxy-based paleoreconstructions, underscoring sea-ice dynamics and ocean circulation's critical influence. This study highlights the potential for localized cold events within ostensibly warm climatic intervals. It underscores the need to comprehend their mechanisms for precise climate predictions and informed policymaking toward a sustainable future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","5e709347878c28a0473a6526"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"344","pagesFromTo":"109002","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","679b4175fdbe8318b4c9c70c","679b4175fdbe8318b4c9c70d","5e709347878c28a0473a6526"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454794a0","mniswId":"16947","title":"QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS","issn":"0277-3791","eissn":"0277-3791","documentHash":"0bf31882-aca7-4b59-9c93-dd68715dcab6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ed4eeefdbe83567c6e9dbf","year":"2024","volume":"344","documentHash":"49f72877-de37-4eb3-bc18-26c10451b4dd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060449812"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b702ffdbe8318b4cd780b","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Schwaha","documentHash":"aac7a13e-019d-4695-8432-d66b62cf7b09"},{"objectId":"679b702ffdbe8318b4cd780a","name":"Juan","lastName":"López-Gappa","documentHash":"67f6fc91-a52a-4219-b8ef-e468f48c86bc"},{"objectId":"679b702ffdbe8318b4cd7809","name":"Abigail M.","lastName":"Smith","documentHash":"c50f275d-2b1a-4c23-bae8-b5c0483dd66a"},{"objectId":"679b702ffdbe8318b4cd7808","name":"Ahmed J.","lastName":"Saadi","documentHash":"51513222-f67b-4200-96fb-eba0d7e3659d"},{"objectId":"679b702ffdbe8318b4cd7807","name":"Mildred J.","lastName":"Johnson","documentHash":"20a5bff5-c018-41c6-b51f-cd77d7d30700"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2024-06-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679b702ffdbe8318b4cd7806","doi":"10.1007/s13127-024-00645-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13127-024-00645-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Digging into boring bryozoans: new characters and new species of Immergentiidae","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Immergentia is an endolithic genus of ctenostome bryozoans and the sole member of the Immergentiidae. Etchings of their typical spindled-shaped and sometimes enantiomorphic borehole aperture in calcium carbonate substrates are accomplished by chemical dissolution. The tentacle crown of the bryozoan is essentially the only body part that extends beyond the shell surface when protruded. Previously, species were mainly described using external colony and zooidal characteristics or whole mounts, with partial histological sections conducted on a single species in 1947. Modern approaches, however, are hitherto missing. We examined the soft body morphology of Immergentia from different locations with confocal laser scanning microscopy and the production of 3D reconstructions. In addition, zooidal characteristics such as tentacle number, size, tubulets, and interzooidal distances were used to distinguish and describe species. The combination of conventional and modern methods revealed the presence of a cardiac constrictor and intercalary kenozooids that can interpose between the cystid appendages, something not previously reported in immergentiids, thus necessitating an amendment of the family diagnosis. The polypide typically has eight to ten tentacles, and the anus is positioned in the low or mid-lophophoral area. In addition, sequence data, including the mitogenome and the nuclear ribosomal genes (18S and 28S) of four species from five locations, are presented for the first time. Based on molecular and morphological data, a novel intertidal immergentiid from France, Immergentia stephanieae sp. nov., and a subtidal species from New Zealand, I. pohowskii sp. nov., are described. This work supplements the rather sparse existing knowledge on Immergentiidae and proposes additional characteristics to complement existing descriptions in order to enhance future species identification."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"217-256","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b702ffdbe8318b4cd7807","679b702ffdbe8318b4cd7808","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","679b702ffdbe8318b4cd7809","679b702ffdbe8318b4cd780a","679b702ffdbe8318b4cd780b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479132","mniswId":"15540","title":"ORGANISMS DIVERSITY & EVOLUTION","issn":"1439-6092","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"dd7dae3b-c173-4db2-954a-abfe0b7e03ea"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060449959"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e9878c28a0473c6b52","name":"Marek","lastName":"DAWIDZIUK","uuid":"E5B5EF670A27652D3759A7D6B83777BFF3B9898F91DF079E74C4808D9CA5BE58544EF9A1FA8F41340D9A9C9BFFCDBD835FDA6D36BE68F0978A7613BB8D3B12CD","documentHash":"a766390b-a2bf-4e85-a143-fa4be02578f7"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf351","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"3C318FDFC2E2976AB579E611D2BAFB0BA54C701999936F34B50FE2A2E40DA03ECEB9A33D5F1B40FA8C33023F04FB8E275A10DC36C0313F424FAA6963570761E0","documentHash":"66f62ffd-0ec3-410f-8fb3-8ead844eeb47"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6525","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Walczowski","uuid":"3C05D7E2F324D389685EB67F5114F749AEDBE4240E429C16EF3E6C1CD8838EB626FB22887985BFB823C2E45775D6558649B8943F3877BC967D69D19F5411A29D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0243-3307","documentHash":"601253a2-b41f-4f16-9e10-04aa9485efb2"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391c8e","name":"Adam","lastName":"OLEJNIK","uuid":"4298C62105FE06F2EF7EB8AAAFC2E01A126C8062D7BF10D7669F6DE8000E57ABAA165F71EBE7DC5BD10AB1601095997908BB155C99F1CFBE04AE9288B793A8FF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1199-5835","documentHash":"c310143f-1488-44d4-948b-44a8af204461"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a04739050a","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"JAKUS","uuid":"4725616F6437EAC3544BB77452D05F49C5EED3CE992464B413575C6036A1121C295FB71225C3AC540FF2CC990BFBB4DF5A39892CACB099B2F8C1C32EB9B84A2C","documentHash":"1ab637fd-1a69-446d-83e9-d26b74616140"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-10-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67641528fdbe830ff2fbd436","doi":"10.2478/phr-2023-0002","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/phr-2023-0002","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Design Optimisation of the Rescue Device for the Argo Profiling Float-SWOT/TOWS Analysis of Design Variants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

This study indicates a large spatial variability in the contamination degree of examined sites by petroleum-derived chemicals. Hopanes and steranes along with UCM appeared to have the highest potential to identify petroleum sources in studied locations, whereas investigations based on alkanes and PAHs seemed to be considerably affected by inputs of modern biogenic and combustion-derived materials, respectively.

Studies were screened for relevant publications of marine taxa displaying bipolar or antitropical distributions, and data were extracted in order to perform a numerical summary of aspects including temporal trends, taxa representation and agreement with this article's standardised definitions. Additional data were gathered from The Arctic Register of Marine Species (ARMS) and The Register of Antarctic Marine Species (RAMS) databases. Distribution data were then extracted to verify the potential bipolarity of species present in both databases.\nResults\nFrom 221 articles, 665 marine taxa records were extracted, of which 517 records were categorised as antitropical and 148 as bipolar. Molecular evidence existed for 25% of non-paleontological records. A considerable amount of records (44%) did not match the definitions used in this review. The data taken from ARMS and RAMS revealed 408 shared species, of which 41 species were listed as bipolar by the literature collected in this study.\nMain Conclusions\nMarine bipolarity and antitropicality have been topics of interest since the 1800s, especially between 2008 and 2017. However, the discrepancy between the number of potentially bipolar species in publicly available species databases and literature-based estimates underscores the need for further research of neglected taxa. Future research should prioritise including molecular evidence, transparent terminology and interdisciplinary approaches to address the complexities of marine disjunct distributions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["618353b97523400564d8208b","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"52","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"454-466","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["618353b97523400564d8208b","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e726602467f01e930a48e9","title":"Journal of Biogeography","issn":"0305-0270","eissn":"0305-0270","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2699","documentHash":"a2991a0a-bc26-4ed4-9f4a-51c530ed6e3c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673b076efdbe8313779d5d7a","year":"2024","documentHash":"4e08b82f-35f7-4773-9bc7-dda8b2d1d299"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060474117"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1e","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Cosenza","documentHash":"17ae1d5c-d69b-44e6-b88f-acf5150dc024"},{"objectId":"67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1d","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Zappalà","documentHash":"d1b57d19-6918-4074-80d0-c5a100da4152"},{"objectId":"67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1c","name":"Giovanna","lastName":"Maimone","documentHash":"e48e6b61-cc4b-446b-8c84-bc2190874394"},{"objectId":"67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1b","name":"Alessandro Ciro","lastName":"Rappazzo","documentHash":"fcc2d220-3e26-4b2c-b131-a47f51c1ef14"},{"objectId":"67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1a","name":"Gabriella","lastName":"Caruso","documentHash":"5b3b25e4-6679-4319-aa4e-0e3252531636"},{"objectId":"5e709467878c28a0473bc51c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Szubska","uuid":"062ACC65E87986B93D5605269122BB49784820812CDDBC9682B3AD8850AE7C63C099C26BB85C910D0F1CA045FE42E8903B4BE2127DCB23692505772D27825003","orcidId":"0000-0003-0716-5177","documentHash":"3ec85d79-d997-487f-a44a-80852d221148"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6544","name":"Agata","lastName":"Zaborska","uuid":"FE40EF42F9E848E1D09D278DBA4FECC8CD79F3BC581694CBDEC7B3EE47F2AC0C2688E35AC59379BC3BC9C53F432C7CF089A8C0E8D1D11ACB2050D908A2E6CF9E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1432-7421","documentHash":"f9a20830-9869-4364-97d8-deb620a80580"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67935b08fdbe835f61f47f18","doi":"10.3390/environments11070148","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/11/7/148/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Svalbard Fjord Sediments as a Hotspot of Functional Diversity and a Reservoir of Antibiotic Resistance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The sea bottom acts as a key natural archive where the memory of long-term timescale environmental changes is recorded. This study discusses some ecological and chemical features of fjord sediments that were explored during the AREX cruise carried out in the Svalbard archipelago in the summer of 2021. The activity rates of the enzymes leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), beta-glucosidase (GLU), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) and community-level physiological profiles (CLPPs) were studied with the aim of determining the functional diversity of the benthic microbial community, while bacterial isolates were screened for their susceptibility to antibiotics in order to explore the role of these extreme environments as potential reservoirs of antibiotic resistance. Enzyme activity rates were obtained using fluorogenic substrates, and CLPPs were obtained using Biolog Ecoplates; antibiotic susceptibility assays were performed through the standard disk diffusion method. Spatial trends observed in the functional profiles of the microbial community suggested variability in the microbial community’s composition, presumably related to the patchy distribution of organic substrates. Complex carbon sources, carbohydrates, and amino acids were the organic polymers preferentially metabolized by the microbial community. Multi-resistance to enrofloxacin and tetracycline was detected in all of the examined samples, stressing the role of sediments as a potential reservoir of chemical wastes ascribable to antibiotic residuals. This study provides new insights on the health status of fjord sediments of West Spitsbergen, applying a dual ecological and biochemical approach. Microbial communities in the fjord sediments showed globally a good functional diversity, suggesting their versatility to rapidly react to changing conditions. The lack of significant diversification among the three studied areas suggests that microbial variables alone cannot be suitable descriptors of sediment health, and that additional measures (i.e., physical–chemical characteristics) should be taken to better define environmental status."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6544","5e709467878c28a0473bc51c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"148","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1a","67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1b","67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1c","67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1d","67935b08fdbe835f61f47f1e","5e709467878c28a0473bc51c","5e709347878c28a0473a6544"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c055","mniswId":"5857","title":"ENVIRONMENTS","issn":"2076-3298","eissn":"2076-3298","documentHash":"83a121c6-f6c1-41b8-b25b-446b19f771a2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67935b08fdbe835f61f47f19","year":"2024","volume":"11","number":"7","documentHash":"14edc7d4-3611-4b93-85d4-4e9071320e3a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sediments","heterotrophic bacteria","carbon substrate utilization profiles","antibiotic resistance","Svalbard fjords","functional diversity","health status"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060481455"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67444663fdbe832ec1e9d769","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wojczulanis‐Jakubas","documentHash":"c9f71843-1088-4c9b-a695-2a4e082516f5"},{"objectId":"67444663fdbe832ec1e9d767","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Jakubas","documentHash":"96f5281f-272d-430b-a382-b4040d63ceae"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af9ea","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kotarba","uuid":"4B8174AB98895DF22FB3960F405C2AFD531E427CEE6F061964A5D09BAACBEAB4B0B6B173B18380E586E059D66359FBCCE46728A1C817CC719F389D00465B9F2C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7982-1992","documentHash":"b70e7fc3-8e39-455b-80c1-04d3d11dd66e"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a04739908e","name":"Kaja","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"DC4B6179C4BD45647A1AEC1A76F4970C284A277C74A65EF0206528E300D22A714A37898D76C5CFC3122008C9AA87A669D98B85255244FCE7601B67EA1A03DD4F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5377-3574","documentHash":"4da606d3-5829-4a94-ad26-33ddead1eb52"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-11-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67444663fdbe832ec1e9d765","doi":"10.1002/rse2.425","publicUri":"https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rse2.425","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Illuminating the Arctic: Unveiling seabird responses to artificial light during polar darkness through citizen science and remote sensing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Artiﬁcial light at night (ALAN) has global impacts on animals, often negative,\nyet its effects in polar regions remains largely underexplored.

Many studies utilise a quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach to ascertain the expression of target genes under experimental conditions. Such an approach relies heavily on the selection of reference genes with stable expression. Yet certain housekeeping genes are commonly used in this role, often without due consideration of their overall expression patterns. Therefore, new approaches should be developed to identify stable reference genes for a given species and to expand the general pool of genes suitable for the reference in qPCR analysis.\nMethods and results\nHere RNA-seq data of nine flounder organs led to identify four candidate genes of the most stable expression. It was achieved by differential expression analysis and tritoconstrictor script. Specific primers were designed for the complete ORF as well as for qPCR analysis. RT-qPCR efficiencies were tested on ORF amplicon templates. Most of the genes tested showed good amplification in a wide range of template dilutions (107-101), with a correlation coefficient (R2) ranging from 0.991 to 0.998 and a consistent efficiency (E) (Sybr Green I staining and TaqMan molecular probe).\nConclusions\nThe proposed approach based on differential expression analysis and a new bioinformatic tool is an appropriate selection method of candidates for reference genes in qPCR. The proposed approach, combining differential expression analysis with a new bioinformatics tool, provides an effective method for selecting reference gene candidates for qPCR. As a result, we can propose four genes (polr2f, yif1a, sf3b6, uba52), each with a set of validated primers, as suitable for consideration as reference genes in qPCR analysis in European flounder, an emerging model species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

of primary production explains the richness of pioneering benthic communities","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A pattern of increasing species richness from the poles to the equator is frequently observed in many animal taxa. Ecological limits, determined by the abiotic conditions and biotic interactions within an environment, are one of the major factors influencing the geographical distribution of species diversity. Energy availability is often considered a crucial limiting factor, with temperature and productivity serving as empirical measures. However, these measures may not fully explain the observed species richness, particularly in marine ecosystems. Here, through a global comparative approach and standardised methodologies, such as Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) and DNA metabarcoding, we show that the seasonality of primary production explains sessile animal richness comparatively or better than surface temperature or primary productivity alone. A Hierarchical Generalised Additive Model (HGAM) is validated, after a model selection procedure, and the prediction error is compared, following a cross-validation approach, with HGAMs including environmental variables commonly used to explain animal richness. Moreover, the linear effect of production magnitude on species richness becomes apparent only when considered jointly with seasonality, and, by identifying world coastal areas characterized by extreme values of both, we postulate that this effect may result in a positive relationship in environments with lower seasonality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6562","5fb3d234085dcb64f926a04c","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e709347878c28a0473a654e","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","5e709306878c28a0473a15be"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679a0169fdbe831aedc9f43e","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f43f","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f440","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f441","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","5fb3d234085dcb64f926a04c","5e709306878c28a0473a15be","5e709347878c28a0473a654e","5e709347878c28a0473a6562","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f442","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f443","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f444","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f445","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f446","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f447","679a0169fdbe831aedc9f448"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f7e","mniswId":"14814","title":"Nature Communications","issn":"2041-1723","eissn":"2041-1723","documentHash":"8ac6042b-5d3a-47c7-90e7-2c25bff3698a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ddd45040970770919addaa","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"3ae44993-1507-4b06-989e-c915ad719abd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060508061"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a2ba3fdbe831aedccef55","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Kudłak","documentHash":"ad46373e-18bc-4deb-8ac5-197a584e5f7b"},{"objectId":"60c32ca09543c72336543fce","name":"Lilianna","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"015BB5DCF65C51926AE7DD3FAE9D7BB6464861F594692F712C793CEAC20E4F08B13196926595E8EB1CEDD661F83D58E8035A57BBA23BB11EC381C8F1B2378104","documentHash":"26bd2a71-52c7-49c2-865d-214b5022e3ca"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85f9","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Siedlewicz","uuid":"DC70C9407291968D20364B0D804E3CA7B8B11A9822DB3809A95A3E086374B2D4E9812F44882A19DF53C23C7134702AB499958CD192CDD2E3D12D44494596F449","orcidId":"0000-0002-3948-1097","documentHash":"7a8cbb94-e357-4660-a972-b1551afd1803"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6545","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stoń-Egiert","uuid":"761936593A0A85A183D4328C890367B2F2F64EA207CBA8ABD568F50DE6BCEADC3C2ACFAC4786EF77370FE85E6437FA754AFFD2F08C89E1B051CDC877FA69B923","orcidId":"0000-0002-4274-8979","documentHash":"eef72685-4d70-4808-a6da-0ffdedc9843e"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b20","name":"Ksenia","lastName":"Pazdro","uuid":"6538DFA042434F944EC3F934E8085434F2F9A5F7DA28C2F322EFC9FCA07523B4807443385DC8947D7F1AC9EA4A37393C4041BA2DDE8C79642BF66690FA9FB669","orcidId":"0000-0003-0283-1468","documentHash":"870f628d-167d-4246-99f6-00e6c1024232"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679a2ba3fdbe831aedccef53","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.177080","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969724072371?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Impact of emerging pollutants mixtures on marine and brackish phytoplankton: diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"abk","content":"Pharmaceuticals and ionic liquids (ILs) are emerging as significant micropollutants with environmental presence and potential ecological impacts. The possible simultaneous occurrence of these two groups of pollutants in aquatic environments raises complex challenges due to their diverse chemical properties and potential for interactive effects. Given the documented widespread presence of pharmaceuticals and the emerging concerns about ILs, the study aims to evaluate the adverse effects of binary mixtures of imidazolium ionic liquid IM1-8C(CN)3 and two representatives of pharmaceuticals: antibiotic oxytetracycline (OXTC) and metabolite carbamazepine 10,11 epoxide (CBZ-E) on the brackish cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa and the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum during chronic exposure experiments. A comprehensive approach was employed, incorporating various endpoints including oxidative stress, chlorophyll a fluorescence, detailed photoprotective and photosynthetic pigment profiles of target microorganisms to assess modes of action and identify the mixture effects of the selected substances.\nThe observed alterations in pigment production affecting carotenoids synthesis in both selected species may be attributed to the differential impacts of these substances on the photosynthetic pathways and metabolic processes in the cyanobacterial and diatom cells. Changes in chlorophyll a fluorescence-specific parameters suggest impairment of the photosynthetic activity, particularly affecting the efficiency of photosystem II.\nThe application of Concentration Addition (CA) and Independent Action (IA) mathematical models, complemented by the evaluation of Model Deviation Ratios (MDR), revealed predominantly antagonistic interactions within the studied mixtures.

In Kongsfjorden, the decreasing population of polar cod is experiencing a shift in their prey community from Arctic to Atlantic zooplankton and fish. Simultaneously, the abundance of Atlantic cod Gadus morhua is increasing. In this study, we explore seasonal dietary patterns, foraging strategies, and potential competition between these 2 gadids in Kongsfjorden via stomach content analyses. Polar cod diet by proportion biomass (B) was dominated by pricklebacks (family Stichaeidae) and conspecifics during polar night (B = 72.7%) and by Calanus spp. (B = 52.4%) and Themisto spp. during summer (B = 31.2%). Atlantic cod diet was dominated by polar cod in both seasons (polar night: B = 37.4%; summer: B = 93.6%). Despite high dietary overlap (Schoener’s D = 0.67) between similarly sized polar cod and Atlantic cod (9–25 cm) during polar night, competition for food between these species is likely relatively low due to polar cod having high individual specialization in their foraging strategies. However, continued Atlantification, and increased abundance of the now established population of Atlantic cod, is a threat to polar cod because of direct consumption of the smaller species by the larger. The high predation rates by Atlantic cod on polar cod also make it a potential competitor with other top predators in the region, which could have negative consequences for local sea birds and marine mammals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6500"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"747","pagesFromTo":"117-132","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6799fb79fdbe831aedc98b30","6799fb79fdbe831aedc98b31","5e709347878c28a0473a6500","6799fb79fdbe831aedc98b32","6799fb79fdbe831aedc98b33"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d68","mniswId":"13911","title":"MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES","issn":"0171-8630","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"f2bdb7a6-fcbd-4ce5-afbf-4f8176865970"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6799fb79fdbe831aedc98b2f","year":"2024","volume":"747","documentHash":"4bd041fa-0c42-478c-9841-e01522478a12"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Atlantification","Arctic","Barents Sea","Climate change","Dietary overlap","Gadid","Seasonal variation","Stomach contents"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060508253"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6615f9a940e3ff2524a62632","name":"NGOC","lastName":"Nguyen","uuid":"AA1E5844A4E7FC87DBE8CFF0663AFCB5D6C6EA4B715251671DC581BE467D5E3924D0C059F461F1E6421EDF0333640662C3D4B429D6F0F8B0805FB3C9E47E4300","documentHash":"219277c1-338f-4bd3-b3c0-9b37d1278722"},{"objectId":"656f1ae040970720e1ff7d2c","name":"Thanh-Tam","lastName":"Ho","documentHash":"f733dcad-02cb-40e5-90c0-d66e7a51e6a4"},{"objectId":"656f1ae040970720e1ff7d2b","name":"Thi Hong Trang","lastName":"Pham","documentHash":"09a92c87-fde3-4891-8b6a-381d8c1468ff"},{"objectId":"656f1ae040970720e1ff7d2a","name":"Van Toan","lastName":"Le","documentHash":"ccc14109-6310-4646-91c5-59115ff015d3"},{"objectId":"656f1ae040970720e1ff7d29","name":"Tien Dat","lastName":"Nguyen","documentHash":"5201aaf4-37ab-412d-b1a6-d96d2bbe22cd"},{"objectId":"656f1ae040970720e1ff7d28","name":"Thi Hong Tham","lastName":"Nguyen","documentHash":"ab71c023-ad29-4217-8aa4-2179eac167c9"},{"objectId":"656f1ae040970720e1ff7d27","name":"Thi Tham","lastName":"Luong","documentHash":"27be16e7-3ff2-40a1-8096-ec162a50f93a"}],"objectId":"656f1ae040970720e1ff7d25","doi":"10.4014/jmb.2308.08037","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2308.08037","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Degradation of Triazole Fungicides by Plant Growth-Promoting Bacteria from Contaminated Agricultural Soil","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The widespread application of triazole fungicides (TFs) in agricultural practices can result in the considerable accumulation of active compound residues in the soil and a subsequent negative impact on the soil microbiota and crop health. In this study, we isolated three TF-degrading bacterial strains from contaminated agricultural soils and identified them as Klebsiella sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Citrobacter sp. based on analysis of morphological characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequences. The strains used three common TFs, namely hexaconazole, difenoconazole, and propiconazole, as their only sources of carbon and energy for growth in a liquid mineral salt medium, with high concentrations (~ 500 mg/l) of each TF. In addition to the ability to degrade fungicides, the isolates also exhibited plant growth-promoting characteristics, such as nitrogen fixation, indole acetic acid production, phosphate dissolution, and cellulose degradation. The synergistic combination of three bacterial isolates significantly improved plant growth and development with an increased survival rate (57%), and achieved TF degradation ranging from 85.83 to 96.59% at a concentration of approximately 50 mg/kg of each TF within 45 days in the soil-plant system.

However, little is known about how accurately marine biodiversity is recorded in sediment eDNA archives, especially planktonic taxa. Here, we address this question by comparing eukaryotic diversity in 273 eDNA samples from three water depths and the surface sediments of 24 stations in the Nordic Seas. Analysis of 18S-V9 metabarcoding data reveals distinct eukaryotic assemblages between water and sediment eDNA. Only 40% of Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) detected in water were also found in sediment eDNA. Remarkably, the ASVs shared between water and sediment accounted for 80% of total sequence reads suggesting that a large amount of plankton DNA is transported to the seafloor, predominantly from abundant phytoplankton taxa. However, not all plankton taxa were equally archived on the seafloor. The plankton DNA deposited in the sediments was dominated by diatoms and showed an underrepresentation of certain nano- and picoplankton taxa (Picozoa or Prymnesiophyceae). Our study offers the first insights into the patterns of plankton diversity recorded in sediment in relation to seasonality and spatial variability of environmental conditions in the Nordic Seas. Our results suggest that the genetic composition and structure of the plankton community vary considerably throughout the water column and differ from what accumulates in the sediment. Hence, the interpretation of sedimentary eDNA archives should take into account potential taxonomic and abundance biases when reconstructing past changes in marine biodiversity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","6615f9a940e3ff2524a62632","5e709347878c28a0473a6526","5e709469878c28a0473bc64b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6615f9a940e3ff2524a62632","5e709469878c28a0473bc64b","5e709347878c28a0473a6526","679b4678fdbe8318b4c9e135","679b4678fdbe8318b4c9e136","679b4678fdbe8318b4c9e137","679b4678fdbe8318b4c9e138","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478eed","mniswId":"14545","title":"Molecular Ecology Resources","issn":"1755-098X","eissn":"1755-0998","documentHash":"899c8774-8cb0-4415-8f3f-735539b56a73"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b4678fdbe8318b4c9e133","year":"2024","volume":"24","number":"8","documentHash":"de51af5a-e239-4c80-befe-4b3bac01d7be"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["environmental DNA","eukaryotes","marine biodiversity","metabarcoding","taphonomy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060511736"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0d0","name":"Ulrike","lastName":"Braeckman","documentHash":"ba3998b8-c68c-49e9-9e49-28ea17d30d02"},{"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0cf","name":"Frank","lastName":"Wenzhöfer","documentHash":"ad976e9f-9371-4a91-9fcc-86a6b750d1f0"},{"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0ce","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Krumpen","documentHash":"78bce364-68f3-40b6-94d9-c7ae9139e418"},{"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0cd","name":"Janine","lastName":"Felden","documentHash":"53d08c6c-88ef-4eeb-946c-cb1294f12553"},{"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0cc","name":"William G.","lastName":"Ambrose","documentHash":"70a7e25e-4991-4abd-87a9-478d1ac4d7ed"},{"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0cb","name":"Luana","lastName":"Da Costa Monteiro","documentHash":"534024d8-ddb8-405d-810a-3305d650b681"},{"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0ca","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Lins","documentHash":"262cbc7e-c05d-420e-8c1c-85a019b16893"},{"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0c9","name":"Paul E.","lastName":"Renaud","documentHash":"753a57b3-f700-4917-b938-eb9e636d9c5e"},{"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0c8","name":"Yasemin V.","lastName":"Bodur","documentHash":"1f161c4a-3e30-45dd-8409-c8c0c0300549"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651e","name":"Maria","lastName":"Włodarska-Kowalczuk","uuid":"D47553F9A2C33D8033D8594650BFC32CC9C68EF6F3EE4CE130DBEC8BA3DF82ED9A7055BF1E4316109AD31C2E6DBEF73F3FEF158A522731E002B07E209F106EDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2757-1108","documentHash":"01d767d9-9266-45a4-bd4b-a8cf8d1e8a8e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0c7","doi":"10.1525/elementa.2023.00005","publicUri":"https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/article-pdf/doi/10.1525/elementa.2023.00005/807394/elementa.2023.00005.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Weakened pelagic-benthic coupling on an Arctic outflow shelf (Northeast Greenland) suggested by benthic ecosystem changes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Arctic marine ecosystems are becoming more boreal due to climate change. Predictions of ecosystem change focus mainly on Arctic inflow or interior shelves, with few comprehensive studies on Arctic outflow regions. During September–October 2017, soft-bottom communities were sampled and benthic ecosystem processes were quantified at 12 stations on the Northeast Greenland shelf (outflow shelf) and compared to the last regional ecosystem study, conducted in 1992 and 1993. The benthic habitat was characterized in terms of sediment granulometry, pigment concentrations, and porewater chemistry (dissolved inorganic carbon, nutrients). Total abundance and biomass of macrobenthos and meiobenthos, bacterial abundance, porewater dissolved inorganic carbon and ammonium concentrations were higher on the outer shelf compared to locations adjacent to the Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden glacier at 79°N and the inner shelf stations (e.g., macrofauna: 1,964–2,952 vs. 18–1,381 individuals m−2). These results suggest higher benthic production in the outer parts of the NEG shelf. This difference was also pronounced in macrobenthic and meiobenthic community structure, which was driven mainly by food availability (pigments with 1.3–4.3 vs. 0.3–0.9 µg g−1 sediment, higher total organic carbon content and bacterial abundance). Compared to the early 1990s, warmer bottom water temperatures, increased number of sea-ice-free days and lower sediment pigment concentrations in 2017 were accompanied by decreased polychaete and increased nematode abundance and diversity, and a different community structure of nematode genera. The present study confirms previous reports of strong pelagic-benthic coupling on the NEG shelf, but highlights a possible weakening since the early 1990s, with a potential shift in importance from macrofauna to meiofauna in the benthic community. Increasing inflow of Atlantic water and decreasing volume transport and thickness of sea ice through the Fram Strait, probably affecting the Northeast Water Polynya, may be responsible, suggesting ecosystem-wide consequences of continued changes in sea-ice patterns on Arctic shelves."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a651e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0c8","679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0c9","679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0ca","679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0cb","679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0cc","679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0cd","679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0ce","679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0cf","5e709347878c28a0473a651e","679b6846fdbe8318b4ccb0d0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bff3","mniswId":"5590","title":"Elementa-Science of the Anthropocene","issn":"2325-1026","eissn":"2325-1026","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"62b408a3-f2ab-48d6-bd03-ec10365e773c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bentho-pelagic coupling","Northeast Water Polynya","Macrobenthos, Polychaeta","Meiobenthos","Biogeochemistry","Sediment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060511750"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9ff","name":"Samuel S.","lastName":"Bowser","documentHash":"d2435a1c-8461-4dfe-8a0a-5b52fb47a15b"},{"objectId":"679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9fe","name":"Andrew J.","lastName":"Gooday","documentHash":"59095867-0c72-4d27-8b2a-81823c84659a"},{"objectId":"679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9fd","name":"Steven D.","lastName":"Hanes","documentHash":"86bfee1b-0add-4fe1-b70a-7c581352b7e3"},{"objectId":"679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9fc","name":"Stephen P.","lastName":"Alexander","documentHash":"83eab63b-b593-416f-baf5-8a1fc8f7cba6"},{"objectId":"679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9fb","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Habura","documentHash":"56cf711c-9fbc-4fb4-898f-1aefbbc0b37f"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9f9","doi":"10.5194/jm-43-337-2024","publicUri":"https://jm.copernicus.org/articles/43/337/2024/jm-43-337-2024.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Distribution of two notodendrodid foraminiferal congeners in McMurdo Sound, Antarctica: an example of extreme regional endemism?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We used morphological and molecular surveys to determine the presence or absence of Notodendrodes antarctikos and its congener, Notodendrodes hyalinosphaira, at diverse sites within McMurdo Sound, Antarctica.

Our results suggest that N. antarctikos is a highly endemic protist and may have one of the most restricted ranges ever reported for an Antarctic organism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"337-347","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9fb","679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9fc","679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9fd","679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9fe","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9ff"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e720dd2467f01e9303ff10","title":"Journal of Micropalaeontology","issn":"0262-821x","eissn":"2041-4978","websiteLink":"http://www.tmsoc.org/publications/","documentHash":"1d0893ae-28e9-4398-a042-266d3238193d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b4244fdbe8318b4c9c9fa","year":"2024","volume":"43","number":"2","documentHash":"c5c7c443-07dc-4b2a-bed3-03b33000566f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060511971"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfb5","name":"Rolf","lastName":"Gradinger","documentHash":"eb29b4a8-b606-4819-9dd5-eb8fd0088c92"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfb4","name":"Magnus","lastName":"Aune","documentHash":"de091030-ac09-4420-9694-6d5d61ac939f"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfb3","name":"Marie","lastName":"Porter","documentHash":"ed04799b-385f-4c44-b7fc-8da1885e598f"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfb2","name":"Lionel","lastName":"Camus","documentHash":"30c9f214-ea1a-46e7-840c-73ab351be99a"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfb1","name":"Muriel","lastName":"Dunn","documentHash":"75d3c663-5857-41b2-ae60-d4eac9cc91ee"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfb0","name":"Frida","lastName":"Cnossen","documentHash":"58469839-4d97-4163-a98c-8ddb11b53aaf"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfaf","name":"Einat","lastName":"Sandbank","documentHash":"5e4f5350-99cc-417a-9f76-5293b4132b6c"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfae","name":"Karley","lastName":"Campbell","documentHash":"5030ee01-6338-4db0-9e3d-95f406255dfd"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfad","name":"Mark","lastName":"Inall","documentHash":"d6f9a744-b504-4ad5-b236-9c6d7b126112"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfac","name":"Sünnje","lastName":"Basedow","documentHash":"51cf9a46-bf2a-40a2-b88d-4e4bbb221ef3"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfab","name":"Maxime","lastName":"Geoffroy","documentHash":"9b7dc28d-f457-4af5-a06f-efde4d7cb9bc"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfaa","name":"Eva","lastName":"Leu","documentHash":"66599544-2f2b-4516-8d1b-358d017d0297"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfa9","name":"Malin","lastName":"Daase","documentHash":"8f55163d-73e3-497c-ab8d-cb2c0247969e"},{"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfa8","name":"Paul E.","lastName":"Renaud","documentHash":"0397e341-e0a6-48f2-82da-372825852b95"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679b7380fdbe8318b4cddfa6","doi":"10.1016/j.pocean.2024.103365","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S007966112400171X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Extreme mismatch between phytoplankton and grazers during Arctic spring blooms and consequences for the pelagic food-web","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Food-web structure determines the cycling pathways and fate of new production in marine ecosystems. Herbivorous zooplankton populations are usually seasonally coupled with pelagic primary producers. Synchrony of phytoplankton blooms with reproduction, recruitment and seasonal ascent of their main grazers ensures efficient transfer of organic carbon to higher trophic levels, including commercially harvested species, especially in high-latitude systems. Changes in light, nutrient, and sea-ice dynamics due to accelerating climate change in the Arctic, however, create large uncertainties in how these systems will function in the future. To address such knowledge gaps, we surveyed the pelagic ecosystem of the Barents Sea Polar Front in May of two consecutive years (2021 and 2022) to investigate the pelagic food-web from primary producers to planktivorous fish. In both years we observed unprecedentedly high phytoplankton chlorophyll a values in open as well as ice-covered waters, much of which was invisible to satellite remote sensing. We also measured very low densities of grazing zooplankton across a wide area and extending for at least one month. This extreme mismatch resulted in low feeding by capelin, and further suggests a high potential for vertical export of carbon to the benthos rather than efficient assimilation into the pelagic food web. As the Arctic continues to warm and is characterized by thinner and more mobile sea ice, we may expect higher variability in phytoplankton bloom phenology and more frequent mismatches with grazer life-histories. This could have significant impacts on ecosystem functioning by re-directing the flow of energy through the system towards seafloor rather than to the production of commercially valuable pelagic marine resources."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

diverse and dominant group of marine meiofauna with high potential as bioindicators of the ecological quality status (EcoQS). The present study explores, for the first time, the applicability of the nematode metabarcoding to infer EcoQS index based on the calibration of ecological behaviors of nematodes Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). To achieve this, we analyzed the nematode community in sediment eDNA samples collected in 2018 and 2021 in areas around three offshore oil platforms in the Danish west coast of the North Sea. One training dataset based on eDNA and environmental data from the three platforms in 2021 covering a wide range of environmental gradients has been used as a training dataset to assign the nematodes ASVs to Ecological Groups. These assignments then allowed us to infer the EcoQS both around these three platforms and in an independent dataset (one of the platforms sampled in 2018). The EcoQS inferred from the nema-gAMBI is perfectly in line with the pollution gradient of the platforms. In fact, stations located close to the platforms (i.e., 100 m and 250 m) show a relatively lower EcoQS than those at greater distance (i.e., reference or 3000 m). The nema-gAMBI seems to capture well the EcoQS variability around platforms and correlates well with the environmental parameters (e.g., trace element and hydrocarbon pollution). Indeed, the nema-gAMBI is positively and significantly correlated with the traditional macrofauna-based AMBI. The present proof of concept strongly advocates for the application of the nematode eDNA-based index in the evaluation of EcoQS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

the region surrounding Sepetiba Bay (SB; SE Brazil) has become a hub of intense urban expansion and economic exploitation in response to ore transport and industrial and port activities. As a result, contaminants have been introduced into the bay, leading to an overall worsening of the environmental quality. The present work applies for the first time a foraminiferal morphology-based approach (M) and eDNA-based metabarcoding sequencing (G), along with geochemical data to assess the ecological quality status (EcoQS) in the SB. Principal component analysis shows that the eDNA and morphospecies diversity as well as most of the taxa relative abundance decline in response to the environmental stress (ES) gradient related to total organic carbon (TOC) and metal pollution. Based on ecological indices, Exp(H'bc) (G), Exp(H'bc) (M), foraminifera ATZI marine biotic index (Foram-AMBI), Foram Stress Index (FSI), and geochemical indices (TOC and Potential Ecological Risk Index), the lowest values of EcoQS (i.e., bad to moderate) are inferred in the innermost part of the SB. Despite minor discrepancies among the six EcoQS indices, an agreement has been found for 63% of the stations. To improve the agreement between the ecological indices, it is necessary to fill the gap in species ecology; information on the ecology of many species is still unknown. This work reinforces the importance of molecular analysis and morphological methods in environmental impact studies and confirms the reliability of foraminiferal metabarcoding in EcoQS assessment. This is the first study evaluating the EcoQS in the South Atlantic by using combined foraminiferal eDNA metabarcoding with morphological data."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"195","pagesFromTo":"106340","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9142c","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9142d","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9142e","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9142f","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91430","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91431","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91432","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91433","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91434","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91435","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91436","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91437","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91438","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91439","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9143a","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9143b","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9143c","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9143d","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9143e","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9143f","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91440","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91441","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91442","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91443","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91444","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91445","679ca2ccfdbe830b35f91446"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d6a","mniswId":"13913","title":"Marine Environmental Research","issn":"0141-1136","eissn":"1879-0291","documentHash":"012bdfa6-7dee-4932-9499-e43cd369ba29"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679ca2ccfdbe830b35f9142b","year":"2024","volume":"195","documentHash":"afa18eae-9b3c-4873-9e04-46cb268a9187"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060517668"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679c9fa2fdbe830b35f8fc41","name":"Evanthia","lastName":"Bournaka","documentHash":"ab13706b-c3e7-41e6-bd00-f43db3648ca1"},{"objectId":"679c9fa2fdbe830b35f8fc40","name":"Elena","lastName":"Terzić","documentHash":"db082a7c-a765-42ee-afde-12477885b453"},{"objectId":"5e7094b8878c28a0473c272c","name":"Artur","lastName":"Palacz","uuid":"F85FC43EFA353E99BDF96AA52DD61E184E03C483EFB2FF4542533183FDAED79C04E2CCC2290D4CAA98E0E62A8FC60B95DF79E6C70BFBD315ACB623D45FF0C68E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1634-7880","documentHash":"6b65d6cb-9018-4ec3-aefc-c14a0713ee33"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655f","name":"Monika","lastName":"Zabłocka","uuid":"58E70D68D4B9FE617EDFA003AA14C9D0A51015AC1DABC1CF4A226E6321ADA8A39282E694843E243857E0D6C8361BC3158D3964E2C2972AFBE2F582251BE479B0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1803-7042","documentHash":"fccb5939-114b-4195-8ef6-aeeaa2d9f5cc"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6545","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stoń-Egiert","uuid":"761936593A0A85A183D4328C890367B2F2F64EA207CBA8ABD568F50DE6BCEADC3C2ACFAC4786EF77370FE85E6437FA754AFFD2F08C89E1B051CDC877FA69B923","orcidId":"0000-0002-4274-8979","documentHash":"eef72685-4d70-4808-a6da-0ffdedc9843e"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a652f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":"8A7046FAD9A00FEE2DDD84DE5CD4F0E7AE988F4D51DC53595C979404E0C8BE0FEDC8318C2740E4B4A40005B431471819B1642B71328D0D50119C34AC42E18163","orcidId":"0000-0001-6016-0610","documentHash":"5a6f088c-195f-4994-90d2-e2f46893703d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679c9fa2fdbe830b35f8fc3f","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1476768","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1476768/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Tracing the origins and transformations of fluorescence dissolved organic matter within western and eastern Greenland’s shelves: a comparative study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Differences in the composition and spatial distribution of Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter (FDOM) between western and eastern Greenland shelf waters reflect the interplay of distinct regional environmental drivers-such as glacial meltwater inputs and stratification effects – which shape local DOM processing and biogeochemical cycles. These contrasts provide unique opportunity to understand how Arctic coastal system responds to climatic changes. To investigate these dynamics, we assessed FDOM by an application of multivariate statistical method - Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) on samples collected in July 2021 and August 2022. The PARAFAC enabled the distinction of five components representing both humic-like (C1 (λEx/λEm 318/392), C2 (λEx/λEm 363(261)/445), C5 (λEx/λEm 399/513)) and protein-like (C3 (tyrosine) − λEx/λEm 267/305, (C4 (tryptophan) − λEx/λEm 285/345)) substances, showing variations between western and eastern shelves and across different water layers (surface, deep chlorophyll a maximum depth – DCM, and below it (i.e., in the West Slope Greenland Core water – WSGC, and in the core Polar Water - PW). The analysis showed that western DOM is almost equally composed of humic-like (51%) and protein-like (49%) substances, while the eastern shelf is dominated by protein-like FDOM (56%), indicating a stronger influence of autochthonous production in the east. The highest fluorescence intensity was measured of the protein-like component C3 in both eastern (PW layer) and western (DCM layer) shelves. In the surface waters of the western Greenland shelf we found a statistically significant (p<0.001), although relatively weak (R = 0.27) correlation between Ip and the total chlorophyll a concentration, Tchla. Derived values of spectral indices (HIX, BIX, and FI), and a ratio of fluorescence intensities of protein-like components to fluorescence intensities of humic-like components, Ip/Ih, indicated that the FDOM in analyzed water was predominantly autochthonous, characterized with low molecular weight and low-saturation aromatic rings. This findings provide new insights into FDOM composition in the Arctic under changing climatic conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b8878c28a0473c272c","5e709347878c28a0473a6545","5e709347878c28a0473a655f","5e709347878c28a0473a652f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a655f","5e709347878c28a0473a652f","5e709347878c28a0473a6545","679c9fa2fdbe830b35f8fc40","679c9fa2fdbe830b35f8fc41","5e7094b8878c28a0473c272c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a12a1fdbe831aedcade69","year":"2025","volume":"11","documentHash":"def617b2-7315-481e-b4fd-432569195d66"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dissolved organic matter","absorbance","fluorescence","Arctic Ocean","Greenland shelf","PARAFAC"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060517698"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"679cb147fdbe830b35f9f46e","publicUri":"https://www.imp.gda.pl/fileadmin/doc/imp_announcements/imp_doctoral_school/2024/main2022_2024_io.pdf","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2024,"title":"Selected problems in Earth and related environmental sciences 2022","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6524"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"EDITOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["679cb147fdbe830b35f9f46f","5e709347878c28a0473a6524"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-83-66928-10-7","pages":168,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb82e","mniswId":"32300","name":"Instytut Maszyn Przepływowych im.

on the biological responses of oceanic microbial communities. It indirectly regulates primary production and influences the strength of the biological pump, which contributes to the oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2 ). As the microbial community structure and functional capacities remain underestimated in terms of temporal and geographical coverage in the Baltic Sea, our understanding of the nitrogen cycle with respect to ecosystem functioning and climate change is limited. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the seasonal and spatial structure of microbial community abundance involved in the nitrogen loss (denitrification, anammox), reduction processes (dissimilatory nitrate reduction (DNR), dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNRA), and oxidation process (nitrification) in the Baltic Proper (Bornholm Deep, Gdańsk Deep, and Gotland Deep). Specifically, we focused on waters below the halocline at depths ranging from 75 to 135 m, characterized by changeable oxygen conditions. The potential of selected nitrogen processes was resolved by mapping raw reads against nitrogen cycle genes identified in de novo assembled metagenomes. Taxonomic analysis of bacterial and archaeal communities, based on paired- end raw reads, revealed that nitrification, DNR, and denitrification potential were primarily associated with the Nitrosopumilaceae and Thioglobaceae families within these phyla. Ammonia oxidation products likely fueled the production of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), with nitric oxide reductase (NOR)—an enzyme encoded by the Thioglobaceae genome—being responsible for further reduction. Anammox-related genes were not present within sites, thus denitrification pathway enzymes, namely, NOR and N2 O reductase (NOS) were responsible for nitrogen loss. At all sites, genes encoding nitrogen reduction enzymes were most abundant, while the presence of NOS encoding genes was found in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla within all sites. Our findings revealed no significant spatial variation, suggesting that the studied ecosystem exhibits a consistent nitrogen processing capacity across different locations. However, seasonality emerged as a key factor, as changes in nutrient and oxygen conditions throughout the year significantly influence microbial activity and the associated nitrogen-cycling processes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6547","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67b58ba4fdbe835419dbeeea","5e709347878c28a0473a6547","67b58ba4fdbe835419dbeeeb","67b58ba4fdbe835419dbeeec","67b58ba4fdbe835419dbeeed","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67b315a1fdbe83707bf532b9","year":"2025","volume":"12","documentHash":"6bead362-b1fa-4a34-b672-c1cafd8ff89e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nitrification","DNRA","DNR","denitrification","anammox","metagenome","oxygen deficiency","DNA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060550270"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ec19defdbe835f93a253e6","name":"Déborah","lastName":"Benkort","documentHash":"8ae74b42-3861-44d6-8039-155f9d03aef8"},{"objectId":"66ec19defdbe835f93a253e5","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Szeligowska","documentHash":"c7345bc6-bb2c-47ff-952a-9a498ede6167"},{"objectId":"61c14a387523404d4a912f17","name":"Bernabe","lastName":"Moreno Leveroni","uuid":"36FA6EE05AD27586A36BA1525B92E9AAD5E4F42B9A77DAD6DAB3BCCEAD1532FFCEBDA7C315B2CAFF88513C5875A69EE85865276D9F50BE3B6B707C2A750E40FD","documentHash":"8f6e77cb-f129-4cfb-94a1-14bcf5f9f6e6"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Moskalik","uuid":"7089D643B2594CC57D59DE2700FC187DBB9C4D62E0328B409B12232373FF164ED96D4B648D07CC92EF366549051735987A73E346A7B7CAB38ED8A2FACEA2C173","orcidId":"0000-0002-0615-9528","documentHash":"312a8722-20f8-4f71-88a9-6b2d058d4efe"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6556","name":"Anna","lastName":"Przyborska","uuid":"3E19638CF37846E94B19CA05A0811841DB6D48F6EC3B749702E29490D16228D2D4B22C28801E19E266F269A77C71EB9DBA67EF4072A7D75F687FCDEDF0596439","orcidId":"0000-0002-2791-6372","documentHash":"0e36dfbf-413c-4bd6-8691-415cef190976"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6520","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Błachowiak-Samołyk","uuid":"8C6AD77D97DA3D9D5230CB20B5B200FB76893BFE72A48BE0BAB6068DBB7BD96049B3C885C6414B2EF04BBFB8AFD27AC9468868A23DB7A01FB8AEBEECC4EDAD0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8076-2168","documentHash":"5036109f-207f-446c-bac6-ec8dd36677f9"}],"objectId":"66ec19defdbe835f93a253e3","doi":"10.5194/bg-21-3617-2024","publicUri":"https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/21/3617/2024/bg-21-3617-2024.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Estimates of carbon sequestration potential in an expanding Arctic fjord (Hornsund, Svalbard) affected by dark plumes of glacial meltwater","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In polar regions, glaciers are retreating onto land, gradually widening ice-free coastal waters, which are known to act as new sinks of atmospheric carbon. However, the increasing delivery of inorganic suspended particulate matter (iSPM) with meltwater might significantly impact their capacity to contribute to carbon sequestration. Here, we present an analysis of satellite, meteorological, and SPM data as well as results of a coupled physical–biogeochemical model (1D GOTM-ECOSMO-E2E-Polar) with a newly implemented iSPM group to show the impact of iSPM on the ecosystem dynamics in a warming polar fjord (Hornsund, European Arctic) with numerous shallow-grounded marine-terminating glaciers. Our results indicate that with a longer melt season (9 d per decade, 1979–2022), the loss of sea ice cover (44 d per decade, 1982–2021) and the formation of new marine habitats after the retreat of marine-terminating glaciers (around 100 km2 in 1976–2022, a 38 % increase in the total area), glacial meltwater has transported increasing loads of iSPM from land (3.7 g m−3 per decade, reconstructed for 1979–2022). The simulated light limitation induced by the iSPM input delayed and decreased the peaks in phytoplankton, zooplankton, and macrobenthos. The newly ice-free areas still markedly contributed to plankton primary and secondary production and carbon burial in sediments (5.1, 2.0, and 0.9 Gg C yr−1, respectively, on average for 2005–2009 in the iSPM scenario). However, these values would have been 5.0, 2.1, and 0.1 Gg C yr−1 higher, respectively, without the iSPM input. Since carbon burial was the least affected by iSPM (a decrease of around 16 %, in comparison to 50 % for plankton primary and secondary production), the impact of marine ice loss and enhanced land–ocean connectivity should be investigated further in the context of carbon fluxes in expanding polar fjords."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af532"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","5e709347878c28a0473a6556","61c14a387523404d4a912f17"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"3617-3639","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66ec19defdbe835f93a253e5","66ec19defdbe835f93a253e6","5e709347878c28a0473a6556","5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","61c14a387523404d4a912f17","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477336","mniswId":"2417","title":"Biogeosciences","issn":"1726-4189","websiteLink":"www.biogeosciences.net/12/6493/2015/","documentHash":"9312d442-03bc-4ac9-b1b5-5323c52b58fc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ec19defdbe835f93a253e4","year":"2024","volume":"21","number":"16","documentHash":"989007a7-d00d-4b2d-a584-56545a981dab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060572903"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6799f9f4fdbe831aedc96e8d","name":"André","lastName":"Menegotto","documentHash":"d2ff131b-5c0a-4efb-953d-307c84c7999a"},{"objectId":"6799f9f4fdbe831aedc96e8c","name":"Christopher D.

However, even the most exhaustive databases are prone to sampling biases, which create knowledge gaps in species distributions and increase uncertainty in model predictions. Regarding marine environments, intertidal zones are globally distributed and considered early warning systems for climate change impacts and species' range shifts. Owing to their relative accessibility, intertidal records should – supposedly – be less incomplete and biased compared to open-ocean and deep-sea areas. Yet, the extent and coverage of intertidal records available in global biodiversity databases remains unknown. In this study, we used a high-resolution worldwide tidal flat map to identify intertidal records of 11 563 benthic species from the OBIS (Ocean Biodiversity Information System) portal. Following a thorough data-cleaning process, we evaluated geographic patterns in observed species richness, site accessibility, sampling effort, and inventory completeness across latitudes. We demonstrate that observed species richness has mid-latitudinal peaks while the tropics accumulate species with missing records, similar to patterns described for the entire marine realm. These patterns correlate with disproportionate mid-latitude sampling efforts and poor tropical sampling coverage. Sixty-five percent of the mapped intertidal sites are located within 3 hours of a city, but sampling records remain almost absent along African Atlantic, South American Pacific, and Indo-Pacific coasts. Thus, even for the accessible and well-studied intertidal shorelines, database records are not free from geographical biases and their associated implications for biodiversity estimates. Our results highlight the need for a better data-sharing culture, and we hope to encourage initiatives promoting more and better-distributed research efforts on intertidal biodiversity, which could improve global scale detection and prediction of climate change impacts at regional and global scales."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6500"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2024","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6799f9f4fdbe831aedc96e89","6799f9f4fdbe831aedc96e8a","6799f9f4fdbe831aedc96e8b","5e709347878c28a0473a6500","6799f9f4fdbe831aedc96e8c","6799f9f4fdbe831aedc96e8d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779ed","mniswId":"5311","title":"ECOGRAPHY","issn":"0906-7590","eissn":"1600-0587","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0a0c123b-d819-4611-b7a3-8594bb0038d4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6799f9f4fdbe831aedc96e88","year":"2024","volume":"2024","number":"12","documentHash":"c3e0f334-ead3-40eb-b478-b157152348f5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["benthos","biodiversity database","intertidal","inventory incompleteness","sample coverage","species richness","tidal flat"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060575440"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6799febdfdbe831aedc9c162","name":"Sergej","lastName":"Olenin","documentHash":"4f8f5000-bfeb-4520-8619-216def92b239"},{"objectId":"6799febdfdbe831aedc9c161","name":"Reda","lastName":"Dzingelevičienė","documentHash":"18a83f48-5ca2-442b-b253-48dc7e32c7ce"},{"objectId":"6799febdfdbe831aedc9c160","name":"Reza","lastName":"Pashaei","documentHash":"7226bec4-0c87-45da-9650-fd0497cca88c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"}],"objectId":"6799febdfdbe831aedc9c15f","doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141642","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0045653524005356?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Mussels (Mytilus spp.) in Svalbard contain microplastic particles in tissues: Implications for monitoring","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We examined the presence of microplastics in blue mussels Mytilus spp. from the intertidal zone of western Spitsbergen in Arctic Svalbard. The optical microscopy technique detected a total of 148 microplastics, with the highest concentration per mussel being 24 particles. Microplastics were found in 84% of the examined mussels. The microplastics ranged in size from <0.5 mm to 5 mm and consisted of fibers (83%), fragments (13%), plates (3%), and spherules (1%). The micro-Raman spectroscopy technique revealed four different types of polymers: polyethylene (67%), nylon-12 (17%), low-density polyethylene (11%), and polypropylene (5%). Our research shows that Arctic coastal waters are polluted with microplastics notwithstanding their remoteness. These findings suggest that microplastic contamination may harm marine life and coastal ecosystems and require further research into long-term environmental effects. We also indicate that intertidal mussels may be beneficial for monitoring microplastics because they can be collected without involving diving."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6500"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"353","pagesFromTo":"141642","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6799febdfdbe831aedc9c160","6799febdfdbe831aedc9c161","5e709347878c28a0473a6500","6799febdfdbe831aedc9c162"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f8","mniswId":"3525","title":"CHEMOSPHERE","issn":"0045-6535","documentHash":"ca7a4227-9b2a-46cb-a2a2-53056fa5e040"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e6d0194097076263e9cc93","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"353","documentHash":"3255cbed-9694-4af1-8978-bdcd7ca4f778"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060575483"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a0b72fdbe831aedca87bb","name":"Douglas A.","lastName":"Campbell","documentHash":"cc8ce43c-eabd-49ca-ba40-0f9f867b9d6e"},{"objectId":"679a0b72fdbe831aedca87ba","name":"Naaman M.","lastName":"Omar","documentHash":"468a3bae-adda-419a-a91b-ccf203f4f9f6"},{"objectId":"679a0b72fdbe831aedca87b9","name":"Anabella","lastName":"Aguilera","documentHash":"8a429801-2876-4fc6-9d2c-0e03276ead23"},{"objectId":"679a0b72fdbe831aedca87b8","name":"Mireille","lastName":"Savoie","documentHash":"6f511fcc-64ab-4473-8a71-e592d17aab3d"},{"objectId":"679a0b72fdbe831aedca87b7","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Śliwińska‐Wilczewska","documentHash":"cb4c99b6-c935-45b4-8cec-85bf6136c45c"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993d5","name":"Marta","lastName":"Konik","uuid":"C9EFA09C8E176C789E5FEDF411C2490E92565CB72CBE1EF71C0DF2DE1AC8FCA7CA9972FDA56DD38CD1A76438D0F4D33B04273B7C66203050838BCF543B92B6E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1145-9127","documentHash":"de341dc2-90f3-4b16-96f7-18332a2e9882"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-03","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679a0b72fdbe831aedca87b5","doi":"10.1002/lno.12750","publicUri":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lno.12750","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Photoperiods and light differentially influence growth and potential niches of phycocyanin‐ and phycoerythrin‐rich picocyanobacteria","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Strains from the picocyanobacteria genus Synechococcus are currently found across a wide range of photoperiods and photosynthetically active radiation. Future scenarios now forecast range expansions of marine Synechococcus into new photic regimes. We found that strains of temperate, coastal phycocyanin-rich and phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus grew fastest under moderate photosynthetically active radiation, and a 24-h photoperiod, despite a cumulative diel photon dose equivalent to conditions where growth was slower, under higher light and shorter photoperiods. Under optimal conditions, a phycoerythrin-rich Synechococcus strain achieved a highest recorded cyanobacterial chlorophyll-specific exponential growth rate (μ) of 4.5 d−1. Two phycoerythrin-rich strains demonstrated wider ability to modulate light capture capacity, whereas two phycocyanin-rich strains showed less change in light capture across increasing cumulative diel photon dose. All four coastal strains showed a decrease of effective absorption cross-section for photosystem II photochemistry, vs. increasing cumulative diel photosynthetically active radiation doses. Within each strain, μ showed consistent, saturating responses to increasing cumulative diel photosystem II electron flux, with more variations in responses of μ to cumulative photosynthetically usable radiation. As photoperiod opportunists, coastal picocyanobacteria show potential to expand into longer photic regimes as higher latitudes

actors of the European ocean observing and forecasting communities with key users of the ocean observing products and services in order to better integrate existing ocean observation systems and tools, and to improve the delivery of ocean information to users. EuroSea was constructed around the ocean observing value chain that connects observations to users of ocean information, and, just as intended, the value chain concept was a useful prism to improve the system. In this article, we summarize some of the main take-home messages from EuroSea on the needs for developing the European Ocean Observing System and its links with modeling and forecasting systems. During the project, the challenges and gaps in the design and coordination of the European ocean observing and forecasting system were identified and mapped. Many gaps and challenges related to the observations of physical, chemical and biological Essential Ocean Variables were identified. Some of these gaps are related to technological developments, while others are caused by insufficient and short-term funding leading to a not sustainable system, management, and cooperation between different entities, as well as limitations in foresight activities, policies and decisions. This article represents a compilation of the broader needs for advancing the observing and forecasting system, and is meant as a guide for the community, and to funders and investors to advance ocean observing and the delivery of ocean information in Europe. To enhance the sustainability of ocean observations, which is paramount for a reliable provision of quality oceanographic data and services, several recommendations were compiled for ocean observing networks, frameworks, initiatives, as well as the ocean observing funders within the European nations, and the European Commission."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b8878c28a0473c272c","5e709383878c28a0473ab893"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679a08dcfdbe831aedca5d9e","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5d9f","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da0","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da1","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da2","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da3","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da4","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da5","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da6","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da7","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da8","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5da9","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5daa","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5dab","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5dac","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5dad","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5dae","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5daf","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5db0","5e709383878c28a0473ab893","5e7094b8878c28a0473c272c","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5db1","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5db2","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5db3","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5db4","679a08dcfdbe831aedca5db5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66389efb4097076e57a5ef9c","year":"2024","volume":"11","documentHash":"495f74cb-874c-429f-a6f6-dd45c3fddca6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ocean observing","governance","ocean science","forecasting","global ocean observing system"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060575723"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393755","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Urbański","uuid":"5AAE6B09F2463205522CC18C08EA4198075E5D7BA9E68C218E43EF94D8D34A63DFA4912E265E11ADC5B9AD298BF0B1A0D3780326687865C939F514BD1629B10C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3842-4143","documentHash":"99854f94-07ea-4c77-a025-17ba9cd32ef4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6799fde7fdbe831aedc9b2d2","doi":"10.24425/ppr.2024.149207","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/130116/PDF/Accepted_Weslawski.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Forty years of warming: Environmental change in marine coastal habitats on Svalbard between 1981 and 2022","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Temperature rise, together with resultant ice cover retreat in Svalbard, changes in hydrology and geomorphology of fjords and coastal waters, is presented as forming force for the marine habitats.

To investigate the aerosolization of PBAPs by sea spray aerosol (SSA), we conducted ship-based campaigns in the central Baltic Sea near Östergarnsholm in May and August 2021. Using a plunging-jet sea spray simulation chamber filled with local seawater, we performed controlled chamber experiments to collect filters and measure aerosols. We determined the abundance of microbial cells in the chamber air and seawater using staining and fluorescence microscopy, normalizing these values to sodium concentrations to calculate enrichment factors. Our results showed that microbes were enriched in the aerosol by 13 to 488 times compared to the underlying seawater, with no significant enrichment observed in the sea surface microlayer. Microbial abundances obtained through microscopy were compared with estimates of fluorescent PBAPs (fPBAPs) using a single-particle fluorescence spectrometer. We estimated microbial emission fluxes using two independent approaches: (1) applying the enrichment factors derived from this study with mass flux estimates from previous SSA parameterizations and (2) using a scaling approach from a companion study. Both methods produced microbial emission flux estimates that were in good agreement and of the same order of magnitude as previous studies, while fPBAP emission flux estimates were significantly lower. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing identified the diversity of bacteria enriched in the nascent SSA compared to the underlying seawater."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"13413-13428","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679a0c35fdbe831aedca8a6c","679a0c35fdbe831aedca8a6d","679a0c35fdbe831aedca8a6e","679a0c35fdbe831aedca8a6f","679a0c35fdbe831aedca8a70","5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","679a0c35fdbe831aedca8a71"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724d","mniswId":"2026","title":"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","issn":"1680-7316","eissn":"1680-7324","documentHash":"767f0fa0-a1ba-4887-b209-a40652902fe4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a0c35fdbe831aedca8a6b","year":"2024","volume":"24","number":"23","documentHash":"9b7be367-efca-4af4-b1a8-2ab73849b181"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060575843"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a12a1fdbe831aedcade6b","name":"Astrid","lastName":"Bracher","documentHash":"24803a3c-1ad9-47b3-9576-61de65775ac4"},{"objectId":"679a12a1fdbe831aedcade6a","name":"Rustam","lastName":"Manurov","documentHash":"705f516b-8049-40b0-bfaf-afdbcaf1bb7c"},{"objectId":"60c9e7109543c72336544556","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Cherkasheva","uuid":"3078FD42A4D92827A49657ED01B6723CCD7020DD5F0F33C277DC996C4B017F8793CAF08F5A515955C90B977091BD37824B880A8150FC856EA4C9A8BDB724E1FA","documentHash":"5d3cbb92-f601-44e7-b266-4c00e58167ea"},{"objectId":"5ef176d17523404d1000ea6d","name":"Alexandra","lastName":"Loginova","uuid":"9B804DC70E1123C329345945F711089645094C8FC2D62653AD4F2060BAF56A37F5C601C00557A2BCB80B289177E255B862077E21474BA5478633D4EB80C2E3B6","documentHash":"6f06f290-8d79-40c4-bcee-224814ad93c9"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655f","name":"Monika","lastName":"Zabłocka","uuid":"58E70D68D4B9FE617EDFA003AA14C9D0A51015AC1DABC1CF4A226E6321ADA8A39282E694843E243857E0D6C8361BC3158D3964E2C2972AFBE2F582251BE479B0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1803-7042","documentHash":"fccb5939-114b-4195-8ef6-aeeaa2d9f5cc"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a652f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":"8A7046FAD9A00FEE2DDD84DE5CD4F0E7AE988F4D51DC53595C979404E0C8BE0FEDC8318C2740E4B4A40005B431471819B1642B71328D0D50119C34AC42E18163","orcidId":"0000-0001-6016-0610","documentHash":"5a6f088c-195f-4994-90d2-e2f46893703d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679a12a1fdbe831aedcade68","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1491180","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1491180/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Adaptation of global primary production model to the Greenland Sea conditions: parameterization and monitoring for 1998-2022","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Phytoplankton are responsible for releasing half of the world’s oxygen and for removing large amounts of carbon dioxide from surface waters. Despite many studies on the topic conducted in the past decades, we are still far from a good understanding of ongoing rapid changes in the Arctic Ocean and how they will affect phytoplankton and the whole ecosystem. An example is the difference in net primary production modelling estimates, which differ twice globally and fifty times when only the Arctic region is considered. Here, we aim to improve the quality of Greenland Sea primary production estimates, by testing different versions of primary production model against in situ data and then calculating regional estimates and trends for 1998-2022 for those performing best. As a baseline, we chose the commonly used global primary production model and tested it with different combinations of empirical relationships and input data. Local empirical relationships were taken from measurements by the literature and derived from the unpublished data of Institute of Oceanology of Polish Academy of Sciences across the Fram Strait. For validation, we took historical net primary production 14C data from literature and added to it our own gross primary production O2 measurements. Field data showed good agreement between primary production measured with 14C and O2 evolution methods. From all the model setups, those including local chlorophyll a profile and local absorption spectrum best reproduced in situ data. Our modelled regional annual primary production estimates are equal to 346 TgC/year for the Nordic Seas region and 342 TgC/year for the Greenland Sea sector of the Arctic defined as 45°W-15°E, 66°33′N-90°N. These values are higher than those previously reported. Monthly values show a seasonal cycle with less monthly variability than previously reported. No significant increase or decrease in primary production was observed when studying regionally averaged trends. The accuracy of the selected here model setups to reproduce the field data in terms of Root Mean Square Difference is better than in the related Arctic studies. The improved primary production estimates strengthen researchers’ ability to assess carbon flux and understand biogeochemical processes in the Greenland Sea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c9e7109543c72336544556","5e709347878c28a0473a655f","5e709347878c28a0473a652f","5ef176d17523404d1000ea6d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c9e7109543c72336544556","679a12a1fdbe831aedcade6a","5e709347878c28a0473a652f","5ef176d17523404d1000ea6d","5e709347878c28a0473a655f","679a12a1fdbe831aedcade6b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a12a1fdbe831aedcade69","year":"2025","volume":"11","documentHash":"def617b2-7315-481e-b4fd-432569195d66"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["primary production","ocean colour","remote sensing","regional model","model development","Greenland Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060576081"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b5fa7fdbe8318b4cbf81c","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Stramski","documentHash":"ee1d0aa4-a3d5-4cbf-8b42-82f5cef8db59"},{"objectId":"679b5fa7fdbe8318b4cbf81b","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Litwicka","documentHash":"40a1110d-1fc3-4d5d-a56b-d5afb4791d83"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6554","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"7DC6EF7449E88C20028F95E36F2899248590FD2207946CC24EEAC57DA894C445DEA823F1DEF0C9D2E453AF0DE2D42CA22703FF05716B407C36835313CE67823A","orcidId":"0000-0001-9757-5553","documentHash":"02c62f14-ac99-4008-b257-09ecaa6160a4"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6545","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stoń-Egiert","uuid":"761936593A0A85A183D4328C890367B2F2F64EA207CBA8ABD568F50DE6BCEADC3C2ACFAC4786EF77370FE85E6437FA754AFFD2F08C89E1B051CDC877FA69B923","orcidId":"0000-0002-4274-8979","documentHash":"eef72685-4d70-4808-a6da-0ffdedc9843e"}],"objectId":"679b5fa7fdbe8318b4cbf819","doi":"10.1016/j.jmarsys.2024.104019","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0924796324000575?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Variability of inherent optical properties of seawater in relation to the concentration and composition of suspended particulate matter in the coastal Arctic waters of western Spitsbergen","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Inherent optical properties (IOPs) and characteristics of suspended particles in surface seawater samples were measured in summer months of 2021 and 2022 in Arctic fjords and coastal waters of western Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago. The measured IOPs included the spectral backscattering and scattering coefficients of suspended particulate matter, as well as the spectral absorption coefficients of suspended particulate matter and its non-algal particulate and phytoplankton components. The particulate assemblages were characterized by measuring the mass concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), particulate organic matter (POM), particulate inorganic matter (PIM), and phytoplankton pigments including chlorophyll-a (Chla). The investigated coastal waters exhibit high variability of particulate characteristics and associated IOPs. We observed more than two orders of magnitude variation in SPM and particulate IOPs, and Chla varied from below the detection limit to more than 3 mg m−3. The contribution of organic fraction to SPM (POM/SPM ratio) varied from 0.05 to 0.6, and the Chla/SPM ratio spanned more than three orders of magnitude with a maximum value of the order of 10−3. As a result, the mass-specific optical coefficients, especially the mass-specific backscattering and scattering coefficients of particles and mass-specific absorption coefficient of non-algal particulate matter, exhibit large variations. In addition, our study demonstrates the influences of changes in composition of suspended particulate matter parameterized in terms of POM/SPM and Chla/SPM ratios on IOPs. Various variants of spectral parametrizations of optical coefficients in terms of univariate or multivariable relationships with particulate characteristics are provided. These parameterizations are representative of the investigated coastal Arctic waters in Svalbard region and can be used for better interpretation of optical measurements, both in-situ and remote, in this Arctic environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6554","5e709347878c28a0473a6545"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"246","pagesFromTo":"104019","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6554","679b5fa7fdbe8318b4cbf81b","5e709347878c28a0473a6545","679b5fa7fdbe8318b4cbf81c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478840","mniswId":"11737","title":"JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS","issn":"0924-7963","documentHash":"1c51e5a1-6309-4089-9824-942fb0bb3edd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b5fa7fdbe8318b4cbf81a","year":"2024","volume":"246","documentHash":"e7216772-42be-4b6b-8b53-84c85e3970d8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060579649"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b4","name":"Camilla","lastName":"Svensen","documentHash":"77438026-7f8e-4446-8a8c-041473eab2e9"},{"objectId":"679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b3","name":"Anette","lastName":"Wold","documentHash":"d9d11266-0a3f-4340-945a-111154bfd662"},{"objectId":"679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b2","name":"Oliver","lastName":"Müller","documentHash":"7bb4e106-6bc9-4baf-9a77-705572ebd19a"},{"objectId":"679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b1","name":"Martí","lastName":"Amargant-Arumí","documentHash":"51fda819-1c4d-41e8-a71c-72c7b0ba1ed7"},{"objectId":"679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b0","name":"Raul","lastName":"Primicerio","documentHash":"2a4fa28d-9755-4c92-87a6-7e5469f7e12d"},{"objectId":"679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3af","name":"Malin","lastName":"Daase","documentHash":"23bfbaee-ebac-4721-be92-aeb6cc21d2ae"},{"objectId":"679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3ae","name":"Christine","lastName":"Gawinski","documentHash":"6095e712-c078-4dc6-b991-8fbfff33c82f"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kwaśniewski","uuid":"8365CC02046923AD10F327E0A9DF80A2A87646DD41F10E1B4BA9B189ECBDAF4BC4DDB9C2AE001CE03926A8551D8319BB4076255C7C53DDF5522FBDA2313D5552","orcidId":"0000-0003-3104-0761","documentHash":"8b17d9b8-6501-443c-a119-2fcad7a66046"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399412","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Ormańczyk","uuid":"28B4DC8E520F0E03AC8C1A1E83782BD4AEC44AF54A34D1A0AC82FE089F00047523DFC2BBBE0F078CD2C7E7B0153E15FEE6B117099FABAD104C75A6546A211997","orcidId":"0000-0003-2343-6694","documentHash":"33aaf417-aeea-4aa6-8501-eb28d6f6bb70"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3ad","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1308542","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1308542/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Response of the copepod community to interannual differences in sea-ice cover and water masses in the northern Barents Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The reduction of Arctic summer sea ice due to climate change can lead to increased primary production in parts of the Barents Sea if sufficient nutrients are available. Changes in the timing and magnitude of primary production may have cascading consequences for the zooplankton community and ultimately for higher trophic levels. In Arctic food webs, both small and large copepods are commonly present, but may have different life history strategies and hence different responses to environmental change. We investigated how contrasting summer sea-ice cover and water masses in the northern Barents Sea influenced the copepod community composition and secondary production of small and large copepods along a transect from 76°N to 83°N in August 2018 and August 2019. Bulk abundance, biomass, and secondary production of the total copepod community did not differ significantly between the two years. There were however significant spatial differences in the copepod community composition and production, with declining copepod abundance from Atlantic to Arctic waters and the highest copepod biomass and production on the Barents Sea shelf. The boreal Calanus finmarchicus showed higher abundance, biomass, and secondary production in the year with less sea-ice cover and at locations with a clear Atlantic water signal. Significant differences in the copepod community between areas in the two years could be attributed to interannual differences in sea-ice cover and Atlantic water inflow. Small copepods contributed more to secondary production in areas with no or little sea ice and their production was positively correlated to water temperature and ciliate abundance. Large copepods contributed more to secondary production in areas with extensive sea ice and their production was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration. Our results show how pelagic communities might function in a future ice-free Barents Sea, in which the main component of the communities are smaller-sized copepod species (including smaller-sized Calanus and small copepods), and the secondary production they generate is available in energetically less resource-rich portions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a047399412","5e70940f878c28a0473b5907"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1308542","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3ae","679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3af","679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b0","679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b1","679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b2","679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b3","5e70929e878c28a047399412","5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","679b6b17fdbe8318b4ccf3b4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66389efb4097076e57a5ef9c","year":"2024","volume":"11","documentHash":"495f74cb-874c-429f-a6f6-dd45c3fddca6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sea-ice cover","copepod community composition","secondary production","northern Barents Sea","interannual variability","sea-ice melt"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060579947"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679ca4f7fdbe830b35f97013","name":"Giuliana","lastName":"Panieri","documentHash":"76383754-016e-4989-8023-24bd02c33ef5"},{"objectId":"679ca4f7fdbe830b35f97012","name":"Andrew J.","lastName":"Gooday","documentHash":"3a6c7975-9bf8-4764-a14f-a0cb6742ebc7"},{"objectId":"679ca4f7fdbe830b35f97011","name":"Ines Barrenechea","lastName":"Angeles","documentHash":"744109ec-d1c7-4a5a-b647-2f192131136f"},{"objectId":"679ca4f7fdbe830b35f97010","name":"Villads D.","lastName":"Holm","documentHash":"417839c4-8742-4add-b64f-b94a765005bf"},{"objectId":"679ca4f7fdbe830b35f9700f","name":"Maria","lastName":"Holzmann","documentHash":"30d98c30-39eb-4676-93bb-983e5ff6af07"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2024-12-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679ca4f7fdbe830b35f9700d","doi":"10.1007/s00300-024-03320-2","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-024-03320-2.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"DNA barcoding of monothalamid foraminifera from Vestnesa and Svyatogor Ridge, Arctic Ocean, including the description of 3 new species","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Monothalamid (single-chambered) foraminifera are a common constituent of high latitudinal coastal and deep-sea biota but are under-researched, and a limited number of species are described.

variability of the MERRA-2 radiation budget over Poland in Central Europe","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper discusses the radiation budget and its temporal variability over Poland. The data analysis is based on the MERRA-2 reanalysis for the years 1980–2020. During the last four decades, the enhancement of climate warming has been observed, which coincides with the changes in the radiation budget. Positive and statistically significant trends at the top of the atmosphere (TOA; 0.7 ± 0.2 W/m2/10 year) and on the Earth’s surface (1.5 ± 0.2 W/m2/10 year) radiation budget (net downward flux) are mainly a consequence of changes in the amount of aerosol and greenhouse gases (GHG). According to MERRA-2, the AOD during this period decreased by − 0.19 (at 550 nm), which is 87% of the long-term (1980–2021) mean value (0.22). The reduction of AOD is due mainly to the decline of non-absorbing sulfate particles, which leads to a reduction of single-scattering albedo (SSA) by − 0.008 per decade and Angstrom exponent (AE) by − 0.06 per decade (both trends statistically significant). On the other hand, the GHG concentration increased by 4.9%/10 year and 3%/10 year, respectively, for CO2 and CH4. The total column of water vapor increased (1.3%/10 year), while ozone decreased (− 1%/10 year). Despite the fact that cloud cover and cloud optical depth (COD) decreased (− 1.8%/10 year and − 1.0%/10 year), the impact of cloud on temporal variability radiation budget is small. It can be explained by nearly compensated shortwave (SW) cooling and longwave (LW) heating effects. During the analysis period, near-surface air temperature increased by 2.0 °C. The estimated increase in SW net surface radiation (7.9 W/m2) leads to climate warming by 0.8 °C, which is a consequence mainly of the reduction of aerosol (0.4 °C) and cloud cover (0.2 °C). The impact of the change of SW radiation on air temperature is more pronounced during the warm season, while during the cold, air temperature change is controlled mainly by the variability of air mass advection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział

benefits of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in atmospheric aerosol research, specifically to obtain information on the vertical variability of aerosol single-scattering properties in the lower troposphere. The results discussed in this paper were obtained during the Polish Radar and Lidar Mobile Observation System (POLIMOS) field campaign in 2018 at a wetland and rural site located in the Rzecin (Poland). UAS was equipped with miniaturised devices (low-cost aerosol optical counter, aethalometer AE-51, RS41 radiosonde) to measure aerosol properties (scattering and absorption coefficient) and air thermodynamic parameters. Typical UAS vertical profiles were conducted up to approximately 1000 m agl. During nighttime, UAS measurements show a very shallow inversion surface layer up to about 100–200 m agl, with significant enhancement of aerosol scattering and absorption coefficient. In this case, the Pearson correlation coefficient between aerosol single-scattering properties measured by ground-based equipment and UAS devices significantly decreases with altitude. In such conditions, aerosol properties at 200 m agl are independent of the ground-based observation. On the contrary, the ground observations are better correlated with UAS measurements at higher altitudes during daytime and under well-mixed conditions. During long-range transport of biomass burning from fire in North America, the aerosol absorption coefficient increases with altitude, probably due to entrainment of such particles into the PBL."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67784c60fdbe833ec1d05e4a","5e709358878c28a0473a7b61","5e709358878c28a0473a7bd0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709489878c28a0473bf377"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936e878c28a0473a95ab"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"4580","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70936e878c28a0473a95ab","5e709358878c28a0473a7bd0","602e57b89543c7410626f140","67784c60fdbe833ec1d05e47","67784c60fdbe833ec1d05e48","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","67784c60fdbe833ec1d05e4a","5e709358878c28a0473a7b61"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","issn":"2072-4292","eissn":"2072-4292","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing","documentHash":"70fe2a0d-444c-49ea-9c4d-4dcd904ee147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67516b42fdbe834f76825e4c","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"23","documentHash":"f4f0489b-5eba-4f0a-b455-3870006cfd24"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["atmosphere aerosols","UAS","atmospheric lidar","vertical profiles"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060617593"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf03d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Nowaczyk","documentHash":"8b942f8f-5dae-49cd-af63-b52d109e1f1a"},{"objectId":"679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf03c","name":"Łucja","lastName":"Przysiecka","documentHash":"23c43afe-7fbf-49f9-bf4e-2fdf1b6d660d"},{"objectId":"679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf03b","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Jarek","documentHash":"6f656383-ee84-41a1-8619-8a785bae321f"},{"objectId":"679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf03a","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Flak","documentHash":"be44c5e7-cd48-404a-a708-3c4374c46183"},{"objectId":"5e70945b878c28a0473bb3af","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Diak","uuid":"42031D146CCB43240D8580DD5CF2F0F79D6EAE47F399F25FDBFC2B8875035CC6E99B64640008C7C19A18DBF42F13AAA48C96CCE4EF3ECF4BB9A28D314A55EF65","orcidId":"0000-0002-7740-608X","documentHash":"fcdd195f-5b59-49a5-8e68-2222b6b17afe"}],"objectId":"679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf038","doi":"10.1016/j.bioadv.2024.214083","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2772950824003261?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Aqueous phase transfer of near-infrared ZnCuInS2/ZnS quantum dots: Synthesis and characterization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cadmium-free and NIR fluorescent QDs are promising candidates for bio-application. Thus, we present the synthesis of ternary ZnCuInS2/ZnS (ZCIS/ZnS) quantum dots (QDs) where the molar variation of Cu/Zn of the precursors was used to tune the optical and structural properties. QDs with Cu/Zn molar ratio of 2/1 passivated with ZnS exhibited the best optical properties. They showed dominant near-infrared photoluminescence (approx. 850 nm) and highest quantum yield (approx. 52 %, λexc = 500 nm). Therefore, they were further subject to modification to ensure their transfer to the aqueous phase and improve biocompatibility. For this, different functionalization approaches were used. The first method relied on encapsulation with polymers like PSMA (poly(styrene co-maleic anhydride)) and PMAO (poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) coupled with polyetheramine (JEFF; Jeffamine M-1000), and the second relied on hydrophilization with PMAO. Furthermore, we also applied a surface ligand exchange process using DHLA (dihydrolipoic acid) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-appended DHLA. The comprehensive study indicated that ZnCuInS2/ZnS QDs functionalized with PMAO (ZnCuInS2/ZnS@PMO) exhibited the highest photoluminescence (PL QY) along with ensured high colloidal stability in aqueous media. Moreover, no noticeable deterioration of the photoluminescence profile was observed for all used functionalization approaches. However, a significant decrease in QY was observed for almost all functionalized QDs except those that were PMO-capped. The synthesized QDs were systematically characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Biological studies indicate that the obtained hydrophilic ZCIS QDs are biocompatible and localized intracellularly inside endosomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70945b878c28a0473bb3af"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"166","pagesFromTo":"214083","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70945b878c28a0473bb3af","679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf03a","679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf03b","679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf03c","679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf03d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"629f125640970718a383b48b","title":"Biomaterials Advances","issn":"2772-9508","websiteLink":"https://journals.elsevier.com/biomaterials-advances","documentHash":"6a401c6b-9572-476a-ae8e-5e39a913854d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a1e25fdbe831aedcbf039","year":"2025","volume":"166","documentHash":"d178c3bd-3baa-4d64-ab0f-a1ca1d13ebe6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ZCIS quantum dots","Quantum yield","Photoluminescence","Polymer-based functionalization","Cytotoxicity","Intracellular localization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060621660"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67b315a1fdbe83707bf532bd","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mackiewicz","documentHash":"3f15dfc2-f30e-414d-8484-af7111c9df62"},{"objectId":"67b315a1fdbe83707bf532bc","name":"Marta","lastName":"Borecka","documentHash":"60a48512-a61e-40fb-b1ed-e119c9aebd8b"},{"objectId":"67b315a1fdbe83707bf532bb","name":"Hermann W.","lastName":"Bange","documentHash":"68fd062c-f3f3-419a-b11b-b93b40641410"},{"objectId":"67b315a1fdbe83707bf532ba","name":"Pratha","lastName":"Sivasamy","documentHash":"cd883306-cd57-477e-9a3c-d7f8e10da48f"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf377","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"85FD817EC7A87F03F838855336B25207286B8767235FEC849DD4568444510725B2225280529810C7754A21DDEE8BCA4353F3BD29A41F34EEFEA5967457C303A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9132-1990","documentHash":"311369bd-713f-4e50-ad69-8c04ac3dcea3"},{"objectId":"5e70945b878c28a0473bb3af","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Diak","uuid":"42031D146CCB43240D8580DD5CF2F0F79D6EAE47F399F25FDBFC2B8875035CC6E99B64640008C7C19A18DBF42F13AAA48C96CCE4EF3ECF4BB9A28D314A55EF65","orcidId":"0000-0002-7740-608X","documentHash":"fcdd195f-5b59-49a5-8e68-2222b6b17afe"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szymczycha","uuid":"F594DC6E0A245A248EACAF139383FF10C32DD82FE0DACFF05A102D4A7E645FB7586B6A7F34800C8363F445238D1E4A8D328549DE8D315F239B00D5F69B7F8C87","orcidId":"0000-0002-5815-215X","documentHash":"0a8a40d0-e3be-4cb4-9e67-7af031f250d1"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Winogradow","uuid":"D50057AD40012BE33D95DBDE17AFF8252F4D4C8BE533331AE47A267772A7AF1EA340927A58A08E00BF25C00BEE718EC87BAB202495DEBA6319C1787B88209CC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6214-9017","documentHash":"5ac9951c-6a34-42af-b699-05492c580241"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kuliński","uuid":"A1362FEB3C94D210BA97D7C5FE392ED27FB4DD61D0B2476A4F5C18B20F589C7FA21F35A13EA5510511C60D24A7EAD1FC4FDC75E86C1645B920BA2AE06C994826","orcidId":"0000-0002-5403-6629","documentHash":"8009c04f-1ba9-4687-80f3-d96316801246"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739941d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Koziorowska","uuid":"3509723B3C9ACF6AC999AADF8F9DFFCBC59EBD1303980F82ED6C7F4BD7719E1581D1822C26EAABF3F62D27DEB38E556101B6169DCDBBF6E954F2721AB7FCCE40","orcidId":"0000-0002-9111-9597","documentHash":"a47a911f-d480-48bd-8d0f-8dc83276f02e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67b315a1fdbe83707bf532b8","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2025.1455803","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2025.1455803/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Spatial and seasonal variability of excess dinitrogen gas in the Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To determine the excess of dissolved dinitrogen gas (DN2 > 0 indicates the loss of bioavailable dissolved nitrogen) in the water column of the Baltic Proper, we measured N2/Ar ratios below the halocline at 19 stations during different seasons between 2017 and 2021. DN2 concentrations below the halocline ranged from 1.0 to 32.6 µmol L-1 for all seasons and sites. A significant spatial difference in DN2 (p = 0.0001) was observed, with the highest values found in the Gotland Deep. The seasonal changes in DN2 were statistically significant (p = 0.005) with the highest concentrations observed in winter. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing the variability of DN2 on a large scale in the Baltic Proper. Our findings suggest that the cumulative loss of bioavailable nitrogen via denitrification and anammox is an important mechanism in the Baltic Sea\nnitrogen cycle. The accumulated signal of N2 production is, however, not\nuniform across the Baltic Proper, exhibiting significant seasonal and spatial\nvariabilities. This calls for future, investigations on a broad spatial scale and a\nseasonal resolution which focus on denitrification and anammox rates in the\nwater column, by utilizing a consistent methodological approach.

of the areas showing most\nnotable changes due to global warming and associated cascade events and processes. The main driving factor,\ntemperature rise, is continuing to cause a large-scale overall decline in ice, from glacier retreating, less coastal land-\nfast ice to thinning and shrinking of open-sea pack ice. This, together with increased inflow of Atlantic waters, is\ncausing profound changes in the local fauna, food web and biodiversity. In parallel, changes in landscape are also\nnotable, mainly due to increasing coastal erosion and glacial melt. Over the past decades, both the traditional hunting-\ntrapping lifestyle and mining have declined almost to the point of non-existence. At the same time, destination tourism\nand scientific research have become the major industries, both associated with an increase in the size of the main\nsettlement of Longyearbyen, and thus also service jobs and local administration. Along with the shrinking of the\nglaciated Arctic landscape, the archipelago exemplifies the broadest level of nature protection in Europe. Strict\nenvironmental regulations that restrict and even prohibit human activities in large areas contribute to Svalbard being\none of the best formally protected wilderness environments in the entire Arctic. Thus, as Svalbard marine ecosystems\ncontinue to change, they also are becoming more accessible to humans, and so also anthropogenic pressures are both\nchanging and increasing in extent. We provide a compilation of both ecosystem components and human activities,\ntogether with indications of how these are, in parallel, changing. This forms the basis for future ecosystem and societal\nvaluation assessments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393755","5e709347878c28a0473a6500","5e709347878c28a0473a6560"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"46","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"29-39","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6500","5e70924f878c28a047393755","5e709347878c28a0473a6560","6799fc68fdbe831aedc9968a","6799fc68fdbe831aedc9968b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479306","mniswId":"16309","title":"Polish Polar Research","issn":"0138-0338","eissn":"2081-8262","documentHash":"b0fa52be-02f9-4991-9f80-9f288f73b726"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638a5c54097076e57a6a886","year":"2024","documentHash":"16d870c4-2261-4b64-9271-0a38be2e91ca"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["European Arctic","climate change","human impact","societal change","biodiversity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060842202"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679ca246fdbe830b35f9115f","name":"Maria","lastName":"Holzmann","documentHash":"36e5ec92-3687-47b2-bdff-d4547ee2fff9"},{"objectId":"679ca246fdbe830b35f9115e","name":"Andrew J.","lastName":"Gooday","documentHash":"120cd16f-4d6e-4fbc-919c-2f871ed2f770"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679ca246fdbe830b35f9115c","doi":"10.1016/j.pocean.2024.103411","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0079661124002179?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"A first look at xenophyophores (Rhizaria, Foraminifera) in the lower bathyal Bering Sea and abyssal areas adjacent to the Aleutian Trench","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Xenophyophores are an abundant component of the megafauna in parts of the equatorial and temperate North Pacific, but few records exist of these giant agglutinated foraminifera in northern North Pacific and adjacent waters. Here, we present a preliminary survey of xenophyophores from the bathyal Bering Sea (∼3500 m depth) and at abyssal depths (4294–6555 m) adjacent to the Aleutian Trench, based on collected material, mainly fragments, and seafloor images. The dominant xenophyophore in the Bering Sea is a reticulated form that yielded DNA sequences identical to those obtained from Syringammina limosa, a species described from > 2700 km to the west in the Sea of Okhotsk. Also visible in seafloor photographs were various plate-like forms, often with upturned, undulating rims, but also branching plates and other more complicated morphotypes that probably represent distinct species. At stations close to the Aleutian Trench, core and epibenthic sledge samples yielded xenophyophores at seven of the 16 sampling sites. At least eleven morphospecies were recognised among those collected, none resembling S. limosa or the plate-like Bering Sea forms. Seafloor images revealed 16 fairly distinct domed or plate-like morphotypes three of these are possibly represented among the collected specimens, making a total of around 24 morphotypes or morphospecies. A few images show morphotypes similar to those seen in the Bering Sea. Our results suggests that xenophyophores are as diverse in the northern North Pacific as they are elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"232","pagesFromTo":"103411","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679ca246fdbe830b35f9115e","679ca246fdbe830b35f9115f","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793d3","mniswId":"16618","title":"Progress in Oceanography","issn":"0079-6611","documentHash":"4bc3bbad-0ed4-4dfe-8f62-93517ff00731"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679ca246fdbe830b35f9115d","year":"2024","documentHash":"6494731f-0f39-4ace-a2b7-23eb7f5f989d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Protista","Deep-sea benthos","North Pacific","Seafloor images"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060875721"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a43fdbe831a3837bfc4","name":"Maren","lastName":"Voss","documentHash":"84bfce47-6476-454b-8fc1-9fb2497a1857"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b80ba","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Pryputniewicz-Flis","uuid":"C33C79B88F47459498783E40C61FB9A9C567A47F8515EE89D3FA0A874863AFA2EE2F1BD0BCEF85CC4DB6892DC4F0D285BB10F99E9D05A33DAAEE90F65880B29C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7641-7238","documentHash":"d7698aa1-8bbe-41ee-a729-05f1fdfaabc1"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b631b","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Saniewska","uuid":"805F98BBA6C969731C605A6D79A564212E88A30BBB179280A169B1828E6E9DC86F4B04A6E5859ABDC7909BB22989827A9708F6B005D1E628FD800B176590B7C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0630-9602","documentHash":"1b45d458-5847-4e40-8dce-e31d0c3e2d7c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kuliński","uuid":"A1362FEB3C94D210BA97D7C5FE392ED27FB4DD61D0B2476A4F5C18B20F589C7FA21F35A13EA5510511C60D24A7EAD1FC4FDC75E86C1645B920BA2AE06C994826","orcidId":"0000-0002-5403-6629","documentHash":"8009c04f-1ba9-4687-80f3-d96316801246"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a653d","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Bełdowski","uuid":"6324C413899A7D55052C03674F85929919743CC2BC68B3E5B4AAA45F79E47792E7A3EC3C7CC1F75C0C115EC7B074EE3974D7F11A989D51502B88F15260A2C634","orcidId":"0000-0002-2891-1901","documentHash":"2d9f6169-3657-4886-b7c4-74b2ba5045de"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c40","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bełdowska","uuid":"A48A6F773BFCA51AAD00108933899A8CFB97306BA86E77BD6E1C2C3F173916EEFDD6A8FF0C1B6F2D169D5F34208E9524FF62E120B68B09F8575EE3C707A1EBBC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3585-9283","documentHash":"38090cfb-a306-49ce-a82e-524d28ca1caf"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739375f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Burska","uuid":"14AF94F4EA9D1DEA232BEFDE1F9F3EA62F1ED0B4D604BBC3CF01F57B2ECFE0D69AC30CF5699FDC917A2E9FF9BD1F28AD03BE18F9F3697B74DF3DEBA132C472BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7708-528X","documentHash":"2a4b5042-ec92-48c0-97ce-a821cf4a78de"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393754","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Szymczak","uuid":"A393FD2B855C68BBE5DF893A3070124BD8B7B100E0CFFE64BF4BE9271D156E074DB03DAFA87038742032BBD15416D484D757BCAEEE3CAB6AAB9FD8A2D23B9D92","orcidId":"0000-0002-6169-2464","documentHash":"e0e8cccc-9034-42c9-9f84-4d855171595f"}],"objectId":"6227310c2467f06c1764a99e","doi":"10.1016/j.marchem.2021.104065","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marchem.2021.104065","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Processes affecting the transformation of mercury in the coastal zone in the vicinity of two river mouths in the southern Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Rivers play an important role in the coastal biogeochemical cycling of mercury (Hg), however, the fate of Hg in these environments remains poorly understood. In this study, we determine how processes such as mixing, flocculation, and settling of particles in the river mouths of the Vistula and the Reda rivers in the southern Baltic Sea, affect the transformation and migration of mercury. The most important process was the mixing of river water with seawater. This process led to a decrease in the concentration of total mercury and particulate mercury with increasing distance from the river mouth. The second most important process affecting the distribution of Hg was flocculation and particle settling. This process most effectively occurred in the middle part of the mouth, where the highest salinity gradient was observed. It was responsible for approximately 32% loss of Hg from the water column with a simultaneous increase in Hg concentration in sediments. In consequence, it significantly limited the transport of Hg to the open Baltic Sea. The assimilation of Hg by marine plankton was also observed. As riverine organic matter stimulated the growth of marine plankton, they actively accumulated Hg and then transferred this metal to the higher trophic level. In both of the river mouths the processes affected the fate of Hg in a similar way. We therefore concluded that the size of the river did not affect the Hg transformation in the river mouth. However, the area of the river catchment, depth of the mouth and hydrological conditions had a significant impact on Hg cycling in the coastal zone in the vicinity of the river mouth."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a04739375f","5e709262878c28a047394c40","5e709419878c28a0473b631b","5e709433878c28a0473b80ba","5e70924f878c28a047393754"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5e709347878c28a0473a653d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"238","pagesFromTo":"1-12","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709419878c28a0473b631b","5e709262878c28a047394c40","5e70924f878c28a047393754","5e709433878c28a0473b80ba","5e70924f878c28a04739375f","5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","677e6a43fdbe831a3837bfc4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d66","mniswId":"13909","title":"Marine Chemistry","issn":"0304-4203","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"31e96c48-5374-4f9a-beed-015606317f7a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["estuary","sea","mixing","flocculation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060881691"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ced774fdbe83617c5117ba","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kubiak","documentHash":"fa7a1c9f-c368-4155-9e85-1ed20bc9643d"},{"objectId":"67ced774fdbe83617c5117b9","name":"Agata","lastName":"Duczmal-Czernikiewicz","documentHash":"eaacdaed-c12c-46a4-96f4-216736adf9c5"},{"objectId":"67ced774fdbe83617c5117b8","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Shunatova","documentHash":"f59ea8e8-c152-4d67-8534-50913e76729c"},{"objectId":"67ced774fdbe83617c5117b7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Piwoni-Piórewicz","documentHash":"f0493f61-d79d-42e4-9771-65f3b62a56d7"},{"objectId":"5e709467878c28a0473bc59b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Krzemińska","uuid":"40368C303C6C42103ABD3BF5D4342F4FF0610EA6B71C5C0AB8EC2B271D18EA7CBD72B796827B93EC8E97B6B845C66B8152E63149444891E5CF388AC1BFAC1587","orcidId":"0000-0001-7823-1253","documentHash":"f54de030-5a94-4885-9efc-348eeb86163c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a2343","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Muszyński","uuid":"7BE139C7920A4038DA31F4E63BA1E5A33A72AA99A9E8860652A45FDEA5D60D9477A5E90B4D681895264CEDC89014D624682AD907E889094C34466F32B42FC80C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9746-0278","documentHash":"a1644d5b-e5f6-478a-b08d-00c885867ef1"}],"objectId":"6227337e2467f06c1764b306","doi":"10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.105542","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Bryozoan carbonate skeletal geochemical composition in the White Sea compared with neighbouring seas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A fundamental question underlying skeletal mineral secretion in marine invertebrates is the extent to which the physico-chemical parameters of seawater (e.g., salinity, temperature) and animal physiology influence their skeletal mineralogy and chemistry. Groups with more complex mineralogies, such as bryozoans, have the ability to actively control their own skeletal composition in response to environmental conditions and could be considered indicators of global environmental change. Thus, this study aims to reveal how the unique environmental conditions of low salinity (circa 24–26), prominent seasonality and semi-isolation of the White Sea (WS) subarctic region caused by the last glaciation (12,000 ya) affect the carbonate skeletal geochemical composition of bryozoans. X-ray diffraction analysis of 27 bryozoan taxa (92 specimens) revealed a completely monomineral calcite composition of skeletons with a mean value of 6.9 ± 1.8 mol% MgCO3 and moderate variability at the species and family levels. Most specimens (43.5%) precipitated skeletal magnesium within the range of 7–8 mol% MgCO3. Regional analysis of the mineralogical profile of the White Sea bryozoans shows that they differ statistically from bryozoan species living in the neighbouring Arctic and temperate Scotland regions in terms of magnesium content in calcite (approximately 7 mol% MgCO3 in the White Sea versus 5 mol% MgCO3 in other regions). We suggest that the effect of low salinity on magnesium content was compensated by relatively high summer temperature causing rapid growth and calcification and possibly resulted in the increased Mg contents in the White Sea (WS) bryozoans. However, on a local scale (between sampling locations), the influence of temperature and salinity could be excluded as a source of observed intraspecific variability. The concentration of MgCO3 in skeletons of the studied bryozoans is controlled by other environmental variables or is species-specific and depends on the physiological processes of the organisms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

Fronts associated with density gradients (active fronts) profoundly structure planktonic communities in adjacent waters, but less is known about the impacts of density-compensated (passive) fronts. Two such fronts are found in the European Arctic, the Arctic Front (AF), and the Polar Front (PF), that both separate warmer and saltier, Atlantic water from the colder, but fresher Arctic water. As scrutinized research on the influence of passive fronts on zooplankton at large spatial and temporal scales had been lacking, we tackled the question of their role in maintaining distinct communities, employing globally unique, twelve years long gelatinous zooplankton (GZ) and hydrological time series from the European Arctic. The GZ, owing to their fast reproductive cycles and passive dispersal, reflect particularly well the local environment. We therefore compared GZ communities between zones separated by the two fronts, disentangled their drivers and analyzed community shifts occurring whenever fronts relocation occurred. We have identified fifteen GZ taxa, distributed among three distinct communities, specific for front-maintained zones, and selected the following taxa as indicators of each zone: W - west of the AF, within the Greenland Sea Gyre, Beroe spp.; C – central, in between the AF and the PF, Aglantha digitale; E - east of the PF, in the West Spitsbergen Shelf Mertensia ovum. Taxonomic composition of these communities, and their specific abundance, persisted throughout the time. We also showed that relocation of either front between the sampling years, was subsequently followed by the restructuring of GZ community. Our results indicate that passive oceanic fronts maintain distinct GZ communities, with probable limited exchange across a front, and provide new perspective for the Arctic ecosystem evolution under progressing Atlantification."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12","5e70929e878c28a0473993f3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","5e709467878c28a0473bc51a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-12","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a0473993f3","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12","5e709467878c28a0473bc51a","5e70940f878c28a0473b5907"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","eissn":"2296-7745","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7fdba0de-070d-4fe1-96ec-11de6b306603"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Polar front","jellyfish","Climate Change","West spitsbergen current","Atlantification","Arctic Front"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060884108"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709467878c28a0473bc51a","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Merchel","uuid":"6AD2CB4499C586B4AE88813E4555694E4C662DA1179E9A5E50B03B44FA6EC89B07A55CEAB5D81049004FBFAD194F3E0B83458227EEC9C23C0D82E6CCBC7107B1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1122-2154","documentHash":"66c23662-6e2a-4802-afdc-c6117f295d95"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kwaśniewski","uuid":"8365CC02046923AD10F327E0A9DF80A2A87646DD41F10E1B4BA9B189ECBDAF4BC4DDB9C2AE001CE03926A8551D8319BB4076255C7C53DDF5522FBDA2313D5552","orcidId":"0000-0003-3104-0761","documentHash":"8b17d9b8-6501-443c-a119-2fcad7a66046"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12","name":"Agata","lastName":"Weydmann-Zwolicka","uuid":"E747C54DA07EC87566C7647C93E9394FFE36F52FF38300571775F980435A21EBA3D37453332B96F03BF05873FAB19CBA6BB7DCF8E7F7052F85D4F5FB0913738D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6655-6613","documentHash":"52375207-91d1-4baa-ba12-4f428e1780b5"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993f3","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Mańko","uuid":"0E2AB2CDD3784941E14E8696C81516FA55044A4C92DEA28D107DBFD406C9A7C5A531BDF57DCB3C6AA9FAEB3809E3996AD93D6E543629FE3DD400CC9411306EAC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6872-0256","documentHash":"84f58948-2004-41f1-a3ab-584301c11a0e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63bd5bec4097073596a1cb5a","doi":"10.1002/lno.12170","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Atlantification alters the reproduction of jellyfish Aglantha digitale in the European Arctic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Increasing heat content, salinity, and velocity of the Atlantic water masses passing northward through the\r\nFram Strait accelerate the transition of the European Arctic toward more Atlantic state, a process referred to as\r\nAtlantification. A pronounced environmental shift leads to a poleward expansion of boreal species ranges and\r\nalters seasonal rhythms of local taxa, potentially affecting the whole food web structure. Here, we monitored a\r\npelagic cnidarian, Aglantha digitale, commonly associated with boreal waters, throughout 12 consecutive summers (2003–2014) and along 2 branches of the West Spitsbergen Current, the main conveyor of Atlantic water\r\nto the Arctic. We documented a steady decrease in A. digitale abundance in the epipelagic waters of the\r\nEuropean Arctic and a disproportionately larger northward advection of this jellyfish with the eastern branch of\r\nthe West Spitsbergen Current compared to the western branch. Supported with modeling techniques, we found\r\nthat year after year, A. digitale reproduced earlier in the southern region, thus leading to an earlier descent of the\r\nlarger, more mature specimens, toward deeper waters, where they avoided our epipelagic sampling. Moreover,\r\nthe prevalence of smaller jellyfish during years with record-level water temperature and salinity (2005–2007) in\r\nthe southern region of the Fram Strait indicated that a 2nd reproductive cycle may have occurred.

This phenomenon is affecting the plankton biomass and communities with potential consequences for the upper trophic levels. Using long-term data (2005-2020) from a high Arctic zooplanktivorous seabird, the little auk (Alle alle), we tested the hypothesis that the Atlantification affects its diet, body condition and demography. We based our study on data collected in three fjords in West Spitsbergen, Svalbard, characterized by distinct oceanographic conditions. In all three fjords, we found a positive relationship between the inflow of Atlantic Waters and the proportion of Atlantic prey, notably of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, in the little auk chick diet. A high proportion of Atlantic prey was negatively associated with adult body mass (though the effect size was small) and with chick survival (only in one fjord where chick survival until 21 days was available). We also found a negative and marginally significant effect of the average proportion of Atlantic prey in the chick diet on chick growth rate (data were available for one fjord only). Our results suggest that there are fitness costs for the little auk associated with the Atlantification of West Spitsbergen fjords. These costs seem especially pronounced during the late phase of the chick rearing period, when the energetic needs of the chicks are the highest. Consequently, even if little auks can partly adapt their foraging behaviour to changing environmental conditions, they are negatively affected by the ongoing changes in the Arctic marine ecosystems. These results stress the importance of long-term monitoring data in the Arctic to improve our understanding of the ongoing Atlantification and highlight the relevance of using seabirds as indicators of environmental change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70945d878c28a0473bb76e","5e709249878c28a0473931c9","5e709249878c28a0473931a1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6520","5e70943f878c28a0473b8d4d","5e709469878c28a0473bc64c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-14","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709249878c28a0473931c9","5e709249878c28a0473931a1","5e70945d878c28a0473bb76e","677d30a4fdbe831a382e2ec4","677d30a4fdbe831a382e2ec5","677d30a4fdbe831a382e2ec6","677d30a4fdbe831a382e2ec7","677d30a4fdbe831a382e2ec8","677d30a4fdbe831a382e2ec9","677d30a4fdbe831a382e2eca","5e70943f878c28a0473b8d4d","677d30a4fdbe831a382e2ecc","5e709469878c28a0473bc64c","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","eissn":"2296-7745","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7fdba0de-070d-4fe1-96ec-11de6b306603"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["borealization","Spitsbergen","copepod","fitness costs","Alle alle","Calanus","little auk"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060884270"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"675e4d39ece39855f73c5c76","name":"Dhanushka","lastName":"Devendra","uuid":"97CB8673E8D17F8D782C594A47A3D138C23AB9DF6185036007A0E66A71C0F56FB0FD6CE57BAFEF31B9E1C772252325CA7F7B542FA7CCE53AE3396361DCD8F303","documentHash":"2f0e57c5-8025-4931-9e64-9c4801effc59"},{"objectId":"633152304097073dc8681027","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Sztybor","documentHash":"2b35a4e5-30f0-4ef9-aa03-003b4d0df8eb"},{"objectId":"633152304097073dc8681026","name":"Tine L.","lastName":"Rasmussen","documentHash":"4bf73fd6-6f82-4656-8b7a-08493b8c5d08"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Telesiński","uuid":"489C4C47EF921C95D0F87CFB076DC6C5FACC4929FD769C245D474C0500CA9B758985ED1B7EDED36C930624568C2BE3B13EE087C9ACE1A45D7EF7EE4A6418A876","orcidId":"0000-0002-5765-2849","documentHash":"261899e6-0135-4cb7-b067-e1e7e987ab86"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc63c","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Łącka-Wojciechowska","uuid":"513BE42A7BB96A082AF947DB45BCB3F2EE649339900A5CA10FE32D0060C1D79E43F98015792F579A5D61DA6E387056AF1A4DF99520BA392238DE0916A503F463","orcidId":"0000-0001-8976-8806","documentHash":"2b4384f1-b95b-430c-8aa1-7799792b1cf6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6526","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zajączkowski","uuid":"61768C4E190810A84AFC1067320A335E9317C35A01DD9975F8CEB8197E3D86D8F6A9ACECEE6D8E804AE2EBFC8A804CECDF21093A04A3A083FD4F8153BEAB0988","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-7359","documentHash":"aee5a47c-de7d-4323-8adc-7fe11d3cf4f0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-10","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"633152304097073dc8681024","doi":"10.1016/j.gloplacha.2022.103947","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0921818122002144?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Paleoceanography of the Northwestern Greenland Sea and Return Atlantic Current evolution, 35–4 kyr BP","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The flow of the Atlantic Water (AW) via the Return Atlantic Current (RAC) regulates the oceanographical conditions in the Northwestern (NW) Greenland Sea in the Fram Strait. As the intensity of the RAC might significantly influence both deep-water formation in the area and the stability of the Northeast Greenland Ice Sheet (NE GIS), knowledge of its variability in the past is important. Here we present a reconstruction of the paleoceanographic forcing of the AW on climatic conditions and associated environmental changes in the NW Greenland Sea by means of foraminiferal assemblages, stable (oxygen and carbon) isotopes, and various sedimentological parameters from sediment core GR02-GC retrieved from NE Greenland continental slope (1170 m water depth). Our data indicate an almost continuous presence of AW in the NW Greenland Sea during the last 35 kyr BP. Two peaks of low planktic δ18O values at ∼34.5 and 33 kyr BP are interpreted as meltwater signals associated with warm AW-induced melting of the adjacent NE GIS. The NE GIS advanced between 32 and 29 kyr BP, resulting in reduced meltwater influx to the NW Greenland Sea. Increased iceberg calving and melting after 29 kyr BP, were probably linked to surface warming and glacier advance to the shelf-break lasting until 23.5 kyr BP. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the extensive sea ice cover was associated with the presence of subsurface AW at the study site. During the Bølling–Allerød (B/A, ∼14.6–12.7 kyr BP) strong melting of glaciers and sea ice was probably caused by the combined effect of the B/A warming and the flow of warm AW. The RAC was weakened during the Younger Dryas (∼12.8–11.7 kyr BP), which reduced the advection of warm AW to the NW Greenland Sea. After 11.7 kyr BP, the RAC reached its modern strength, whereas, during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, it reached its maximum strength for the study period. In addition, short-term weakening of AW inflow to the core site was observed, especially at 10.5, 8.5, and 5.8 kyr BP."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","5e709347878c28a0473a6526","675e4d39ece39855f73c5c76","5e709469878c28a0473bc63c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"217","pagesFromTo":"103947","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["675e4d39ece39855f73c5c76","5e709469878c28a0473bc63c","5e7094c3878c28a0473c3498","633152304097073dc8681026","633152304097073dc8681027","5e709347878c28a0473a6526"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e4d","mniswId":"7241","title":"GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE","issn":"0921-8181","documentHash":"08b96e6b-9739-4b62-820d-32070dcbbac0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633152304097073dc8681025","year":"2022","volume":"217","documentHash":"4752e8e3-14d7-4e2a-ae0c-c706fb777353"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fram Strait","Atlantic Water","Foraminifera","Stable isotopes","Late Weichselian"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060884301"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b944","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Pyrć","documentHash":"4cf9d934-0656-41bb-ab0d-6020e52aaf25"},{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b943","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Barreto-Duran","documentHash":"40fa43ba-f383-4b96-ad76-bd64eeeecad5"},{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b942","name":"Yuliya","lastName":"Chykunova","documentHash":"b6a1ac46-6432-4e1d-bc8a-a8c588001e13"},{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b941","name":"Artur","lastName":"Szczepański","documentHash":"c7bca08c-b7ae-4066-b337-a16e3be8538e"},{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b940","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Lis","documentHash":"5bb8234b-f2ec-4a07-9a2a-8f6026ca5352"},{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93f","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Milewska","documentHash":"97d513a4-3602-438f-aca6-90b67fe791ec"},{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93e","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Plewka","documentHash":"6c002116-eeb0-4832-99fe-0d0a56cb26a3"},{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Lenart","documentHash":"37a26352-6642-44ac-97b9-7c7fe24de9f4"},{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93c","name":"Beata","lastName":"Grygier","documentHash":"77799f35-4fb6-47f0-89bd-7e4077dc1cba"},{"objectId":"677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93b","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Szubert","documentHash":"9453c00c-b088-42cf-90e7-1765ca93258f"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b531d","name":"Marta","lastName":"Cegłowska","uuid":"89FE0790F5C9D9E8F0260FF7B9232D603066BED265D2DA543EBC02B4A61C62B11FD24340296284E0CC2F71D75AE72065559F3C82C1C50598882121E3853911FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6601-5825","documentHash":"411af4a6-4468-4760-bcca-7323b99db6ce"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a650d","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Kosakowska","uuid":"1AAB831CD2AD1B28FA458153B8981967085805E7D78736669B40DC2A29E4D0F3D45CA2F3AFCBB6D2007D46E8ED4039B3DBDFB7B50DDF4F090AF685C0F59CB995","orcidId":"0000-0002-5833-0016","documentHash":"0d84f357-f20e-4e28-a377-5fe5d798ecf6"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739376e","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Mazur-Marzec","uuid":"2852F5647EE385956A11FD39CEA425EFF527786F3E1EC88F4B48FD89DEBB05D21128545C3FF7B9D04705B55E13F3DD254507B596D8D439373A1BFE5D7F9FEDBF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6526-4045","documentHash":"79af155b-3304-43df-b504-96adcf915d45"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6281f2db4097077bd401257e","doi":"10.3390/toxins14050330","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins14050330","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Pseudanabaena galeata CCNP1313 - biological activity and peptides production","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Even cyanobacteria from ecosystems of low biodiversity, such as the Baltic Sea, can constitute a rich source of bioactive metabolites.

In previous work on the Baltic Pseudanabaena galeata CCNP1313, the induction of apoptosis in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 was documented. Here, the activity of the strain was further explored using human dermal fibroblasts, African green monkey kidney, cancer cell lines (T47D, HCT-8, and A549ACE2/TMPRSS2) and viruses (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, and WNV). In the tests, extracts, chromatographic fractions, and the main components of the P. galeata CCNP1313 fractions were used. The LC-MS/MS analyses of the tested samples led to the detection of forty-five peptides. For fourteen of the new peptides, putative structures were proposed based on MS/MS spectra. Although the complex samples (i.e., extracts and chromatographic fractions) showed potent cytotoxic and antiviral activities, the effects of the isolated compounds were minor. The study confirmed the significance of P. galeata CCNP1313 as a source of metabolites with potent activity. It also illustrated the difficulties in assigning the observed biological effects to specific metabolites, especially when they are produced in minute amounts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93b","5e70924f878c28a04739376e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b531d","5e709347878c28a0473a650d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1-21","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739376e","5e709408878c28a0473b531d","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93b","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93c","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93d","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93e","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b93f","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b940","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b941","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b942","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b943","677e6a16fdbe831a3837b944","5e709347878c28a0473a650d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479977","mniswId":"19616","title":"Toxins","issn":"2072-6651","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"f5ce86ad-97e4-472c-b5f7-4febfe9ccfe5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pseudanabaena galeata","anticancer activity","antiviral activity","cytotoxicity","new peptides"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060884319"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b435a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jóźwiak","uuid":"D79461FBFDEF2F2CA50738A1995D43BA7E13E795F8914BF4957C8F921AB1E3C6F0D307D122728F8F924331898C166D14C5579AF4627DA9FDBD8917583CC15323","orcidId":"0000-0002-5171-3145","documentHash":"07f85df8-35b9-4140-95b6-10b06492f023"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473adda2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Pabis","uuid":"9F20387CD293DED7AF5AD4981E91D26F887428A76BF61CF9C0E9E6BC8110D6155C465BA3BAB5CE799A02297FE28ECA37540A804341979B1DA505CAF66A759244","orcidId":"0000-0002-9625-3453","documentHash":"4b581b07-67b9-4ec8-988e-ad6b5095604f"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9c53","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Błażewicz","uuid":"60266185E130C07C9F864222BE080D0AA11BDB68F11D9B6759D19410976AF2A6ACEB7A8E207A900FA33C5D6CF4563FDFEA48B6E272EBCB15CDAA00CBBC5C5641","orcidId":"0000-0002-4753-3424","documentHash":"ce936d8f-003d-4117-83e1-49f92d18b0be"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651e","name":"Maria","lastName":"Włodarska-Kowalczuk","uuid":"D47553F9A2C33D8033D8594650BFC32CC9C68EF6F3EE4CE130DBEC8BA3DF82ED9A7055BF1E4316109AD31C2E6DBEF73F3FEF158A522731E002B07E209F106EDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2757-1108","documentHash":"01d767d9-9266-45a4-bd4b-a8cf8d1e8a8e"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a5f5","name":"TERESA","lastName":"RADZIEJEWSKA","uuid":"FBFFADF1A87403E791BF8B02B64128E2D2FE4162C0CEDAC6D24CC62437CDB20DC69CEBBF1A1CC52F9FD8DBADD98FFAA467028934E3433D027B52087E55F154F0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4759-1306","documentHash":"2693dbb8-d14a-476b-825c-77e2c5a44abc"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6375f93e40970765d46302e2","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2022.898828","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.898828/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Benthic biology in the Polish exploration contract area of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge: The knowns and the unknowns : a review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"n February 2018, the Government of Poland and the International Seabed Authority signed a 15-year contract for exploration of polymetallic sulfide deposits on a section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge extending between the Hayes, Atlantic and Kane transform faults (32°45.378’ N, 39°57.760’ W to 26°14.411’ N, 44°18.008’ W). The contractor is obliged to collect data on the contract area environment and its ecosystem components. In this context, it is important that the contractor establishes a sound starting point which further baseline investigations can be referred to. Such a starting point involves assessment of currently held information and, most importantly, knowledge gaps on the ecosystem components in the area of exploration (and of potential future exploitation). Of major importance here is the knowledge on benthic communities, as it is the benthos that will be most affected by any human intervention in the area of interest. Based on available published evidence, we have reviewed the present state of knowledge on benthic communities in the Polish exploration contract area (PECA). In the process, we have identified important knowledge gaps that will need to be addressed during exploration surveys. These include, but are not limited to, the distribution and structure of benthic communities throughout the contract area, the spatial and temporal variability of those communities, possible differences between communities inhabiting active and inactive vent fields, connectivity issues and the recovery potential. Special consideration should be given to Lost City, a geologically and ecologically unique hydrothermal field which has been a focus of international research and an important conservation target."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f902","uid":"bk_n03ydqnhCQzeW0cj586g","uuid":"dae78b8a-6bdd-4a4c-aeba-e3409b15c413","name":"Instytut Nauk o Morzu i

of beach wrack on the fate of mercury at the land-sea interface - a preliminary study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Since the 1970s, the amount of aquatic plants and algae debris, called beach wrack (BW), has increased along the shores of industrialised regions. The strong ability of primary producers to accumulate pollutants can potentially result in their deposition on the beach along with the BW. Despite that, the fate and impact of such pollutants on sandy beach ecosystems have not been investigated so far. This study examines the fate of neurotoxic mercury and its labile and stable fractions in BW on sandy beaches of the Puck Bay (Baltic Sea). In addition to BW, beach sediments and wrack-associated macrofauna were also analysed. Rough estimations showed that Puck Bay beaches (58.8 km) may be a temporary storage of 0.2-0.5 kg of mercury, deposited on them along with the BW annually. A large proportion of Hg (89 ± 16%) in a BW was labile and potentially bioavailable. The contribution of Hg fractions in the BW was conditioned by the degree of its decomposition (molar C:N:P ratio). With the progressive degradation of BW, a decrease in the contribution of Hg adsorbed on its surface with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of adsorbed (intracellular), mercury was observed. BW accumulation decreased oxygen content and redox potential and increased methylmercury content in underlying sediments, indicating methylation. Hg concentrations in the studied fauna were up to 4 times higher than in the BW. The highest values occurred in a predatory sand bear spider and the lowest in a herbivorous sand hopper. Regardless of trophic position, most of Hg (92-95%) occurred as an absorbed fraction, which indicates about a 30% increase in relation to its share of BW. These findings suggest the significant role of BW as a mercury carrier in a land-sea interface and increased exposure of beach communities to the adverse effects of mercury in coastal ecosystems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709262878c28a047394c40","5e70924f878c28a04739376c","5e70924f878c28a047393764"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6541","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","61a83db87523402fabe26d33","5e709438878c28a0473b85f9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"315","pagesFromTo":"1-11","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393764","5e709262878c28a047394c40","5e70924f878c28a04739376c","61a83db87523402fabe26d33","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","5e709347878c28a0473a6541","5e709438878c28a0473b85f9","677e6a19fdbe831a3837b9ad","677e6a19fdbe831a3837b9ae"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b0e","mniswId":"5835","title":"Environmental Pollution","issn":"0269-7491","eissn":"1873-6424","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"98be96ab-7362-44e2-8258-0d76d11fec8b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mercury","shoreline","seaweed","decay","fractions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060884726"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67b5d197fdbe8362a577f5ae","name":"Agata","lastName":"Weydmann-Zwolicka","documentHash":"19311232-c30f-4b9e-84ab-2e03dd2dc7ec"},{"objectId":"67b5d197fdbe8362a577f5ac","name":"Anna-Karina","lastName":"Kaczorowska","documentHash":"a8770d6f-4095-4317-8c63-1d94bbfab2c9"},{"objectId":"67b5d197fdbe8362a577f5ab","name":"Jan P.","lastName":"Jastrzębski","documentHash":"a1470fc1-4f6b-4585-b5f6-ec81c4763820"},{"objectId":"67b5d197fdbe8362a577f5aa","name":"Anna","lastName":"Iglikowska","documentHash":"121bece4-a14c-4e93-b140-837651981b3b"},{"objectId":"67b5d197fdbe8362a577f5a9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mioduchowska","documentHash":"0411ba40-6f9b-48f2-a7e5-7556329641e7"},{"objectId":"602ba3059543c7410626df19","name":"Artur","lastName":"Trzebny","uuid":"536EC7BF834D2E8F0C4EB44D5D1A5B1B76215FB9B0123E3A886EC587534B43FFE55EE3BEBD10481D1B71FA625FFEA951F47C69C78B5935D86B7CDF4694ECC5BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-0831-7243","documentHash":"1366b36a-1264-4cd0-bf05-8a9574c80e1a"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6547","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kotlarska","uuid":"21C7374EE8D85591AF0BF4337FF25DA10E6C171A3B9220801ECB74ACA089F5AAC3C3CAE7E0EC6B2AFBF54E523E70E1EE92AB17A7A36AABD20CF04C155730C5C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-3122-7772","documentHash":"f26aba89-9744-4f38-af11-2a2d8da22ef9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6385f67c40970769ab6d5d5f","doi":"10.3390/w14233855","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Challenges of Comparing Marine Microbiome Community Composition Data Provided by Different Commercial Laboratories and Classification Databases","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<p>In the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) era, a metabarcoding technique based on the bacterial V3–V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA analysis requires sophisticated bioinformatics pipelines and validated methods that allow researchers to compare their data with confidence. Many commercial laboratories conduct extensive HTS analyses; however, there is no available information on whether the results generated by these vendors are consistent. In our study, we compared the sequencing data obtained for the same marine microbiome community sample generated by three commercial laboratories. Additionally, as a sequencing control to determine differences between commercial laboratories and two 16S rRNA databases, we also performed a “mock community” analysis of a defined number of microbial species. We also assessed the impact of the choice of two commonly used 16S rRNA databases, i.e., Greengenes and SILVA, on downstream data analysis, including taxonomic classification assignment. We demonstrated that the final results depend on the choice of the laboratory conducting the HTS and the reference database of ribosomal sequences. Our findings showed that the number of produced ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) ranged from 137 to 564. Different putative bacterial endosymbionts could be identified, and these differences correspond to the applied 16S rRNA database. The results presented might be of particular interest to researchers who plan to perform microbiome community analysis using the 16S rRNA marker gene, including the identification of putative bacterial endosymbionts, and serve as a guide for choosing the optimum pipeline to obtain the most accurate and reproducible data.</p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

Therefore, the remobilization of natural and anthropogenic contaminants is gaining importance in their biogeochemical\r\ncycle. In the marine coastal zone, this process occurs during the erosion of a shore, especially\r\nthe most vulnerable cliffs. The research was conducted in the Gulf of Gdansk ´ (southern Baltic\r\nSea) from 2016 to 2017. The sediment cores were collected from four cliffs; additionally, marine surface sediments were also taken. The concentrations of essential (Cr, Mn, Fr, Cu, Zn)\r\nand nonessential (Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba) metals were analyzed using the XRF technique. The levels\r\nof the analyzed metals were relatively low, typical of nonpolluted areas. However, considering\r\nthe mass of eroded sediments, the annual load of metals introduced into the sea in this way is\r\nsignificant. In the case of Cu, Zn, and Y the load can amount to a few kilograms, for Cr and Rb\r\n— over ten kilograms, for Mn, Sr, and Zr — several tens of kilograms, for toxic Ba — over 100\r\nkg, and in the case of Fe — 4.8 tonnes. During strong winds and storms, when the upper part of\r\na cliff is eroded, especially the load of Zn and Cr entering the sea may increase. The content\r\nof Cr, Zr, and Ba in the cliffs was higher compared to marine sediments from the deep accumulation bottom, which indicates that coastal erosion may be an important source of these\r\nmetals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709262878c28a047394c40","677e6a0ffdbe831a3837b868"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a653d","5e709467878c28a0473bc51c","61a83db87523402fabe26d33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"64","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"553-566","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709262878c28a047394c40","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","677e6a0ffdbe831a3837b868","5e709467878c28a0473bc51c","61a83db87523402fabe26d33"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"0078-3234","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"21cd6d5e-391e-4879-83bd-3b75e5a7ac2d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cliffs","Metals","coastal erosion","sediments","Baltic Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060884772"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea8","name":"Marco","lastName":"Bartoli","documentHash":"12865238-a76e-40c8-a8cc-1098a2ed0736"},{"objectId":"680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea7","name":"Stefano","lastName":"Bonaglia","documentHash":"dd25bd75-ceea-476c-ac0d-56db75e9b076"},{"objectId":"680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea6","name":"Mindaugas","lastName":"Zilius","documentHash":"dd17ba58-a44a-4acf-bf86-600030f1d0c6"},{"objectId":"680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea5","name":"Sergej","lastName":"Olenin","documentHash":"0274b882-ba6e-4875-8cd7-e238098e36f2"},{"objectId":"680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea4","name":"Tobia","lastName":"Politi","documentHash":"e4ae9802-2700-492f-85ea-2cd2a4dbe439"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739940b","name":"Kajetan","lastName":"Deja","uuid":"9D662B5DB9D9989CA2118EDEC7988EF7D4D3980D2C609A38B7C9587CFC9D6D5B787097E27010CA8550182A7210D7D7626DAA6E7FFF1C7E0FD28C9FB88D4072BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6707-3883","documentHash":"2fb48e59-8c28-4aaa-9364-256c74d01e4d"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993cf","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"BACE9E820844C505745871AB1E069A3FE871A0AA597DB695946ABCEDABDAE239968DE9050390480EE9C612EF6607DE8183FD2AFDFD78CEDEECA17F889594D919","documentHash":"3bc43de3-b90c-4854-8782-492442b45a2c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-04-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea2","doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2025.109304","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0272771425001829?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Benthic metabolism and macrofauna bioturbation along a glacier-driven gradient in Kongsfjorden","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate change is warming the Arctic at a rate four times faster than the global average. Due to a unique pattern in ocean currents, the Kongsfjorden fjord in Svalbard (Norway) is experiencing even more rapid warming causing tidewater glaciers to retreat. Increasing freshwater and terrestrial inputs are expected to determine deep impacts at fjord head more than at fjord mouth, affecting both benthic communities and biogeochemistry, selecting highly tolerant pioneer taxa, such as polychaetes with a high bioturbation and nutrient recycling potential.\nIn this work 16 intact sediment cores were collected from the head and the mouth of Kongsfjorden and incubated in the dark at in situ temperature. Benthic fluxes of nutrients and gas, and denitrification rates were assessed during the incubations and macrofauna abundance and community were analyzed. Benthic metabolism and macrofauna bioturbation were then contrasted and interpreted with respect to the glacier disturbance.\nAt the glacier front, oxygen and nitrate respiration, methane efflux and nutrient regeneration were higher than at the fjord mouth. At the inner fjord the macrofauna community was more abundant and dominated by deep burrowing polychaetes, tolerant to glacier disturbance. Through bioturbation, they played a crucial role in stimulating coupled nitrification and denitrification, ammonium, and methane release. Our models indicate that polychaetes contribute significantly (32%) to the total flux variability confirming their role in nutrient cycling. In this Arctic fjord, warming, glacial retreat and disturbance favor pioneer species of macrofauna that promote the recycle of nutrients and the evasion of methane."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a0473993cf","5e70929e878c28a04739940b","5e709347878c28a0473a6500"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"109304","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea4","680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea5","5e70929e878c28a04739940b","5e70929e878c28a0473993cf","680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea6","680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea7","5e709347878c28a0473a6500","680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff6e5ad49b31ccec45400","title":"ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE","issn":"0272-7714","eissn":"0272-7714","documentHash":"2dcd1643-60cc-426c-9bc2-bb07190c3f64"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"680a13adfdbe831c0f990ea3","year":"2025","documentHash":"03f1ed23-af9a-4ca1-81d5-c0a4b6d1c12f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Benthic macrofauna","Arctic fjords","Nutrients","Glacier","Functional traits","Fluxes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060887245"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69a9fdbe831a3837a628","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Płońska","documentHash":"7b8cf00c-1964-469e-b4d6-5f2ae0d42367"},{"objectId":"677e69a9fdbe831a3837a626","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Wilman","documentHash":"48cfbe05-8e63-41cc-868f-ecb7d23af0a1"},{"objectId":"677e69a9fdbe831a3837a625","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Fudala","documentHash":"827bd7ac-6414-421c-9b23-63cd81b588c1"},{"objectId":"677e69a9fdbe831a3837a624","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Jarzynowska","documentHash":"f45e6cc7-9009-4180-8872-fd0efab7d98e"},{"objectId":"5e7094ed878c28a0473c717f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Saniewski","uuid":"73D372462BCFCB5B5D0D49E2207DF9797C0B847808F117642642D43A49BB2C3C0E6EE4DDCC31778F9F88EF0249A6D812E7017ADAD91BE797603D5F9604825B98","orcidId":"0000-0002-2347-1660","documentHash":"974674eb-b8f5-42d1-ba40-6460bd4b3fef"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b631b","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Saniewska","uuid":"805F98BBA6C969731C605A6D79A564212E88A30BBB179280A169B1828E6E9DC86F4B04A6E5859ABDC7909BB22989827A9708F6B005D1E628FD800B176590B7C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0630-9602","documentHash":"1b45d458-5847-4e40-8dce-e31d0c3e2d7c"}],"objectId":"64b1461540970704a433e29d","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115237","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Mercury and methylmercury in birds and marine mammals inhabiting the coastal zone of the two King George Island's bays: Admiralty and King George Bay (maritime Antarctic)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Antarctic is particularly sensitive to mercury (Hg) pollution and even low levels of Hg may cause significant damage in this fragile environment.

They have been identified in cyanobacteria of genera Microcystis, Oscillatoria, and Limnoraphis. In this work, the new data on the in vitro activities of three AEG variants, AEG A, AEG625 and AEG657, and their interactions with metabolic enzymes are reported. Two aeruginosamides, AEG625 and AEG657, decreased the viability of human breast cancer cell line T47D, but neither of the peptides was active against human liver cancer cell line Huh7. AEGs also did not change the expression of MIR92b-3p, but for AEG625, the induction of oxidative stress was observed. In the presence of a liver S9 fraction containing microsomal and cytosolic enzymes, AEG625 and AEG657 showed high stability. In the same assays, quick removal of AEG A was recorded. The peptides had mild activity against three cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, but only at the highest concentration used in the study (60 µM). The properties of AEGs, i.e., cytotoxic activity and in vitro interactions with important metabolic enzymes, form a good basis for further studies on their pharmacological potential."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a04739376e","677e6a15fdbe831a3837b914"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b531d","5e709347878c28a0473a650d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1-12","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739376e","5e709408878c28a0473b531d","677e6a15fdbe831a3837b913","677e6a15fdbe831a3837b914","677e6a15fdbe831a3837b915","677e6a15fdbe831a3837b916","677e6a15fdbe831a3837b917","5e709347878c28a0473a650d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d67","mniswId":"13910","title":"Marine Drugs","issn":"1660-3397","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"d344c631-ab0f-4cf6-bd9a-cea727af08a9"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aeruginosamides","metabolic stability","miRNA","cyanopeptides","cytotoxicity","cytochrome P450 enzymes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060914679"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66911f42fdbe83399d799b26","name":"Marta","lastName":"Mitręga","documentHash":"218680d6-35dd-4b93-bbb1-64fdff9a07f0"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1da","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Pleskot","uuid":"29F7A4C62965B9B0FCF7AEE454F1FB1844D045B9F411CF3081E686AD479852E4B861AFA24F1AC9F6734857C155F0AA3B3797A597943D40843D4401B18BE8C7D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3724-1700","documentHash":"2409c721-5f82-45ea-93b1-e0056dffc693"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a6814","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Kokociński","uuid":"7A3A1564390EE7BF40A930D4335DE46F033CD064884EA3A46FD489E3AA112694518550A8EB4CB7654A7BEF127B6DCF4DF9B34D327C07F437E622DEF0298FA096","orcidId":"0000-0002-0552-9769","documentHash":"a96bedc8-cbbf-45f0-afe0-bde5c474c4f7"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6526","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zajączkowski","uuid":"61768C4E190810A84AFC1067320A335E9317C35A01DD9975F8CEB8197E3D86D8F6A9ACECEE6D8E804AE2EBFC8A804CECDF21093A04A3A083FD4F8153BEAB0988","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-7359","documentHash":"aee5a47c-de7d-4323-8adc-7fe11d3cf4f0"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a237c","name":"Robert","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"D95E8615BCDFA522577C3B499C09C731F66FB3D1B6FE83C908D15546795FB5BA21F3F930D7E85C82CF130E41E9FA8FECF3B6EB03D72E3812619B697F6387C628","orcidId":"0000-0002-8469-215X","documentHash":"275d5236-9634-43a5-9448-e755155c3834"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a2351","name":"Witold","lastName":"Szczuciński","uuid":"69620A91E3F16B8B1CFFB4237B7C60EB24B889216F043689B292971362BA10D2DE3FD3662BA72A11EE71168B5C81F9E2C28E52FB9E95EA629AFE4D09C0293949","orcidId":"0000-0003-2466-2263","documentHash":"0e0883a5-25f5-48f2-9d0b-bb1c2a465529"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"646201c140970734435a882a","doi":"10.1016/j.palaeo.2023.111499","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Late Holocene Vistula River floods recorded in grain size distributions and diatom assemblages of marine sediments of the Gulf of Gdańsk (Baltic Sea)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During the large flood of the Vistula River in 2010, the riverine brackish water surface plume extended up to 70\r\nkm into the Gulf of Gda´nsk (Baltic Sea), leaving a thin layer of medium-grained sand deposits. It inspired a search\r\nfor palaeoflood records in marine sediments. Thus, we aimed to identify the most useful flood indicators and\r\napply them to reveal palaeoflood records in sediment cores from the Gulf of Gda´nsk. The study is based on\r\nanalyses of surface samples, collected during and one year after the 2010 flood, and two long sediment cores,\r\nwhich were subjected to high-resolution grain size, diatom, and geochemical analyses, while chronology was\r\nbased on the combined AMS 14C, 210Pb and 137Cs dating. It was found that, in a water depth of less than 30 m,\r\nmodern large flood deposits were not preserved after a year. Sediment cores retrieved from greater water depths\r\n(over 60 m) were composed of sandy mud, and most of the 1 cm thick sediment samples were characterized by\r\nunimodal grain size distribution. However, some of the samples were bimodal, with the additional mode in fine-\r\ngrained fractions, which is interpreted to be the result of direct deposition from riverine flood surface water\r\nplume. The diatom assemblages revealed a moderate downcore variability, except for the intervals characterized\r\nby bimodal grain size distributions. They contained elevated amounts of benthic oligohalobous (freshwater) and\r\ndecreased euhalobous and mesohalobous taxa, supporting the likely interpretation of these layers as deposited\r\nduring river flood events. During the last c. 4 ka, a dozen major flood events were identified. However, their\r\napplication to flood climate reconstruction is challenging because of relatively frequent and partly unknown\r\nchanges in major river mouth positions in the past. We suggest that thin deposits of major floods left on the\r\nseafloor and subjected to further mixing maybe still recognized using a combination of high-resolution grain size\r\ndistribution and diatom analyses supplemented by a good understanding of the depositional system history."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

Among the uncertainties regarding the risks associated with these compounds, bioconcentration is\r\none of the key issues, about which many doubts have been raised in recent years. While in vitro data suggest that per-\r\nmanently charged compounds can also bioconcentrate, conclusive evidence in the form of studies on organisms, at\r\nleast for selected compounds, is needed. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to determine whether\r\nimidazolium cations of ILs, namely 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium ([IM18]+) and 1-methyl-3-dodecylimidazolium\r\n([IM1–12]+), can bioconcentrate in marine invertebrates tissues. During 21-day experiments, Mytilus trossulus mussels\r\nwere exposed to these cations individually, at a concentration of 10 μg/L. In our study, it has been demonstrated for the\r\nfirst time during in vivo study, that long-chain imidazolium ionic liquids can bioconcentrate. The determined BCF value\r\nfor [IM1–12]+ of 21,901 ± 3400 L/kg makes this compound to be considered highly bioaccumulative according to\r\ncommonly accepted criteria. However, the obtained BCF for [IM18]+ (with the value below 100) suggests that this\r\ncation has little potential for bioconcentration. On the other hand, no salinity or anion influence on the\r\nbioconcentration of the tested cations was observed. Our tests also confirm that imidazolium ILs exhibit acute toxicity\r\nonly at relatively high concentration levels, as LC50 reached 0.68 mg/L for [IM1–12][Br], and 11.66 mg/L for [IM18]\r\n[C(CN)3]. This further confirms that the risks associated with the potential presence of these compounds in the envi-\r\nronment should be attributed to their high persistence and potential bioconcentration, rather than acute toxicity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b80f1","5e70924b878c28a04739320a","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","6777d832fdbe831a38c31521"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c32ca09543c72336543fce","5e709326878c28a0473a3b20"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"858","issue":"pt. 1","pagesFromTo":"1-7","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b80f1","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef8","5e70924b878c28a04739320a","6777d832fdbe831a38c31521","60c32ca09543c72336543fce","5e709326878c28a0473a3b20"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["toxicity","BCF","water pollution","bioaccumulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060914839"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69c6fdbe831a3837aa0a","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Patuła","documentHash":"8045b9b3-5528-4177-a07b-0e6562b3560d"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda","name":"MARTA","lastName":"RONOWICZ","uuid":"A12BD0AEECF4F7FD3C28D29DBAFC1BCC4FB4821C697A9C3870D029B46A87F78F286EC78CCEDFA8B73418C66DE888C52FFE9A9BB6EB89D9B701ADD57682C49148","orcidId":"0000-0001-8703-9132","documentHash":"c9083290-9530-45cf-b1ca-c1e3f397a474"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12","name":"Agata","lastName":"Weydmann-Zwolicka","uuid":"E747C54DA07EC87566C7647C93E9394FFE36F52FF38300571775F980435A21EBA3D37453332B96F03BF05873FAB19CBA6BB7DCF8E7F7052F85D4F5FB0913738D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6655-6613","documentHash":"52375207-91d1-4baa-ba12-4f428e1780b5"}],"objectId":"6572ddcf4097074b37772234","doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2023.108295","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The interplay between predatory chaetognaths and zooplankton community in a high Arctic fjord","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the marine environment, chaetognaths are among the major predators of zooplankton. The most common Chaetognatha species in the Arctic coastal waters are Parasagitta elegans and Eukrohnia hamata. Their distribution and size structure and potential predatory impact on the zooplankton community were analyzed in Isfjorden (Svalbard Archipelago). Parasagitta elegans dominated in terms of biomass (1.5 mg DM ∙ m−3) over E. hamata (0.09 mg DM ∙ m−3), and the clear pattern of chaetognaths' size distribution was noticed: smaller individuals occurred in the upper water layers, while larger ones were observed near the fjords’ bottom. Based on Redundancy Analysis (RDA) followed by variation partitioning, the zooplankton community was influenced by environmental variables (36.6%) and by chaetognaths (16.6%), while the joint impact for both groups of these predictors was 46.6%. Both increasing temperature and P. elegans influenced medium-sized and small copepods (e.g., Calanus finmarchicus, Oithona similis), pteropods, and meroplankton larvae (upper layers), while E. hamata was related to larger copepods (e.g., Calanus hyperboreus, Metridia longa) at greater depths. The study showed different predation pressure of P. elegans and E. hamata in the Arctic fjord and revealed complex interactions within the zooplankton community and marine environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"285","pagesFromTo":"1-10","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12","677e69c6fdbe831a3837aa0a","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b48","mniswId":"5962","title":"Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science","issn":"0272-7714","eissn":"1096-0015","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f0a974e1-f795-4803-a548-95d5a6a9d439"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climatic changes","Eukrohnia hamata","Isfjorden","Parasagitta elegans","predation","zooplankton biomass"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060919447"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67f48a28ece39874c5e197d8","name":"Alexandra","lastName":"Loginova","uuid":"47F27E742ECB4E3B404D62CF656ACDDEBE0B734875D690CCC702A1553BFADFA2899DB26FE57E0867BCE617A1E37D35BF68818EBBF91607B23B51A74DC967C1C6","documentHash":"d0d88e31-6414-4129-b6cd-4e5b99d8f493"},{"objectId":"679a220bfdbe831aedcc6101","name":"Urban J.","lastName":"Wünsch","documentHash":"9b23f3bf-ed80-4a73-bdfb-209371ab5524"},{"objectId":"60c9e7109543c72336544556","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Cherkasheva","uuid":"3078FD42A4D92827A49657ED01B6723CCD7020DD5F0F33C277DC996C4B017F8793CAF08F5A515955C90B977091BD37824B880A8150FC856EA4C9A8BDB724E1FA","documentHash":"5d3cbb92-f601-44e7-b266-4c00e58167ea"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szymczycha","uuid":"F594DC6E0A245A248EACAF139383FF10C32DD82FE0DACFF05A102D4A7E645FB7586B6A7F34800C8363F445238D1E4A8D328549DE8D315F239B00D5F69B7F8C87","orcidId":"0000-0002-5815-215X","documentHash":"0a8a40d0-e3be-4cb4-9e67-7af031f250d1"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1d","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Winogradow","uuid":"D50057AD40012BE33D95DBDE17AFF8252F4D4C8BE533331AE47A267772A7AF1EA340927A58A08E00BF25C00BEE718EC87BAB202495DEBA6319C1787B88209CC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6214-9017","documentHash":"5ac9951c-6a34-42af-b699-05492c580241"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655f","name":"Monika","lastName":"Zabłocka","uuid":"58E70D68D4B9FE617EDFA003AA14C9D0A51015AC1DABC1CF4A226E6321ADA8A39282E694843E243857E0D6C8361BC3158D3964E2C2972AFBE2F582251BE479B0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1803-7042","documentHash":"fccb5939-114b-4195-8ef6-aeeaa2d9f5cc"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Kuliński","uuid":"A1362FEB3C94D210BA97D7C5FE392ED27FB4DD61D0B2476A4F5C18B20F589C7FA21F35A13EA5510511C60D24A7EAD1FC4FDC75E86C1645B920BA2AE06C994826","orcidId":"0000-0002-5403-6629","documentHash":"8009c04f-1ba9-4687-80f3-d96316801246"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a652f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":"8A7046FAD9A00FEE2DDD84DE5CD4F0E7AE988F4D51DC53595C979404E0C8BE0FEDC8318C2740E4B4A40005B431471819B1642B71328D0D50119C34AC42E18163","orcidId":"0000-0001-6016-0610","documentHash":"5a6f088c-195f-4994-90d2-e2f46893703d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679a220bfdbe831aedcc6100","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1433199","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1433199/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Qualitative variability of dissolved organic matter in the Baltic Sea sediments apparent from fluxes and optical properties","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The release of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from sediments serves as an\nimportant part of the carbon cycle.

DOM release from\nsediments displayed spatial variability, with diffusive DOC fluxes ranging from\n0.02 to 1.06 mmol m−2 d−1\n, and basin-averaged fluxes increased in the order\nGotland < Bornholm < Gdansk. DOM qualitative characteristics also varied\namong investigated basins. In the oxygen-limited study sites from the Gdansk\nBasin, we observed elevated abundances of low apparent molecular weight DOM\nfraction and proteinaceous-like fluorescent DOM, while in the Bornholm Basin,\npore water DOM was generally more humic-like and of higher apparent\nmolecular weight. Pore waters from the deepest study sites in the Gotland\nBasin were qualitatively very similar to those of the pore waters from the upper\nsediment layers (0–4 cm) from all other investigated sites, suggesting little\norganic matter reworking at depth at those stations.

Although the concentration of dust results from several complex transport processes, as well as chemical and microphysical transformations of aerosols, sources of emissions may have a significant impact on the local level of pollution. This pilot study aimed to use measurements of the concentrations of dust (with the specification of the PM10 and PM2.5 fractions) made over a heap/excavation and its surroundings using an airship equipped with equipment for testing the optical and microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosols, and a ground station located at the facility. On the basis of the measurements, the function of the source of emissions of dust was estimated. According to our study, the yearly emission of dust varies between 42,470 and 886,289 kg for PM10, and between 42,470 and 803,893 for PM2.5 (minimum and maximum values). A model of local air quality was also used, which allowed us to verify the parameterization of emissions of dust pollutants for the PM10 and PM2.5 fractions from heaps and excavations based on the modelling results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii

of microorganisms in the Baltic Sea: the power of novel methods in the identification of marine microbes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Until recently, the data on the diversity of the entire microbial community from the Baltic Sea were relatively rare and very scarce. However, modern molecular methods have provided new insights into this field with interesting results. They can be summarized as follows. (i) Although low salinity causes a reduction in the biodiversity of multicellular species relative to the populations of the North-East Atlantic, no such reduction occurs in bacterial diversity. (ii) Among cyanobacteria, the picocyanobacterial group dominates when considering gene abundance, while filamentous cyanobacteria dominate in means of biomass. (iii) The diversity of diatoms and dinoflagellates is significantly larger than described a few decades ago; however, molecular studies on these groups are still scarce. (iv) Knowledge gaps in other protistan communities are evident. (v) Salinity is the main limiting parameter of pelagic fungal community composition, while the benthic fungal diversity is shaped by water depth, salinity, and sediment C and N availability.

Głównym celem pracy było sprawdzenie wpływu stężeń Zn i Cu w środowisku wodnym na związane z dostosowaniem cechy historii życiowej kosmopolitycznego małżoraczka słodkowodnego Heterocypris incongruens. Łącznie przeprowadzono osiem subchronicznych eksperymentów laboratoryjnych w celu sprawdzenia skutków narażenia na dwa stężenia Cu (260 i 460 μg Cu L-1) i Zn (230 i 410 μg Zn L-1) w porównaniu z warunkami kontrolnymi, z udziałem partenogenetycznych samic pochodzących z populacji dzikiej oraz z komercyjnego testu toksyczności (Ostracodtoxkit f). Reakcja małżoraczków na ekspozycję na Zn i Cu różniła się znacznie. Wpływ Cu znacząco zmniejszył całkowity sukces lęgowy i dynamikę wylęgu jaj w stanie spoczynku, zwiększył śmiertelność młodych osobników i zmniejszył przeżywalność osobników dorosłych, radykalnie zmniejszając dostosowanie małżoraczków. Z drugiej strony, ekspozycja na cynk była mniej szkodliwa i nie wpływała na przeżycie osobników dorosłych ani na czas wyklucia się młodych z jaj przetrwalnych, ale wydłużyła czas składania jaj przy niższych stężeniach i stymulowała dynamikę i sukces wylęgu przy wyższych stężeniach. Wydaje się, że zwiększona bioakumulacja Zn w organizmie nie miała istotnego wpływu na dostosowanie badanych osobników. Co więcej, różne reakcje populacji laboratoryjnej i dzikiej w eksperymentach z Zn mogą sugerować genetyczną zmienność w zakresie tolerancji małżoraczków na metale. Dlatego też doświadczenia wykorzystujące laboratoryjną populację H. incongruens jako analogu dzikich małżoraczków należy interpretować z ostrożnością. Na podstawie przeprowadzonych eksperymentów wnioskujemy, że główną substancją toksyczną w naszym badaniu była Cu, podczas gdy Zn można uznać za mikroelement wspierający dostosowanie małżoraczków, chociaż wyższe poziomy Zn prawdopodobnie będą wywierać działanie toksyczne."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Zinc (Zn) and copper (Cu) are common contaminants of inland water bodies under severe anthropogenic pressure. The main aim of this study was to test the influence of environmental aqueous concentrations of Zn and Cu on the fitness-related life history traits of the cosmopolitan freshwater ostracod Heterocypris incongruens. Overall, eight subchronic laboratory experiments were conducted to test the effects of exposure to two Cu (260 and 460 µg Cu L−1) and Zn (230 and 410 µg Zn L−1) concentrations compared to the control conditions using asexual individuals originating from a wild population and from a commercial toxicity test (Ostracodtoxkit f). The response of ostracods to exposure to Zn and Cu differed considerably. The Cu treatments significantly reduced the total hatching success and hatching dynamics of resting eggs, increased the mortality of juveniles and reduced the survival of adults, dramatically decreasing the fitness of ostracods. On the other hand, the Zn treatments were less harmful and did not affect adult survival or the timing of juvenile hatching from subitaneous eggs but extended the timing of laying eggs at lower concentrations and stimulated hatching dynamics and success at higher concentrations. It seems that the increased Zn body burden did not strongly impact the fitness of the studied specimens. Moreover, the different responses of the laboratory and wild populations in the Zn experiments may suggest a genetic variation in the tolerance of ostracods to metals. Therefore, experiments involving laboratory H. incongruens as analogues of wild ostracods should be cautiously interpreted. We concluded that the major toxicant in our study was Cu, while Zn could be considered a micronutrient even supporting ostracod fitness, although its higher levels are likely to exert strong toxic effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bef","677d2ec4fdbe831a382df1a7","677d2ec4fdbe831a382df1a6","677d2ec4fdbe831a382df1a5","5e709249878c28a0473931d3","5e70949c878c28a0473c0615","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6544","5e70929e878c28a04739945b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"91","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"687-707","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bef","5e70949c878c28a0473c0615","5e709249878c28a0473931d3","677d2ec4fdbe831a382df1a5","677d2ec4fdbe831a382df1a6","677d2ec4fdbe831a382df1a7","5e70929e878c28a04739945b","5e709347878c28a0473a6544"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c115","mniswId":"6355","title":"European Zoological Journal","eissn":"2475-0263","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"ac27a0bd-0adf-45bf-84c4-e224e50a2640"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["żywotność jaj","ekspozycja wodna","metale ciężkie","biokoncentracja","Ostracodtoxkit f"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["eggs viability","bioconcentration","aqueous exposure","heavy metals","Ostracodtoxkit f"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060923379"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67f48a28ece39874c5e197d8","name":"Alexandra","lastName":"Loginova","uuid":"47F27E742ECB4E3B404D62CF656ACDDEBE0B734875D690CCC702A1553BFADFA2899DB26FE57E0867BCE617A1E37D35BF68818EBBF91607B23B51A74DC967C1C6","documentHash":"d0d88e31-6414-4129-b6cd-4e5b99d8f493"},{"objectId":"66794c0e409707627d68ef07","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Borzycka","documentHash":"2b777238-2d0d-47fa-8b74-ba6a3706659b"},{"objectId":"66794c0e409707627d68ef06","name":"Elena","lastName":"Terzić","documentHash":"ee2c65a4-5264-4d59-86b7-b65a6f7d9cce"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655f","name":"Monika","lastName":"Zabłocka","uuid":"58E70D68D4B9FE617EDFA003AA14C9D0A51015AC1DABC1CF4A226E6321ADA8A39282E694843E243857E0D6C8361BC3158D3964E2C2972AFBE2F582251BE479B0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1803-7042","documentHash":"fccb5939-114b-4195-8ef6-aeeaa2d9f5cc"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a652f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":"8A7046FAD9A00FEE2DDD84DE5CD4F0E7AE988F4D51DC53595C979404E0C8BE0FEDC8318C2740E4B4A40005B431471819B1642B71328D0D50119C34AC42E18163","orcidId":"0000-0001-6016-0610","documentHash":"5a6f088c-195f-4994-90d2-e2f46893703d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66794c0e409707627d68ef05","doi":"10.3389/fmars.2024.1379604","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1379604/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Estimation of net accumulation and removal of fluorescent dissolved organic matter in different Baltic Sea water masses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to detect non-conservative processes that affect the distribution of fluorescent dissolved organic matter (FDOM) in the Baltic Sea. An extensive data set comprised of 408 FDOM data, optical and physical profiles, and the development of a water masses balance model allowed us to ascertain the sources of mixing anomalies. These were seen as second-order deviations in the FDOM distribution as a function of salinity in three layers: surface water, Baltic Sea Winter Water, and deep water. The difference between modeled and measured FDOM values at three different excitation/emission wavelengths allowed to show the strength of non- conservative processes, such as photochemical and microbial decomposition (negative residual values) or extracellular release of dissolved organic matter from phytoplankton, heterotrophic uptake and release from anoxic sediments (positive residual values). Humic-like FDOM fractions displayed positive residuals in all seasons for intermediate and deep layers and negative residuals in surface waters. Largest accumulation rates of humic-like fractions were reached in the Gulf of Gdańsk during summer in intermediate and deep layers, while the greatest removal in surface waters was observed during spring in the Bornholm and Gotland Basins and during summer in the Gulf of Gdańsk, probably due to photodegradation. Positive residuals of the protein-like fraction were observed at the surface in summer and autumn in the Gulf of Gdańsk, probably linked to the abundance of phytoplankton and also due to the low molecular weight by-products of photodegradation of humic-like components. Spatial transects revealed an increase in humic-like residuals with depth and a strong correlation with apparent oxygen utilization, increasing with higher fluorescence and exhibiting an asymptotic trend. A relationship was found between the protein-like fractions and phytoplankton biomass proxies. A generalized concept for FDOM cycling in the Baltic Sea was proposed, highlighting photobleaching as the dominant non-linear process determining the efficiency of humic-like FDOM removal. The protein-like component was found to be more efficiently taken up by aerobic prokaryotes at the surface. Microbial utilization and reworking of organic matter, release from sediments, and a decade-long stagnation of bottom water masses, all contribute to the observed accumulation of FDOM in mesohaline deep waters below the permanent pycnocline in the Baltic Sea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a655f","5e709347878c28a0473a652f","67f48a28ece39874c5e197d8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1379604","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66794c0e409707627d68ef06","5e709347878c28a0473a655f","67f48a28ece39874c5e197d8","66794c0e409707627d68ef07","5e709347878c28a0473a652f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":"Frontiers in Marine Science","issn":"2296-7745","documentHash":"10c3cbd4-c3f9-49fd-a17d-31a35133724c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66389efb4097076e57a5ef9c","year":"2024","volume":"11","documentHash":"495f74cb-874c-429f-a6f6-dd45c3fddca6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chromophoric dissolved organic matter","fluorescence","absorption","Baltic Sea","conservative mixing model","apparent oxygen utilization","dissolved organic carbon"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060923540"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a3afdbe831a3837be90","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Dera","documentHash":"06b1d2c2-0156-4e79-b110-4b10a870f8b1"},{"objectId":"677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Pawlik","documentHash":"fd37081a-dfbc-41fd-be49-8d448f40b1d1"},{"objectId":"677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8e","name":"Roman","lastName":"Majchrowski","documentHash":"3757810b-c2d2-4c4b-ae30-698dafac18e1"},{"objectId":"677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Zapadka","documentHash":"33ab0441-3e64-4219-9e98-0594e3aa0ba9"},{"objectId":"677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Zdun","documentHash":"0ad1adf8-4966-4d27-8d99-f437279feef4"},{"objectId":"677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8a","name":"Damian","lastName":"Stoltmann","documentHash":"5232d8f9-5861-466a-8fcf-ed9e90ce7d8e"},{"objectId":"677e6a3afdbe831a3837be89","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Ficek","documentHash":"7a21e25a-a39b-463f-9187-4ca14e6870f8"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6551","name":"Mirosława","lastName":"Ostrowska","uuid":"B19F1ECC6A8EEFB8503A9CAD4E91373462DDFD51C249E1F6501AC58A1EB4494AC18857F1276DC1CEF4E64AE4891F5EDB1D03B25DB68486E43C9DCA373032A9F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3738-3565","documentHash":"1121a880-5b1c-473a-a260-47f4e34c317c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6545","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stoń-Egiert","uuid":"761936593A0A85A183D4328C890367B2F2F64EA207CBA8ABD568F50DE6BCEADC3C2ACFAC4786EF77370FE85E6437FA754AFFD2F08C89E1B051CDC877FA69B923","orcidId":"0000-0002-4274-8979","documentHash":"eef72685-4d70-4808-a6da-0ffdedc9843e"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d0a6","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"2C35C2CBF198DC76BB1801932933909E017C41418E7905AADACCD06DD69FCCD3AE30CDD0D53EA7CEBAE7DEF00CFF5ED796AB9EE6BC693A12417B4AE7E7A5537E","orcidId":"0000-0002-8317-6989","documentHash":"3fe18b0b-9a94-46eb-aa36-c10a459a0581"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-02-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"637224454097073559588a80","doi":"10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100715","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100715","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Ten years of remote sensing and analyses of the Baltic Sea primary production (2010-2019)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the work is to present the possibilities of using advanced systems combining data obtained by remote sensing methods with data from other sources and bio-optical models for tracking and analyzing long-term changes in marine ecosystems. For this purpose, the 2010–2019 primary production data set provided by the SatBałtyk System, a platform that monitors the Baltic Sea based on satellite data, was used. As a result, the paper provides a quantitative description of the variability of the organic matter primary production (PP) in the Baltic Sea. In the individual months, the mean daily PP for the entire Baltic Sea, ranges from ca. 5 mgC m-2day-1 in winter (December and January) to over 700 mgC m-2day-1 in July. The overall annual PP of this basin ranges from 37 to 45 *106 tC year-1, but it is clearly noticeable that the yearly distributions of PP vary significantly from year to year over the 2010–2019 period and different regions. On the basis of the presented results for selected regions, it can be also seen that the maximum values of PP characteristic for the Baltic Sea in the summer months in the Gdańsk Basin can be observed from June to July. However, in the Bornholm Basin and the East Gotland Basin, PP does not peak until July and occasionally in August. The obtained results indicate a slight increase in the productivity of the Baltic Sea (ca. 11%) over the 10 years’ period and it also varies regionally."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d0a6"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6551","5e709347878c28a0473a6545"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"1-19","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d0a6","5e709347878c28a0473a6551","677e6a3afdbe831a3837be89","677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8a","5e709347878c28a0473a6545","677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8c","677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8d","677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8e","677e6a3afdbe831a3837be8f","677e6a3afdbe831a3837be90"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e864","mniswId":"25912","title":"Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","eissn":"2352-9385","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"bd52c4fa-f783-4b73-b812-ff23e7aafbad"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["primary production","long-term changes","phytoplankton","remote-sensing","Baltic Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060930311"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a25fdbe831a3837bb50","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Korejwo","documentHash":"108a7819-0dd7-4a92-86cc-0e3bee76d239"},{"objectId":"5e7094ed878c28a0473c717f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Saniewski","uuid":"73D372462BCFCB5B5D0D49E2207DF9797C0B847808F117642642D43A49BB2C3C0E6EE4DDCC31778F9F88EF0249A6D812E7017ADAD91BE797603D5F9604825B98","orcidId":"0000-0002-2347-1660","documentHash":"974674eb-b8f5-42d1-ba40-6460bd4b3fef"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b631b","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Saniewska","uuid":"805F98BBA6C969731C605A6D79A564212E88A30BBB179280A169B1828E6E9DC86F4B04A6E5859ABDC7909BB22989827A9708F6B005D1E628FD800B176590B7C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0630-9602","documentHash":"1b45d458-5847-4e40-8dce-e31d0c3e2d7c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a653d","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Bełdowski","uuid":"6324C413899A7D55052C03674F85929919743CC2BC68B3E5B4AAA45F79E47792E7A3EC3C7CC1F75C0C115EC7B074EE3974D7F11A989D51502B88F15260A2C634","orcidId":"0000-0002-2891-1901","documentHash":"2d9f6169-3657-4886-b7c4-74b2ba5045de"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"632955c6409707398ef023f1","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114115","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Mercury concentration and speciation in benthic organisms from Isfjorden, Svalbard","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Polar regions are an important part of the global mercury cycle and interesting study sites due to different\r\npossible mercury sources.

Mesozooplankton materials were collected using WP-2 net in the top 300 m layer, from 32 stations located along the profile designated from the southern coast of Africa towards the Antarctic. Twenty-one species of ostracods were recorded. Ostracoda species diversity generally decreased with increasing latitude. Their total abundance showed a parabolic pattern of distribution, with lower numbers at the edges of the transect and higher numbers in the middle. We identified three distinctive areas occupied by different assemblages of Ostracoda. The first area, the Benguela Current (BENG), was inhabited mainly by subtropical ostracods. The second area - Southern Subtropical Convergence, Subantarctic Front, Subantarctic Zone and Polar Front (SSTC, SAF, SANT and PF) - was characterized by the presence of a mixture of subtropical, subantarctic, and Antarctic species. The third area, the Antarctic Zone (ANTA), was inhabited mostly by subantarctic and Antarctic ostracods. Moreover, we confirmed that the SSTC was an almost impassable hydrographical barrier for subtropical-tropical Ostracoda species. This study demonstrated the distribution of some species extending further north (e.g., Metaconchoecia australis) than previously recorded. Morphometric analysis of the most common ostracod species, Discoconchoecia elegans, showed an increasing trend in its mean individual size from the BENG zone to the ANTA zone."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a04739375d"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"187","pagesFromTo":"1-11","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739375d","677e6a35fdbe831a3837bdd3","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a59","mniswId":"12601","title":"Journal of Sea Research","issn":"1385-1101","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"25cf4335-0728-4af4-9933-45092abe089e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climate changes","biogeography","Atlantic Ocean","taxa/abundance composition","planktonic ostracods","size ranges"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060930611"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca54a94097077ac1cfc6cd","name":"Shahabaldin","lastName":"Rezania","documentHash":"083267aa-7c50-497b-8fce-eb602bddb5b2"},{"objectId":"64ca54a94097077ac1cfc6cc","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Mohsin","documentHash":"c96ab70c-e689-442a-835d-dd949f01eb7b"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac39f","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Matej-Łukowicz","uuid":"B79F06C551D43C21F7691D57465FFC41F229E75F68FF5798123AC19867D5015ACB3816031BE56DBB274588EFE7004692C911B7783216FEFA76E868CA7FBB0C5E","orcidId":"0000-0003-2797-2996","documentHash":"2df90728-632d-42cd-b94a-98d2f51949b9"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac37e","name":"Nicole","lastName":"Nawrot","uuid":"A2B34291E07547D87140516FF2750AFBD7B6F960CB54A9BDA82B3EBF2D630F71E95C79D1B5BA774A792C1622BFBF887DA090BE1945F106A31556843F41FF1B75","orcidId":"0000-0001-5737-5143","documentHash":"43f4026c-f7d9-4c2e-8b0e-03260fbce3b9"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b20","name":"Ksenia","lastName":"Pazdro","uuid":"6538DFA042434F944EC3F934E8085434F2F9A5F7DA28C2F322EFC9FCA07523B4807443385DC8947D7F1AC9EA4A37393C4041BA2DDE8C79642BF66690FA9FB669","orcidId":"0000-0003-0283-1468","documentHash":"870f628d-167d-4246-99f6-00e6c1024232"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739945b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pouch","uuid":"9D8E0E331A2E1554B9833195757F665FCB9551025B4D9DC772A41CA36D50F685CDA5AAF4F26E7415651E9F3B10B980DD557F43CBF11D50F88AE0078596519343","orcidId":"0000-0002-2898-8896","documentHash":"4ebf3f5f-2242-46bc-b69c-77d5b603ac61"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047393066","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wojciechowska","uuid":"9398013E30DC1D2B6D5A4A031BBF786FF9C0F77F755D70FA033988056259151526D3407F3E840437724DFB759F36D5CE9F319541C9ADCF7DE8B0C0FEE61AB061","orcidId":"0000-0002-9164-528X","documentHash":"07599496-fd9a-475e-8053-cdc08e6204ee"}],"objectId":"6377594840970701fd3d5f1c","doi":"10.1007/s11356-022-24168-1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A multi‑criteria approach to investigate spatial distribution,sources, and the potential toxicological effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediments of urban retention tanks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bottom sediments deposited in retention tanks (RTs) located on two urban streams (Oliwski and Strzyza) in the central part of Gdansk (Poland) were analysed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons’ (PAHs) content. PAHs were extracted from samples with methylene chloride, then the extracts were subjected to clean-up applying the solid phase extraction (SPE) method. Quantitative and qualitative determination of 16 PAHs was performed with the use of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry technique. A multi-dimensional approach was applied to analyse PAHs’ spatial distribution, source, and contamination status. Potential sources of PAHs were verified using isomer ratios supported by a statistical approach. The Σ16PAHs (in mg/kg d.w.) ranged from 1.95 ± 0.64 to 20.4 ± 6.8 for RTs located on the Oliwski Stream and from 0.50 ± 0.17 to 8.6 ± 2.9 for RTs located on the Strzyza Stream. PAHs detected in bottom sediments were mainly composed of 4- and 5-ring compounds. PAH isomer ratios such as Phen/Anth, Flth/Pyr, B(a)A/B(a)A + Chry, Inpy/Inpy + B(ghi)P, Flth/Flth + Pyr, Anth/Anth + Phen, and Flth/Flth + Pyr suggested delivery pathways for biomass, coal, and petroleum combustion. Petrogenic PAHs related to fuel leaks from cars were not detected. Statistical analyses confirmed traffic and heating system sources, while factor analysis (FA) pointed out the abrasion of wasting parts of vehicles. Based on threshold levels presented in sediment quality guidelines (SQGs), in most cases, PAHs were at low levels with occasional negative biological effects on organisms. Only sediments deposited in two RTs located on the Oliwski Stream presented harmful features for sediment-dwelling organisms. The risk assessment performed accordingly to the Σ16PAHs presented a moderate and high risk for biota. This study not only reflects the direct threat related to PAH content in bottom sediments, but also highlights the overall pollution of an area, considered to be a recreational part of the city (Oliwski Stream catchment). The findings of this study highlight the need to launch preventative methods to protect the area against pollution from heating system emission and traffic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b20","5e70929e878c28a04739945b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac39f","5e709248878c28a047393066","5e709389878c28a0473ac37e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"27895 - 27911","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b20","5e709389878c28a0473ac37e","5e70929e878c28a04739945b","5e709389878c28a0473ac39f","64ca54a94097077ac1cfc6cc","64ca54a94097077ac1cfc6cd","5e709248878c28a047393066"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research","issn":"0944-1344","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"80fb5f49-d17d-4c94-ae09-f813bb7059c2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION","POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS","RETENTION TANKS","SEDIMENTS","URBAN CATCHMENT"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060930670"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a41fdbe831a3837bf5a","name":"Najorka","lastName":"Jens","documentHash":"55911b51-4125-4b4e-915a-64854e4910d9"},{"objectId":"677e6a41fdbe831a3837bf59","name":"Emma","lastName":"Humphreys-Williams","documentHash":"52e1fb83-73b4-48d7-8625-7b0a80f47e3c"},{"objectId":"677e6a41fdbe831a3837bf58","name":"Stanislav","lastName":"Strekopytov","documentHash":"97e08456-9864-4ec3-be41-f30edf37c390"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc624","name":"Anna","lastName":"Piwoni-Piórewicz","uuid":"71036F512EC2C4002AC3AFDA79ADFF76F8780B3074DA7D8661A60E6881A5386C256AA0C9C134C0BBFC6462D863EDF20FE31C37739C14579054F5CFF7F6246D61","orcidId":"0000-0003-2131-161X","documentHash":"ba984255-53e5-4f5a-addb-75b20c0cd131"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szymczycha","uuid":"F594DC6E0A245A248EACAF139383FF10C32DD82FE0DACFF05A102D4A7E645FB7586B6A7F34800C8363F445238D1E4A8D328549DE8D315F239B00D5F69B7F8C87","orcidId":"0000-0002-5815-215X","documentHash":"0a8a40d0-e3be-4cb4-9e67-7af031f250d1"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"objectId":"63bd62e44097073596a27a32","doi":"10.1111/gbi.12496","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Polymorphism of CaCO3 and the variability of elemental composition of the calcareous skeletons secreted by invertebrates along the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biomineralization is of great importance in ecosystem functioning and for the use of carbonate skeleton as environmental proxies. Skeletal formation is controlled to different degrees by environmental parameters and biological mechanisms. While salinity is one of the most important factors affecting ecological processes and ocean physiochemistry, the goal of this investigation was to identify how salinity influences the mineral type and the concentrations of chemical elements in the whole skeleton of invertebrates from the Baltic Sea. In this model system, the surface salinity decreases from marine values (27.2) to almost fresh water (6.1). The selected organ-isms, mussels (Mytilus spp.), bryozoans (Einhornia crustulenta, Cribrilina cryptooecium, Cryptosula  pallasiana, Electra  pilosa, Escharella  immersa), barnacles (Amphibalanus  improvisus, Semibalanus balanoides), and polychaetes (Spirorbis tridentatus), precipitated skeleton composed of calcite and aragonite, most likely as a result of various interacting environmental and biological factors. The concentrations of all elements in bulk skeleton were highly variable between species from the same location, underlining the role of the biological mechanisms in skeletal formation. The concentration of Ca, Mg, Sr, and Na increased in the bulk skeleton of stenohaline organisms with increasing salinity, while in the bulk skeleton of euryhaline species, only the concentration of Na increased with increasing salinity. The concentrations of Mn, Ba, Cu, Pb, Y, V, Cd, and U in the skeleton of euryhaline species generally decreased at higher salinities, most likely reflecting the lower bioavailability of elements at higher salinity. However, the concentrations of elements in the skeleton of stenohaline organisms were highly variable with no clear salinity impact. This study suggests that, although the composition of skeleton of calcifying organisms along the salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea is to a large extent affected by biological mechanisms, it also reflects the responses to environmental conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc624"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"575-596","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709469878c28a0473bc624","677e6a41fdbe831a3837bf58","677e6a41fdbe831a3837bf59","677e6a41fdbe831a3837bf5a","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","5e709347878c28a0473a6522"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477de6","mniswId":"7057","title":"Geobiology","issn":"1472-4677","eissn":"1472-4669","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0667c1a8-7215-4e74-aba8-5b0c266967b6"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["benthic invertebrates","calcium carbonate","elemental signatures","ICP-MS","salinity","trace elements","XRD-PSD"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060930699"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8fafdbe831a38c33062","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Block-Łaszewska","documentHash":"d21d8b1e-430e-456c-993c-608336a50fd8"},{"objectId":"6777d8fafdbe831a38c33061","name":"D.","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"e7955d2b-571e-40e3-b81b-eaf68155b840"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7a67","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Olszewski","uuid":"7695D0816BE4D351A820A5407063D2BD84CC888FAA7AA933566C1EE174CC3A6222D350EF6F5A97770CF3D9449A5899C60246805F7995F5082FB6A07B8051DFED","orcidId":"0000-0002-3816-3572","documentHash":"11e24df6-62ef-4a2d-96a9-69a129e99bc5"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b6704","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Moniakowska","uuid":"EFD7DC98D4F30C373507F6EF2B64309FFB46D583E0CE6B5165B5CC7E42E2E5BE8D4BDC026D8DF8E7795602BD78EF5ED596E5AF8CD5C4A491F4915127DC5486A5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3346-7283","documentHash":"1a3b438e-9808-4765-a9f6-8f393c54a38c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6544","name":"Agata","lastName":"Zaborska","uuid":"FE40EF42F9E848E1D09D278DBA4FECC8CD79F3BC581694CBDEC7B3EE47F2AC0C2688E35AC59379BC3BC9C53F432C7CF089A8C0E8D1D11ACB2050D908A2E6CF9E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1432-7421","documentHash":"f9a20830-9869-4364-97d8-deb620a80580"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739320b","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Strumińska-Parulska","uuid":"18582184A7A278191B136E32EF58032B118A0B14CD3A84637338E57C2BF576E650B14392F038D58EA78C7DA14DA279A9CD380E7AD4D5F2B5128FF449B83A323E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7900-6517","documentHash":"349a0389-bb07-489c-98e8-6d0c9f0eb256"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6347d81b409707209e51bea2","doi":"10.1016/j.jfca.2022.104862","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Radioactive isotopes 40K, 137Cs, 226Ra, 228Ra, 234Th in algae supplements - potential radiotoxicity of aquatic superfoods","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Many food products are recommended to give health benefits.

The study presents radioactive 40K, 137Cs, 226Ra, 228Ra, and 234Th in algae supplements available worldwide for human consumption. Samples have been quantified by gamma-ray spectrometry and the activity concentrations (Bq/kg dw) ranged 0.23–0.65 (137Cs) followed by 1.76–10.7 (226Ra), 0.20–12.7 (228Ra), 11.6–24.2 (234Th), and 20.1–400 (40K). Also, the effective radiation doses from 40K, 137Cs, 226Ra, 228Ra, and 234Th decay ingested with analyzed algae supplements have been estimated. The highest annual effective dose reaching 15.1 µSv/year has been assessed for naturally occurring 226Ra in Chlorella vulgaris from Japan.

Based on the study, the activity concentrations of radionuclides seem to be low, the naturally occurring radionuclides would give the highest effective doses, and the investigated algae supplements could be considered safe food."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7a67","5e70924b878c28a04739320b","6777d8fafdbe831a38c33062","5e70941c878c28a0473b6704"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6544"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"114","pagesFromTo":"1-5","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70941c878c28a0473b6704","5e70942d878c28a0473b7a67","5e70924b878c28a04739320b","6777d8fafdbe831a38c33061","6777d8fafdbe831a38c33062","5e709347878c28a0473a6544"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454786ef","mniswId":"11138","title":"Journal of Food Composition and Analysis","issn":"0889-1575","eissn":"1096-0481","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3d49d51e-fc0b-4722-9787-f563fc722203"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["radiotoxicity","radioactive contamination","diet supplement","superfood","effective radiation dose","food analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060930863"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69aafdbe831a3837a64b","name":"Józef M.","lastName":"Pacyna","documentHash":"3e8fb930-3139-4583-af5a-6f143c7341fc"},{"objectId":"677e69aafdbe831a3837a64a","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Duzinkiewicz","documentHash":"885b7bd0-a40d-40c7-801d-1f8ea31617e7"},{"objectId":"677e69aafdbe831a3837a649","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Kalisińska","documentHash":"9e2b5808-a060-4f3d-98fb-c6a28085580e"},{"objectId":"61a83db87523402fabe26d33","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jędruch","uuid":"47E8A53FA888557E38D24349865DB78266E096B906D832F18A31D0956EF5AB2DEFC230E5F038A2E9DF684775A07820AC0E9E2E415363DAEE2DC390F1E0C189A0","documentHash":"76d3dc46-c415-45d5-8ca7-ead44b4bbabf"},{"objectId":"5ffebf55085dcb0e357dcd46","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Grajewska","uuid":"FFD2AA404E481C026DD295725342EC6D095B4B25628FEAC7631100DBD0F754106A96DAC73E14A087D12C819EF8548BD56F16082E6B263C0777A4CF329EE124C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4517-4584","documentHash":"0c1cc8a5-9ec2-4854-b025-3d22ce3a9cfc"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b631b","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Saniewska","uuid":"805F98BBA6C969731C605A6D79A564212E88A30BBB179280A169B1828E6E9DC86F4B04A6E5859ABDC7909BB22989827A9708F6B005D1E628FD800B176590B7C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0630-9602","documentHash":"1b45d458-5847-4e40-8dce-e31d0c3e2d7c"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c40","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bełdowska","uuid":"A48A6F773BFCA51AAD00108933899A8CFB97306BA86E77BD6E1C2C3F173916EEFDD6A8FF0C1B6F2D169D5F34208E9524FF62E120B68B09F8575EE3C707A1EBBC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3585-9283","documentHash":"38090cfb-a306-49ce-a82e-524d28ca1caf"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393845","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Meissner","uuid":"B216FC1695AF75B8F6A762180599E05E2A9FFA3A6437FB172A210382791D79AF0FA2F52AD25BB0D10382FB9882AFECF563C5795B1729B014693966A594EAEDD5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5995-9185","documentHash":"e33e5ec7-21ff-4a0a-b754-2f00dbacce8f"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393761","name":"Lucyna","lastName":"Falkowska","uuid":"23E2365573327B96962FD5AF179A685EC6BB6A8126CC1C7A1DB563F4F228C8649B7ACFD55DC44ED1EA9F78D56C718AB75840C77459A3CE151FA5691BF95EA408","documentHash":"e6551a60-2cb0-4550-a21d-cc6ca8fb58da"}],"objectId":"63bbb1254097075486171f5e","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114426","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2022.114426","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Mercury in the Polish part of the Baltic Sea: a response to decreased atmospheric deposition and changing environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Our review of the literature showed that since the beginning of the socio-economic transformation in Poland in the 1990s, the downward trend in Hg emissions and its deposition in the southern Baltic Sea was followed by a simultaneous decrease in Hg levels in water and marine plants and animals. Hg concentrations in the biota lowered to values that pose no or low risk to wildlife and seafood consumers. However, in the first decade of the current century, a divergence between these two trends became apparent and Hg concentrations in fish, herring and cod, began to rise. Therefore, increasing emission-independent anthropogenic pressures, which affect Hg uptake and trophodynamics, remobilization of land-based and marine legacy Hg deposits, as well as the structure of the food web, can undermine the chances of reducing both the Hg pool in the marine environment and human Hg exposure from fish."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393845","5e709262878c28a047394c40","5e70924f878c28a047393761","5e709419878c28a0473b631b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffebf55085dcb0e357dcd46"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a83db87523402fabe26d33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"186","pagesFromTo":"1-15","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393761","5e709419878c28a0473b631b","5e709262878c28a047394c40","5e70924f878c28a047393845","61a83db87523402fabe26d33","5ffebf55085dcb0e357dcd46","677e69aafdbe831a3837a649","677e69aafdbe831a3837a64a","677e69aafdbe831a3837a64b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d73","mniswId":"13923","title":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","issn":"0025-326X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4da78be2-a8fc-4c7c-8770-04b5572174f2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Baltic Sea","climate change","Hg","Minamata convention","risk assessment","temporal trends"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060953114"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a52fdbe831a3837c1d1","name":"Sanna","lastName":"Majaneva","documentHash":"1fd9c5cc-9584-433b-bbe2-9ea4c22b8438"},{"objectId":"677e6a52fdbe831a3837c1d0","name":"Jørgen","lastName":"Berge","documentHash":"f1c1be83-8e1e-476b-b6a6-34a910e837a8"},{"objectId":"677e6a52fdbe831a3837c1cf","name":"Finlo","lastName":"Cottier","documentHash":"c269ec22-a207-489a-b13a-7e5858126ed7"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12","name":"Agata","lastName":"Weydmann-Zwolicka","uuid":"E747C54DA07EC87566C7647C93E9394FFE36F52FF38300571775F980435A21EBA3D37453332B96F03BF05873FAB19CBA6BB7DCF8E7F7052F85D4F5FB0913738D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6655-6613","documentHash":"52375207-91d1-4baa-ba12-4f428e1780b5"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931cc","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Zwolicki","uuid":"AFBDD8B612F49392F82B4F0A1DDF70BBFB2727FAA7B1AAF80AA0816917925A136A89294B09332BE3E265D2FD782A34C05B38592AD06DDA02EEB0EA6866FE9994","orcidId":"0000-0003-2710-681X","documentHash":"777b13b2-b86c-4884-8525-aaafef429f9c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6572e2414097074b3777f002","doi":"10.1002/ece3.9569","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Environmental niche overlap in sibling planktonic species Calanus finmarchicus and C. glacialis in Arctic fjords","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Knowledge of environmental preferences of the key planktonic species, such as Calanus copepods in the Arctic, is crucial to understand ecosystem function and its future under climate change. Here, we assessed the environmental conditions influencing the development stages of Atlantic Calanus finmarchicus and Arctic Calanus glacialis, and we quantified the extent to which their niches overlap by incorporating multiple environmental data. We based our analysis on a 3-year seasonal collection of zooplankton by sediment traps, located on moorings in two contrasting Svalbard fjords: the Arctic Rijpfjorden and the Atlantic-influenced Kongsfjorden. Despite large differences in water temperature between the fjords, local realized ecological niches of the sibling Calanus species overlapped almost perfectly. The exception was the earliest copepodites of C. glacialis in Rijpfjorden, which probably utilized the local ice algal bloom in spring. However, during periods with no sea ice, like in Kongsfjorden, the siblings of both Calanus species showed high synchronization in the population structure. Interestingly, differences in temperature preferences of C. finmarchicus and C. glacialis were much higher between the studied fjords than between the species. Our analysis confirmed the high plasticity of Calanus copepods and their abilities to adapt to highly variable environmental settings, not only on an interannual basis but also in a climate warming context, indicating some resilience in the Calanus community."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet

measurements in water vapor, precipitation, and seawater during EUREC4A","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In early 2020, an international team set out to investigate trade-wind cumulus clouds and their coupling to the large-scale circulation through the field campaign EUREC4A: ElUcidating the RolE of Clouds-Circulation Coupling in ClimAte. Focused on the western tropical Atlantic near Barbados, EUREC4A deployed a number of innovative observational strategies, including a large network of water isotopic measurements collectively known as EUREC4A-iso, to study the tropical shallow convective environment. The goal of the isotopic measurements was to elucidate processes that regulate the hydroclimate state – for example, by identifying moisture sources, quantifying mixing between atmospheric layers, characterizing the microphysics that influence the formation and persistence of clouds and precipitation, and providing an extra constraint in the evaluation of numerical simulations. During the field experiment, researchers deployed seven water vapor isotopic analyzers on two aircraft, on three ships, and at the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO). Precipitation was collected for isotopic analysis at the BCO and from aboard four ships. In addition, three ships collected seawater for isotopic analysis. All told, the in situ data span the period 5 January–22 February 2020 and cover the approximate area 6 to 16∘ N and 50 to 60∘ W, with water vapor isotope ratios measured from a few meters above sea level to the mid-free troposphere and seawater samples spanning the ocean surface to several kilometers depth.\n\nThis paper describes the full EUREC4A isotopic in situ data collection – providing extensive information about sampling strategies and data uncertainties – and also guides readers to complementary remotely sensed water vapor isotope ratios. All field data have been made publicly available even if they are affected by known biases, as is the case for high-altitude aircraft measurements, one of the two BCO ground-based water vapor time series, and select rain and seawater samples from the ships. Publication of these data reflects a desire to promote dialogue around improving water isotope measurement strategies for the future. The remaining, high-quality data create unprecedented opportunities to close water isotopic budgets and evaluate water fluxes and their influence on cloudiness in the trade-wind environment. The full list of dataset DOIs and notes on data quality flags are provided in Table 3 of Sect. 5 (“Data availability”)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

species, C. glacialis and C. finmarchicus, due to different life strategies and environmental preferences act as an ecological indicators of Arctic Atlantification. Their high lipid content makes them important food source for higher trophic levels of Arctic ecosystems including the most abundant Northern Hemisphere's seabird, the little auk (Alle alle). Recent studies indicate a critical need for the use of molecular methods to reliably identify these two sympatric Calanus species. We performed genetic and morphology-based identification of 2600 Calanus individuals collected in little auks foraging grounds and diet in summer seasons 2019–2021 in regions of Svalbard with varying levels of Atlantification. Genetic identification proved that 40% of Calanus individuals were wrongly classified as C. finmarchicus according to morphology-based identification in both types of samples. The diet of little auks consisted almost entirely of C. glacialis even in more Atlantified regions. Due to the substantial bias in morphology-based identification, we expect that the scale of the northern expansion of boreal C. finmarchicus may have been largely overestimated and that higher costs for birds exposed to Atlantification could be mostly driven by a decrease in the size of C. glacialis rather than by shift from C. glacialis to C. finmarchicus."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a0473931c9","5e709249878c28a0473931a1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","5e70929c878c28a04739908e","5e709469878c28a0473bc64c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-14","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709249878c28a0473931c9","5e709249878c28a0473931a1","5e70929c878c28a04739908e","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","677d2f99fdbe831a382e0af6","677d2f99fdbe831a382e0af7","677d2f99fdbe831a382e0af8","677d2f99fdbe831a382e0af9","677d2f99fdbe831a382e0afa","5e709469878c28a0473bc64c","677d2f99fdbe831a382e0afc","677d2f99fdbe831a382e0afd","677d2f99fdbe831a382e0afe","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060956430"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69cefdbe831a3837ab85","name":"Michał","lastName":"Węgrzyn","documentHash":"e1c5dd01-27b4-43a3-80dc-4d7991d7b9ee"},{"objectId":"677e69cefdbe831a3837ab84","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Wietrzyk-Pełka","documentHash":"961c98d7-857e-454f-a49b-95ed8cfa30ac"},{"objectId":"5e7094ed878c28a0473c717f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Saniewski","uuid":"73D372462BCFCB5B5D0D49E2207DF9797C0B847808F117642642D43A49BB2C3C0E6EE4DDCC31778F9F88EF0249A6D812E7017ADAD91BE797603D5F9604825B98","orcidId":"0000-0002-2347-1660","documentHash":"974674eb-b8f5-42d1-ba40-6460bd4b3fef"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b631b","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Saniewska","uuid":"805F98BBA6C969731C605A6D79A564212E88A30BBB179280A169B1828E6E9DC86F4B04A6E5859ABDC7909BB22989827A9708F6B005D1E628FD800B176590B7C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0630-9602","documentHash":"1b45d458-5847-4e40-8dce-e31d0c3e2d7c"},{"objectId":"5e709339878c28a0473a531a","name":"Tamara","lastName":"Zalewska","uuid":"17316AA6C4A83E2B6CEF6B4D542508D42A2101D5A3FED318454BE40C3D09F7054740AB55BCCF46F435DE92CB9A31124875B42F098D789521D51F1749774B2A3E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1030-8258","documentHash":"5d3cb296-9b03-47bc-b940-e73cb629aa48"}],"objectId":"63fcb4b94097074e59ffa290","doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138218","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Distribution of 90Sr and 137Cs in biotic and abiotic elements of the coastal zone of the King George Island (South Shetland Archipelago, Antarctic Peninsula)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For many years Antarctic ecosystems have been considered pristine, however recent studies, including our results, contradict this assumption.

The mean activity of 137Cs measured in lichens, bryophytes, vascular plants, green algae, soil, and guano was, respectively: 3.72 Bq kg−1dw, 3.70 Bq kg−1dw, 2.62 Bq kg−1dw, 2.26 Bq kg−1dw, 4.07 Bq kg−1dw and 2.08 Bq kg−1dw. For 90Sr mean activity in lichens, bryophytes, vascular plants, green algae, and soil was, respectively: 1.99 Bq kg−1dw, 3.05 Bq kg−1dw, 2.42 Bq kg−1dw, 1.08 Bq kg−1dw, and 6.43 Bq kg−1dw. Increased activities of 90Sr and 137Cs were observed in species collected in the area influenced by glacier melt and penguin guano."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709419878c28a0473b631b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709339878c28a0473a531a","5e7094ed878c28a0473c717f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"322","pagesFromTo":"1-12","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709419878c28a0473b631b","5e7094ed878c28a0473c717f","677e69cefdbe831a3837ab84","677e69cefdbe831a3837ab85","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","5e709339878c28a0473a531a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f8","mniswId":"3525","title":"Chemosphere","issn":"0045-6535","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"58ab338e-e160-4952-ac84-e8a482aef1f5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antarctic","cryptogamic species","radioactive pollution","vegetation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060956544"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69aefdbe831a3837a6f6","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Paturej","documentHash":"c8ce966a-9723-4dd8-89b3-a4ca453e5dd1"},{"objectId":"677e69aefdbe831a3837a6f3","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Wawrzynek-Borejko","documentHash":"68465ddd-4f75-4033-882a-cfd49b53495e"},{"objectId":"61a83db87523402fabe26d33","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jędruch","uuid":"47E8A53FA888557E38D24349865DB78266E096B906D832F18A31D0956EF5AB2DEFC230E5F038A2E9DF684775A07820AC0E9E2E415363DAEE2DC390F1E0C189A0","documentHash":"76d3dc46-c415-45d5-8ca7-ead44b4bbabf"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a653d","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Bełdowski","uuid":"6324C413899A7D55052C03674F85929919743CC2BC68B3E5B4AAA45F79E47792E7A3EC3C7CC1F75C0C115EC7B074EE3974D7F11A989D51502B88F15260A2C634","orcidId":"0000-0002-2891-1901","documentHash":"2d9f6169-3657-4886-b7c4-74b2ba5045de"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993cc","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Korejwo","uuid":"A25E2DBBB467C298E30EE786935C31F06CC3B6BA30E2FA4472729EAEE42481D7A96A94FB35EBDF38450B418765EA3D70589B7AE04E16D027592ACE255AF13BEB","documentHash":"e9198a55-4580-4278-8c99-327f1cc7e9f3"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c40","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bełdowska","uuid":"A48A6F773BFCA51AAD00108933899A8CFB97306BA86E77BD6E1C2C3F173916EEFDD6A8FF0C1B6F2D169D5F34208E9524FF62E120B68B09F8575EE3C707A1EBBC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3585-9283","documentHash":"38090cfb-a306-49ce-a82e-524d28ca1caf"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393770","name":"Anna","lastName":"Panasiuk","uuid":"0E6F266C522B3052D48DF74C8C5625DE5746B683DDE5D88105719D4BF8DBDA683CD5603833AD95C8C3380B1CD92A372AE7EA86EF4E2873AD241C2F16ADFE326D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1008-2922","documentHash":"70f7a40a-fbfe-41f4-9221-2276970f92d2"}],"objectId":"6582d14240970751d8f18d31","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167239","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Mercury concentrations in Antarctic zooplankton with a focus on the krill species, Euphausia superba","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Antarctic is the most isolated region in the world; nevertheless, it has not avoided the negative impact of human activity, including the inflow of toxic mercury (Hg). Hg deposited in the Antarctic marine environment can be bioavailable and accumulate in the food web, reaching elevated concentrations in high-trophic-level biota, especially if methylated. Zooplankton, together with phytoplankton, are critical for the transport of pollutants, including Hg to higher trophic levels. For the Southern Ocean ecosystem, one of the key zooplankton components is the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, the smaller euphausiid Thysanoessa macrura, and the amphipod Themisto gaudichaudii – a crucial food source for most predatory fish, birds, and mammals. The main goal of this study was to determine the Hg burden, as well as the distribution of different Hg forms, in these dominant Antarctic planktonic crustaceans. The results showed that the highest concentrations of Hg were found in T. gaudichaudii, a typically predatory taxon. Most of the Hg in the tested crustaceans was labile and potentially bioavailable for planktivorous organisms, with the most dangerous methylmercury (MeHg) accounting for an average of 16 % of the total mercury. Elevated Hg concentrations were observed close to the land, which is influenced by the proximity to penguin and pinniped colonies. In areas near the shore, volcanic activity might be a possible cause of the increase in mercury sulfide (HgS) content. The total Hg concentration increased with the trophic position and ontogenetic stage of predation, specific to adult organisms. In contrast, the proportion of MeHg decreased with age, indicating more efficient demethylation or elimination. The Hg magnification kinetics in the study area were relatively high, which may be related to climate-change induced alterations of the Antarctic ecosystem: additional food sources and reshaped trophic structure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709262878c28a047394c40","677e69aefdbe831a3837a6f6","5e70924f878c28a047393770","677e69aefdbe831a3837a6f3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a0473993cc","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","61a83db87523402fabe26d33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"905","pagesFromTo":"1-16","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393770","5e709262878c28a047394c40","5e70929e878c28a0473993cc","677e69aefdbe831a3837a6f3","61a83db87523402fabe26d33","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","677e69aefdbe831a3837a6f6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hg","mercury fractions","methylmercury","Western Antarctic Peninsula","pelagic food chain","euphausiids"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060956562"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6937fdbe831a383796dd","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Cichecka","documentHash":"28fe8daa-19c9-444f-ade4-7d7da51f58fa"},{"objectId":"5e7094ed878c28a0473c717f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Saniewski","uuid":"73D372462BCFCB5B5D0D49E2207DF9797C0B847808F117642642D43A49BB2C3C0E6EE4DDCC31778F9F88EF0249A6D812E7017ADAD91BE797603D5F9604825B98","orcidId":"0000-0002-2347-1660","documentHash":"974674eb-b8f5-42d1-ba40-6460bd4b3fef"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b631b","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Saniewska","uuid":"805F98BBA6C969731C605A6D79A564212E88A30BBB179280A169B1828E6E9DC86F4B04A6E5859ABDC7909BB22989827A9708F6B005D1E628FD800B176590B7C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0630-9602","documentHash":"1b45d458-5847-4e40-8dce-e31d0c3e2d7c"}],"objectId":"65376298409707399ee1d5ad","doi":"10.1016/j.catena.2023.107592","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2023.107592","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Sources and pathways of mercury in soils from Antarctic periglacial areas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Antarctic plays a critical role in global mercury cycling as both a sink of Hg and, in response to rapid global warming, an emerging source of Hg through its release from thawing permafrost and recessing glaciers. At the present time, Antarctica and surrounding areas have little mercury contamination in comparison to other regions of the world. Understanding the sources and transformations of Hg in the Antarctic will be particularly important in predicting the role of a changing environment in the mercury cycle as emissions and global climate change. Study samples were collected at 12 stations, categorized into three groups based on the human or animal presence and flora. Sampling took place in December 2018 and January 2019, and soil and parent rock samples were collected and analyzed for total mercury concentration and its fractions using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Bedrock samples collected on the coast of Admiralty Bay were found to have low organic matter content, while soil samples from the west shore of the bay had a high variability of organic matter content, ranging from 3 % to 41 %. The concentration of total mercury in bedrock ranged from 2.1 ng/g to 15.0 ng/g, and in soil samples, the total mercury concentration ranged from 4.7 ng/g to 143.1 ng/g. This paper reviews current knowledge of Hg cycling in the Antarctic, including its sources, fate, and effects on the ecosystem. The implications of climate change for Hg cycling in the region are also discussed, highlighting the need for continued\r\nresearch to better understand the potential impacts of Hg contamination in the Antarctic.

Metal concentrations were analysed in 17 species from four echinoderm classes: Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea, Crinoidea and Echinoidea. The results revealed species-specific accumulation patterns for most metals, indicating a strong biological control over metal incorporation. In crinoid Heliometra glacialis, a negative correlation between body size and skeletal concentrations of Al, Fe, Mg and Mn was observed. This correlation was ascribed to age-related metabolic traits and a likely mechanism for removing foreign metals from the skeletal calcite. The relationships between environmental factors and metal accumulation patterns were less clear. However, higher concentrations of Al, Fe, Mg, Mn and Pb were found in suspension feeders collected near glaciers, which were potential sources of suspended material. Asteroids exhibited particularly high concentrations of Cu, Fe, Cr, Hg compared to species from the other regions, suggesting that their calcified skeletons may serve as storage mechanisms to prevent toxic effects in other body parts. These observations confirm that biologically-mediated processes predominantly govern metal bioaccumulation in Arctic echinoderms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc624","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"367","pagesFromTo":"1-15","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13","5e709469878c28a0473bc624","677e6956fdbe831a38379a69","677e6956fdbe831a38379a6a","677e6956fdbe831a38379a6b","5e709347878c28a0473a6522"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f8","mniswId":"3525","title":"Chemosphere","issn":"0045-6535","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"58ab338e-e160-4952-ac84-e8a482aef1f5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["liliowce","pierwiastki śladowe","Arktyka","zanieczyszczenie morskie","rozgwiazdy","wężowidła"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["trace elements","sea lilies","brittle star","marine pollution","starfish","Arctic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060959386"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b8725","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mioduchowska","uuid":"63EC8AA96D14A4C713B31761C0F3B148176B1472182F4ECF51841EE52D69C594240C902144DE94A5796E56E4E2423B0097BE41F6C029AF8F00814EE213682585","orcidId":"0000-0003-1707-5028","documentHash":"1cffbee1-d14d-41d0-99d2-8f686b2e759e"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"EEF890B1E5D83511CFF757CBCF10CA2BD7991D3807A5C930A1FE7E612F46F8C684536138A249461DB575FC1B980CA1B886292FD94C3FEBB57329BF6C05122B7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0911-3082","documentHash":"6cad81c7-1414-4d5a-958e-f2eaeda4b528"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12","name":"Agata","lastName":"Weydmann-Zwolicka","uuid":"E747C54DA07EC87566C7647C93E9394FFE36F52FF38300571775F980435A21EBA3D37453332B96F03BF05873FAB19CBA6BB7DCF8E7F7052F85D4F5FB0913738D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6655-6613","documentHash":"52375207-91d1-4baa-ba12-4f428e1780b5"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931cc","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Zwolicki","uuid":"AFBDD8B612F49392F82B4F0A1DDF70BBFB2727FAA7B1AAF80AA0816917925A136A89294B09332BE3E265D2FD782A34C05B38592AD06DDA02EEB0EA6866FE9994","orcidId":"0000-0003-2710-681X","documentHash":"777b13b2-b86c-4884-8525-aaafef429f9c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66f3e8eefdbe8326af96deee","doi":"10.1007/s12526-024-01436-6","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Comparison of DNA metabarcoding and microscopy in analysing planktonic protists from the European Arctic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the era of climate change-related restructuring of planktonic protist communities, it is especially important to identify possible shifts in their taxonomic composition. While traditional microscopy-based morphological classification is time-consuming and requires experienced taxonomists, metabarcoding seems to substantially accelerate the determination of taxonomic composition. In this study, based on samples collected in summer 2019 from the West Spitsbergen Current, we analysed planktonic protists using both methods. Metabarcoding, based on high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene, resulted in a much higher number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and sample diversity than microscopy, although the resolution of taxonomic identification ranged from species to phyla. Most morphology-based identification was performed at the species or genus level, additionally allowing us to include information about dominants and size fractions. The highest proportion of 45% shared taxa by both methods was recorded at the class level. The composition of dominant protists differed between the approaches, with most similarities being observed in Bacillariophyceae, for which two genera, Thalassiosira and Eucampia, were found to be the most abundant with both methods. For Dinophyceae, the most abundant representatives identified by microscopy were Gymnodinium spp., Prorocentrum minimum and Gonyaulax gracilis, while in the metabarcoding approach, most dinoflagellates were identified to the class level only. Given the different levels of accuracy of taxonomic determinations and possible biases in results connected to the chosen methodology, we advocate using an integrative taxonomic approach for the classification of planktonic protists based on the combination of microscopy and molecular methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b8725","5e709249878c28a0473931cc","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86eb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"1-10","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12","5e709439878c28a0473b8725","5e709249878c28a0473931cc","5e709439878c28a0473b86eb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d62","mniswId":"13905","title":"Marine Biodiversity","issn":"1867-1616","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a215a373-d544-4ffc-9c73-9755f74be360"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Atlantifcation","integrative taxonomy","Spitsbergen","next-generation sequencing","Phytoplankton","fram strait","high-throughput sequencing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060959514"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6992fdbe831a3837a2bf","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Witalis","documentHash":"d6d7a3d4-ef55-4506-b224-17acde81d581"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda","name":"MARTA","lastName":"RONOWICZ","uuid":"A12BD0AEECF4F7FD3C28D29DBAFC1BCC4FB4821C697A9C3870D029B46A87F78F286EC78CCEDFA8B73418C66DE888C52FFE9A9BB6EB89D9B701ADD57682C49148","orcidId":"0000-0001-8703-9132","documentHash":"c9083290-9530-45cf-b1ca-c1e3f397a474"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13","name":"Anna","lastName":"Iglikowska","uuid":"6CA1279301544EC9D4A6D185A9E282764B1CFE8885F634000DEC92D847207F9256BA6F5341530B86350D3DF140829DFB7FD955662C6814953270BB437360BB79","orcidId":"0000-0002-3932-9079","documentHash":"3a275c47-9172-49a6-b5de-136edd52c81a"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff12","name":"Agata","lastName":"Weydmann-Zwolicka","uuid":"E747C54DA07EC87566C7647C93E9394FFE36F52FF38300571775F980435A21EBA3D37453332B96F03BF05873FAB19CBA6BB7DCF8E7F7052F85D4F5FB0913738D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6655-6613","documentHash":"52375207-91d1-4baa-ba12-4f428e1780b5"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-02-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"660d0fdd409707034651d7fe","doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2024.02.001","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The zooplankton community of Baltic Sea ports: diversity and seasonal dynamics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W pracy zbadano skład gatunkowy i dynamikę sezonową zooplanktonu, a także wpływ wybranych czynników środowiskowych na zgrupowania zooplanktonu w trzech portach polskiego wybrzeża Bałtyku: we Władysławowie, w Gdyni i w Gdańsku.

Long-Term Ecological Research Data Set From the Marine Genetic Monitoring Program ARMS-MBON 2018–2020","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Molecular methods such as DNA/eDNA metabarcoding have emerged as useful tools to document the biodiversity of complex communities over large spatio-temporal scales. We established an international Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (ARMS-MBON) combining standardised sampling using autonomous reef monitoring structures (ARMS) with metabarcoding for genetic monitoring of marine hard-bottom benthic communities. Here, we present the data of our first sampling campaign comprising 56 ARMS units deployed in 2018–2019 and retrieved in 2018–2020 across 15 observatories along the coasts of Europe and adjacent regions. We describe the open-access data set (image, genetic and metadata) and explore the genetic data to show its potential for marine biodiversity monitoring and ecological research. Our analysis shows that ARMS recovered more than 60 eukaryotic phyla capturing diversity of up to ~5500 amplicon sequence variants and ~1800 operational taxonomic units, and up to ~250 and ~50 species per observatory using the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 18S rRNA marker genes, respectively. Further, ARMS detected threatened, vulnerable and non-indigenous species often targeted in biological monitoring. We show that while deployment duration does not drive diversity estimates, sampling effort and sequencing depth across observatories do. We recommend that ARMS should be deployed for at least 3–6 months during the main growth season to use resources as efficiently as possible and that post-sequencing curation is applied to enable statistical comparison of spatio-temporal entities. We suggest that ARMS should be used in biological monitoring programs and long-term ecological research and encourage the adoption of our ARMS-MBON protocols."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6562","5fb3d234085dcb64f926a04c","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e709347878c28a0473a654e","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","5e709306878c28a0473a15be"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67b31709fdbe83707bf5495a","67b31709fdbe83707bf5495b","67b31709fdbe83707bf5495c","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","67b31709fdbe83707bf5495d","67b31709fdbe83707bf5495e","67b31709fdbe83707bf5495f","5fb3d234085dcb64f926a04c","67b31709fdbe83707bf54960","67b31709fdbe83707bf54961","67b31709fdbe83707bf54962","67b31709fdbe83707bf54963","67b31709fdbe83707bf54964","67b31709fdbe83707bf54965","67b31709fdbe83707bf54966","67b31709fdbe83707bf54967","67b31709fdbe83707bf54968","67b31709fdbe83707bf54969","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","67b31709fdbe83707bf5496a","67b31709fdbe83707bf5496b","5e709306878c28a0473a15be","67b31709fdbe83707bf5496c","67b31709fdbe83707bf5496d","67b31709fdbe83707bf5496e","5e709347878c28a0473a654e","67b31709fdbe83707bf5496f","67b31709fdbe83707bf54970","67b31709fdbe83707bf54971","67b31709fdbe83707bf54972","67b31709fdbe83707bf54973","67b31709fdbe83707bf54974","67b31709fdbe83707bf54975","67b31709fdbe83707bf54976","67b31709fdbe83707bf54977","67b31709fdbe83707bf54978","67b31709fdbe83707bf54979","67b31709fdbe83707bf5497a","5e709347878c28a0473a6562","67b31709fdbe83707bf5497b","67b31709fdbe83707bf5497c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478eed","mniswId":"14545","title":"Molecular Ecology Resources","issn":"1755-098X","eissn":"1755-0998","documentHash":"899c8774-8cb0-4415-8f3f-735539b56a73"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67b31709fdbe83707bf54959","year":"2025","documentHash":"a2e613c9-9299-49d1-a6bb-f480900954c7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060959639"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69b2fdbe831a3837a791","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Kwasigroch","documentHash":"eb6ecdfa-d078-45dc-9ba1-9839d72824b5"},{"objectId":"61a83db87523402fabe26d33","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jędruch","uuid":"47E8A53FA888557E38D24349865DB78266E096B906D832F18A31D0956EF5AB2DEFC230E5F038A2E9DF684775A07820AC0E9E2E415363DAEE2DC390F1E0C189A0","documentHash":"76d3dc46-c415-45d5-8ca7-ead44b4bbabf"},{"objectId":"603db2de9543c711bc6e9dd7","name":"Olga","lastName":"Brocławik","uuid":"62F9F6789ECFA0719CCCDD3AF57763167CB6605549DDB8F2369044F0B4A5F983B3B669D9104829DC2BB1A1BDDF9330694FF8D13101578F848574B1EBA8178A85","documentHash":"bdf56012-9982-41b7-9f47-50c3f69b1b6c"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c40","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bełdowska","uuid":"A48A6F773BFCA51AAD00108933899A8CFB97306BA86E77BD6E1C2C3F173916EEFDD6A8FF0C1B6F2D169D5F34208E9524FF62E120B68B09F8575EE3C707A1EBBC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3585-9283","documentHash":"38090cfb-a306-49ce-a82e-524d28ca1caf"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739376c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Łukawska-Matuszewska","uuid":"BEE7D0CE197D7EF40F9E8C86B64F270ED067E9BCBA5A317D6632E79229CCF6FA58BC06CC0357E85138453C20FEEE806D777D1C523150D293EA322E99E5465D83","orcidId":"0000-0003-1513-3175","documentHash":"b9d5160d-b039-4e98-8661-a04718e785ec"}],"objectId":"658000954097076c1491c132","doi":"10.1016/j.marenvres.2023.106132","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Mobility and bioavailability of mercury in sediments of the southern Baltic sea in relation to the chemical fractions of iron: spatial and temporal patterns","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Marine sediments play a significant role as reservoirs for mercury (Hg), a bioaccumulative toxic pollutant that poses risks to human and ecosystem health. Iron (Fe) has been recognized as an influential factor in the complexation and bioavailability of Hg in sediments.

This study aims to examine the fractions of Hg and Fe in sediments of the Baltic Sea, a region historically impacted by Hg pollution. The Hg fractions were determined using the thermodesorption technique, while sequential extraction was employed to identify the Fe fractions. The findings confirm the crucial role of Fe in the formation, as well as the horizontal and vertical distribution of labile and stable Hg in marine sediments. Factors such as the contribution of organic matter, the presence of reactive Fe, and Fe associated with sheet silicates emerged as significant drivers that positively influenced the content of the most labile Hg fractions, potentially affecting the mobility and bioavailability of Hg in the marine environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603db2de9543c711bc6e9dd7","5e709262878c28a047394c40","677e69b2fdbe831a3837a791","5e70924f878c28a04739376c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a83db87523402fabe26d33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"191","pagesFromTo":"1-26","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739376c","603db2de9543c711bc6e9dd7","5e709262878c28a047394c40","677e69b2fdbe831a3837a791","61a83db87523402fabe26d33"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d6a","mniswId":"13913","title":"Marine Environmental Research","issn":"0141-1136","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f4bd04d0-89db-47f3-978a-7ec6d86d0dd2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hg","Fe","chemical fractions","sediments","pollution history","Baltic Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060959853"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"649260a940e3ff055afcdb17","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Borawska","uuid":"E966F782A8007F4E354BB264CF90EB8FF98D9B6E2348F267C51C3602020B66145B9BA163336FDDCE058155F34CC9B2EEF16B5A3DBCC0950ACE4707ADC67DBECC","documentHash":"1c1c420e-aba7-4566-b086-e25f27355c31"},{"objectId":"624512287523402df09a215a","name":"Marta","lastName":"Szczepanek","uuid":"EDB4A9AB9FBE619D699452A10833164BB9D90ACE8E74E4E6E5336B014009A0200D9A6DADA9D868D7B6F2F5A77CD6C24C9646E7A8779E91B255C61FF75A25CD4E","documentHash":"e29b6770-7259-432d-86a0-458129356369"},{"objectId":"5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","name":"Marc","lastName":"Silberberger","uuid":"E363DD7660B6F1967F260E77F0DEF03CA3C92DBDD2009A5DBC438FB3DAEB66FD9BD2F93626269E3F1CFEEB33857F9B6DB8B35FB96FCEC7ADE22AD4C7FDCB76B5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8819-4388","documentHash":"5c5d0ad5-b173-4b3e-82f6-be9607003a7e"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc646","name":"Monika","lastName":"Grabowska","uuid":"445A343F4B243B5B65DB4BC17735449BF3A0CEFF8A5CB0947B755796E903851AC662A9B50F2006972259288B920E87CC99D2C4BC867609B0F280EA0D8E535812","documentHash":"3352aea9-aff8-40a1-bdf6-2672c225a514"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6546","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kędra","uuid":"B950AFC0394B7FA11EB92F7D86E8B739E8F8E7879A82119B50736842491ECD0E305659B79802EAF50951C7A11F3F4453F898F95EE3550F2986DCF421440D2324","orcidId":"0000-0002-2223-5850","documentHash":"dc1fef89-bd48-43c8-8077-d9cff1028c90"}],"objectId":"670d0bd0fdbe83238aec96a1","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.117087","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025326X24010646?dgcid=coauthor","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Integrating natural and anthropogenic factors in assessment of benthic ecosystem disturbance: A biotic index approach from the southern Baltic Sea.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Baltic Sea, with its semi-enclosed and nutrient-rich waters, can serve for compelling case studies to understand coastal dynamics amidst anthropogenic pressures. We assessed the levels of benthic disturbance across various coastal locations along the southern Baltic, focusing on water and sediment parameters and benthic community structure. We revealed significant differences in ecological status measured by the AMBI index, largely influenced by the quantity and quality of organic matter in sediments. While the disturbance level along the southern Baltic coast was generally low, moderate anthropogenic disturbances were noted in deeper parts of Puck Bay, similar to those in the highly impacted part of Szczecin Lagoon. In contrast, the sandy open coast exhibited the highest ecological quality due to high hydrodynamics preventing organic matter accumulation. Our study underscores the effectiveness of AMBI in detecting ecological changes within complex environmental dynamics and emphasize the importance of integrating natural and anthropogenic factors in ecosystem health assessments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","uid":"b6NUXJH6kJYzzJvxqM0-8WA","uuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","name":"Morski Instytut Rybacki - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","parentUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","rootUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6546","649260a940e3ff055afcdb17","624512287523402df09a215a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"209","issue":"Part A","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["624512287523402df09a215a","5e709469878c28a0473bc646","5e7094ef878c28a0473c73ec","649260a940e3ff055afcdb17","5e709347878c28a0473a6546"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d73","mniswId":"13923","title":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","issn":"0025-326X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4da78be2-a8fc-4c7c-8770-04b5572174f2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"670d0bd0fdbe83238aec96a2","year":"2024","volume":"209","documentHash":"ed30837d-7e9a-47e6-a65c-6aef12ff140c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060959961"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a10fdbe831a3837b888","name":"Martin V.","lastName":"Angel","documentHash":"5d45f023-4558-46fc-9695-28abdf08935c"},{"objectId":"677e6a10fdbe831a3837b887","name":"Wioleta ","lastName":"Rasmus","documentHash":"4f8b4d1b-09b5-4c4e-aac4-f2743f0120e7"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59ae","name":"Maria","lastName":"Szymelfenig","uuid":"F8199DF3104F4321BD413EFA91C56920954B22C7307F131318A6763255E46CF82F7B2E8229DF25484CADE5B0C41A1547F1C4548BAC66C5DF8A4452043C9AC14F","documentHash":"f1057808-0df2-49ad-8dee-4976f5254389"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6520","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Błachowiak-Samołyk","uuid":"8C6AD77D97DA3D9D5230CB20B5B200FB76893BFE72A48BE0BAB6068DBB7BD96049B3C885C6414B2EF04BBFB8AFD27AC9468868A23DB7A01FB8AEBEECC4EDAD0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8076-2168","documentHash":"5036109f-207f-446c-bac6-ec8dd36677f9"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739375d","name":"Luiza","lastName":"Bielecka","uuid":"12FEC7198AE9C8453F9C3EB893C387FEAFE80060C856F2995547D6C27B8A9606C41E7D4EB86CF1B987195BBD293266B371737A5FAE7880DE88420EEAC7FA0587","orcidId":"0000-0002-1162-9272","documentHash":"a70fe1e6-6ef0-42d4-8edd-6a4f6f929dc8"}],"objectId":"63bbf04c40970754861d9f15","doi":"10.1007/s00300-022-03029-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00300-022-03029-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Drake passage-a bottleneck where spatial distribution of the planktonic Ostracoda reflects the dynamic hydrography well","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Across the Drake Passage, planktonic ostracods are a significant component of mesozooplankton communities. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate their composition structure and distribution within the upper 300-m layer in summer 2010. Our study revealed a complex pattern in their assemblages along the south–north transect, which strongly coincides with three distinct hydrographic regimes the transect crossed: the Antarctic Zone (AZ), the Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ), and the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ). Superimposed on this hydrographic zonation was a northward gradient in increasing ostracod abundance. The overall species number was low—just 12 species—but the composition of ostracod assemblages reflected the origin of the water masses well, since the numerically dominant species in the three hydrographic zones were: Alacia hettacra, in the AZ; Discoconchoecia elegans, in the PFZ; and Pseudoconchoecia serrulata, in the SAZ. Although the Passage acts as a physical bottleneck, diverting typically Antarctic waters further north than in other sectors of the Southern Ocean (SO), the distributional ranges of Conchoecia magna, Obtusoecia antarctica, and P. serrulata were observed further south than had previously been reported. A possible explanation for this shift is that the Polar Front position is located further south than in the other Atlantic part of the SO. It is also likely that, in such a narrow passage containing pelagic fauna of various hydrographical zones, even subtle shifts in distribution, including changes in climate, will be observed at first; therefore, our data might constitute important reference material for tracking further zooplankton biogeography in Antarctic waters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59ae","677e6a10fdbe831a3837b887","5e70924f878c28a04739375d"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"809-824","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739375d","5e709410878c28a0473b59ae","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","677e6a10fdbe831a3837b887","677e6a10fdbe831a3837b888"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792ee","mniswId":"16268","title":"Polar Biology","issn":"0722-4060","eissn":"1432-2056","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"bc27ecdf-9f44-411f-a246-5c1f92e41153"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["planktonowe Ostracoda","strefy hydrograficzne","biogeografia","wskaźniki","położenie Frontu Polarnego"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Planktonic ostracods","hydrographical zonation","biogeography","indicators","Polar Front position"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060987846"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a28fdbe831a3837bba9","name":"Jennifer","lastName":"Loxton","documentHash":"1ab9df7d-df90-4329-bf1f-76818b40d360"},{"objectId":"677e6a28fdbe831a3837bba8","name":"Joanne","lastName":"Porter","documentHash":"f69a08ee-ef4b-480c-92fc-5410da16f503"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda","name":"MARTA","lastName":"RONOWICZ","uuid":"A12BD0AEECF4F7FD3C28D29DBAFC1BCC4FB4821C697A9C3870D029B46A87F78F286EC78CCEDFA8B73418C66DE888C52FFE9A9BB6EB89D9B701ADD57682C49148","orcidId":"0000-0001-8703-9132","documentHash":"c9083290-9530-45cf-b1ca-c1e3f397a474"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393774","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sokołowski","uuid":"A8DF78223D6931F3A1488AD4CA2DD71EB576109EF1E4A6E28D46AD9FD41D849B6AE4A66B0A063CE1E11FB58DE256E50829B83C64559A5AE53AFFAE38111120B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-7551-3199","documentHash":"f352609d-eee6-479b-b503-7e977d3e76e8"}],"objectId":"6228652f2467f0086c9ba389","doi":"10.1016/j.csr.2021.104641","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Experimental apparatus for investigating colonization, succession and related processes of rocky bottom epifauna","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To fully understand what controls the structure of benthic assemblages, recognition of the factors that influence each step of their development is needed. This includes knowledge about crucial processes such as biota recruitment and succession. Complex, heterogeneous natural substrates occurring on the sea floor, such as rocks, boulders and biogenic substrata, are often difficult to replicate experimentally. Uniform artificial substrate in the form of plates, often referred to as settlement panels, mimic the natural hard substrata of the rocky bottom and provides uniform replication at a wider scale. This allows scientists to study recruitment and succession processes and also various other issues related to colonization in aquatic environments. In this paper, we present detailed instructions for the construction of a settlement panel apparatus that has been used successfully over multiple years to study epifaunal succession and colonization in shallow-water marine environments around the world; we also provide practical examples of such studies from temperate and polar areas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393774"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"233","pagesFromTo":"1-5","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393774","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","677e6a28fdbe831a3837bba8","677e6a28fdbe831a3837bba9","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cda"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777e6","mniswId":"4393","title":"Continental Shelf Research","issn":"0278-4343","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"75ab7b08-e6eb-4397-86ad-544a8e0c0feb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["benthos","colonization","succession","settlement panels","hard substrate","SCUBA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060988000"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa5","name":"Eduardo","lastName":"Zorita","documentHash":"f921838f-e53c-4340-8228-98eb44277cb7"},{"objectId":"677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa4","name":"Anders","lastName":"Wörman","documentHash":"a42e3465-2141-45e8-b688-d03bf45a48dc"},{"objectId":"677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa3","name":"Emma","lastName":"Undeman","documentHash":"569996b3-3fa9-412a-9844-986f09a139b5"},{"objectId":"677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa1","name":"Jarkko","lastName":"Saarinen","documentHash":"64ade665-f5a5-4ae1-a157-846ae28737b8"},{"objectId":"677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa0","name":"Anneli","lastName":"Poska","documentHash":"0f579847-cbb4-4871-a443-431bd3c3d32c"},{"objectId":"677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9f","name":"Cristian","lastName":"Pons‐ Seres de Brauwer","documentHash":"95e15c5f-4637-414c-a57d-1298cec0d85a"},{"objectId":"677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9e","name":"Kevin","lastName":"Parnell","documentHash":"f3626453-d5a7-4559-ad17-370399dc0960"},{"objectId":"677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9d","name":"Sonja","lastName":"Oberbeckmann","documentHash":"1a9c0c76-8a0e-417a-b904-30bbdc78f88a"},{"objectId":"677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9c","name":"H.

A multitude of human impacts, including climate change, affect the different compartments of the environment, and these effects interact with each other. As part of the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports (BEAR), we present an inventory and discussion of different human-induced factors and processes affecting the environment of the Baltic Sea region, and their interrelations. Some are naturally occurring and modified by human activities (i.e. climate change, coastal processes, hypoxia, acidification, submarine groundwater discharges, marine ecosystems, non-indigenous species, land use and land cover), some are completely human-induced (i.e. agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, river regulations, offshore wind farms, shipping, chemical contamination, dumped warfare agents, marine litter and microplastics, tourism, and coastal management), and they are all interrelated to different degrees. We present a general description and analysis of the state of knowledge on these interrelations. Our main insight is that climate change has an overarching, integrating impact on all of the other factors and can be interpreted as a background effect, which has different implications for the other factors. Impacts on the environment and the human sphere can be roughly allocated to anthropogenic drivers such as food production, energy production, transport, industry and economy. The findings from this inventory of available information and analysis of the different factors and their interactions in the Baltic Sea region can largely be transferred to other comparable marginal and coastal seas in the world."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709262878c28a047394c40"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654a","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-80","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709262878c28a047394c40","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf8c","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf8d","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf8e","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf8f","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf90","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf92","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf93","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf94","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf95","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf96","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf97","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf98","5e709347878c28a0473a654a","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9a","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9b","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9c","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9d","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9e","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bf9f","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa0","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa1","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa3","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa4","677e6a42fdbe831a3837bfa5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779db","mniswId":"5271","title":"Earth System Dynamics","issn":"2190-4979","eissn":"2190-4987","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f71f48a0-a236-4168-916e-dc33338082c8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060988408"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602f967f9543c7410626f647","name":"Robert","lastName":"Konkel","uuid":"3B854E92CEDE8E8356AADECC65794087D4CE477CB8F8ED6AA933E6EB2B20087DDAF561EE349B687BF54605806C27509A29214AF17E3174EF35485530E49755BB","documentHash":"45c1845a-3cc6-4c82-a93f-dcc3f0a87ec7"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b531d","name":"Marta","lastName":"Cegłowska","uuid":"89FE0790F5C9D9E8F0260FF7B9232D603066BED265D2DA543EBC02B4A61C62B11FD24340296284E0CC2F71D75AE72065559F3C82C1C50598882121E3853911FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6601-5825","documentHash":"411af4a6-4468-4760-bcca-7323b99db6ce"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1be5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Grabski","uuid":"AA274E3954D587FF2524682C97BF93E3775CA1B366276F2DE90E77D5E064D537E6040519307230C82819C6A06CA8CE220E529756C6E2C04FC06736735A1B0562","orcidId":"0000-0002-2574-5688","documentHash":"06b2e5f8-91fe-4c3d-8f22-e95f9d1f112a"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aee3","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wieczerzak","uuid":"8EE3BF664D0894B79EDA6F98524D79C0B325765BCD4C4606ECBA7EFD50426B023AF68F8AF5BADB4A9C097916A303039E6A165913338B328F9B4F779CCBD113A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2539-5160","documentHash":"b156787c-91a0-40c4-859f-9ecc80faab25"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739376e","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Mazur-Marzec","uuid":"2852F5647EE385956A11FD39CEA425EFF527786F3E1EC88F4B48FD89DEBB05D21128545C3FF7B9D04705B55E13F3DD254507B596D8D439373A1BFE5D7F9FEDBF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6526-4045","documentHash":"79af155b-3304-43df-b504-96adcf915d45"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931c8","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Węgrzyn","uuid":"A469E34D344425E81483D591AD304ECA0BD06E82101A57C8F81C3F7F51F06AEE4CF9BA3B9C888B51971D42B797F240E6C3C6DBCC9579819D19B981C0CAECF418","orcidId":"0000-0003-4042-7466","documentHash":"3b1ccf83-c10d-421d-bcfa-c3cb7d3daa3b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"633d4a9d409707220fbcff61","doi":"10.3390/ijerph191912346","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191912346","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Anabaenopeptins from Nostoc edaphicum CCNP1411","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cyanobacteria of the Nostoc genus belong to the most prolific sources of bioactive metabolites.

Three of the APs, including two new variants, were isolated as pure compounds and tested against four serine proteases and carboxypeptidase A (CPA).

We found out that it differed significantly, with salinity being the main environmental variable responsible for these differences. The Spitsbergen shelf was dominated by Atlantic Waters, with a rather homogenous water column in terms of salinity and temperature down to 300 m; hence, the marine microbial community was also homogenous at all sampled depths (0, 25, 50 m). On the contrary, stations on the Greenland shelf were exposed to different water masses of both Arctic and Atlantic origin, which resulted in a more diverse microbial community there. Unexpectedly, for the very first time, we identified cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus marinus in Arctic waters (Spitsbergen shelf, 75–77° N). Till now, the distribution of this cyanobacteria in oceans has been described only between 40° N and 40° S.

W niniejszej pracy przedstawiamy największy jak dotąd zbiór danych mineralogicznych dotyczących węglanowych szkieletów u mszywiołów z Oceanu Południowego. Mszywioły są grupą różnorodną, liczną i mającą duże znaczenie w produkcji węglanów, co czyni je doskonałymi organizmami modelowymi w kwestii monitorowania skutków ocieplenia i zakwaszenia oceanu. Aby lepiej zrozumieć, w jaki sposób mszywioły mogą reagować na ocieplenie i zakwaszenie oceanu, po raz pierwszy podjęto próbę oceny czy skład mineralny szkieletu zmienia się w gradiencie równoleżnikowym i wraz ze zmianą temperatury dna morskiego. Aby tego dokonać wykorzystano dane na temat występowania gatunków mszywiołów i porównano je wraz z danymi dotyczącymi temperatury. Nasze zestawienie obejmujące nowe dane mineralogiczne z opublikowanymi danymi z cieplejszych regionów pokazuje, że udział kalcytu wysokomagnezowego i gatunków bimineralicznych wzrasta znacząco w kierunku niższych szerokości geograficznych i wraz ze wzrostem temperatury wody morskiej.

Ocean warming and acidification are already impacting benthic species with carbonate skeletons, but the magnitude of these changes to species and ecosystems remains largely unknown. Here we provide the largest carbonate mineralogical dataset to date for Southern Ocean bryozoans, which are diverse, abundant and important as carbonate producers, thus making them excellent for monitoring the effects of ocean warming and acidification. To improve our understanding of how bryozoans might respond to ocean warming and acidification, we assess latitudinal and seafloor temperature patterns of skeletal mineralogy using bryozoan species occurrences together with temperature data for the first time. Our findings, combining new mineralogical data with published data from warmer regions, show that the proportions of high-Mg calcite and bimineralic species increase significantly towards lower latitudes and with increasing seawater temperature. These patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that seawater temperature is likely a significant driver of variations in bryozoan mineralogy at a global scale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc624","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709467878c28a0473bc59b","5e709347878c28a0473a6522"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2023","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-14","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709469878c28a0473bc624","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13","677e69a2fdbe831a3837a524","677e69a2fdbe831a3837a525","5e709467878c28a0473bc59b","5e709347878c28a0473a6522"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779ed","mniswId":"5311","title":"Ecography","issn":"0906-7590","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"45f72039-edc8-49c3-b604-d7915960746e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Antarktyda","kalcyt magnezowy","organizm kalcyfikujący","zakwaszenie","ocieplenie oceanu","aragonit"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mg-calcite","aragonite","calcifying organisms","ocean\nwarming","acidification","Antarctic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061018066"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69acfdbe831a3837a68b","name":"Monika","lastName":"Soja-Woźniak","documentHash":"e524f012-3229-4571-a140-cac77c3752af"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59ad","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Śliwińska-Wilczewska","uuid":"A77991D461A5E7A6AA9B0AD0A5E43595074E96450913A0D33EE65327BB5591F2EFFEC4B8B57EB7A78138189B34C5047117C62D7D5B0953B969BD035684DD95D3","orcidId":"0000-0002-3147-6605","documentHash":"a3fd2811-c7b3-4285-8c0e-c5ef97db623e"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6553","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Darecki","uuid":"3755ABFC91B9E5A4F1AE0A7678119D08E03F290D86F7F0652A5312D20FE39F687D1A53AC6EDA03F9ECCAA1B4F03ECEA0646A362FF8EA959243FCD42C5D7DD4BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4326-5212","documentHash":"767e4626-6c39-4ef7-aec0-2c18b6ea089b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6545","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stoń-Egiert","uuid":"761936593A0A85A183D4328C890367B2F2F64EA207CBA8ABD568F50DE6BCEADC3C2ACFAC4786EF77370FE85E6437FA754AFFD2F08C89E1B051CDC877FA69B923","orcidId":"0000-0002-4274-8979","documentHash":"eef72685-4d70-4808-a6da-0ffdedc9843e"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993d5","name":"Marta","lastName":"Konik","uuid":"C9EFA09C8E176C789E5FEDF411C2490E92565CB72CBE1EF71C0DF2DE1AC8FCA7CA9972FDA56DD38CD1A76438D0F4D33B04273B7C66203050838BCF543B92B6E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1145-9127","documentHash":"de341dc2-90f3-4b16-96f7-18332a2e9882"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739375e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bradtke","uuid":"5D7F0E97E4051924BF632F540B405544DC86D9C13D47A5B39EAE8AD4EB182CC233EE2CF633AEB01DDEFF1E55EE144ED62AC43DBDCDBF9B95BA98C683495819B0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9305-8193","documentHash":"a701baf3-d918-4b69-909c-fcee70f9799e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6412e87b4097075d81fb3a12","doi":"10.3390/rs15061601","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cyanobacteria index as a tool for the satellite detection of cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea have been studied for years due to their toxicity, which negatively affects all biota, along with the influence of these floating colonies on surface fluxes. However, mapping these blooms is still a challenge since their high dynamics, wide coverage, and specific radiometric footprint hinder atmospheric correction and negatively affect the quality of satellite images. In this study, we assessed the use of an alternative approach called the cyanobacteria index (CI), which is based on the reflectance spectral shape and which does not require comprehensive atmospheric correction. We demonstrated a close relationship between the positive CI values, indicating the presence of blooms, and the concentration of phycocyanin, the marker pigment of filamentous cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea. We proved that the CI index could efficiently identify cyanobacteria-dominated blooms where colonies floated near the surface. Therefore, this index represents a valuable complement to the previous monitoring methods, suitable for extreme bloom events. The analysis of a time series of satellite images obtained between 2002 and 2018 using the CI index revealed the elongation of the bloom season, which may have been a consequence of the water temperature remaining within the cyanobacteria’s tolerance range for a longer time."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a04739375e","5e709410878c28a0473b59ad"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a0473993d5","5e709347878c28a0473a6553","5e709347878c28a0473a6545"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1-19","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739375e","5e709410878c28a0473b59ad","5e70929e878c28a0473993d5","5e709347878c28a0473a6545","677e69acfdbe831a3837a68b","5e709347878c28a0473a6553"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","issn":"2072-4292","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"adfc571f-e92f-4da0-8504-22894916b3f6"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cyanobacteria blooms","cyanobacteria index","OLCI","remote sensing","HABs","Baltic Sea"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061018177"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b8def34097073f66fc9094","name":"Marc J.","lastName":"Silberberger","documentHash":"565e20e6-6b78-4197-8a0b-f1fc89b66d28"},{"objectId":"624512287523402df09a215a","name":"Marta","lastName":"Szczepanek","uuid":"EDB4A9AB9FBE619D699452A10833164BB9D90ACE8E74E4E6E5336B014009A0200D9A6DADA9D868D7B6F2F5A77CD6C24C9646E7A8779E91B255C61FF75A25CD4E","documentHash":"e29b6770-7259-432d-86a0-458129356369"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6546","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kędra","uuid":"B950AFC0394B7FA11EB92F7D86E8B739E8F8E7879A82119B50736842491ECD0E305659B79802EAF50951C7A11F3F4453F898F95EE3550F2986DCF421440D2324","orcidId":"0000-0002-2223-5850","documentHash":"dc1fef89-bd48-43c8-8077-d9cff1028c90"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-01-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65b8def34097073f66fc9093","doi":"10.1002/lno.12506","publicUri":"https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/lno.12506","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Functional structure and diversity of marine benthos reflect food availability and quality, as evidenced by isotopic diversity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Organic matter (OM) resources shape not only the trophic diversity of benthic communities but also the diversity of benthic functional traits. The resulting community structure has a direct effect on many ecosystem processes and functions. Still, the relationship between functional diversity of marine benthos and its trophic diversity in response to the variability of food remains poorly investigated. To explore this relationship we focused on the assessment of various facets of macrobenthic diversity in two temperate coastal areas (southern Baltic Sea) characterized by similar species pool and habitat properties but different OM sources and supplies. We also identified spatio-temporal patterns of functional structure and assessed, which OM properties had the strongest influence on benthic communities. In our study, functional space dispersion followed isotopic space dispersion, reflecting the positive relationship between food variability and ecological functions of benthic communities. Moreover, functional structure in shallow areas was more location-specific in comparison to deeper areas, and this was significantly related to OM parameters. Higher OM variability close to the river mouth prevented the community from becoming dominated by one specialized species, whereas limited OM supply at shallow open coast lowered the diversity by enabling stronger competitor to dominate the community. In more offshore areas, local OM variability ceased and hence, communities tended to reflect similar trophic and functional patterns. Our study demonstrates that functional and isotopic diversity approaches can be effectively combined to better understand mechanisms driving benthic community structure and confirm that greater variability in OM supply increases diversity of benthic communities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6546","624512287523402df09a215a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9999","pagesFromTo":"1-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["624512287523402df09a215a","65b8def34097073f66fc9094","5e709347878c28a0473a6546"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cf6","mniswId":"13650","title":"LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY","issn":"0024-3590","documentHash":"c17962d9-0f64-4611-8165-2a6856d816c5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65afa60e4097073321c27de1","year":"2024","documentHash":"a91d49fa-6f64-4536-8e1b-01980dd7fb0d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747061024050"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6950fdbe831a3837998c","name":"Robert","lastName":"Gromadka","documentHash":"0f4107bf-07ac-421c-a0f2-716fc993ca5c"},{"objectId":"677e6950fdbe831a3837998a","name":"Jan","lastName":"Gawor","documentHash":"ebd7a6b8-85fd-4677-b818-5973f7255876"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b531d","name":"Marta","lastName":"Cegłowska","uuid":"89FE0790F5C9D9E8F0260FF7B9232D603066BED265D2DA543EBC02B4A61C62B11FD24340296284E0CC2F71D75AE72065559F3C82C1C50598882121E3853911FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6601-5825","documentHash":"411af4a6-4468-4760-bcca-7323b99db6ce"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1be5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Grabski","uuid":"AA274E3954D587FF2524682C97BF93E3775CA1B366276F2DE90E77D5E064D537E6040519307230C82819C6A06CA8CE220E529756C6E2C04FC06736735A1B0562","orcidId":"0000-0002-2574-5688","documentHash":"06b2e5f8-91fe-4c3d-8f22-e95f9d1f112a"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739376e","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Mazur-Marzec","uuid":"2852F5647EE385956A11FD39CEA425EFF527786F3E1EC88F4B48FD89DEBB05D21128545C3FF7B9D04705B55E13F3DD254507B596D8D439373A1BFE5D7F9FEDBF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6526-4045","documentHash":"79af155b-3304-43df-b504-96adcf915d45"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931c8","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Węgrzyn","uuid":"A469E34D344425E81483D591AD304ECA0BD06E82101A57C8F81C3F7F51F06AEE4CF9BA3B9C888B51971D42B797F240E6C3C6DBCC9579819D19B981C0CAECF418","orcidId":"0000-0003-4042-7466","documentHash":"3b1ccf83-c10d-421d-bcfa-c3cb7d3daa3b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66dee566fdbe832ef89e22c7","doi":"10.3390/microorganisms12081628","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Genome mining of pseudanabaena galeata CCNP1313 indicates a new scope in the search for antiproliferative and antiviral agents","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Compounds derived from natural sources pave the way for novel drug development. Cyanobacteria is an ubiquitous phylum found in various habitats. The fitness of those microorganisms, within different biotopes, is partially dependent on secondary metabolite production. Their enhanced production under biotic/abiotic stress factors accounts for better survival rates of cells, and thereby cyanobacteria are as an enticing source of bioactive compounds. Previous studies have shown the potent activity of extracts and fractions from Pseudanabaena galeata (Böcher 1949) strain CCNP1313 against cancer cells and viruses. However, active agents remain unknown, as the selected peptides had no effect on the tested cell lines. Here, we present a bottom-up approach, pinpointing key structures involved in secondary metabolite production. Consisting of six replicons, a complete genome sequence of P. galeata strain CCNP1313 was found to carry genes for non-ribosomal peptide/polyketide synthetases embedded within chromosome spans (4.9 Mbp) and for a ribosomally synthesized peptide located on one of the plasmids (0.2 Mbp). Elucidation of metabolite synthesis pathways led to prediction of their structure. While none of the synthesis-predicted products were found in mass spectrometry analysis, unexplored synthetases are characterized by structural similarities to those producing potent bioactive compounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a0473931c8","5e70924f878c28a04739376e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b531d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1-17","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1be5","5e70924f878c28a04739376e","5e709249878c28a0473931c8","677e6950fdbe831a3837998a","5e709408878c28a0473b531d","677e6950fdbe831a3837998c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547ccb4","mniswId":"14352","title":"Microorganisms","issn":"2076-2607","eissn":"2076-2607","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"1acb9682-3059-4777-960d-c292bad20179"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["secondary metabolites","genome analysis","cyanobacteria"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061024174"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66794e16409707627d6907fb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Nasiek","documentHash":"4f8552a5-19a3-49c8-903a-cf5a9eb14fc0"},{"objectId":"66794e16409707627d6907fa","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Artichowicz","documentHash":"4e460c97-d868-4b98-b1b2-0fb3b4f7ddca"},{"objectId":"617e0db87523400564d62f44","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Janczewska","uuid":"52103224986382FD8123F1E28F0048D8DE1E55E6DD79FFC881FEAF9DF1E0CEC3C4AA19F85E6C0EE4A8454F542EA817F8955CAF9D480C5E3CCD36A05EC6F76974","documentHash":"8dad9a81-4c5f-4f7c-83f6-e3f1603fa784"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac37a","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Kosek","uuid":"580974CB932CB9CB9F745E04EA8FDCC73A6416953BF93826231A8DB6AEADD3D7FCF80210B3DFE1C8D733CC02FB1884641FBCEA604F9998EF3FE0E4797C11F887","orcidId":"0000-0003-1372-6567","documentHash":"11f2f9cc-0a47-42b4-a859-1339732ed7d8"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f3fb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Ruman","uuid":"98ED11210A34E93704E2682BB61980A8DD720FE78F4FFB5D1CE848B5A521A5E60AA36150C71DC9F2676530D649F578147FA3C8BD6B60C71B0F7F5DE4D53150E7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9424-7589","documentHash":"3b16b106-7123-4d0c-aa88-3cfb1da97be0"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f3b7","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Matysik","uuid":"3FE6E31AF3D57DCE2348D6E9BB0668822082B008EA1A77B8E8B328FA27903DE7C8B0A0809AF1A9D5F60124F1C0425EE43107B47F16E33685E3320D1104BB5585","orcidId":"0000-0002-5424-5703","documentHash":"762912c8-2e06-4fee-bff7-892921dedd58"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66794e16409707627d6907f6","doi":"10.1007/s11600-024-01390-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11600-024-01390-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Fluvial ecology disasters: the impact of the Gliwice Canal on the ecological crisis in the Oder River basin, Poland (2022)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In August 2022, the Oder River experienced an ecological disaster, resulting in the extinction of hundreds of aquatic organisms. Mass fish deaths also occurred during that time in the Gliwice Canal, located in southern Poland, which connects to the upper section of the Oder River. The aim of the article was to assess the impact of the waters from the Gliwice Canal on the water quality changes in the Oder River, as expressed by chloride, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate content, as well as its parameters such as conductivity, temperature, and pH. Statistical analyses were conducted based on our own research and a series of data collected by the Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection. Below the confluence of the Oder River with the waters of the canal, an increase in sulphates levels and a decrease in sodium content were observed. The other parameters remained unchanged. It was also noted that the magnitude of each parameter was significantly higher in the waters of the Gliwice Canal compared to the Oder River. The research conclusion is that there is no influence of the canals’ waters on the quality of the Oder River waters, both during the ecological disaster and afterwards. The presented research clearly indicates the need for separate analyses of flowing waters (with significantly higher salt and other pollutant dissolution capacity) and stagnant waters in water infrastructure (without water exchange)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac37a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f3b7","5e7092ec878c28a04739f3fb","617e0db87523400564d62f44"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"73","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"775-798","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ec878c28a04739f3fb","617e0db87523400564d62f44","5e709389878c28a0473ac37a","66794e16409707627d6907fa","66794e16409707627d6907fb","5e7092eb878c28a04739f3b7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e09","mniswId":"215","title":"Acta Geophysica","issn":"1895-7455","eissn":"1895-7455","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"020c90c9-42d9-4cda-b1e1-55d7af1c9363"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67bdb23cfdbe8332d80914f3","year":"2025","volume":"73","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"4495c3c9-274d-4a31-8aff-4c7822ae133c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ecological disaster","Gliwice Canal","Oder River","Fluvial ecology","Poland"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061024254"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f8466d","name":"Lars","lastName":"Stemmann","documentHash":"fa950f3d-dedc-46d2-bd64-2227f87ea748"},{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f8466c","name":"Gabriel","lastName":"Gorsky","documentHash":"6645398c-230a-4b19-8848-445dab5d6f40"},{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f8466b","name":"Rainer","lastName":"Kiko","documentHash":"58ca358e-19b9-4a69-9bd9-1a47716e46c1"},{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f8466a","name":"Jean-Louis","lastName":"Jamet","documentHash":"f297111c-b16a-4f92-8a93-08ba722b88d5"},{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f84669","name":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Romagnan","documentHash":"61b75dbc-9238-4c3d-b3ca-0b4fa094ac9d"},{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f84668","name":"Fabien","lastName":"Lombard","documentHash":"8f6d7f06-560d-417a-a6a6-c240bf02a710"},{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f84667","name":"Tristan","lastName":"Biard","documentHash":"d5ee8fa6-aa2f-4be8-8b54-95434f814567"},{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f84666","name":"Laetitia","lastName":"Drago","documentHash":"ae351f7f-3453-4b7b-aee5-c9e818330b98"},{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f84665","name":"Mathilde","lastName":"Dugenne","documentHash":"34d6d1c5-75da-46c3-af66-0b046393e612"},{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f84664","name":"Yawouvi Dodji","lastName":"Soviadan","documentHash":"b0269f7f-d28b-450c-bd8c-088561307397"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2024-09-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f84662","doi":"10.1093/plankt/fbae046","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/plankt/article-pdf/46/5/461/59465075/fbae046.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Combining in situ and ex situ plankton image data to reconstruct zooplankton (>1 mm) volume and mass distribution in the global ocean","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plankton size spectra are important indicators of the ecosystem state, yet such measurements are typically biased by the available sampling methods. Here, we combined individual size measurement from two zooplankton imaging approaches—in situ observation by the Underwater Vision Profiler5 and Multinet-collection supplemented by ex situ imaging via Zooscan—obtained in the global ocean, to calculate zooplankton normalized biovolume size spectra (NBSS) for all organisms larger than 1 mm. The reconstructed NBSS combining both datasets resulted in increased biomass estimates by adding organisms poorly sampled by either of the methods. The optimal values measured by both methods are used to reconstruct the zooplankton biovolume and biomass distributions. The reconstructed slopes appeared steeper and closer to those measured only by the UVP5 (+7.6%) and flatter than those obtained only from the Multinet (−20%), particularly in tropical and temperate latitudes. The main difference in tropical and temperate NBSS from the two devices is due to the fragile rhizarians that were not accounted for when using net data. When possible, we suggest using in situ and ex situ technologies together, and we provide potential indications on how to correct for missing components of the community when only one method is available."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"46","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"461-474","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679c9401fdbe830b35f84664","679c9401fdbe830b35f84665","679c9401fdbe830b35f84666","679c9401fdbe830b35f84667","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","679c9401fdbe830b35f84668","679c9401fdbe830b35f84669","679c9401fdbe830b35f8466a","679c9401fdbe830b35f8466b","679c9401fdbe830b35f8466c","679c9401fdbe830b35f8466d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789b8","mniswId":"12311","title":"JOURNAL OF PLANKTON RESEARCH","issn":"0142-7873","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"632a0acf-841b-4ac9-ae7d-eacb4d94c8af"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679c9401fdbe830b35f84663","year":"2024","volume":"46","number":"5","documentHash":"3bc0fa91-5ced-4785-989a-bc69f3e27b24"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["net","Uvp5","zooplankton","Nbss reconstruction","gain","biomass"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061024297"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c2","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Paździor","uuid":"DADC54691FBE81C5F946DC42E8DD071BBE303B4EA3CF351BEABE42720C6C569D8FAF65923AD06BC559A1F5C4916DA622EC519E78D01A0741DD099503CBCC8526","orcidId":"0000-0001-6564-5246","documentHash":"d47b0aad-82be-4128-85e9-0c345d4d4dcb"},{"objectId":"5e70945c878c28a0473bb4cd","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Nadolna-Ałtyn","uuid":"99FF302E9700DB06F7ED2E84957341E145AA70D0BFB7BB5806042F6A7C8711D3541E04365AE4FC207C15F96ABBCD4ED7E1F7A601FAB958200C00D91C3EDDD2DC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5507-2595","documentHash":"fcccbf03-3d41-4239-8b9d-fafacb0be634"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85f9","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Siedlewicz","uuid":"DC70C9407291968D20364B0D804E3CA7B8B11A9822DB3809A95A3E086374B2D4E9812F44882A19DF53C23C7134702AB499958CD192CDD2E3D12D44494596F449","orcidId":"0000-0002-3948-1097","documentHash":"7a8cbb94-e357-4660-a972-b1551afd1803"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bałazy","uuid":"C51DDFE81021C9BDBC94153AD8673AFD2340612B4497F5A9F2274D9139AFED119910BAA163A0541469885863BF7C0C0E6D060776390EAF18AF21DE0EBF0C72D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-3151","documentHash":"41dd14b2-f8d5-4ddc-af2a-0b0fd60b21c6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d29","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Pękala-Safińska","uuid":"C20069D66531D7CBD28DB4AE6C92C6ADF940091E294B58C26A5C16C6FB3D9C209FE525D8B212160A92C54C26958413924CB703280A0167C5439AFEC9A001295C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5515-8329","documentHash":"22bf7090-4f23-4135-a753-8016e4d98946"},{"objectId":"5e709333878c28a0473a4c16","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Psuty","uuid":"627C6B61EFEA530D50B9152FA64FF8F48B4D9655A39A153FF5F9D077BF0E6F97A5664F461957DF15B30663024886CDBEFD462D284EC6FDEB22145BFAFE9FB3DB","orcidId":"0000-0002-3120-4503","documentHash":"13e3e277-a4a7-47e0-9e17-141eb41272aa"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399418","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pawlak","uuid":"BADF07F646D2E39465604548C9CF7CFECDD6BED44F85DA8956D6B9C5FF5C3200D2FE20E0418A5D2677B39952CC4E1796512FE0FFC2524811D0911E23620FECF7","orcidId":"0000-0002-4684-9670","documentHash":"538b3fe2-f5c8-4204-96b5-4fb8d15e4172"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-20","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"643d277a409707219a4e60b6","doi":"10.24425/pjvs.2023.145017","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/126670/PDF/17%20_%20Nadolna-Altyn.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Microbiological studies of the round goby ( Neogobius melanostomus) from the Puck Bay, southern Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In summer 2017 numerous dead round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) and individuals covered with white coating were observed in the Puck Bay.

This study investigated the behaviour of several pharmaceuticals in the rocky-bottom, macrobenthic food web in the coastal zone of Isfjorden (western Spitsbergen) using stable isotope analyses (SIA) coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Across 16 macroalgal and invertebrate species the highest average concentration was measured for ciprofloxacin (CIP) (on average 60.3 ng g−1 dw) followed by paracetamol (PCT) (51.3 ng g−1 dw) and nicotine (NIC) (37.8 ng g−1 dw). The biomagnification potential was assessed for six target compounds of 13 analytes detected that were quantified with a frequency > 50 % in biological samples. The trophic magnification factor (TMF) ranged between 0.3 and 2.8, and was significant for NIC and CIP. TMF < 1.0 for NIC (0.3; confidence interval, CI 0.1–0.5) indicated that the compound does not accumulate with trophic position. The dilution of pharmaceutical residues in the food web may result from limited intake with dietary route, poor assimilation efficiency and high biotransformation rates in benthic invertebrates. TMF for CIP (2.8, CI 1.2–6.4) suggests trophic magnification, a phenomenon observed previously for several antibiotics in freshwater food webs. Trophic transfer therefore plays a role in controlling concentration of CIP in the Arctic benthic communities and should be considered in environmental risk assessment. Biomagnification potential of diclofenac (DIC; 0.9, CI 0.5–1.7), carbamazepine (CBZ; 0.4, CI 0.1–2.1), caffeine (CAF; 0.9, CI 0.5–1.9) and PCT (1.3, CI 0.7–2.7) was not evident due to large 95 % confidence of their TMFs. This study provides the first evidence of drug bioaccumulation in the Arctic food web and indicates that behaviour of pharmaceuticals varies among target compounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677e6981fdbe831a3837a07c","5e70924f878c28a047393774","5e7093d1878c28a0473b1443"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a651e","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"909","pagesFromTo":"1-11","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393774","5e7093d1878c28a0473b1443","677e6981fdbe831a3837a07c","677e6981fdbe831a3837a07d","677e6981fdbe831a3837a07e","5e709347878c28a0473a651e","5e70942d878c28a0473b7b18","677e6981fdbe831a3837a081","677e6981fdbe831a3837a082"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coastal zone","stable isotopes","European Arctic","trophic transfer","macrobenthos","pharmaceuticals"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061024497"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61a83db87523402fabe26d33","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jędruch","uuid":"47E8A53FA888557E38D24349865DB78266E096B906D832F18A31D0956EF5AB2DEFC230E5F038A2E9DF684775A07820AC0E9E2E415363DAEE2DC390F1E0C189A0","documentHash":"76d3dc46-c415-45d5-8ca7-ead44b4bbabf"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a653d","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Bełdowski","uuid":"6324C413899A7D55052C03674F85929919743CC2BC68B3E5B4AAA45F79E47792E7A3EC3C7CC1F75C0C115EC7B074EE3974D7F11A989D51502B88F15260A2C634","orcidId":"0000-0002-2891-1901","documentHash":"2d9f6169-3657-4886-b7c4-74b2ba5045de"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c40","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bełdowska","uuid":"A48A6F773BFCA51AAD00108933899A8CFB97306BA86E77BD6E1C2C3F173916EEFDD6A8FF0C1B6F2D169D5F34208E9524FF62E120B68B09F8575EE3C707A1EBBC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3585-9283","documentHash":"38090cfb-a306-49ce-a82e-524d28ca1caf"}],"objectId":"67655dc0fdbe837ab159e27d","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116363","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2024.116363","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Mercury dynamics at the base of the pelagic food web of the Gulf of Gdańsk, southern Baltic Sea","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Planktonic organisms, which have direct contact with water, serve as the entry point for mercury (Hg), into the marine food web, impacting its levels in higher organisms, including fish, mammals, and humans who consume seafood.

Phytoplankton Hg levels were primarily influenced by its concentrations in water, while Hg concentrations in zooplankton resulted from dietary exposure through suspended particulate matter and phytoplankton consumption. Hg uptake by planktonic organisms, particularly phytoplankton, was highly efficient, with Hg concentrations four orders of magnitude higher than those in the surrounding water.

Połączyliśmy te dane z danymi wcześniej opublikowanymi, docierając w ten sposób do 981 gatunków. Zastosowaliśmy modele liniowe (LM), uogólnione modele liniowe (GLM) i filogenetyczne uogólnione modele najmniejszych kwadratów (PGLS), aby zbadać wpływ temperatury, zasolenia, głębokości i historii filogenetycznej na mineralogię u prawie 1000 gatunków mszywiołów cheilostomowych.\r\nWyniki: Mszywioły cheilostomowe znacznie różnią się składem mineralnym szkieletu: w naszym zbiorze danych 65% gatunków miało szkielety wyłącznie kalcytowe, 15% wyłącznie aragonitowe, a 20% wykazało mineralogię mieszaną (tj. kalcytowo-aragonitową). Temperatura była dominującym czynnikiem środowiskowym wpływającym na mineralogię szkieletu mszywiołów i odpowiadała za 20% jego zmienności pomiędzy gatunkami, gdy nie bierze się pod uwagę pokrewieństwa filogenetycznego. Mszywioły występujące w niższych szerokościach geograficznych, charakteryzujących się wyższą temperaturą wody morskiej, miały wyższe stężenie aragonitu. Uwzględniając strukturę filogenetyczną na podzbiorze 87 gatunków, dla których mieliśmy informacje topologiczne, 40% zaobserwowanej zmienności mineralogicznej można było przypisać współczesnej temperaturze. Natomiast głębokość i zasolenie odgrywały mniejszą rolę, wyjaśniając mniej niż 1% zmienności mineralogicznej każdy.\r\nGłówne wnioski: Badanie to podkreśla wpływ historii ewolucji na zmienność mineralogiczną organizmów kalcyfikujących, nawet jeśli można wykazać, że pojedynczy czynnik środowiskowy (temperatura) wyjaśnia znaczną część tej zmienności. W konfrontacji ze zmieniającą się temperaturą organizmy kalcyfikujące, takie jak mszywioły, prawdopodobnie zareagują na różne sposoby, w zależności od gatunku, biorąc pod uwagę ich pokrewieństwo filogenetyczne i warunki zewnętrzne, jakie spotykają."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aim: Quantify the contribution of environmental factors (water temperature, salinity and depth) and evolutionary history to varied skeletal mineralogy in calcifying marine organisms.\r\nLocation: Global Ocean.\r\nTime period: Present.\r\nMajor taxa studied: Order: Cheilostomatida; Phylum: Bryozoa.\r\nMethods: We employed X-ray diffraction (XRD) to analyse the skeletal mineral composition of 872 individual colonies, representing 437 bryozoan species, in terms of calcite/aragonite ratios. We integrated these data with equivalent published data, thus reaching 981 species, and applied linear models (LMs), generalized linear models (GLMs) and phylogenetic generalized least squares models (PGLSs) to investigate the influences of temperature, salinity, depth and phylogenetic history on the mineralogy of nearly 1000 cheilostome bryozoan species.\r\nResults: Cheilostome bryozoans vary considerably in their skeletal mineral composition: in our dataset 65% of the species possess purely calcite skeletons, 15% exclusively employ aragonite and 20% exhibit mixed (i.e. calcite and aragonite) mineralogies. Temperature is the predominant measured environmental factor influencing bryozoan skeletal mineralogy, accounting for 20% of its variability across species, when phylogenetic relatedness is unaccounted for. Bryozoans in lower latitudes, characterized by higher seawater temperatures, have higher aragonite concentrations. By accounting for phylogenetic structure using a subset of 87 species for which we have topological information, 40% of the observed mineralogical variability could be attributed to present-day temperature. In contrast, depth and salinity played minor roles, explaining less than 1% of the mineralogical variation each.\r\nMain conclusions: This study emphasizes the influence of evolutionary history on the mineralogical variability of calcifying organisms, even when it can be shown that a single environmental factor (temperature) explains a substantial amount of this variability. When confronted with changing temperature, calcifiers such as bryozoans are likely to respond in diverse ways, depending on the species, given their phylogenetic relatedness and the external conditions they meet."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc624","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709467878c28a0473bc59b","5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e70929e878c28a047399408"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1-18","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709469878c28a0473bc624","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13","677e6975fdbe831a38379eac","5e709467878c28a0473bc59b","677e6975fdbe831a38379eae","677e6975fdbe831a38379eaf","5e70929e878c28a047399408","677e6975fdbe831a38379eb1","677e6975fdbe831a38379eb2","677e6975fdbe831a38379eb3","677e6975fdbe831a38379eb4","677e6975fdbe831a38379eb5","677e6975fdbe831a38379eb6","677e6975fdbe831a38379eb7","677e6975fdbe831a38379eb8","677e6975fdbe831a38379eb9","677e6975fdbe831a38379eba","677e6975fdbe831a38379ebb","677e6975fdbe831a38379ebc","677e6975fdbe831a38379ebd","677e6975fdbe831a38379ebe","677e6975fdbe831a38379ebf","677e6975fdbe831a38379ec0","677e6975fdbe831a38379ec1","677e6975fdbe831a38379ec2","677e6975fdbe831a38379ec3","677e6975fdbe831a38379ec4","5e709347878c28a0473a6522"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e51","mniswId":"7250","title":"Global Ecology and Biogeography","issn":"1466-822X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"726c6de1-0e43-4d16-9ef1-faaaac312dbd"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["organizmy kalcyfikujące","szkielet","kalcyt","morskie bezkręgowce","aragonit","biomineralizacja","filogeneza"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["skeleton","biomineralization","aragonite","calcifiers","phylogeny","calcite","marine invertebrates"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061024518"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677e696ffdbe831a38379de5","name":"Donata","lastName":"Overlingė","documentHash":"1470ddeb-157e-40f5-b395-09149e704aa6"},{"objectId":"602f967f9543c7410626f647","name":"Robert","lastName":"Konkel","uuid":"3B854E92CEDE8E8356AADECC65794087D4CE477CB8F8ED6AA933E6EB2B20087DDAF561EE349B687BF54605806C27509A29214AF17E3174EF35485530E49755BB","documentHash":"45c1845a-3cc6-4c82-a93f-dcc3f0a87ec7"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b531d","name":"Marta","lastName":"Cegłowska","uuid":"89FE0790F5C9D9E8F0260FF7B9232D603066BED265D2DA543EBC02B4A61C62B11FD24340296284E0CC2F71D75AE72065559F3C82C1C50598882121E3853911FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6601-5825","documentHash":"411af4a6-4468-4760-bcca-7323b99db6ce"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739376e","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Mazur-Marzec","uuid":"2852F5647EE385956A11FD39CEA425EFF527786F3E1EC88F4B48FD89DEBB05D21128545C3FF7B9D04705B55E13F3DD254507B596D8D439373A1BFE5D7F9FEDBF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6526-4045","documentHash":"79af155b-3304-43df-b504-96adcf915d45"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"673c57d4fdbe831a0207e2f8","doi":"10.3390/md22110506","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Aeruginosin 525 (AER525) from cyanobacterium Aphanizomenon sp.

They have been found in Microcystis, Nodularia spumigena, Oscillatoria/Plantothrix, and Nostoc. The presence of AER in Aphanizomenon isolated from the Curonian Lagoon was reported for the first time in our previous work. Here, the structure of aeruginosin 525 (AER525), isolated from Aphanizomenon sp. KUCC C2, was characterised based on high-resolution mass spectrometry. This new AER variant shows potent activity against thrombin. It also inhibits trypsin and carboxypeptidase A but has no effect on elastase and chymotrypsin. In terms of the N-terminal residue and biological activity, AER525 displaces some similarity to dysinosins, which belongs to the most potent inhibitors of thrombin among AERs. The findings underline the potential of AER525 as a new anticoagulant agent."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a04739376e","602f967f9543c7410626f647"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b531d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-11","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f967f9543c7410626f647","5e70924f878c28a04739376e","677e696ffdbe831a38379de5","5e709408878c28a0473b531d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d67","mniswId":"13910","title":"Marine Drugs","issn":"1660-3397","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"d344c631-ab0f-4cf6-bd9a-cea727af08a9"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["high-resolution mass spectroscopy","bioactive peptides","enzyme inhibition"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061024537"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a104bfdbe831aedcab56e","name":"Luca","lastName":"Ferrero","documentHash":"cb90a5f4-09e6-4f19-b593-a1abc2349174"},{"objectId":"679a104bfdbe831aedcab56d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Petelski","documentHash":"8421536d-0587-4d5c-a17c-005fdb9d3b61"},{"objectId":"679a104bfdbe831aedcab56b","name":"Matthew","lastName":"Salter","documentHash":"fb7a274a-856e-454a-ad4e-d4d8c3582aa8"},{"objectId":"679a104bfdbe831aedcab56a","name":"E.

Measured total SSA fluxes varied between 8.9 × 103 ± 6.8 × 105 m−2 s−1 for the Baltic Sea and 1.0 × 104 ± 105 m−2 s−1 for the Atlantic Ocean. The analysis uncovered a significant decrease (by a factor of 2.2 in the wind speed range of 10.5–14.5 m s−1) in SSA fluxes, with chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration higher than 3.5 mg m−3 in the Baltic Sea area. We found statistically significant correlations for both regions of interest between SSA fluxes and various environmental factors, including wind speed, wind acceleration, wave age, significant wave height, and wave Reynolds number. Our findings indicate that higher chl a concentrations are associated with reduced SSA fluxes at higher wind speeds in the Baltic Sea, while the influence of wave age showed higher aerosol emissions in the Baltic Sea for younger waves compared to the Atlantic Ocean. These insights underscore the complex interplay between biological activity and physical dynamics in regulating SSA emissions. Additionally, in both measurement regions, we observed weak correlations between SSA fluxes and air and water temperature and between SSA fluxes and atmospheric stability. Comparing the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic, we noted distinct emission behaviors, with higher emissions in the Baltic Sea at low wave age values compared to the Atlantic Ocean. This study represents the first comparative analysis of SSA flux measurements using the same methodology in these contrasting marine environments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["617a0b297523400564d4b4c1","5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","5e709347878c28a0473a6530","5e709328878c28a0473a3cea","5e709489878c28a0473bf343","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","5e709347878c28a0473a6516"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"11227-11253","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","679a104bfdbe831aedcab568","679a104bfdbe831aedcab569","679a104bfdbe831aedcab56a","679a104bfdbe831aedcab56b","5e709489878c28a0473bf377","5e709489878c28a0473bf343","5e709328878c28a0473a3cea","5e709347878c28a0473a6530","617a0b297523400564d4b4c1","679a104bfdbe831aedcab56d","679a104bfdbe831aedcab56e","5e709347878c28a0473a6516"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724d","mniswId":"2026","title":"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","issn":"1680-7316","eissn":"1680-7324","documentHash":"767f0fa0-a1ba-4887-b209-a40652902fe4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a104bfdbe831aedcab567","year":"2024","volume":"24","number":"19","documentHash":"2423827d-0783-4b7b-9e69-10ef4e786bed"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661154"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f3d7e3fdbe8326af95abc4","name":"Koh Siang","lastName":"Tan","documentHash":"31b2dd4b-4e8f-4a93-9c81-18f63c9f66fb"},{"objectId":"66f3d7e3fdbe8326af95abc3","name":"Mattia","lastName":"Greco","documentHash":"217079da-258a-4da7-bbfa-72f34b55e005"},{"objectId":"66f3d7e3fdbe8326af95abc1","name":"Inès","lastName":"Barrenechea Angeles","documentHash":"3af29a49-177a-49e0-b25a-0a5306a127a5"},{"objectId":"6615f9a940e3ff2524a62632","name":"NGOC","lastName":"Nguyen","uuid":"AA1E5844A4E7FC87DBE8CFF0663AFCB5D6C6EA4B715251671DC581BE467D5E3924D0C059F461F1E6421EDF0333640662C3D4B429D6F0F8B0805FB3C9E47E4300","documentHash":"219277c1-338f-4bd3-b3c0-9b37d1278722"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"2DDE7AE92A999985DD6A8554077E67ABD4FBCA61593C1C776B4CDC2C2BF29CB7363D36CC78C8A0CAF10F1504395CF60F53DF6410D42BE7A7A054A95AA3A44D3D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2421-388X","documentHash":"736ab0c4-f7d7-4ae3-ad10-0b9ed0b679c9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66f3d7e3fdbe8326af95abc0","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0298440","publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0298440","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Assigning the unassigned: A signature-based classification of rDNA metabarcodes reveals new deep-sea diversity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Environmental DNA metabarcoding reveals a vast genetic diversity of marine eukaryotes. Yet, most of the metabarcoding data remain unassigned due to the paucity of reference databases. This is particularly true for the deep-sea meiofauna and eukaryotic microbiota, whose hidden diversity is largely unexplored. Here, we tackle this issue by using unique DNA signatures to classify unknown metabarcodes assigned to deep-sea foraminifera. We analyzed metabarcoding data obtained from 311 deep-sea sediment samples collected in the Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone, an area of potential polymetallic nodule exploitation in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Using the signatures designed in the 37F hypervariable region of the 18S rRNA gene, we were able to classify 802 unassigned metabarcodes into 61 novel lineages, which have been placed in 27 phylogenetic clades. The comparison of new lineages with other foraminiferal datasets shows that most novel lineages are widely distributed in the deep sea. Five lineages are also present in the shallow-water datasets; however, phylogenetic analysis of these lineages separates deep-sea and shallow-water metabarcodes except in one case. While the signature-based classification does not solve the problem of gaps in reference databases, this taxonomy-free approach provides insight into the distribution and ecology of deep-sea species represented by unassigned metabarcodes, which could be useful in future applications of metabarcoding for environmental monitoring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii

The Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) has been\nactively grappling with how to build such trust: provision of demonstrably independent assessments\nof the quality of products, which was deemed an important element in such trust-building processes.\nC3S provides access to essential climate variables (ECVs) from multiple sources to a broad set of\nusers ranging from scientists to private companies and decision-makers. Here we outline the approach\nundertaken to coherently assess the quality of a suite of observation- and reanalysis-based ECV products\ncovering the atmosphere, ocean, land, and cryosphere. The assessment is based on four pillars: basic\ndata checks, maturity of the datasets, fitness for purpose (scientific use cases and climate studies), and\nguidance to users. It is undertaken independently by scientific experts and presented alongside the\ndatasets in a fully traceable, replicable, and transparent manner. The methodology deployed is detailed,\nand example assessments are given. These independent scientific quality assessments are intended\nto guide users to ensure they use tools and datasets that are fit for purpose to answer their specific\nneeds rather than simply use the first product they alight on. This is the first such effort to develop and\napply an assessment framework consistently to all ECVs. Lessons learned and future perspectives are\noutlined to potentially improve future assessment activities and thus climate services."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b8878c28a0473c272c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"103","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"E2032-E2049","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6334197a4097070fbdd59b38","6334197a4097070fbdd59b39","6334197a4097070fbdd59b3a","6334197a4097070fbdd59b3b","6334197a4097070fbdd59b3c","6334197a4097070fbdd59b3d","6334197a4097070fbdd59b3e","6334197a4097070fbdd59b3f","6334197a4097070fbdd59b40","6334197a4097070fbdd59b41","6334197a4097070fbdd59b42","6334197a4097070fbdd59b43","6334197a4097070fbdd59b44","6334197a4097070fbdd59b45","6334197a4097070fbdd59b46","6334197a4097070fbdd59b47","6334197a4097070fbdd59b48","6334197a4097070fbdd59b49","6334197a4097070fbdd59b4a","6334197a4097070fbdd59b4b","6334197a4097070fbdd59b4c","6334197a4097070fbdd59b4d","6334197a4097070fbdd59b4e","6334197a4097070fbdd59b4f","6334197a4097070fbdd59b50","6334197a4097070fbdd59b51","6334197a4097070fbdd59b52","6334197a4097070fbdd59b53","6334197a4097070fbdd59b54","6334197a4097070fbdd59b55","6334197a4097070fbdd59b56","5e7094b8878c28a0473c272c","6334197a4097070fbdd59b57","6334197a4097070fbdd59b58","6334197a4097070fbdd59b59","6334197a4097070fbdd59b5a","6334197a4097070fbdd59b5b","6334197a4097070fbdd59b5c","6334197a4097070fbdd59b5d","6334197a4097070fbdd59b5e","6334197a4097070fbdd59b5f","6334197a4097070fbdd59b60","6334197a4097070fbdd59b61","6334197a4097070fbdd59b62","6334197a4097070fbdd59b63","6334197a4097070fbdd59b64"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454774a3","mniswId":"2945","title":"Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society","issn":"0003-0007","eissn":"1520-0477","documentHash":"1b2c1448-e4e2-4987-ba45-3d7df024b97a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6334197a4097070fbdd59b37","year":"2022","documentHash":"8eb2d1d0-da95-4425-8a7f-b4181b776261"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Climate change","Climate records","Quality assurance/control","Satellite observations","Reanalysis data","Climate services"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654658054"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"636a52814097073ba718e7d7","name":"M.","lastName":"Reigstad","documentHash":"96ab8926-d50d-4ec1-80be-bf16435fdf36"},{"objectId":"636a52814097073ba718e7d6","name":"K.

To investigate the impact of these ongoing changes on annual particle export, two moorings with sequential sediment traps were deployed in ice-free and seasonally ice-covered waters on the shelf north (NSv) and east (ESv) of Svalbard, collecting sinking particles nearly continuously from October 2017 to October 2018. Vertical export of particulate organic carbon (POC), total particulate matter (TPM), planktonic protists, chlorophyll a, and zooplankton fecal pellets were measured, and swimmers were quantified and identified. Combined with sensor data from the moorings, these time-series measurements provided a first assessment of the factors influencing particle export in this region of the Arctic Ocean. Higher annual TPM and POC fluxes at the ice-free NSv site were primarily driven by the advection of AW, higher grazing by large copepods, and a wind-induced mixing event during winter. Higher diatom fluxes were observed during spring in the presence of sea ice at the ESv site. Along with sea ice cover, regional differences in AW advection and the seasonal presence of grazers played a prominent role in the biological carbon pump along the continental shelf off Svalbard."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86eb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"127","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"e2022JC018897","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["636a52814097073ba718e7cf","636a52814097073ba718e7d0","636a52814097073ba718e7d1","636a52814097073ba718e7d2","636a52814097073ba718e7d3","636a52814097073ba718e7d4","636a52814097073ba718e7d5","636a52814097073ba718e7d6","5e709439878c28a0473b86eb","636a52814097073ba718e7d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c849","mniswId":"11229","title":"JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS","issn":"2169-9275","eissn":"2169-9291","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"59b92342-e5c4-40f2-9c0e-da48d6ebce72"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636a52814097073ba718e7ce","year":"2022","volume":"127","number":"10","documentHash":"c9be192f-a0a0-4fe1-a2b9-6a156a7215ec"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sea ice melt led to higher springtime and annual diatom fluxes at the seasonally ice-covered site","Aside from algal fluxes, annual particle fluxes were higher at the ice-free site","Atlantic water advection, zooplankton grazing, wind-induced mixing, and resuspension contributed to the higher fluxes at the ice-free site"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654661850"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"649bd0384097071cb9022cb6","name":"B.","lastName":"de Young","documentHash":"8d8dc611-08c0-404d-a787-b6da38edbc92"},{"objectId":"649bd0384097071cb9022cb5","name":"N.","lastName":"von Oppeln-Bronikowski","documentHash":"7360bf59-e13d-427b-a842-fcf3035007c2"},{"objectId":"649bd0384097071cb9022cb4","name":"E.","lastName":"Frajka-Williams","documentHash":"0acbdf55-7d81-4b54-b1ef-e310a54b4a9d"},{"objectId":"649bd0384097071cb9022cb3","name":"Louis","lastName":"Clément","documentHash":"b104c7bf-b0a4-44ee-8179-4ce8948a3bbf"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc63a","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Goszczko","uuid":"7F19340DDF540F6AF7945CF6383F7C1E9A06C28E4BA74C12F06997956B1E5084F8FAEEA2B8697093BCDB3A06976401F0557814C4DA0E346719A0A560A12A8F7A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5719-5860","documentHash":"bcfc94ad-06b6-4a04-b934-617749c29db1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-09","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"649bd0384097071cb9022cb1","doi":"10.1175/jpo-d-22-0178.1","publicUri":"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/aop/JPO-D-22-0178.1/JPO-D-22-0178.1.xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cessation of Labrador Sea Convection triggered by distinct fresh and warm (Sub)mesoscale Flows","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"By ventilating the deep ocean, deep convection in the Labrador Sea plays a crucial role in the climate system.

At the convection boundaries, buoyant intrusions–including eddies and filaments–instead of atmospheric warming primarily trigger restratification by bringing buoyancy with a comparable contribution from either fresh or warm intrusions. At the edges of these intrusions, submesoscale instabilities, such as symmetric instabilities and mixed-layer baroclinic instabilities, seem to contribute to the decay of the intrusions. In winter, enhanced lateral buoyancy gradients are correlated with strong destabilising surface heat fluxes and along-front winds. Consequently, winter atmospheric conditions and buoyant intrusions participate in halting convection by triggering restratification while surface fluxes are still destratifying. This study reveals freshwater anomalies in a narrow area offshore of the Labrador Current and near the convective region; this area has received less attention than the more eddy-rich West Greenland Current, but is a potential source of freshwater in closer proximity to the region of deep convection. Freshwater fluxes from the Arctic and Greenland are expected to increase under a changing climate, and our findings suggest that they may play an active role in the restratification of deep convection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc63a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1959–1977","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["649bd0384097071cb9022cb3","649bd0384097071cb9022cb4","649bd0384097071cb9022cb5","5e709469878c28a0473bc63a","649bd0384097071cb9022cb6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a4","mniswId":"12289","title":"JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY","issn":"0022-3670","documentHash":"262d650e-20c6-40c0-8a6c-0b4170a581eb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649bd0384097071cb9022cb2","year":"2023","documentHash":"293ae4ce-624b-46a1-87f4-e0c3888c645f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654713875"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5efff22e7523404d1000eb0a","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Dybowski","uuid":"44456DCF7D40E94D0FCE26CF34A563C163D0D5A3505B9C65B35D18B0274C07EDB22D88A27478304A5BBAD40962598E80410A2F835A227AE3F94627A54AC4818D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6878-8250","documentHash":"59e8156c-f9d8-46c5-aa6f-948bebe96e8f"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655a","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Rak","uuid":"93CA76011F426FF61AEABACB4C39A1FCEA26445E7E566D8189103F6DE570DC61CF4574AAD54D873D6D6610ECF941ED23F01E28B96CB7EAC8DE7E052EB1E4F454","orcidId":"0000-0002-3432-1924","documentHash":"ee738ad1-4418-4fff-8cfc-0fe52785bb5c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Janecki","uuid":"0124EB42B550538B6EEEBE8AD570F2C5891BD81F4B2BE5A01771E72F4E699EC92BD4BBF74E613E973495B437D8B01EC430475EE98F9B81A06171565FE7E04415","orcidId":"0000-0002-8784-2862","documentHash":"c4d146e1-e71b-4582-b065-e8a216de65a8"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6519","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Dzierzbicka-Głowacka","uuid":"FDC01B0A03DACF40B86B8C76A6A5733A190D116F34DE41E026356499D64643AF86AFC24DF2A76B418A86F7BD2FBFE787F2EDEC5EF089D54B41C4018FFF1CD7CE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6151-2390","documentHash":"04fde4ef-26c2-4f72-87ad-b9283d779642"}],"objectId":"634534674097077ad4d80f9f","doi":"10.1175/jpo-d-22-0008.1","publicUri":"https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/52/9/JPO-D-22-0008.1.xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A New Method for Thermocline and Halocline Depth Determination at Shallow Seas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper introduces a new method for finding the top of thermocline (TTD) and halocline (THD) depths that may become a powerful tool for applications in shallow marine basins around the world.

The method has been calibrated using an extensive set of data from the ecohydrodynamic model EcoFish. As a result of the calibration, the values of the input parameters that allowed the correct determination of TTD and THD were established. It was confirmed by the validation carried out on the in situ profiles collected by the research vessel S/Y Oceania during statutory cruises in the southern Baltic Sea.

To address some of these questions, we use the fully-coupled, high-resolution Regional Arctic System Model to simulate Arctic marine biogeochemistry over a 30-year period. Our results demonstrate the presence of extensive under-ice phytoplankton growth in the western Arctic (WA) in summer. In addition, similar growth, yet of lower magnitude, occurs annually in the eastern Arctic (EA). We investigate the critical levels of nitrate concentration and photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) that are necessary for under-ice phytoplankton growth to occur. Our results show that while the majority of ice-covered Arctic waters have sufficient surface nitrate levels to sustain growth, PAR reaching the ocean surface through the sea ice in early summer only exceeds critical levels in the WA. We therefore conclude that the EA high chlorophyll-a concentrations shown in our simulations did not develop under sea ice, but were instead, at least in part, formed in open waters upstream and

possible to measure with instruments deployed in situ. Compared to DOC, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption spectroscopy is an easy-to-measure, relatively quick and cost-effective approach which is often closely related to DOC concentrations in water samples. Here we present an algorithm based on quantitative and qualitative metrics of CDOM to provide DOC estimates derived from a Pan-Arctic data set (n = 3,302) spanning rivers to deep ocean, with DOC ranging between 31 and 1,958 μM. The algorithm provided robust DOC estimates (r2 = 0.94; p < 0.0001) and could reproduce DOC profiles and mixing plots across different locations in the Arctic Ocean. Besides its simplicity, this method is capable of capturing the extremely broad range of DOC within the strong gradients observed between Arctic riverine and marine systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a652f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"50","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"e2023GL105028","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["654b777c4097073103402f12","654b777c4097073103402f13","654b777c4097073103402f14","5e709347878c28a0473a652f","654b777c4097073103402f15"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e1d","mniswId":"7140","title":"Geophysical Research Letters","issn":"0094-8276","eissn":"1944-8007","documentHash":"63368470-de61-44de-ab6b-31ac3c585da7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"654b777c4097073103402f11","year":"2023","volume":"50","number":"21","documentHash":"4d74f9cc-03aa-4967-beab-57df1eaf743a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654881957"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c97a","name":"Isaac R.","lastName":"Santos","documentHash":"0599402b-f6c4-47c9-98e1-706a16e84180"},{"objectId":"66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c979","name":"Ina","lastName":"Ulber","documentHash":"30b294bb-900b-45a7-994b-61bb3b277737"},{"objectId":"66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c978","name":"Thorsten","lastName":"Dittmar","documentHash":"82d037a0-0f1d-4509-a1ed-73d065c0aebe"},{"objectId":"66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c977","name":"Angel","lastName":"Ruiz‐Angulo","documentHash":"2935f21d-6730-4b09-b660-852c2a9f4543"},{"objectId":"66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c976","name":"Tristan","lastName":"McKenzie","documentHash":"10cb6812-94e6-413a-b1a8-83432a3f5746"},{"objectId":"66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c975","name":"Linnea","lastName":"Henriksson","documentHash":"12f54b74-608a-4350-b6bd-f4e762eaebbb"},{"objectId":"66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c974","name":"Claudia","lastName":"Majtényi‐Hill","documentHash":"33555bd8-f8db-442d-8116-7c2b498063e7"},{"objectId":"66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c973","name":"Alex","lastName":"Cabral","documentHash":"7c7c8da5-8e86-44dd-9326-5ab54930ce9c"},{"objectId":"66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c972","name":"Yvonne Y.

Most tidewater glaciers are rapidly retreating, but little is known about how glacial melting modifies coastal biogeochemical cycles. Here, we investigate carbonate and nutrient dynamics and fluxes in an expanding proglacial tidal lagoon connected to Europe's largest glacier in Iceland (Vatnajökull). The lagoon N:P:Si ratios (2:1:30) imply a system deficient in nitrogen. The large variations in the freshwater endmembers highlighted the complexity of resolving sources and transformations. The lagoon acted as a sink of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Floating chamber incubations revealed a CO2 uptake of 26 ± 15 mmol m−2 d−1. Lagoon waters near the glacier had a 170% higher CO2 uptake than near the lagoon mouth, likely driven by primary production stimulated by nitrogen-rich bottom water upwelling. The lateral DIC and total alkalinity (TA) flux rates (outwelling) from the lagoon to the ocean were −1.5 ± 0.1 (export to ocean) and 23 ± 5 mmol m−2 d−1 (import into the lagoon) respectively. All samples were undersaturated with respect to aragonite due to glacial meltwater dilution of TA and CO2 uptake. This implies dilution of oceanic alkalinity, lowering the nearshore buffering capacity against ocean acidification."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"129","issue":"6","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c971","66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c972","66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c973","66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c974","66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c975","66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c976","66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c977","5e70941c878c28a0473b66a7","66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c978","66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c979","66f3e68cfdbe8326af96c97a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c847","mniswId":"11227","title":"Journal of Geophysical Research.

study is the first assessment of a fjord Ecological Quality Status (EcoQS) by comparing both the traditional morphology-based and emerging metabarcoding techniques in benthic foraminifera. For this, we focus on historically polluted Idefjord on the Swedish Norwegian border, which has experienced high effluent load from pulp and paper mill for almost a century. Based on our results, the morphological data was more sensitive to “naturally stressed” conditions, like course sediments and cascading water inflows at fjord sills. Generally, both data sets report congruous responses in the EcoQS and benthic foraminiferal assemblages to environmental stress factors, showing highest diversity at the coastal reference station and the outer fjord, with a diversity decline in proximity of industrial facilities and at the most oxygen depleted sites in the inner fjord. Genetic methods tend to overestimate EcoQS at highly anoxic sites probably due to a presence of dormant propagules or extraorganismal DNA, emphasizing a need for cross-correlation with morphological methods to validate EcoQS assessment in such conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"129","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-20","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679ca0befdbe830b35f9028e","679ca0befdbe830b35f9028f","679ca0befdbe830b35f90290","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d","679ca0befdbe830b35f90291","679ca0befdbe830b35f90292","679ca0befdbe830b35f90293"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c847","mniswId":"11227","title":"Journal of Geophysical Research-Biogeosciences","issn":"2169-8953","eissn":"2169-8961","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"daeeb014-5fd0-49cd-98a3-3def9cda1fd9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679ca0befdbe830b35f9028d","year":"2024","volume":"129","number":"12","documentHash":"bff7fe85-c93e-40c6-8d27-33e85874bb0d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654954525"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5efff22e7523404d1000eb0a","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Dybowski","uuid":"44456DCF7D40E94D0FCE26CF34A563C163D0D5A3505B9C65B35D18B0274C07EDB22D88A27478304A5BBAD40962598E80410A2F835A227AE3F94627A54AC4818D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6878-8250","documentHash":"59e8156c-f9d8-46c5-aa6f-948bebe96e8f"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf364","name":"Artur","lastName":"Nowicki","uuid":"1C3C548A5E41558A22752BCA98EF8EC9398A558F37A436EEDDB2D3982DE95F95AA7ECADF312BCCCFF2DC992128F39EB6A43454E2BB3379ADBCF54504957EAC23","orcidId":"0000-0003-3801-8137","documentHash":"59be7831-5171-4481-b044-573e7a3edd4e"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a654f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Janecki","uuid":"0124EB42B550538B6EEEBE8AD570F2C5891BD81F4B2BE5A01771E72F4E699EC92BD4BBF74E613E973495B437D8B01EC430475EE98F9B81A06171565FE7E04415","orcidId":"0000-0002-8784-2862","documentHash":"c4d146e1-e71b-4582-b065-e8a216de65a8"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6519","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Dzierzbicka-Głowacka","uuid":"FDC01B0A03DACF40B86B8C76A6A5733A190D116F34DE41E026356499D64643AF86AFC24DF2A76B418A86F7BD2FBFE787F2EDEC5EF089D54B41C4018FFF1CD7CE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6151-2390","documentHash":"04fde4ef-26c2-4f72-87ad-b9283d779642"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2025},"objectId":"67b31c6ffdbe83707bf58116","doi":"10.5697/cukw4719","publicUri":"https://oceanologia.eu/library/67_1/PDF/Dzierzb-G.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Digital Information System for the Polish Marine Areas - Modelling of Structures and Dynamics of Physical Processes in the Southern Baltic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Researching the dynamic environment of the Baltic Sea requires an interdisciplinary approach, with numerical models\nand computer simulations becoming essential tools. The 3D CEMBS-PolSEA ecosystem model, developed at the\nInstitute of Oceanology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, aims to determine the basic hydrodynamic parameters of the\nsouthern Baltic Sea. The CSI-POM service (Digital Information System on the Environment of Polish Marine Areas)\nconsists of new tools for studying the structures, dynamics, and variability of physical processes in the southern Baltic.\nThe service includes tools for determining the thermocline, halocline, and pycnocline, conducting spatio-temporal\nanalysis of water column structure, automatic detection of vortices, testing water mass inertia under forecasted wind\nforces, and automatic detection of upwelling currents. The novelty of this work lies in the development of tools\nfor studying the dynamics of the structure and variability of physical processes in the southern Baltic Sea. These\ninnovative techniques support scientists, the maritime community, and regulatory bodies by providing detailed insights\ninto local phenomena such as vortex formation, water mixing. The tools are implemented on the project server and the\nTryton+ supercomputer, enabling high temporal and spatial resolution results. The CSI-POM system’s operational\nmode ensures access to the latest model results, with real-time and forecasted data. This enhances understanding and\nforecasting capabilities, informing about the current state of the environment and potential threats in the open sea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a654f","5efff22e7523404d1000eb0a","5e709489878c28a0473bf364","5e709347878c28a0473a6519"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"67","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6519","5efff22e7523404d1000eb0a","5e709347878c28a0473a654f","5e709489878c28a0473bf364"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67b31b93fdbe83707bf57c94","year":"2025","volume":"67","number":"1","documentHash":"251f767e-3b85-41e0-ab34-4fa5dc82f8cf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Numerical modelling","Baltic Sea","Polish Marine Areas","Ocean hydrodynamic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654965249"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d121a","name":"Claire","lastName":"Waelbroeck","documentHash":"8c982429-789b-44db-ae09-f7e1e17b9b16"},{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1219","name":"Bruno","lastName":"Lansard","documentHash":"190abfa8-bb17-4202-8e63-63fbdddc348c"},{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1218","name":"Yannis","lastName":"Cuypers","documentHash":"9a0cc594-b22e-4fe0-ae0c-7ad582f10ca4"},{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1217","name":"Pascale","lastName":"Bouruet‐Aubertot","documentHash":"eeb6756d-3d29-4852-8173-655cc322e06f"},{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1216","name":"Clément","lastName":"Rousset","documentHash":"493b3b6f-699c-4863-82de-37adebf61feb"},{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1215","name":"Elisabeth","lastName":"Michel","documentHash":"727e7587-96d9-4168-aedf-58179aae9083"},{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1213","name":"Ragnheid","lastName":"Skogseth","documentHash":"343aa3e1-4a8f-4a93-a9c4-d746a7df7be7"},{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1212","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Lourenço","documentHash":"b0051dcc-bfad-4483-9aaf-3a53b502fee4"},{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1211","name":"Frédéric","lastName":"Vivier","documentHash":"bca5fbc2-b884-4f67-82a6-943837df5744"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc63a","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Goszczko","uuid":"7F19340DDF540F6AF7945CF6383F7C1E9A06C28E4BA74C12F06997956B1E5084F8FAEEA2B8697093BCDB3A06976401F0557814C4DA0E346719A0A560A12A8F7A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5719-5860","documentHash":"bcfc94ad-06b6-4a04-b934-617749c29db1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-09-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d120f","doi":"10.1029/2024jc020878","publicUri":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2024JC020878","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Dense Water Production in Storfjorden, Svalbard, From a 1‐Year Time Series of Observations and a Simple Model: Are Polynyas in a Warming Arctic Exporting Heat to the Deep Ocean?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The formation of dense Brine-enriched Shelf Water (BSW) in Storfjorden is analyzed during Winter 2016–2017 from mooring observations, a polynya model nudged to satellite observations, and an original BSW production model. The ice season was two months shorter than average, yet 44.2 \n of sea ice were formed, in line with estimates for the period preceding the atlantification of the Barents Sea in the mid-2000s: A thinner, more fragile ice may favor polynya openings and frazil ice production. A saline specimen of BSW was produced in large volumes, corresponding to an annual mean transport of 0.042 Sv, larger than previous estimates. The important production is due to the preconditioning of the polynya with a more saline source water, exceeding the pre-2005 values by 0.37. The BSW overflow was observed on the West Spitsbergen shelf slope from hydrographic sections down to 750 m, thus entering the Norwegian Sea Deep Water layer. Its core temperature was about \nC warmer than the pre-2005 values owing to the entrainment of a warmer water in Storfjordrenna, suggesting that a part of the excess surface heat of the Barents Sea could be exported into the deep ocean. Overall our results suggest that dense water formation in the Storfjorden polynya may not, at least for now, be hampered by the atlantification of the Barents Sea, and perhaps even temporarily favored by the more saline source water. Anomalous atmospheric warming during the Winter-Spring may however disrupt the production, as was observed 1 year before."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc63a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"129","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-27","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1211","66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1212","66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1213","5e709469878c28a0473bc63a","66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1215","66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1216","66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1217","66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1218","66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1219","66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d121a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c849","mniswId":"11229","title":"JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS","issn":"2169-9275","eissn":"2169-9291","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"59b92342-e5c4-40f2-9c0e-da48d6ebce72"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd3c26fdbe836fcb7d1210","year":"2024","volume":"129","number":"10","documentHash":"20bab23a-4eba-4bcc-89ca-25d1484b882d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655018628"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679b61dcfdbe8318b4cc499c","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Litwicka","documentHash":"7b1fcebd-af52-4672-9744-5b3ad7b1d81b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6554","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"7DC6EF7449E88C20028F95E36F2899248590FD2207946CC24EEAC57DA894C445DEA823F1DEF0C9D2E453AF0DE2D42CA22703FF05716B407C36835313CE67823A","orcidId":"0000-0001-9757-5553","documentHash":"02c62f14-ac99-4008-b257-09ecaa6160a4"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6545","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stoń-Egiert","uuid":"761936593A0A85A183D4328C890367B2F2F64EA207CBA8ABD568F50DE6BCEADC3C2ACFAC4786EF77370FE85E6437FA754AFFD2F08C89E1B051CDC877FA69B923","orcidId":"0000-0002-4274-8979","documentHash":"eef72685-4d70-4808-a6da-0ffdedc9843e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"679b61dcfdbe8318b4cc499a","doi":"10.5697/eznp4044","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.5697/eznp4044","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Variability and relationships between the size, composition and optical properties of suspended particulate matter in the coastal waters of western Spitsbergen, assessed through measurements of size-fractionated seawater samples","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Measurements of inherent optical properties (IOPs) and characteristics of concentration and composition of suspended particles were made on original and size-fractionated surface water samples from Arctic fjords and coastal waters of western Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago, in the summer months of 2021 and 2022. Optical measurements included the spectral scattering coefficient of particles, and spectral absorption coefficients of particles as well as depigmented (non-algal) particles and phytoplankton. Assemblages of suspended particles were characterised by measuring the mass concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), particulate organic matter (POM), particulate inorganic matter (PIM), and phytoplankton pigments including chlorophyll a (Chla ). All measurements were performed on original (unfiltered) seawater and on size-fractionated samples obtained by filtration using a combination of nylon meshes and membrane filters. This allowed us to determine the contribution of the fractions of very small (VS), small (S) and combined medium and large particles (ML) to the total SPM and Chla, as well as to the total scattering and absorption coefficients. The obtained results: (i) indirectly indicate a clear variability in particle size distributions occurring in the studied marine environment (e.g., the contribution of ML size fraction to SPM (the ratio SPMML/SPM) varied between 0.10 and 0.52); (ii) indicate noticeable differences in composition between size fractions (e.g., the POM/SPM ratio was on average 0.21 for the S fraction, and 0.34 and 0.32 for the VS and ML fractions, respectively); (iii) in most cases indicate that the fraction S had the largest contribution to all analysed spectral optical coefficients, followed by the VS and ML fractions (the average contributions of the S fraction to scattering coefficient of particles and absorption coefficient of particles or depigmented (non-algal) particles were above 0.6 in the entire analysed spectral ranges); (iv) allowed for the identification of statistical relationships between selected characteristics describing changes in particle size and variability of particle IOPs (e.g., we observed statistical relations between SPMML/SPM and the spectral slope of scattering coefficient by particles, as well as SPM-specific coefficients of scattering by particles)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6554","5e709347878c28a0473a6545"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"4","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6554","679b61dcfdbe8318b4cc499c","5e709347878c28a0473a6545"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","issn":"2300-7370","eissn":"0078-3234","websiteLink":"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/oceanologia/","documentHash":"aa2131a9-9921-49df-aa5f-48b55221c8d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b61dcfdbe8318b4cc499b","year":"2024","volume":"66","number":"4","documentHash":"4f2133fd-9992-4a27-9f50-e0000bad5914"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Inherent optical properties (spectral scattering coefficient of particles, spectral absorption coefficients of particles, depigmented (non-algal) particles and phytoplankton)","Composition of suspended particulate matter (mass concentrations of particulate organic matter, particulate inorganic matter","chlorophyll a","Seawater samples fractionated by particle size","Contributions of size fractions of suspended matter to particle concentration metrics and optical coefficients","Relations between metrics of size, composition and optical coefficients","Arctic coastal waters"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655055265"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a2d64fdbe831aedcd3164","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Otremba","documentHash":"708e08b1-397a-4062-9338-a128e41f6154"},{"objectId":"679a2d64fdbe831aedcd3163","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Lednicka","documentHash":"4e5d9c20-478d-4782-9397-a4c9f41e6597"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6516","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Piskozub","uuid":"F6CDFD38B1C79615F0E0B20F3365ADD4B1200329EA42AC8AB53AB7E23D15B94E0649AE8F62EF4883789E83DA9ED8CAC69BBD68B558F56384A5E1528EA9B5C86D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3386-6604","documentHash":"59cdfcf5-844a-466b-9794-c7ac52086fa5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2024-08-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679a2d64fdbe831aedcd3161","doi":"10.1364/oe.532853","publicUri":"https://opg.optica.org/viewmedia.cfm?URI=oe-32-17-29424&seq=0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Vector irradiance modelling in a seawater column for assessing the detection capabilities of an oil-in-water emulsion","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The possibility of tracking oil pollution in the sea has been an issue that has been analysed for a long time, and the use of light interactions with the sea polluted with various forms of oil has been the subject of numerous studies.

infrastructure, also impacts on the environment, which needs to be assessed and documented. On September the 26th 2022, unknown perpetrators deliberately ruptured the two gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2 with four coordinated explosions near a major chemical munition dump site near the Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. While the massive release of natural gas into atmosphere raised serious concerns concerning the contribution to climate change—this paper assesses the overlooked direct impact of the explosions on the marine ecosystem. Seals and porpoises within a radius of four km would be at high risk of being killed by the shockwave, while temporary impact on hearing would be expected up to 50 km away. As the Baltic Proper population of harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) is critically endangered, the loss or serious injury of even a single individual is considered a significant impact on the population. The rupture moreover resulted in the resuspension of 250000 metric tons of heavily contaminated sediment from deep-sea sedimentary basin for over a week, resulting in unacceptable toxicological risks towards fish and other biota in 11 km3 water in the area for more than a month."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

toxicity of triphenylarsine to Danio rerio","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Triphenylarsine (TPA) is a persistent organoarsenical that has emerged as a major environmental concern due to the extensive marine disposal of chemical munitions throughout the 20th century. The waterborne toxicity of TPA in aquatic organisms remains poorly understood, with limited and often inconclusive data, and its chronic effects are entirely unexplored. To address this gap, a 28-day exposure study was conducted, focusing on assessing the long-term toxicity of TPA in the model fish species Danio rerio. The results indicate that chronic exposure to trace concentrations of TPA significantly reduces body length, weight, and growth rate in fish. Furthermore, TPA and its primary degradation product, triphenylarsine oxide (TPAO), accumulate in the muscle tissues of fish. The accumulation rates are 0.61 μg × g⁻¹ (dry weight) for TPA and 9.1 μg × g⁻¹ (dry weight) for TPAO, for every microgram of TPA per litre of water over 28 days of exposure. Additionally, chronic exposure induced oxidative stress in the gills, as evidenced by altered mRNA expression and elevated enzymatic activity of detoxification-related proteins. Therefore, TPA exposure represents a significant threat to fish. This compound should be recognized as a high-priority environmental contaminant, and its concentrations should be routinely monitored in bottom waters, particularly near chemical munitions dumping sites. Expanding research to predict and assess the toxicity of other persistent organoarsenicals co-disposed with TPA is essential for understanding their cumulative ecological and health impacts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a793e","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa92","6831c74afdbe8314669173fe","61a1a6387523402fabdffb4a","616a392975234017e0545a19"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709477878c28a0473bdd54","5e7092a5878c28a047399cc0","5e709390878c28a0473ace8e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a653d","616a392975234017e0545a19"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"299","pagesFromTo":"118366","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61a1a6387523402fabdffb4a","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa92","5e709477878c28a0473bdd54","5e709390878c28a0473ace8e","5e7092a5878c28a047399cc0","6831c74afdbe8314669173fe","616a392975234017e0545a19","5e709347878c28a0473a653d","5e709356878c28a0473a793e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a30","mniswId":"5410","title":"Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety","issn":"0147-6513","documentHash":"3e1b6306-6135-443c-826f-386138091b18"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6831c74afdbe8314669173fd","year":"2025","volume":"299","documentHash":"911ecf91-2d2f-4c7a-be56-4bb43036c172"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Organoarsenicals","TPA","Zebrafish","Long-term toxicity","Accumulation","Oxidative stress"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748124705538"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68359424fdbe834f489b732c","name":"Anette","lastName":"Wold","documentHash":"d78bb94a-5af8-48f7-bd87-32b0adde59b6"},{"objectId":"68359424fdbe834f489b732b","name":"Emily Yi-Shyuan","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"912dd286-2670-4889-8fbd-be9ed7af8655"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc64c","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Boehnke","uuid":"5658579154E9552DE663998D941AAF201FF70D0E52796417670EE7DB1D1C7085F3BFDDD17EDC3A1A5729DEC5ED47F8F8DABC9FEE45ADC844E9B5AFF5673A33C8","orcidId":"0000-0001-8349-818X","documentHash":"f81bd47b-1ca2-4241-b5ec-6f133e813c24"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Trudnowska","uuid":"AA053DA780011D48828031E0F546FBA1539476879FBCBDE10F1D8C2B4534A50AA85A7A8306F9B2D9975214D2058F8F1B1DFD9227C2F2DB66C127DBF1C87DABA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3471-6632","documentHash":"6a2cc11c-54aa-4bf9-8692-2ffad1b22811"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6520","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Błachowiak-Samołyk","uuid":"8C6AD77D97DA3D9D5230CB20B5B200FB76893BFE72A48BE0BAB6068DBB7BD96049B3C885C6414B2EF04BBFB8AFD27AC9468868A23DB7A01FB8AEBEECC4EDAD0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8076-2168","documentHash":"5036109f-207f-446c-bac6-ec8dd36677f9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"68359424fdbe834f489b7329","doi":"10.1007/s00227-025-04601-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00227-025-04601-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"A decade of reproductive abnormalities in pelagic ostracods observed at the entrance to a changing Arctic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The rapid warming of the Arctic Ocean is driving significant shifts in ecosystem dyamics, from species-level morphologi-\ncal changes to changes in community composition. Within the Arctic pelagic community, Ostracoda is an understudied\nzooplankton group that exhibits distinct sexually dimorphic features, including carapace shape, size, frontal and reproduc-\ntive organs, and antennae. During analyses of a zooplankton time series collected each summer from 2010 to 2019 in the\nFram Strait, the main gateway between the north Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean, all four dominant pelagic ostracod species\n(Boroecia maxima, B. borealis, Discoconchoecia elegans, and Obtusoecia obtusata) displayed reproductive abnormalities\nin the form of pseudopenises that otherwise had distinct female features. Out of the total analyzed material of 4,137 adult\nand pre-mature A-1 stages individuals, 646 A-1 stage individuals, or 15.6% of the population, exhibited pseudopenises. All\nobserved abnormalities were confined to the A-1 stage with no variant adults recorded. The primary difference between\nthese pseudopenises and normal male penises was the lack of muscle bands and sperm duct required for reproductive\nfunctionality. However, a few A-1 females had pseudopenises with signs of these bands and ducts developing, suggest-\ning a potential transition to true intersexuality. Monitoring this phenomenon in ostracods is crucial because it can have\npopulation-wide reproductive consequences. Furthermore, widespread intersexuality could complicate the interpretation\nof ecological trends in the changing Arctic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","5e709347878c28a0473a6520","5e709469878c28a0473bc64c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"172","issue":"3","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68359424fdbe834f489b732b","5e709439878c28a0473b86e9","68359424fdbe834f489b732c","5e709469878c28a0473bc64c","5e709347878c28a0473a6520"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d63","mniswId":"13906","title":"MARINE BIOLOGY","issn":"0025-3162","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"aa2b5ab7-5c4f-48fc-b004-3b0cc7bc4a59"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68359424fdbe834f489b732a","year":"2025","volume":"172","number":"3","documentHash":"ee3fbc1f-fe68-4189-96ad-af312bd10359"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ostracods","Arctic","Zooplankton","Taxonomy","Intersexuality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748386607722"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16ed","name":"Haakon","lastName":"Hop","documentHash":"1fb9add7-963a-4e3a-b737-64cd764aef20"},{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16ec","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sowa","documentHash":"c712d808-cba1-490c-8b39-ee2c1d1e410d"},{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16eb","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Chełchowski","documentHash":"98da3130-ec34-4eac-b9f6-ca99f9a08c30"},{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16ea","name":"Jens","lastName":"Najorka","documentHash":"53e606d3-f9e7-4a9c-9b1d-d892bfb1e3ae"},{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16e9","name":"Emma","lastName":"Humphreys-Williams","documentHash":"ba706eb1-f093-41c1-9fd4-e11218d137cb"},{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16e8","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Przytarska","documentHash":"17017b0a-db93-4db1-8504-a3fccd06b7f8"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13","name":"Anna","lastName":"Iglikowska","uuid":"6CA1279301544EC9D4A6D185A9E282764B1CFE8885F634000DEC92D847207F9256BA6F5341530B86350D3DF140829DFB7FD955662C6814953270BB437360BB79","orcidId":"0000-0002-3932-9079","documentHash":"3a275c47-9172-49a6-b5de-136edd52c81a"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6522","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kukliński","uuid":"A7B41634DA49559842528BE50F2EE40F4A73728ECB06B76D3193FF0AF68D7A875FE6A41818510F4011B3A1FF1FF62E139BCE1E4BAC9B4592CD7DB39D82DE4729","orcidId":"0000-0002-1507-215X","documentHash":"a06883c9-4c31-48ba-81fb-37a53ad2a61b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a651e","name":"Maria","lastName":"Włodarska-Kowalczuk","uuid":"D47553F9A2C33D8033D8594650BFC32CC9C68EF6F3EE4CE130DBEC8BA3DF82ED9A7055BF1E4316109AD31C2E6DBEF73F3FEF158A522731E002B07E209F106EDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2757-1108","documentHash":"01d767d9-9266-45a4-bd4b-a8cf8d1e8a8e"}],"objectId":"6571ba9540970741e5c16112","doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.114759","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Shell mineralogy and chemistry - Arctic bivalves in a global context","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Badanie to dostarczyło nowych danych na temat mineralogii muszli 23 gatunków małży arktycznych.

This observation implies the dominance of biological processes regulating elemental uptake into the skeleton over factors related to the variability of abiotic environmental conditions. Analysis of the present study and literature data revealed that the highest concentrations of metals were observed in bivalves collected in the temperate zone, with intermediate levels in the tropics and the lowest levels in polar regions. This trend was ascribed mainly to the presence of higher anthropogenic pressure at temperate latitudes being a potential source of human-mediated metal pollution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6522","5e709347878c28a0473a651e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"189","pagesFromTo":"1-17","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff13","677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16e8","677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16e9","677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16ea","677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16eb","677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16ec","677d2fe8fdbe831a382e16ed","5e709347878c28a0473a651e","5e709347878c28a0473a6522"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d73","mniswId":"13923","title":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","issn":"0025-326X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4da78be2-a8fc-4c7c-8770-04b5572174f2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["metale śladowe","geochemia muszli","trend równoleżnikowy","morskie mięczaki","Svalbard"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["trace metals","shell geochemistry","latitudinal trend","marine molluscs","Svalbard"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748646938948"}]
