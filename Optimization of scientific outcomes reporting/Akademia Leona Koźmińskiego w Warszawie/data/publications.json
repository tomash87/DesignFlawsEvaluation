The study’s primary goal is to determine the effect of digital educational initiatives on human capital development. The systematization of literary sources and approaches to solving the problem indicates that the debate about the advantages and disadvantages of digital education in Ukraine continues until now. The urgency of solving this scientific problem lies in the fact that digital education is essential for the state’s educational policy and the country’s general development of human capital. The study of the topic in the article is carried out in the following logical sequence: a review of the literature to determine the advantages and disadvantages of digital education in Ukraine and an assessment of the impact of digital education on the development of skills and abilities of education seekers. An in-depth retrospective analysis of scientific works was carried out to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the subject of research. To solve the set goal, the methods of statistical analysis and questionnaires were used in the work. The object of the study is digital education initiatives in Ukraine. The effectiveness of initiatives in improving students’ knowledge, abilities, and employment prospects is analyzed. The study empirically confirms and theoretically proves that digital education initiatives positively affect the development of human capital in Ukraine. Educators who have mastered the skills of working on digital platforms demonstrate improved critical thinking and teamwork skills. The results show that these initiatives improve students’ skills, knowledge and employability. The development of digital education also requires establishing fair access to digital educational materials, especially in rural areas, and improving pedagogical workers’ qualifications in using digital products. The findings contribute to the broader academic discourse on the relationship between digital education and human capital growth, providing ideas for future research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0","66254e5740970710350a2aca","66254e5740970710350a2acb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"603e32ce2467f058472fa03c","title":"SocioEconomic Challenges","issn":"2520-6621","eissn":"2520-6214","websiteLink":"https://armgpublishing.sumdu.edu.ua/journals/sec/","documentHash":"73f7ebcd-729e-444b-b8c1-dba4b296db63"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66254e5740970710350a2ac9","year":"2023","volume":"7","number":"3","documentHash":"11c1f7e2-bff5-424f-8039-85e9df3e8b3e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["digital education initiatives, human capital development impact, Ukraine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059561870"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65825fb840e3ff6b1294e823","name":"Inna","lastName":"Tselinko","uuid":"6E9C6637FF5057CAE153541EF7FCB71DF444C0D84091A238948015B73DF1159E3210B6C3CD9ED7F6C0286C6E1EACA8490F51AEA42424CDD4C949088A136F7952","documentHash":"b019a39d-8a33-4b07-ad36-2afa92bd9a8d"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2d","name":"Boštjan","lastName":"Brezovnik","uuid":"057D2341400585FF838E13BA67E1A118266945FD652C1C330428D5B5C90A970A2D6EAAE0D277F35FDD07D3EAD39EC689C3D4817EE5A0E71B45EFAF4121EEAF06","documentHash":"43709327-bed0-4a75-941a-50077f81b9f3"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6dcf","name":"FRANJO","lastName":"MLINARIC","uuid":"C2E1306E7E98B8DC93E615B8C27C26B2B06E1DD153CA0CA2D0DD6768CC34BC28420BE8BB491F4292E39558A404A7B74423A6DD9C48FFEA7DD89E0DE065208B44","documentHash":"eebc9bc4-bd1e-4a23-9750-462d5aa63a52"},{"objectId":"5e7094cd878c28a0473c3ffb","name":"Grygorii","lastName":"Kravchenko","uuid":"6560C2650863C4534E3B011B71B9AF547C5DCC47CBCB593482EF387653BB3C4A7522DAAE8A1A308595E405C83A0A77E7E5219741076F0BD1FDBA68790CCFC9CB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5269-6300","documentHash":"23cc17db-11c8-4007-971f-3dfcbc7a4df2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-10-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"66255a8c40970710350a95bc","publicUri":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4600087","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Unlocking ESG Potential: The Interaction of Gender Diversity and Specialized Skills","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Amidst global regulatory efforts to increase female representation on corporate boards and growing academic interest in gender-diverse leadership, this study examines the impact of gender diversity and directors' specialized skills on ESG performance.

In an environment of low marginal costs of supplying information and potential large network effects and externalities, traditional markets support concentration and often fail as providers of equitable coordination of information use. Conversely, hierarchical power, even if democratically controlled, is often mistrusted by citizens, especially in peripheral and semi-peripheral countries. On the other hand, technology giants are much more flexible and experienced in data handling. Naturally, both polar modes of coordination will remain very important in the realm of information management, but it seems important to explore, and maybe even encourage the use of information as a kind of social commons, with an emphasis on various bottom-up initiatives. This chapter constitutes an attempt to identify the key characteristics of states, markets, and bottom-up initiatives as data management coordination mechanisms drawing on case studies conducted in three countries often referred to as semi-peripheral (India, Taiwan, Poland). The discussion concludes with a model of data governance practices based on these case studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["600a892b9543c753022219d7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-20","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709328878c28a0473a3e1c","5e7094ca878c28a0473c3be2","5e7092d5878c28a04739d9e2","600a892b9543c753022219d7"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"63306f9a409707021a32c8d0","doi":"10.4324/9781003264170","title":"Industrial Revolution 4.0 : Economic Foundations and Practical Implications","year":2022,"isbn":"9781032205632","translation":false,"documentHash":"b2d8adf4-1e29-42de-83cd-a2a940744566","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059612191"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664ba6a940970745fdef11de","name":"S.

International institutions deliberating on dispute resolution mechanisms and strategies have been evincing interest in discussing TPF in international arbitration. To that extent, this research is premised upon the proposition that TPF serves the cause of access to justice, and it would serve the cause of justice to ensure that the TPF is regulated. This article sets out to prove this hypothesis by suggesting an appropriate arbitral rules regime that could ensure the presence of TPF as well as offer an effective regulation of the same through an appropriate regime on disclosures, independence and impartiality, thereby assuring transparency while fostering access to justice. Following the introduction, the first part of this research discusses the wherewithal of TPF, access to justice through TPF, and the importance of TPF for environmental disputes. Within the second part, there is a discussion on the characterization of the claimant in environmental disputes and the ISDS jurisprudence on environmental disputes. The third part of this research showcases the PCA’s Optional Rules related to arbitration of environmental rules as being a viable mechanism to enhance access to justice via multi-party arbitrations while ensuring the regulation of TPF through an effective transparency and disclosures-related regime. The research concludes with a few suggestions for future reform efforts towards enhanced value."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c32b4f9543c72336543f66"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"Special Issue on \"International Investment Arbitration - Environmental Protection and Climate Change Issues\"","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"online","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["664ba6a940970745fdef11de","60c32b4f9543c72336543f66"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547eed6","mniswId":"476168","title":"Transnational Dispute Management","issn":" ","eissn":"1875-4120","metadataSource":"WCN","documentHash":"9fd60390-e2ad-496f-94d1-321e64c803d8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664ba6a940970745fdef11dd","year":"2023","volume":"3","number":"Special Issue","documentHash":"1d2fd6a9-709e-4809-8901-b6af709c7b08"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059618205"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"600a892b9543c753022219d7","name":"JAN","lastName":"OLESZCZUK-ZYGMUNTOWSKI","uuid":"A431DC791D27C6C9D544578C442F9032CAD4C70C6DDD2BE864EE174559E086AC15AD055367765190053C30A3FAD9CEAF30EAC043773ACE09AE176DC844436196","documentHash":"2f04168b-d5d3-4bdd-ad68-b0e39d516a17"}],"objectId":"665f19e94097073a824384fc","doi":"10.3224/ijar.v18i1.07","publicUri":"https://www.budrich-journals.de/index.php/ijar/article/download/39901/34012","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Surveil and Control: A critical review of “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism”","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["600a892b9543c753022219d7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1-2022","pagesFromTo":"71-78","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["600a892b9543c753022219d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547de99","mniswId":"23058","title":"International Journal of Action Research","issn":"1861-1303","eissn":"1861-9916","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2a6b5f90-061c-4459-af3d-811afbaa1785"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665f19e94097073a824384fd","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"1","documentHash":"c4d40fe1-a0fa-4cb5-bd9e-9f59a870539b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059628612"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"600a892b9543c753022219d7","name":"JAN","lastName":"OLESZCZUK-ZYGMUNTOWSKI","uuid":"A431DC791D27C6C9D544578C442F9032CAD4C70C6DDD2BE864EE174559E086AC15AD055367765190053C30A3FAD9CEAF30EAC043773ACE09AE176DC844436196","documentHash":"2f04168b-d5d3-4bdd-ad68-b0e39d516a17"}],"objectId":"665f12974097073a8242ee85","doi":"10.1007/s44206-023-00058-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44206-023-00058-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Data Governance in a Trilemma: A Qualitative Analysis of Rights, Values, and Goals in Building Data Commons","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Most of the discussions on data governance stress legal and technological aspects, while avoiding the discussion of power, stakeholder interests, and value. In order to move from formal debates to operational institution-building, we ask about the goals of data governance for different stakeholders and why data commons can be useful in achieving them. We discuss the evolution of data governance over time and cast light on the antagonism between three main goals of data governance: protecting fundamental rights, generating economic value and serving public interest. Given the necessity to navigate this conflicted political economy of data, we introduce the data governance trilemma (DGT) model. We turn to data commons as an institution capable of solving the collective action problem and negotiating acceptable configuration of the DGT goals. In order to operationalize data commons using DGT, we conducted workshops combining the critical success factors (CSFs) method with a deliberative Delphi technique. We find that the systemic configuration of data governance should be restructured towards data sovereignty, founded on institutional trust, protection of rights, and obligatory data sharing with the public interest in mind. Based on our results, we claim that unless we build data commons to steward data as a democratic medium, a lack of legitimization will riddle attempts to govern data better, and societal benefits will fail to manifest."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["600a892b9543c753022219d7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"online","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["600a892b9543c753022219d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"665f12974097073a8242ee86","title":"Digital Society","issn":"2731-4650","websiteLink":"https://link.springer.com/journal/44206","documentHash":"b8ab2bdb-228b-4c11-9453-54ca22d04a8d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665f12974097073a8242ee87","year":"2023","volume":"2","documentHash":"efde6211-a829-46e1-84d2-074c4d136e08"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Data governance, Data commons, Political economy, Collective rights, Public interest, Deliberative Delphi, Critical success factors"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059628632"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae41f","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"SKÓRZEWSKA-AMBERG","uuid":"80B4DD2C19F157CFFDB5B1AF1224F8CAE475551C603F3FEA061E48E7C1EF2C77A08747638F40083C04987C6F0B161E3483E19D5B53B28949E39F65399DF7ED9A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8498-833X","documentHash":"0860c8e2-10d3-40a6-b61f-cd44cd9a8ee6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67178505fdbe83553de920b1","publicUri":"http://www.e-transformations.com/jeden_artykul_pl.php?post-slug=archiwum_transformacje/2023/12/20231229224927662.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"PROTECTING THE LEGAL BASIS OF DEMOCRACY  IN STATES OF CRISIS – SWEDISH CONSTITUTIONAL DILEMMAS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Swedish system of governance is based on a strongly established and safeguarded separation of powers (the trias politica principle) with strong parliamentary control over the actions of the executive.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research used selected capital adequacy measures recommended by the central bank and the Financial Supervision Commission. The standards were verified in 2018-2022 for purposively selected banks in Poland: ING Bank Slaski S.A., mBank S.A. and Bank Millennium S.A. The assessment was based on a comparative analysis of the reviewed banks' financial statements. Findings: As a result of the descriptive analysis, it was confirmed that the reviewed banks, despite the risk of economic uncertainty, met the stansards of capital adequacy during the set period. In this context, particularly sensitive risk areas of banking activities were identified.. Practical Implications: In business practice, the monitoring of financial adequacy standards informs both banks and entrepreneurs: about business risks, the need to modify credit policy, the need for recapitalization. It is a useful 'barometer' of economic uncertainty verification. Originality/Value: Permanent evaluation of banks' capital adequacy standards, based on selected evaluation measures, allows monitoring the risk of banking activity under conditions of economic uncertainty."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094af878c28a0473c1b4f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"XXVIΙ","issue":"Issue 2","pagesFromTo":"517-530","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094af878c28a0473c1b4f","67510116fdbe834f76811fc7","5e709411878c28a0473b5c27","5e7094c0878c28a0473c303d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","issn":"1108-2976","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e13ec1b4-9fe9-4c4d-9da5-bd3082096ed5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662a1cef4097074b67c1f5e1","year":"2024","volume":"XXVIΙ","number":"Issue 2","documentHash":"ca5e8cd8-1f3a-4393-8268-409aa79b237a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pandemic periodeconomic uncertaintycapital adequacy standardsPolandbanking"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060001993"},{"authors":[],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"645a739c409707019f3caa63","doi":"10.2775/401187","publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/permalink/48OMNIS_NLOP/1aot9i7/alma9913148976405606","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2022,"title":"Problem praworządności w Polsce w świetle orzecznictwa Trybunału Sprawiedliwości UE (2021).

Given the high costs involved, it is inevitable that parties to the arbitration proceedings may be either willing to pay the costs but are unable to or maybe are able to pay the costs but unwilling to. The significant drain on the financial resources of the parties coupled with the need to maintain financial stability has resulted in parties opting for a wide array of litigation financing options. Such being the case, the need for market-based solutions has also prompted the advent of third-party funding (TPF). Consequently, it is not surprising to witness the recent usage of TPF in investor-state arbitrations. The hypothesis of the present article is that TPF in investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) is necessary to ensure access to justice in ISDS. Accordingly, the first part of the article establishes the connect between the concept of access to justice and ISDS. The second part of the article examines the relationship between access to justice and TPF and assesses how ISDS tribunals react and critique the presence of a funder in ISDS proceedings. In essence, the second part will evaluate TPF vis-à-vis Security for Costs applications in the ISDS framework, thereby confirming or dismissing the general hypothesis that TPF is necessary for access to justice in ISDS. The last part of the article concludes with the pertinent underpinnings and takeaways of the above two parts of the article."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c32b4f9543c72336543f66"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"34-53","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c45ccefdbe8379b394cbc5","60c32b4f9543c72336543f66"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5f878c28514547e4d0","mniswId":"24814","title":"Manchester Journal of International Economic Law","eissn":"1742-3945","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"07a31a3c-e8d3-4dc6-ba9f-ba52b73ee970"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c45ccefdbe8379b394cbc4","year":"2024","volume":"21","number":"1","documentHash":"5d41529f-4a03-4621-8694-8f274d2ebb31"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["International arbitration, Third-party funding (TPF), Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060593177"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c7435dfdbe83570429f562","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Blyznyukov","documentHash":"7e588661-1bf3-4235-8f88-aa457aea045f"},{"objectId":"67c7435dfdbe83570429f561","name":"Kateryna","lastName":"Chepel","documentHash":"87188504-6983-43e5-9458-7e14c65bedb0"},{"objectId":"67c7435dfdbe83570429f560","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Dotsenko","documentHash":"9c6fe71d-602a-4f24-8996-d9ed45e66de5"},{"objectId":"603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Melnyk","uuid":"4143B117E9C3784673E4A8B8EA49B6FBEEF4DB897CF212CE3524181A286CB0DC76E05531D66E841B9A5457DA876B7418A5B86634ACF9BCFA270972D7972977E9","documentHash":"4f879ab1-9ea3-4383-9805-6fef8d6c1dc3"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a047392150","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Jarzębowski","uuid":"514E526853E4CCBD426B907205AEFCCC4E194F0531D7CA19100E8740268F4AEC7AE05228E7293F719FEF277F86C975583960F43FF21AE991A265124C6D64CBA2","orcidId":"0000-0002-9394-577X","documentHash":"7c143554-bb8a-42e2-b7e1-9ed38fa6cab8"}],"objectId":"67c7435dfdbe83570429f55e","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.61093/bel.8(3).199-218.2024","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Role of IT Companies’ Business Leadership in Driving Digital Progress in Local Communities","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigates the role of local IT companies in driving digital progress in Ukrainian communities, \nhighlighting the critical relationship between IT companies’ business leadership and regional digital transformation. \nThe relevance of this topic is particularly significant given Ukraine’s ongoing efforts to digitally transform its regions \nin the context of post-war recovery and economic rebuilding. Local IT companies are pivotal in fostering economic \ngrowth and bridging the digital divide by promoting innovation, infrastructure, and digital services, especially in \nunderserved areas. The methodology used in this study involved the development of an econometric model to evaluate \nthe correlation between two integral indices. The Digital Transformation Index integrally reflects the region’s overall \nprogress on the digital transformation path (institutional capacity, Internet development, ASC development, paperless \nmode, digital education, regional business cards, penetration of basic services, and sectoral digital transformation). IT \nBusiness Leadership Index is proposed to be described in this study by the following indicators: the number of operating \nlocal IT companies, their employees and recruited employees, and the volume of products sold, produced and added by \nlocal IT companies. Regression, correlation, canonical analysis (to determine the interdependencies between sets of \nfactors, to define the canonical roots of the studied indices), and factor analysis (to build an integral indicator of IT \ncompanies’ business leadership under the influence of digital transformation), were used to determine the statistical \ndependencies between these indicators. The data across Ukraine’s regions were gathered from official government \nsources, covering 2020‒2022. The findings revealed a strong correlation between active IT company leadership and \nhigher levels of digital progress in regions like Kyiv and Kharkiv. These areas have advanced in implementing digital \nservices such as e-governance and digital education platforms. However, disparities were observed, with regions like \nZaporizhia and Donetsk lagging behind due to weaker IT infrastructure and limited access to skilled labor. The analysis \nhighlighted that not all factors contributed equally, with variables like production costs showing weaker correlations. \nThis suggests the need for targeted policies and investments to ensure equitable digital transformation across all regions. \nThis study underscores the importance of strengthening local IT ecosystems. It suggests that a multifaceted approach –\nencompassing policy support, infrastructure development, and education – is essential for achieving widespread and \nsustainable digital progress in Ukraine."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0","5e70923a878c28a047392150"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"199-218","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c7435dfdbe83570429f560","5e70923a878c28a047392150","67c7435dfdbe83570429f561","67c7435dfdbe83570429f562","603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e71828146e0fb0001d07bac","title":"Business Ethics and Leadership (BEL)","issn":"2520-6761","eissn":"2520-6311","documentHash":"26018c3d-b8f5-449a-af8e-6c94a8296b49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c7435dfdbe83570429f55f","year":"2024","volume":"8","number":"3","documentHash":"d79d3e0a-652e-4ed2-966b-df1d715085b2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["business leadership, digital transformation, digital transformation index, e-governance, IT companies, IT business leadership index, local communities, Ukraine"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060604656"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c74110fdbe83570429e391","name":"Bohdan","lastName":"Kovalov","documentHash":"c531f975-a25a-4ff1-bda4-f5d42fffe689"},{"objectId":"67c74110fdbe83570429e390","name":"Ihor","lastName":"Ponomarenko","documentHash":"98110ec1-9029-4b81-a3ba-afb282bec1b5"},{"objectId":"603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Melnyk","uuid":"4143B117E9C3784673E4A8B8EA49B6FBEEF4DB897CF212CE3524181A286CB0DC76E05531D66E841B9A5457DA876B7418A5B86634ACF9BCFA270972D7972977E9","documentHash":"4f879ab1-9ea3-4383-9805-6fef8d6c1dc3"}],"objectId":"67c74110fdbe83570429e38e","doi":"10.61093/bel.8(1).74-92.2024","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.61093/bel.8(1).74-92.2024","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Business Innovations and Digital Transformation: Trend, Comparative and Bibliometric Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The rapid development of digital technologies, digital transformation, business innovation, and the emergence of such technologies as artificial intelligence, blockchain, the Internet of Things provides significant potential for transforming business processes and creating new innovative models. The trend analysis conducted in this article (using the Google Trends tool) around the world for 2009-2023 showed that public interest in “business innovation” was almost constant until 2021 (according to the GT Scale, it ranged from 0.25 to 0.5). After 2021, it increased (according to the GT Scale, it was more than 0.5). At the same time, public interest in “digital transformation” has significantly increased since 2014, reaching almost maximum values in 2020-2023 (0.75 – 1.00 on the GT Scale). This confirms a growing need in society to acquire new knowledge related to the ability of businesses to adapt to digital transformation, including through creating innovative developments. Unlike trend analysis, bibliometric and comparative analyses identify trends in developing interest in this topic not among ordinary citizens – users of the Google search platform ‒ but among scientists who publish the results of their research either in monographs or in authoritative peer-reviewed scientific journals indexed by leading scientometric databases. The comparative analysis conducted in the article using the Google Books Ngram Viewer (Google) tool, which displays the frequency of references to relevant terms in English-language books for 2009-2019 worldwide, showed similar trends: the persistence of scholars’ attention to business innovation, while their interest in digital transformation is growing: in 2009-2013 – a slight increase, in 2013-2019 ‒ a significant increase. In the bibliometric analysis, a five-level mechanism for limiting the research sample was applied: only English-language and most recent (for 2018-2022) scientific articles indexed by the Scopus database in the subject area of Business, Management and Accounting were subject to analysis. Based on these limitations, the research sample for the keyword “digital transformation” was reduced from 12131 to 1700 papers, and for “business innovation” from 865 to 70. The analysis of the published articles, their views and citations, carried out using the SciVal tool, fully confirmed the conclusions drawn from the trend and comparative analysis results. In terms of digital transformation, the leaders in terms of the number of papers and the number of views are Germany, Italy, the UK and the US; in terms of citations – the UK, Germany, the US, and in terms of individual scientists – Brazil and Germany. As for the topic of business innovation, the United States is the undisputed leader in all these parameters, followed by China and the United Kingdom. Some scientists from Germany and Spain also attract the attention of the academic community (in terms of views and citations). Changes in trends and research priorities in each of the studied topics were identified and described using SciVal (analysis of the reference dynamics to the top 50 keywords in articles for 2018-2023). For example, in 2023, compared to 2022, scientific interest in issues related to “value creation” (+61.5%), “incumbents” (+66.7%), “service economy” (+83.3%), “digital marketing” (+75.0%), and “design thinking” (+150.0%) increased the most. VOSviewer software made it possible to cluster the scientific work by thematic areas. The largest cluster on digital transformation relates this concept to small and medium-sized businesses and technologies, and the largest cluster on business innovation relates it to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and the protection of property rights."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"74-92","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c74110fdbe83570429e390","67c74110fdbe83570429e391","603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff306ad49b31ccebfde57","title":"Business Ethics and Leadership","issn":"2520-6761","eissn":"2520-6311","websiteLink":"http://armgpublishing.sumdu.edu.ua/journals/bel/","documentHash":"80e893af-7125-471a-95c5-3769927ed2ba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c74110fdbe83570429e38f","year":"2024","volume":"8","number":"1","documentHash":"a81a5cae-6d39-40c6-a8d1-8afb73c7ff81"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bibliometric analysis, business innovation, comparative analysis, digital transformation, digitalization, Google Books Ngram Viewer, Google Trends, SciVal, trends analysis, VOSviewer"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060604662"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67984f38ece398101e31df6a","name":"Junaid","lastName":"Ahmed","uuid":"225B840B51B1035B506F5EFE7EB003DFA1B76B5C1FC6B60F12608322DBDB3AFF3FDFC0B98A3B667B7C139634430F96FA9639A97EAAB74FBE1C526BFEB8748A6F","documentHash":"24ba2a2f-2b1d-4e0f-b415-0dc953127e25"},{"objectId":"664b49f340970745fdea30a7","name":"Bülent","lastName":"Akkaya","documentHash":"1b9b13bf-9223-4d0d-ae87-0981dcbd4da3"}],"objectId":"664b49f340970745fdea30a6","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/978-1-80262-325-320220001/full/html","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"VUCA-RR toward industry 5.0","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The future will see a new revolution in both industry and society in Industry 5.0.

The sustainable production can be achieved by adopting sustainability compatible production management systems. The literature refers to some of the important production management systems which can promise sustainability. Among various important servitization, circular economy and lean manufacturing are important ones. Designing and implementing servitization, circular economy, and lean manufacturing have been a problem for firms as this production system requires investment, knowledge, and infrastructure. However, with emergence of technology ecosystem of Industry 4.0, designing and implementing servitization, circular economy, and lean manufacturing have become a goal to be realized easily. The digital twin which is an important technology of Industry 4.0 facilitates designing and implementation of these production management systems. This chapter’s research shows that using digital twin technology, which creates a digital copy of physical things like products, value chains, and the actions and behavior of people involved, can help businesses design products and create value chain systems for things like improving customer service, using resources efficiently, and streamlining production. The digital twin through twinning of physical entity of various activities such as product and value chain activities and effective information management and analytics can help companies to easily implement servitization, circular economy, and lean manufacturing as production systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67984f38ece398101e31df6a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"135-154","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67984f38ece398101e31df6a"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"643542184097074edd602e1f","doi":"10.1201/9781003383444","title":"Human Factors in Engineering: Manufacturing Systems, Automation, and Interactions","year":2023,"isbn":"9781003383444","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/9781003383444","translation":false,"documentHash":"dcb1115d-4bd3-431d-a860-85f2bc1a8575","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb764","mniswId":"2600","name":"Taylor & Francis Group","documentHash":"186b7a58-eacb-453a-bc81-dbcca285e881"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060621789"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67984f38ece398101e31df6a","name":"Junaid","lastName":"Ahmed","uuid":"225B840B51B1035B506F5EFE7EB003DFA1B76B5C1FC6B60F12608322DBDB3AFF3FDFC0B98A3B667B7C139634430F96FA9639A97EAAB74FBE1C526BFEB8748A6F","documentHash":"24ba2a2f-2b1d-4e0f-b415-0dc953127e25"},{"objectId":"63085def4097076f71f4b18e","name":"Bülent","lastName":"Akkaya","documentHash":"5e6aca71-f28f-4511-af12-be87faf9f7e7"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a072d","name":"Beata","lastName":"Mrugalska","uuid":"2FFB51B1BA15D74E0DAC4ABAE905A87A98140DC181A018D5398883C986499AB9CDB06B2A7DB9C64938D76A62987BAE2A933CC11CB61528DED3D2B01AFEAAE1D3","orcidId":"0000-0001-9827-9449","documentHash":"e248cb51-7404-4614-a497-aaecc601aac3"}],"objectId":"63085def4097076f71f4b18b","doi":"10.1108/978-1-80262-325-320220002","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/978-1-80262-325-320220002/full/html","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Agile Management and VUCA 2.0 (VUCA-RR) During Industry 4.0","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a072d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67984f38ece398101e31df6a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"13 -

We offer insights into how a DAO is employed to facilitate decision-making and discern the nature of the issues about which decisions are made. DAOs promise horizontal and democratic decision-making. However, our research reveals a high concentration of voting power among a few members despite them not utilizing it to a great extent. Additionally, we identify the prevailing themes in decision-making processes within the organization through topic modeling. The primary topics identified are the effective management and governance of the platform and community and the platform’s strategic growth, with a particular emphasis on wearable technology. This research addresses fundamental questions regarding the democratic integrity of DAOs and their ability to achieve equitable representation and decision-making."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67984f38ece398101e31df6a","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6ddc"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"2051-2060","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574175e","mniswId":"575","fullName":"Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","shortName":"HICSS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"8a3c2154-085c-427a-b55a-ed004b652c68"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6797627efdbe8349c0804996","startDate":"2025-01-07","endDate":"2025-01-10","fullName":"58th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)","shortName":"HICSS","city":"Honolulu","country":"US","website":"https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/communities/aaeec9ed-5368-44e3-88e5-33ea62366840","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"641a7bf9-51fa-4240-8cdc-116a4703735b"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67b8c8a0fdbe83514c894ae4","5e7094ea878c28a0473c6ddc","67984f38ece398101e31df6a"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"67b8c7affdbe83514c894814","title":"Proceedings of the 58th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","year":2025,"isbn":"978-0-9981331-8-8","url":"https://hicss.hawaii.edu/","translation":false,"documentHash":"ef0ee6be-b7d4-499a-87cc-b4812dfe407f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Blockchain, Decentralized AutonomousOrganizations (DAOs), e-Democracy, e-Voting, OnlineGovernance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060663612"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af7df","name":"EWA","lastName":"LISTOPADZKA","uuid":"602170D731CB8BC74675E56BF1F15E5B7E34461D4423D09F3A0D7953CCAB89F5BE11BF727AA1360AA1E6CE3DBB6FE7F81345B5D798B4AAA5A92DE59D30A97C69","orcidId":"0000-0002-4581-2163","documentHash":"95386832-d3a2-443a-b745-7e257baeed67"}],"objectId":"67bb086efdbe835250bbc2e4","publicUri":"https://www.fnce.info/portoflio/ekonomia-i-zarzadzanie-w-xxi-wieku/","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Inteligentne, sprytne czy zrównoważone - jakie jest smart city","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af7df"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"121-134","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af7df"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"67013749fdbe8378ce1f5032","title":"Ekonomia i zarządzanie w XXI wieku.

However, the benefits of bank digitalization for small & medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remain ambiguous. Using a sample of 179,921 SMEs and their borrowing relationships with the 54 largest European banks from 2008 to 2019, we show that bank technology has disproportionally benefited SMEs' access to short-term as opposed to long-term credit. At the same time, we observe an average increase in the cost of intermediation to SMEs, though the effect is non-monotonic.

It is also argued that NGOs, by being permitted to participate in arbitral proceedings, ensure transparency, which is often regarded as one of the primary solutions to the negative reactions to investor-state arbitration. To that extent, this chapter will attempt to explore public interest litigation vis-à-vis amicus participation in investor-state arbitration. Notably, this chapter begins by examining why human rights are not assigned the desired importance in most investor-state treaties and agreements. The second section discusses why the ‘interests of the public’ in the host state need to be represented in investor-state arbitral proceedings. The third section delves into analysing the potential role that NGOs can play in representing ‘public interests’ and ‘human rights’ issues before the arbitral tribunals through recent case studies.

International institutions deliberating on dispute resolution mechanisms and strategies have been evincing interest in discussing claim funding in international arbitration. The Working Group III of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) is currently engaged with the access to justice (“ATJ”) rationale set forth by proponents of third-party funding in the context of an investor to state dispute settlement (“ISDS”). This chapter aims to discuss the potential overlap between the nascent practice of “not-for-profit third-party funding” (“TPF”) or “ideological funders” and the need to ensure the rule of law through disclosure in situations where TPF is identified. Although shrouded in mystery and less prominent compared to the traditional TPF, the author believes that the prevalence of not-for-profit funding is only set to increase in investment arbitration since a financial return on investment would not in usual circumstances be required to be given to that funder party. Through this chapter, the author will also attempt to define the contours of the rule of law in the context of TPF in arbitration and also elaborate upon the role of the rule of law in ensuring procedural fairness and natural justice in arbitration proceedings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c32b4f9543c72336543f66"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"103-125","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c32b4f9543c72336543f66"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"665efc404097073a824161ab","doi":"10.1007/978-981-16-8480-7","title":"Blurry Boundaries of Public and Private International Law: Towards Convergence or Divergent Still?","year":2022,"isbn":"9789811684791","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-16-8480-7.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"19a79639-f1d1-4c88-89b0-4cd788690dba","publisher":{"objectId":"60c3a9042467f01f2921406e","name":"Springer Nature Singapore","documentHash":"7dbc4e9a-8bb0-444d-b0fc-372487b66da3"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060706041"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"665f03724097073a8241d86e","name":"Gaurav","lastName":"Rai","documentHash":"a8b5e415-9e38-4639-a30a-5fb520386c11"},{"objectId":"60c32b4f9543c72336543f66","name":"Gautam","lastName":"Mohanty","uuid":"D1DAFD8526D8BC5BCEC352A57D986B7B2FB8FB1014A5605D373FB2C55F0E77F5B86E966BFD5E190EB678CBF2ECC0A0A4CF3E9770F41A39AB95E93A30023A091F","documentHash":"46695ff8-17b6-44c3-89d7-9a6959331d3c"}],"objectId":"665f03724097073a8241d86c","doi":"10.1007/s10991-022-09303-9","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10991-022-09303-9.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Hermeneutics of the Concept of Misrepresentation: Addressing the Quagmire of Damages and Compensation in Cases of Misrepresentation in Formation of a Contract Under Indian and English Law","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In England, fraudulent misrepresentation is governed by English common law and damages are provided under the Tort of Deceit whereas negligent and innocent misrepresentation is governed by the Misrepresentation Act, 1967. In India, fraud is governed by s 17 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (ICA) and misrepresentation by s 18 of the ICA. Notably, unlike in England where the remedies for fraud and misrepresentation are provided at separate avenues, in India, the relief to the innocent party in both cases is provided under s 19 of the ICA. This article discusses fraudulent misrepresentation & negligent/innocent misrepresentation and the quantification of damages thereof in contracts under the two legal regimes mentioned above. To that extent, the authors attempt to illustrate certain nuanced differences between the two legal regimes while also highlighting the similarities between English law and Indian law. For the purposes of this article, the authors refer to the Misrepresentation Act, 1967 and the seminal judgments of Derry v Peek, Doyle v Olby, East v Maurer and Smith New Court Securities Ltd. v Scrimgeour Vickers and discuss the “date of transaction rule” as enunciated by Lord Steyn while juxtaposing it with the judgments of the High Court of Delhi, and the Supreme Court of India. In the Indian context, the authors highlight the position of law as is apparent from two recent judgments of the Delhi High Court in NHAI v Pune Sholapur Road Development and Daiichi Sankyo v Malvinder Mohan Singh and Ors and also focus on the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in Avitel Post Stuidoz v HSBC Holdings (Mauritius)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c32b4f9543c72336543f66"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"477-500","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c32b4f9543c72336543f66","665f03724097073a8241d86e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e7241f2467f01e9307d617","title":"LIverpool Law Review","issn":"0144-932x","eissn":"1572-8625","documentHash":"0492da45-31e9-4b99-8e93-c4833ccd6a49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665f03724097073a8241d86d","year":"2022","volume":"43","number":"2","documentHash":"92bed776-4ca1-4ea6-a2ad-a3fc3aa6174d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060706239"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c4b92ffdbe8379b399446f","name":"Wang","lastName":"Ruomeng","documentHash":"2429891e-97c9-4eab-a31f-bbe6098a7de0"},{"objectId":"67c4b92ffdbe8379b399446e","name":"Julia A.","lastName":"Korosteleva","documentHash":"d7287e52-d594-44d1-ba00-b7980ad5dbae"},{"objectId":"60c321c79543c72336543e25","name":"MALWINA","lastName":"RZEPKA","uuid":"BFFA51FBC4E10901F15605CB8242F319C7931D915ED4CA5DE628A5B235A1043A87C4FB454D96273B193FDED2A3529535B5FB4ED1CBDFF5CFC0CFFF872DA2FE78","orcidId":"0000-0001-7994-5880","documentHash":"1b4b06d0-c581-44f8-8f39-48c6ed32a267"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa85","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kozłowski","uuid":"EE6F0287AD781F00E308CAAE4A6A56A6B976C6D9097AFA524E6BCA12894071C2F3A2FC6DDC00A4EE3FFD71F8648054750DA860FA2FE4ECB3C90008AC84F145CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2887-9067","documentHash":"cecce26e-a130-43ca-b0dc-dd363917e6af"},{"objectId":"5e7093a0878c28a0473ae049","name":"ANETA","lastName":"HRYCKIEWICZ-GONTARCZYK","uuid":"36B7034310CB5F5225D49FD7840FA74B9783C1EED355B74822887942602611678225D90A5FED460F17597FD7AC8396D53DD28F010226DD73222BD3FDCB3B4B85","orcidId":"0000-0002-2546-1829","documentHash":"3df64e20-723b-4f89-a952-c1ce4ec678e3"}],"objectId":"67c4b92ffdbe8379b399446d","publicUri":"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4850547","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Paradox of Progress: Technological Innovations in Banking and the Dual Impact on SME Bank Borrowing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigates the impact of technological innovations in banks on SME borrowing within the European Union. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset comprising 179,921 SME-bank lending relationships from 2009 to 2019, it explores how technological advancements in banking are reshaping traditional lending practices. Our empirical analysis documents that technological innovations in banks significantly impact both short-term and long-term credit growth for SMEs, highlighting the role of technologies in enhancing information efficiency. Additionally, our findings suggest that banking technology facilitates access to credit for SMEs by easing collateral requirements. However, we also uncover a paradoxical dual effect: while technology boosts informational efficiency, it also increases the borrowing costs for SMEs. Our study adds to the understanding of the nuanced role of innovation in banking, providing insights into the dualistic impact of technology on SME financing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae049","60c321c79543c72336543e25","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa85"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"online","pagesFromTo":"online","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae049","67c4b92ffdbe8379b399446e","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa85","67c4b92ffdbe8379b399446f","60c321c79543c72336543e25"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e71461b46e0fb0001c7b862","title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","issn":"1556-5068","documentHash":"2a76a626-8aa8-4a6a-8ccf-5a6bf9fa642e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"666c4f8240970729e3c520e7","year":"2024","documentHash":"69660388-59b4-4e44-acf3-ab2a39bff486"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SME financing, bank credit, bank technology, Innovation, collateral, cost of intermediation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060706287"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664b56e140970745fdeb794f","name":"Sai","lastName":"Ramani","documentHash":"d679f2c5-7cc6-46ad-a321-e1e383000190"},{"objectId":"60c32b4f9543c72336543f66","name":"Gautam","lastName":"Mohanty","uuid":"D1DAFD8526D8BC5BCEC352A57D986B7B2FB8FB1014A5605D373FB2C55F0E77F5B86E966BFD5E190EB678CBF2ECC0A0A4CF3E9770F41A39AB95E93A30023A091F","documentHash":"46695ff8-17b6-44c3-89d7-9a6959331d3c"}],"objectId":"664b56e140970745fdeb794e","publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003329688-12/law-commission-india-sai-ramani-garimella-gautam-mohanty","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"The Law Commission of India.

In modern India, the law commission is an ad hoc body providing advisory recommendations. This research critiques the work of the law commission, including its reports and recommendations, using a historiographic method that examines the historical context and evolution of the law commission. The research analyses the pre-independence work of the law commission and its impact on its current role and functioning.

However, as this article demonstrates, complete depoliticisation was never either the intention of ISDS or a realistic possibility – at least substantially. Investment protection standards, for example, serve as safeguards against political risk. In this context, the article demonstrates that it is the adherence to procedural international rule of law elements that can actually counter the growing politicisation and maintain ISDS’s neutrality. Thus, the first part explores the desirability of depoliticisation in ISDS, distinguishing between procedural and substantive aspects. The second part delves into the parameters of procedural depoliticisation, highlighting the tools employed and identifying instances of its strongest implementation. The paper concludes by explaining the impracticality and undesirability of achieving complete substantive depoliticisation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c32b4f9543c72336543f66"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c32b4f9543c72336543f66","67c44f7cfdbe8379b3946a7e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e71461b46e0fb0001c7b862","title":"SSRN Electronic Journal","issn":"1556-5068","documentHash":"4c58cb66-b58c-46ab-b8d7-2107c878c596"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64edd1274097076b09619813","year":"2023","documentHash":"65598fef-9260-43ea-8af3-9c96a4982a2a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["legitimacy crisis, politicisation, procedural safeguards, rule of law"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060708368"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664ba89940970745fdef1770","name":"Hamidou","lastName":"Tangara","documentHash":"fa19eca9-9112-40a3-a4ac-e16f9a76e58c"},{"objectId":"60c32b4f9543c72336543f66","name":"Gautam","lastName":"Mohanty","uuid":"D1DAFD8526D8BC5BCEC352A57D986B7B2FB8FB1014A5605D373FB2C55F0E77F5B86E966BFD5E190EB678CBF2ECC0A0A4CF3E9770F41A39AB95E93A30023A091F","documentHash":"46695ff8-17b6-44c3-89d7-9a6959331d3c"}],"objectId":"664ba89940970745fdef176e","publicUri":"https://www.electronicpublications.org/stuff/952","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cryptocurrencies in International Investment Law: The Dawn of a New Era of Protected Investments under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In January 2009, the first-ever cryptocurrency, i.e., Bitcoin, was launched. Since then, the market capitalization of cryptocurrency, as per reports, has grown to a billion-dollar industry ushering in the renaissance of the internet’s innovation. Inspite of the high usage of cryptocurrency, international law and particularly international investment law is silent regarding the impacts of cryptocurrencies on international trade and dispute resolution. While some tend to consider them as digital tokens and tradable assets, others consider them as a currency. In the traditional sense, international investment law governs the legal relationship between a foreign investor and a host state. Pertinently, the primary source of authority in international investment law are bilateral investment treaties (BITs) which impart necessary remedies to the foreign investor in case of any misconduct by the host state. Against the above backdrop, this article addresses the issue of contextualizing cryptocurrencies within the investor-state arbitration framework and determining whether disputes involving cryptocurrencies can be successfully tackled under international investment law. This article commences by ascertaining whether entities dealing with cryptocurrencies qualify as investors within the prevailing jurisprudence of international investment law and BITs. Thereafter, this article aims to determine whether cryptocurrencies qualify as investments under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention while juxtaposing it with the definition of ‘investment’ ascribed by the arbitral tribunal in the case of Salini v.

The objective of this study is to assess the essence of this contemporary social problem, including its causes and forms, as well as to exemplify the level of banking among individuals aged 50+ in Poland. This group is believed to at risk of financial exclusion. This will enable the estimation of the risk of deepening financial exclusion in the future in Poland and the recommendation of possible initiatives and actions to limit the exacerbation of this negative phenomenon in the future. The article demonstrates the results of a study conducted on a group of Poles. The research indicates that the majority of individuals aged 50+ have used basic banking services. The level of banking reached 89% among urban residents and 67% among rural residents. However, the group of underbanked individuals in urban areas accounted for 11%, while in rural areas, it was three times higher at 33% of respondents. These individuals are at risk of future financial exclusion because they do not utilize any other banking services/products and are selfexcluding based on costs, habits, and psychological determinants (trust in banks).

Research questions were: i) what are the ambitions of commercial banks in generating profits and how do they change in line with growth of the market of FinTechs? ii) to which extent traditional banking models and FinTechs solutions can be compared by assessed form the perspective of operations?; iii) which scenario out of tradition banking models, FinTechs only and a symbiosis between both is most likely to progress in the closest decade? Findings demonstrate that commercial banks’ financial ambitions continue to transform in line with product diversification they propose, commercial banks transform in their products and pricing will keep in balance between remaining competitive and profitable. The most realistic scenario in the future of commercial banks and FinTech solutions is the in-depth symbiosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","uid":"b2eiZUbb85g0FOaTA2KZtOw","uuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","name":"Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65b3273c40e3ff6b12a08a8f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","parentUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","rootUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0","6628ae0940970762632a93a4","65b3273c40e3ff6b12a08a8f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00a53ad49b31ccedce5aa","title":"Financial Markets, Institutions and Risks (FMIR)","issn":"2521-1250","eissn":"2521-1242","websiteLink":"http://armgpublishing.sumdu.edu.ua/journals/fmir/","documentHash":"3b7e48a4-8895-422d-aa82-339303a2542e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66254ab540970710350a14c3","year":"2022","volume":"6","number":"2","documentHash":"8e0332e8-c78e-43c7-81f3-c814952087cc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["analiza porównawcza","bankowość tradycyjna ","FinTechy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["commercial banks","institutional banking","traditional banking","FinTechs","symbiosis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060708839"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c73f2afdbe83570429d25a","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Cieślik","documentHash":"c0e0e536-e692-496c-97bd-d8ec8e7abaa9"},{"objectId":"67c73f2afdbe83570429d259","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Blyznyukov","documentHash":"01278cd9-d1e9-4658-9014-43975e4cd7a6"},{"objectId":"603f62bd9543c711bc6ea3d0","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Melnyk","uuid":"4143B117E9C3784673E4A8B8EA49B6FBEEF4DB897CF212CE3524181A286CB0DC76E05531D66E841B9A5457DA876B7418A5B86634ACF9BCFA270972D7972977E9","documentHash":"4f879ab1-9ea3-4383-9805-6fef8d6c1dc3"}],"objectId":"67c73f2afdbe83570429d258","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.61093/sec.7(3).1-9.2023","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The impact of digital education initiatives","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article summarizes the arguments and counterarguments of the scientific debate regarding the \nimpact of digital education initiatives on human capital development in Ukraine.

Similarly problematic is the assumption that the deadline for submitting a protest is a strict deadline with a simultaneous distinctness in the manner of its behavior compared to the Code of Civil Procedure.

This research paper aims to examine the impact of digitalization on the competitiveness of selected European countries by analysing key indicators that define digital progress and economic performance. Digital transformation has been identified as a fundamental driver of economic growth, innovation, and efficiency across various sectors, emphasizing the importance of digital technologies in shaping contemporary economies. The study utilizes a combination of correlation, canonical, and regression analyses to systematically explore the relationship between digitalization and competitiveness. Data for 10 European countries – Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Luxembourg, Denmark, and Portugal – was collected from the European Commission, World Economic Forum, and official sources from IMD and WIPO over the period from 2017 to 2022. The key indicators analysed include the Digital Economy and Society Index, Global Competitiveness Index, Global Innovation Index, E-Government Index, and R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP. These variables were selected to comprehensively assess the state of digitalization and its correlation with national competitiveness. Findings from the analysis suggest that digitalization has a profound influence on the competitiveness of the countries studied. High DESI and GII scores, indicating advanced digital integration and innovation capacity, are positively correlated with a higher GCI score, reflecting global competitiveness. Moreover, R&D expenditure emerged as a significant factor contributing to digital readiness and economic performance. The disparities in digitalization levels across countries highlight the uneven progress in adopting digital technologies, suggesting a need for policies that enhance digital infrastructure, skills development, and innovation ecosystems. The discussion emphasizes that digitalization drives the transformation of traditional business models, improves efficiency in manufacturing (Industry 4.0), and fosters innovation in services such as fintech, e-commerce, and public administration. However, challenges like the digital skills gap, regulatory barriers, and differences in infrastructure and policy readiness persist, impacting the overall ability of European countries to leverage digital transformation for competitiveness. The paper concludes by advocating for continued investment in digital infrastructure, balanced regulatory frameworks, and skill development initiatives to maximize the benefits of digitalization and enhance the competitive standing of European nations in the digital economy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w

public accountability. Studies in this area show how digital technologies are equipped to support more participative information-sharing and provide dialogic tools for interactions with forums. However, no research has yet examined how to engage forums and enable web-based accountability relationships. We address this gap by highlighting the need to adapt social media communication strategies for topic-specific discussions. Our analysis builds on a database containing 25,485 posts extracted from social media platforms used by 13 Polish municipalities and focuses on two different matters of discussion: posts related to public health during the COVID-19 pandemic and non-COVID-19 related posts. Moreover, during the analysis, we consider two social media communication strategies: passive and participatory. Our findings indicate that both communication strategies can generate forum engagement, which subsequently supports web-based accountability. They also demonstrate that, to support forum engagement, municipalities should avoid one-style-fits-all approaches to communication and instead tailor strategies to the specific subject of discussion. This study contributes to expanding academic debates on web-based accountability by illustrating how the use of social media communication strategies can help engage citizens in public forums to enhance accountability relationships."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603764e49543c7410626fca1","5e7093a1878c28a0473ae090","60c3048a9543c72336543a37","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa85"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"40","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"101859","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae090","5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c63","662556d840970710350a80f1","60c3048a9543c72336543a37","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa85","603764e49543c7410626fca1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e69","mniswId":"7307","title":"GOVERNMENT INFORMATION QUARTERLY","issn":"0740-624X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"07459837-132e-4330-8108-74ed654c41e3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662556d840970710350a80f0","year":"2023","volume":"40","number":"4","documentHash":"8a2bee5e-e935-46e6-b50d-8945831b00e4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Public accountability, Web-based accountability, Citizen engagement, Engaging communication, Social media"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060722094"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67984f38ece398101e31df6a","name":"Junaid","lastName":"Ahmed","uuid":"225B840B51B1035B506F5EFE7EB003DFA1B76B5C1FC6B60F12608322DBDB3AFF3FDFC0B98A3B667B7C139634430F96FA9639A97EAAB74FBE1C526BFEB8748A6F","documentHash":"24ba2a2f-2b1d-4e0f-b415-0dc953127e25"},{"objectId":"664b47a240970745fdea0c44","name":"Oon Kam","lastName":"Hoe","documentHash":"9cebdc03-e88a-427a-b4bf-0a588beefa46"},{"objectId":"664b47a240970745fdea0c43","name":"Au Yong Hui","lastName":"Nee","documentHash":"7e14e894-7275-4ba7-9d14-cbcc3ab2cdc0"},{"objectId":"664b47a240970745fdea0c41","name":"Yip Chee","lastName":"Yin","documentHash":"8b4eb9a7-45f4-4735-901f-ec55681c9003"}],"objectId":"664b47a240970745fdea0c3f","doi":"10.1007/s11356-022-22271-x","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-022-22271-x.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The rural consumer adoption of sustainable energy: a PLS-SEM-ANN approach of conceptual model development and cross-country validation of Pakistan and Malaysia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sustainable and alternative energy sources of biofuel and solar power panel have been revolutionizing the lives and economy of many countries. However, these changes mainly occur in the urban areas and the rural population section has long been ignored by policy makers and government in the provision of energy. It is only recently that solar and biofuel are finally making in road to provide cheap and clean energy sources to rural population. As a result, literatures on consumer behavior of rural population towards sustainable energy sources are still very scarce. The present research aims to fulfill this gap by developing a conceptual model to investigate the adoption of solar power and biofuel energy resources in the cross-cultural setting of Malaysia and Pakistan. The data was collected from the rural areas of Pakistan and Malaysia. The two-stage data analysis method of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) have been applied to satisfy both linear and non-linear regression assumptions, respectively. The results show that consumer in rural areas of Pakistan are willing and possess intention to adopt both biofuel and solar power for commercial and domestic use. Additionally, the results confirm that branding, economic, and altruistic factors are important in yielding intention to use towards biofuel and solar power panel in Pakistan which are validated by the results obtained in Malaysia. Other factors such as climate change awareness, retailer services quality, and ease of use are also important. The results offer wide-ranging theoretical and managerial implications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67984f38ece398101e31df6a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"5881-5902","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["664b47a240970745fdea0c41","67984f38ece398101e31df6a","664b47a240970745fdea0c43","664b47a240970745fdea0c44"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research","issn":"0944-1344","eissn":"1614-7499","documentHash":"a276ab08-d4e3-4e6f-8f21-94c32ed97f96"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664b47a240970745fdea0c40","year":"2022","volume":"30","number":"3","documentHash":"22da6a84-1a87-475a-a820-df6e0ea96548"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Solar power, Biofuel, Artificial neural network, Rural areas, Sustainable energy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060735613"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66c5a071fdbe837a868fb82d","name":"Brigitte","lastName":"Petersen","documentHash":"183bf55a-7ac6-4510-8f6f-f60be6abc688"},{"objectId":"66c5a071fdbe837a868fb82c","name":"Stephanie","lastName":"Krieger-Güss","documentHash":"3d0a4ddb-6200-4bf4-9383-dfff70e0415f"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a5406","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Bezat-Jarzębowska","uuid":"ECC437676C9060DFF06BEC02F478B7CD0F083E361CA15031F8A237A16D1CDFB39229E9B0E7A60F5FA9C2DDA2F2B6BDC06EE0E115A7BAAC7F9E3A320B3C074EAD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2464-8437","documentHash":"4f0b41c3-a349-430f-ab2a-0841ab18f7ac"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a047392150","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Jarzębowski","uuid":"514E526853E4CCBD426B907205AEFCCC4E194F0531D7CA19100E8740268F4AEC7AE05228E7293F719FEF277F86C975583960F43FF21AE991A265124C6D64CBA2","orcidId":"0000-0002-9394-577X","documentHash":"7c143554-bb8a-42e2-b7e1-9ed38fa6cab8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66c5a071fdbe837a868fb82b","doi":"10.3390/agriculture14081403","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/8/1403","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Integration of the Food Supply Chain as a Driver of Sustainability: A Conceptual Framework","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a conceptual framework aimed at exploring the connections between integration within the food supply chain and the three pillars of sustainability: economic, environmental, and social. The analysis combines theoretical insights with empirical research, specifically focusing on the economic aspect of sustainability, measured through efficiency. The study emphasizes the critical role of integrating participants across the food supply chain to achieve sustainability goals. It discusses methodologies for assessing integration levels within the chain, providing a theoretical and analytical basis for modeling integration and efficiency within the supply chain. To empirically validate these relationships, an extended stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) method was applied to selected sectors within the food processing industry. The results demonstrate that enhancing integration with suppliers and buyers can significantly improve efficiency within the food chain. In conclusion, through deductive reasoning, this study asserts that integration plays a pivotal role in advancing economic sustainability objectives within the food sector.

However, the role of national culture should be considered equally important. Hence, diferences in national culture are hypothesized to correlate with average fnancial capability levels at the country level. This study attempts to answer an important question: What is the relationship between culture and fnancial capability at the country level? The data for this study originate from four diverse sources provided by the World Bank (two datasets), United Nations, and Hofstede Insights. The\r\nfnal dataset includes data from 137 countries. As a measure of fnancial capability, we use an aggregate index combining fnancial behavior (account ownership) and fnancial knowledge. Culture is measured using six dimensions of national cultures from Hofstede Insights: Power Distance, Masculinity, Uncertainty Avoidance, Individualism, LongTerm Orientation, and Indulgence. The results show that certain dimensions of culture are strongly correlated with fnancial capabilities at the country level even after controlling for the level of economic development. Positive relationships between fnancial capability and\r\nthree cultural factors—Individualism, Long-Term Orientation, and Indulgence - are noted. In addition, Uncertainty Avoidance is negatively associated with fnancial capabilities. The observed relationships are non-linear. Specifcally, Individualism and Long-Term Orientation are positive correlates of fnancial capability up to a certain level (the score of 75 and 50, respectively, on the scale 0–100), Individualism is a positive correlate starting at the score of 25, while Uncertainty Avoidance is a negative correlate up to the score of 75."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w

Our results show that the topics of interest to people seeking psychological knowledge changed during the pandemic. In addition, the interests differ noticeably among the languages. We made two important observations. The first was that during the pandemic, people in most countries looked for new ways to manage their stress without resorting to external help. This is understandable, given the increased stress of lockdown and the limited amount of professional help available. We also found that academic topics, typically covered in university classes, experienced a substantial drop in traffic, which could be indicative of issues with remote

need for social scientists to embrace the new reality and incorporate visuals in their research. As a result, the importance of visual research, which centers on the use of visual sources, is growing. This paper provides an overview of how visual materials and related methodological approaches can be used in qualitative management and accounting research. Methodology/approach: We begin by reviewing the literature on the research methods, drawing from many disciplines such as sociology, organizational learning, management, and accounting. Next, we analyze three cases – already published papers in accounting – to illustrate how photography can be used in qualitative accounting research. Findings: There is a growing literature on visual research methods. Researchers have used visual materials as primary and secondary data and multiple methodological approaches. Visual methods can also be used in accounting research. Originality/value: This paper provides an overview of emerging methodological approaches that use visual materials and discusses how they can be incorporated into qualitative accounting research. Research limitations: Drawing a simple line between the various approaches presented in this paper is difficult as researchers can use visual material in unique ways throughout the research process. Therefore, the presented methodological categorizations can only help to better understand emerging visual research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae090","60c3048a9543c72336543a37"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"47","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"51-67","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae090","5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c63","60c3048a9543c72336543a37"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a753","mniswId":"200221","title":"Zeszyty Teoretyczne Rachunkowości","issn":"1641-4381","eissn":"2391-677X","documentHash":"79ecdfaa-c4a6-49fa-ab7d-31be2b7cec0a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c4b247fdbe8379b398bb67","year":"2023","volume":"47","number":"4","documentHash":"611813b9-2182-4b30-92dc-f22ce3976975"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["qualitative research methods, photography, visual analysis, visual methods,  photo-elicitation, photo-voice"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060803453"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6602be9c4097071d5ba51a2e","name":"Petko","lastName":"Kusev","documentHash":"ccaec5f8-0dc2-4bd0-bc28-1148f2cfd5cf"},{"objectId":"6040d3299543c711bc6ea8d6","name":"Diana","lastName":"Jaworska","uuid":"F3EDF9A73A93C5BCE9D7EAAD83CC282FAC389D8F16AFF7B6BE73757A658C0AE82AE0676E3442402A455ECAE8E6F7F8F10B0ABBD66428371E0825D31104AC6BFB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0068-759X","documentHash":"ca395758-344d-43e4-a9fd-0d0e98a508a4"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b77a4","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Rudzińska-Wojciechowska","uuid":"6C85CD14CEFDA29BC823315B5CFF4468CBEB184F60A362B7D5AD9DD9CDD23805D85002EEEE1C10D8C495723893C110560960CF06F8B389F3AD40E81EFBA1BAA4","orcidId":"0000-0003-3995-6803","documentHash":"a5a08c10-6f8c-4e28-b329-91a899797af6"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e7a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sekścińska","uuid":"C2834D231F21648339A080114F905FA4861AB06A00D86CB950BCBDC9566BA655C83B9A71660F089E7698473CF0703DA0714E774DFBF74C2794913C9DE5A6F508","orcidId":"0000-0002-6641-6506","documentHash":"9c93ed62-64b1-4240-a3e7-a28b233da6c1"}],"objectId":"6602be9c4097071d5ba51a2b","doi":"10.1027/1618-3169/a000576","publicUri":"https://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/pdf/10.1027/1618-3169/a000576","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Effects of Activating Gender-Related Social Roles on Financial                     Risk-Taking","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Previous studies observed differences between men and women in terms of their financial risk-taking. However, these differences may stem not only from the gender of the decision-maker but also from other factors, such as stereotypical gender social roles. Media content exposes both men and women to stereotypical portrayals of their gender, and this might temporarily activate thoughts related to their social roles. A question arises whether such activation might impact the way people make risky financial decisions. The present experimental study investigated whether temporarily activated gender-related social roles influence the risk-taking propensities of men and women (N = 319) in the context of gambling and investment choices. The results show that activating a stereotypically male social role (professional employee) made both men and women more prone to take financial risks relative to a control condition. Furthermore, activating a stereotypically female social role (homemaker) lowered the propensity to take financial risks in both genders for the investment domain and in women only for the gambling domain. This study contributes to the literature on gender differences in economic behavior by showing that researchers should not overlook sociocultural factors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","name":"Wydział Psychologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e7a","6040d3299543c711bc6ea8d6"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942a878c28a0473b77a4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"70","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"40-50","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e7a","6040d3299543c711bc6ea8d6","5e70942a878c28a0473b77a4","6602be9c4097071d5ba51a2e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c6d","mniswId":"6429","title":"Experimental Psychology","issn":"1618-3169","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0350ee59-64e1-44cf-b5f3-cae0a0a7c338"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6602be9c4097071d5ba51a2c","year":"2023","volume":"70","number":"1","documentHash":"f2dad4f3-ce76-4f1e-b839-0e69cedc9486"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gambling","gender-related social roles","investing","risk-taking"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060810356"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"603764e49543c7410626fca1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kovbasiuk","uuid":"0584D3C645BD4641B0918F2F121117954964E75AAF4D05901CFCE51559FEB375E9CB8D3A2B41FCA0EFBB1B4C1D41FA4686047F5A8F82345552F35EDA0473726E","documentHash":"9f9b6bbd-981e-478c-b561-7de37aab4de4"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae43c","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"JEMIELNIAK","uuid":"53CFE70C485ACD162D25E6F6787ADC13694279541C8F42641B73AB0946D056A25BA478DE54E7E57683C3560DF840064231B10BA26B376FA7FE50C044C3DD0AFC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3745-7931","documentHash":"56500846-384b-4cd5-bd65-4b5e2ff9f9a2"},{"objectId":"5e70936d878c28a0473a9519","name":"Leon","lastName":"Ciechanowski","uuid":"6F37A2C6763561599EF3660C99B6FABA730567F8BB5E9C03CE7EA7A5A697000480F08B8D32054FAC0269C8215FCA3A51ED8887D25C8AB7984B0D43A4C50D3397","orcidId":"0000-0002-4569-7222","documentHash":"80f95bf5-f961-4473-8b4a-b93da61769b6"}],"objectId":"664b41d440970745fde9bc58","doi":"10.1177/14034948231219833","publicUri":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/14034948231219833","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"A taste of ambrosia: Do Olympic medalists live longer than Olympic losers?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective:\nTo investigate the longevity of a large sample of Olympic Games participants, considering the interaction between different types of sports and medal awards.\nMethodolgy:\nData scraping from Wikipedia and Wikidata allowed us to collect a sample of 102,993 famous athletes.

We conducted a comparison of life duration on a subset of 17,194 elite athletes, predominantly male, dead at the time of analysis.\nResults:\nOlympic medalists’ lifespan was shorter than non-medalists. Athletes in such disciplines as boxing, weightlifting, ice hockey, cycling, football, swimming, and wrestling lived significantly shorter lives than the mean of the group of athletes. In contrast, the duration of life in athletes involved in athletics, rowing, fencing, artistic gymnastics, shooting, cross-country skiing, sailing, and equestrian sports was highest compared with the mean of the group.\nConclusions:\nDisciplines classified as engaging mostly power were linked to shorter lifespans, whereas those involving predominantly skill were associated with longer life durations. The interaction of being a medalist and sport was found to be significant. Medalists in the disciplines of athletics, basketball, boxing, equestrian sports, wrestling, and water polo had significantly shorter lives (the final item was insignificant after correction for multiple comparisons).

The city under analysis was Xalapa, the capital city of the state of Veracruz in Mexico. To accomplish our research goals, we employed a qualitative methodology. We conducted interviews with the government representative responsible for municipal solid waste management during the designated period, as well as with the proprietors of the 18 most prominent private waste collection centers. Additionally, we obtained relevant information from the government through the transparency platform. For our assessment, we utilized the waste-focused indicators provided by L. Girard and F. Nocca. Our analysis indicates that the city under investigation is not on the trajectory towards adopting a \"circular city\" model.

The initial study tested the utility of generative AI across diverse tasks and the significance of AI-related skills enhancement. The subsequent study explored interactions between humans and AI, analyzing emotional tone, sentence structure, and word choice. Our results indicate that incorporating AI can significantly improve organizational task performance in areas such as automation, support, creative endeavors, and innovation processes.

We investigate co‐operation around labour standards regulation for posted construction workers, focusing on bilateral co‐operation of labour inspectorates between Estonia and Finland and comparing it with co‐operation efforts between Poland and Finland, and Ukraine via Poland to Finland. The shifting patterns of labour mobility and employer efforts to recruit from less regulated sources mean that investment in bilateral relations can be undermined by the dynamic character of the pan‐European labour market. This article contributes to debates on EU regulatory governance by showing how transaction costs from co‐operation can decrease the effectiveness of transgovernmental network‐based governance; in the

Nowością w tym tomie jest próba podsumowania zmian, ukazująca skalę problemów, z jakimi skonfrontowana została sama Unia Europejska. Generalny wniosek jest z jednej strony pozytywny - w odpowiedzi na naruszenia zasady państwa prawnego, w orzecznictwie i praktyce działania Unii skonsolidował i rozwinął się unijny standard praworządności. Z drugiej natomiast strony kryzys praworządności z Polsce w okresie rządów PiS ukazał ograniczoną efektywność procedur unijnych i zachowawczą postawę wielu państw członkowskich UE."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709221878c28a047390557","5e709265878c28a0473950f2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"EDITOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e709221878c28a047390557","5e709265878c28a0473950f2"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-92-68-20381-1","pages":1168,"translation":false,"publicationPlace":"Warszawa","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7cc","mniswId":"20700","name":"Dom Wydawniczy i Handlowy Elipsa","documentHash":"1742eaae-fab4-40e8-862c-b5e3287b8f51"},"editors":[{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a0473950f2","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"21D5166306393F5C6A4E1811A9E18194B1588BFBAF1F6A38FC4B35FC1AD584E7DC2922C5CA8092D07E36C4A83AB7A329FCF954F777D3512463F1480428DD99D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-5867-8135","documentHash":"00ebb3d2-7141-40e8-adff-b0b0d9f48666"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a047390557","name":"JAN","lastName":"BARCZ","uuid":"977597DE215107C7476B6302DFCCC90CC0F479227EEC73EEAB7D5BBD7A55EDAED09E24A7BFCF10E40CD89ABCA1BC0BEB2CFA2CE51F40BB24419DCD7FF767C82A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2826-1945","documentHash":"46321f8a-7a2f-414a-8eab-93b25d456afb"}],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["praworządność","Unia Europejska","Europejski Trybunał Sprawiedliwości"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060919812"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6347782a7523402e3411ccaf","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Ryś","uuid":"B9D0B6C759387F63008C159CB5B3300B4A6D9CC553917246709C860A10F13AD3DFB5BC5E29668C6E1F00ED6AE5130B874DEECD47501D89299165840425628EDF","documentHash":"6e77cc63-30f4-4f88-ba94-d7011afec65b"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"KORZYŃSKI","uuid":"5EB44695C70620961A97244EC82193337F08313108E364F50DB6FAF1B1BC6B5678CEF6E184FAB5581BC5213D89BD383E7C870C706E6F46F1E18C44AFDD0245B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-6457-4965","documentHash":"57388e0f-aae8-4919-80cc-831b988cfc60"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d2a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Górska","uuid":"2F92749966FD9D9A45C03520226704E02A2DF287D1541D1EB4E80E157EF79684A42659B5A45A85E1EA58DFB61DDF13696BBB34BE7293FF6EA27F4AD93AF882EE","orcidId":"0000-0003-3406-5454","documentHash":"46f5fdd3-21e5-4042-93bc-1453dfaa92ad"}],"objectId":"67ed3410fdbe831b59a04258","doi":"10.1016/j.wsif.2024.103009","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S027753952400147X?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Challenging the status quo: A feminist analysis of gender dynamics, motivation, and empowerment in hackathons","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study explores gender differences in motivation, anxiety, and confidence within hackathon environments. It examines whether intrinsic and extrinsic motivations influence the relationship between gender and these psychological states. Data from HackYeah 2023 participants indicate that, while female participants do not report higher anxiety levels, they display marginally lower confidence compared to their male counterparts. Contrary to initial hypotheses, neither intrinsic nor extrinsic motivation significantly influences the gender-anxiety relationship. However, extrinsic motivation does partially mediate the gender-confidence relationship. These results challenge patriarchal structures and highlight the resilience and capabilities of women in competitive technological settings, emphasizing the need for feminist approaches to dismantle systemic biases. The study also discusses its limitations and the implications for future research and hackathon organization, underscoring the critical role of motivational factors in mitigating gender disparities in hackathons. The study underscores the importance of feminist interventions in hackathons to cultivate an environment where all genders can thrive equally."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398d2a","5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6347782a7523402e3411ccaf"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"107","pagesFromTo":"103009","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929a878c28a047398d2a","6347782a7523402e3411ccaf","5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479adb","mniswId":"20334","title":"Women's Studies International Forum","issn":"0277-5395","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"550a864d-d966-403b-ba98-c3416a2052bc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"680f774bfdbe83659c86d7ca","year":"2024","volume":"107","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"2e44100e-441b-4b78-8ec3-bbf34c1090d7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Technofeminism","Motivation","Gender","Hackathon","Empowerment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061017622"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed364efdbe831b59a0bd3b","name":"Katarzyna W.","lastName":"Sidło","documentHash":"3a5b367f-f4bf-40fe-91b8-9a19312fc7f5"},{"objectId":"602e51569543c7410626f0c4","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Polak","uuid":"3F15335F77359578D974668FA374850F6CAC2B2B43988993D7239C6B49FD4C5A2764FB3C1081D88C40442FBAA858EB872487AAE1644F1449BF17B0F1E89285FE","orcidId":"0000-0003-0970-3899","documentHash":"9f8b895a-aa6c-4022-9378-a2c36d7ecc0d"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b89ee","name":"CHRISTOPHER","lastName":"HARTWELL","uuid":"0A05F7F00A41C8BD7BAC30C51BD417D5CA79EE6330F81CBE2277DFEE564183CD1020B6F500B12DF2E8DC8B4A6259330D943D09BDF1D8BBE5C0470C4C38AE23E7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3340-1276","documentHash":"179776b6-e822-4b81-9eff-9b1fad2bb911"}],"objectId":"65b0cfe04097073c3fa082d0","doi":"10.1515/soeu-2022-0054","publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/soeu-2022-0054/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Physically Present but Spiritually Distant: The View of the European Union in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Polish people remain staunchly in favour of the concept of a European Union. Paradoxically though, there has been strong and continued electoral support for Law and Justice (PiS), its ruling party, despite its insistence on precipitating and then continuing multifaceted conflicts with EU institutions. This article examines the internal structural changes in Poland and the attitudes to the EU of Poland’s leaders; the article will argue that those attitudes have deepened pre-existing divisions over integration. By fusing the triple modernization theory of European integration with a two-dimensional concept of party-based Euroscepticism, the article shows how PiS’s ambiguous discourse on European integration, combined with an increasingly instrumental approach to the EU by the Polish electorate—and that electorate’s deepening polarization—have secured steady support for PiS from ostensibly Europhile voters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w

zidentyfikowanie determinantów wyników dla prywatnych pokoi oferowanych w ramach usług noclegowych typu peer-to-peer. Projekt/metodologia/podejście: bazując na danych Airbnb na poziomie pojedynczych lokali, projekt proponuje zastosowanie uczenia maszynowego i sztucznych sieci neuronowych do określenia determinantów wyników, zdefiniowanych jako roczne przychody, dla prywatnych pokoi oferowanych na platformie usług noclegowych typu peer-to-peer.\n\nWyniki: wyniki wskazują, że najważniejszymi determinantami przychodów były: maksymalna liczba gości, zdjęć, łazienek, lokalizacja nieruchomości i polityka odwołania rezerwacji, a także wysoka dostępność lokalu do wynajmu w ciągu roku. Najwyższe przychody zostały osiągnięte przez 2–3 osobowe pokoje wyposażone w co najmniej dwie łazienki, pokoje 4-osobowe, lub pokoje zlokalizowane najbliżej stacji kolejowej Warszawa Centralna. Jednakże nieruchomości wyposażone w co najmniej dwie łazienki wykazały tendencję do osiągania wyższych przychodów niezależnie od lokalizacji. Co więcej, wystarczająca liczba zdjęć i elastyczna polityka odwołania rezerwacji mogą zrównoważyć niedogodności lokalizacyjne i dostarczyć wyższych przychodów w porównaniu z centralnymi lokalizacjami.\n\nOgraniczenia/implikacje badawcze: ograniczeniem tego projektu jest to, że badanie obejmowało tylko jedno miasto na przestrzeni 12 miesięcy, co wprawdzie umożliwia odzwierciedlenie rocznej sezonowości, jednak może zawierać zdarzenia wyjątkowe. Powtórzenie analizy na danych z innych lokalizacji (miejskich lub nie) lub innych okresów stanowi rekomendację dla przyszłych badań.\n\nOryginalność/wartość: projekt wzbogaca nurt literatury opisującej determinanty przychodów na trzy sposoby. Po pierwsze, oferuje zastosowanie metod uczenia maszynowego do określenia cech lokalu oraz cech i zachowań gospodarzy, które sprzyjają osiąganiu wysokich wyników. Po drugie, w odróżnieniu od większości istniejących badań, ten projekt definiuje wyniki jako przychody, a nie jako cenę. Po trzecie, budując na hedonicznej teorii cen, projekt ten rzuca światło na sposoby zarządzania kompleksową ofertą prywatnych pokoi oferowanych w usługach noclegowych typu peer-to-peer, w odróżnieniu od całych domów/mieszkań, na których badacze koncentrowali się do tej pory."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Design/methodology/approach: Based on property level data of Airbnb, the applications of machine learning clustering and artificial neural networks methods were proposed to identify the performance determinants of private room performance defined as yearly revenue.\n\nFindings: The results indicate that the most important revenue determinants were maximum number of guests, number of photos, number of bathrooms, location, and cancellation policy, as well as high availability of the property throughout the year. The highest revenues were achieved by 2–3 person rooms with at least two bathrooms, 4-person rooms, or rooms located around the Central Railway Station. However, properties with at least 2 bathrooms tend to deliver high revenue, regardless of location. Furthermore, a sufficient number of photos and a flexible cancellation policy could offset location disadvantages and deliver higher revenues in distant vs. central locations.\n\nResearch limitations/implications: The limitations of this study are that it covered only one destination during a 12-month period, which encompasses yearly seasonality, but might include some exceptional events. Replication for other destinations (urban or non-urban) or timeframes would be valuable future research recommendations.\n\nOriginality/value: This study adds threefold to the P2PA performance determinants stream. First, it offers an application of machine learning methods to identify property and host features and behaviours that contribute to high performance. Second, as opposite to the majority of available research, it defines performance as revenue rather than price. Third, building on the hedonic price theory, it sheds light on how to manage a complex offer for private rooms in P2PA, in contrast to entire homes/apartments that researchers have focused on to date."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebed734752340254fc40a2c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"33-58","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebed734752340254fc40a2c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a34c","mniswId":"16504","title":"Problemy Zarządzania-Management Issues","issn":"1644-9584","eissn":"2300-8792","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"84284576-9302-4d92-8fb4-3d9a7854ed4f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["uczenie maszynowe","przychody","usługi noclegowe typu peer-to-peer","determinanty wyników","Airbnb"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["revenue","performance determinants","peer-to-peer accommodation","Airbnb","machine learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747174888005"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed34dbfdbe831b59a05421","name":"KAJA","lastName":"PRYSTUPA-RZĄDCA","documentHash":"d17d5780-8970-48ae-b50b-061e3e9b89c9"},{"objectId":"60c3048a9543c72336543a37","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Staniszewska","uuid":"4860896025565184D76485488F5AAFAFD544603B127E7EFDC9772B20E80B2BF6880ACA59BF6C259DA49D76C2D3CEC9F0F7A5A037F947E38F381DF030A7C0441D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8133-3629","documentHash":"27f635ca-5ef8-4afd-a7eb-7f51ea37d62e"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae090","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"DOBIJA","uuid":"12FF93BDE76C663B7B380560E1D67E379B9D3F85183998660388FAF0A8F42003BF9F59B16F0C91EDC77E7B2256DA6783C6F337B6018EAEA1E448C6666E41EC59","orcidId":"0000-0003-2957-6882","documentHash":"7a58bc43-597e-4e58-a1cf-2d2950ace45f"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d2a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Górska","uuid":"2F92749966FD9D9A45C03520226704E02A2DF287D1541D1EB4E80E157EF79684A42659B5A45A85E1EA58DFB61DDF13696BBB34BE7293FF6EA27F4AD93AF882EE","orcidId":"0000-0003-3406-5454","documentHash":"46f5fdd3-21e5-4042-93bc-1453dfaa92ad"}],"objectId":"618a5f932467f041c1f09f0a","doi":"10.1108/gm-01-2021-0004","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/GM-01-2021-0004/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Women’s journey to the top: the role of bonding and bridging social capital","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose Drawing on Putnam’s concept of social capital, this study aims to examine the oral life histories of women on management boards. It explores how the bridging and bonding forms of social capital are created and used to advance women’s careers to reach top management positions on corporate boards.  Design/methodology/approach This study is both explorative and interpretive. A total of 30 semi-structured interviews were conducted with female board members of Polish companies to gain access to their life histories.  Findings Women develop social capital to advance their careers. However, they mainly focus on bonding capital, which allows them to sustain relationships within their inner circle. Bridging capital, which extends relationships to advance women’s careers, is often overlooked if not neglected. It seems it is usually an external shock when women understand the importance of bridging capital.  Practical implications This study provides a better insight into how bridging and bonding capital help and/or distract women from reaching top managerial positions. It has potential policy-making implications for promoting women to leadership positions. The study results can guide organizations in providing equal opportunities for employees.  Originality/value This study builds on previous research regarding the accumulation of human and social capital by board members. It encourages academics and practitioners to critically consider the relationship between bonding and bridging capital and the promotion of women to top management positions.

First, it compares the Nash equilibrium outcomes between GD and SD and then contrasts them also with profit maximisation (PM). A plethora of Nash equilibria emerges, especially in the case GD versus PM (the ‘green delegation game’), depending on the public awareness toward environmental quality, ranging from the coordination game to the ‘green’ prisoner’s dilemma. Second, though the contract under GD incentivises managers for emissions, the environmental damage is lower than under SD. This is because the optimal tax more than compensates the incentive for emissions. These findings suggest that designing GD contracts paradoxically favours environmental quality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c6878c28a0473b09ae"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"223-249","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c6878c28a0473b09ae","67ed3669fdbe831b59a0c4c9","67ed3669fdbe831b59a0c4ca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ae4","mniswId":"5778","title":"Environment and Development Economics","issn":"1355-770X","eissn":"1469-4395","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c15a8669-e5ee-47db-850e-efb8d04e6f80"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["emissions tax","Cournot duopoly","‘green’ managerial delegation","abatement"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654557479"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b65b4","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Osiichuk","uuid":"19C0C78BEBF477C5D46FF10D37F7E5088846C07DA595B32820D38E55A1FDF346D90A09EE725E11D0A2E0E8365DE8EDFEB8D8B2A4DBCE125A7D4C243BDF33D295","documentHash":"2fb68138-792c-42ab-99dc-97566ba291b6"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae42a","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"WNUCZAK","uuid":"2A59475848BFFF15C0400FC714F84DAA35CA22F067D7AF4443F8EE2A5890A49E314D9EA481A74D47A3D77575B43730C142B18245D53A665C6688D8A748EFE608","orcidId":"0000-0001-6928-584X","documentHash":"759217c3-4012-4d25-99b0-b26a70eead63"}],"objectId":"61a6354d2467f0269e914369","doi":"10.1108/apjba-03-2021-0120","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/APJBA-03-2021-0120/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Do generous trade credit terms provide a competitive edge?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose The authors document a persistent negative link between contemporaneous trade credit provision and subsequent firm-level operating performance.  Design/methodology/approach Textual analysis of firms' profile descriptions is used to study the role of market segmentation and product differentiation in intermediating the nexus between trade credit and corporate performance. The paper relies on dynamic panel regression modeling to investigate the postulated empirical relationships. This approach allows to address endogeneity issues and to test a number of different model specifications.  Findings Despite fueling short-term sales growth, the more generous trade credit terms are found to be associated with lower post hoc margins and declining overall business profitability. The market share is not affected by firms' proclivity to provide trade credit suggesting that the latter may not be effectively used as a long-term growth enhancement strategy.

It takes progressively less time for incumbent senior officers to find a subsequent/concomitant board position with a network of social ties from prior workplaces facilitating career progress and prior experience being negatively associated with multiple positions. Officers’ social ties at the senior level are also shown to be positively associated with total compensation and with the likelihood of cross-industry career transition in both executive and supervisory roles.

The lack of adequate financial cushion can translate into financial hardship at any age, but its effects can be especially severe in later adulthood. The authors evaluate whether financial literacy can prevent individuals from depleting the stock of liquid financial assets below a predefined minimum level.  Design/methodology/approach Defining financial resilience as the ability to maintain the value of household savings above the level of 3-monthly incomes, the authors examined whether financial literacy is (1) prospectively associated with the probability of losing financial resilience and (2) the probability of gaining financial resilience among financially vulnerable middle-aged and older adults. To this end, the authors applied the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates. Data were retrieved from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe with the sample comprising 13,718 adults aged ≥ 50 years in (1) and 12,802 in (2).  Findings The authors show that financial literacy plays a protective role for financial resilience. Its role is not symmetrical and protects more against the loss of financial resilience than it contributes to the gain of financial resilience. Among individuals aged 65–74, the association between financial literacy and financial resilience is weaker than among adults in the middle-age (50–64) and among the oldest (75+).  Social implications Fostering financial literacy can be important to help middle-aged and older adults maintain a good quality of life and favorable living standards.  Originality/value Given the scarce evidence on the links between financial literacy and financial resilience among middle-aged and older adults, the article contributes to the literature by examining whether financial literacy retains its protective role in later stages of the life course."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709267878c28a047395135"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"40","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1718-1748","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709267878c28a04739512f","5e709267878c28a047395135","67ed3011fdbe831b59a0057a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d59878c28514547c440","mniswId":"8653","title":"International Journal of Bank Marketing","issn":"0265-2323","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5b7c7d17-9d52-443e-aab9-20545d0a6900"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Financial literacy","Savings","SHARE","Middle-aged and older adults","Financial resilience"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654658098"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed34eafdbe831b59a0583b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Muniak","documentHash":"01b39ea7-555b-494e-9226-b340c2b02aaf"},{"objectId":"67ed34eafdbe831b59a0583a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Grzyb","documentHash":"3ce2599a-651d-4a46-bb22-901a7f637ec3"},{"objectId":"67ed34eafdbe831b59a05839","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Kosim","documentHash":"63dace30-50b6-4676-bb84-9af3909b3889"},{"objectId":"67ed34eafdbe831b59a05838","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Dolinski","documentHash":"57635d85-4051-4ba9-bb18-460b671a1f5f"},{"objectId":"67ed34eafdbe831b59a05837","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kulesza","documentHash":"314758ec-7dfd-4b77-be8a-a730e105a3f0"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae43c","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"JEMIELNIAK","uuid":"53CFE70C485ACD162D25E6F6787ADC13694279541C8F42641B73AB0946D056A25BA478DE54E7E57683C3560DF840064231B10BA26B376FA7FE50C044C3DD0AFC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3745-7931","documentHash":"56500846-384b-4cd5-bd65-4b5e2ff9f9a2"}],"objectId":"63aead21409707109b9fa951","doi":"10.1016/j.erap.2022.100767","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1162908822000184","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The chameleon effect, the temporal aspects of mimicry and their impact on service measurement","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nIn an experiment conducted in a natural setting, we test the link between mimicry, the amount of time during which the mimicry behavior takes place, and its impact on service quality.\n\nMethods\nCable TV clients (n = 120) were randomly assigned to six experimental conditions (2 mimicry conditions: verbal mimicry vs. no mimicry x 3 interaction time: 5 vs. 10 vs. 15 minutes).

The analysis was conducted both from the perspective of the formal foundations of national legislation on space exploration, which is supposed to reflect the international obligations of the country in this area, and from the perspective of the interests of all stakeholders who bear the main burden of carrying out this risky activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b3878c28a0473af662"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"3","issue":"170","pagesFromTo":"95-119","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67f6484bfdbe837d21412424","5e7093b3878c28a0473af662","67f6484bfdbe837d21412425","67f6484bfdbe837d21412426"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a399","mniswId":"27438","title":"Przegląd Sejmowy","issn":"1230-5502","eissn":"1230-5502","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"820e8a40-da32-4b39-a299-42d7c26bd08f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Polish space law","liability for space damage","space insurance","Polish act on space activities","delimitation of outer space"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654689517"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63aead0c409707109b9fa6c3","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Lewandowska","documentHash":"db87b8df-f261-4df2-ae98-7d96abc9accf"},{"objectId":"603764e49543c7410626fca1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kovbasiuk","uuid":"0584D3C645BD4641B0918F2F121117954964E75AAF4D05901CFCE51559FEB375E9CB8D3A2B41FCA0EFBB1B4C1D41FA4686047F5A8F82345552F35EDA0473726E","documentHash":"9f9b6bbd-981e-478c-b561-7de37aab4de4"},{"objectId":"5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f8a","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Brzezicka","uuid":"52B22E294B5630B57D578F8E1A1B329F44E976097AF57DC9EC9C0B55885D9EA8A5B7949089C3149071C256AE4088F559478A791983CEEE7DDEDAC8B988317F45","orcidId":"0000-0003-1950-4180","documentHash":"ce9c13b0-8235-451c-a712-5f17dd2598b5"},{"objectId":"5e70934c878c28a0473a6b76","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Kowalczyk-Grębska","uuid":"49DEE0D11A85891332A34EAB59756D8A9F4E31B5908B9918A0636C3B758F5FFD83B4B6A85EECF9DFA48DD7EA4D02ADB9279E905FBD96B56A68B3FFBB5815820F","orcidId":"0000-0002-2294-5529","documentHash":"001ed52a-0cfb-4bbb-a1d9-d451907ee66d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aead0c409707109b9fa6c1","doi":"10.3389/fnins.2022.834954","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.834954/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Neuroanatomical predictors of complex skill acquisition during video game training","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It is known that the outcomes of complex video game (VG) skill acquisition are correlated with individual differences in demographic and behavioral variables, such as age, intelligence and visual attention. However, empirical studies of the relationship between neuroanatomical features and success in VG training have been few and far between. The present review summarizes existing literature on gray matter (GM) and white matter correlates of complex VG skill acquisition as well as explores its relationship with neuroplasticity. In particular, since age can be an important factor in the acquisition of new cognitive skills, we present studies that compare different age groups (young and old adults). Our review reveals that GM in subcortical brain areas predicts complex VG learning outcomes in young subjects, whereas in older subjects the same is true of cortical frontal areas. This may be linked to age-related compensatory mechanisms in the frontal areas, as proposed by The Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition. In the case of plasticity, there is no such relationship – in the group of younger and older adults there are changes after training in both cortical and subcortical areas. We also summarize best practices in research on predictors of VG training performance and outline promising areas of research in the study of complex video game skill acquisition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","uid":"bbri63cV925_nCYguCmj8bQ","uuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","name":"Uniwersytet SWPS","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934c878c28a0473a6b76","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f8a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","parentUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcba","rootUuid":"55baf644-3dc9-4855-a45b-d6b971a17256","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603764e49543c7410626fca1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":" 16","pagesFromTo":"1-23","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["603764e49543c7410626fca1","63aead0c409707109b9fa6c3","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f8a","5e70934c878c28a0473a6b76"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d67","mniswId":"6856","title":"Frontiers in Neuroscience","issn":"1662-4548","eissn":"1662-453X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f9ba7011-af5c-4840-89f0-735fd5e00d9e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["individual differences","MRI","video game training","predispositions","complex skill acquisition","performance enhancement","Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654733420"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed35eefdbe831b59a0a3de","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Niesiobędzka","documentHash":"4844b67e-a84d-411d-8440-258c607da43c"},{"objectId":"67ed35eefdbe831b59a0a3dd","name":"Ewa Wanda","lastName":"Maruszewska","documentHash":"8d7a072c-58a8-4081-bf82-82b47f7edab8"},{"objectId":"5e7093a0878c28a0473ae048","name":"SABINA","lastName":"KOŁODZIEJ","uuid":"1BA6478C8D3B5E356F5E40EB4F736DFF8D0B43EA6A4BABA84CAF16F9F43EB0CC6231E1ADF9B87EF16B86A72F359A11FB1B4B8F8EBF9FD1B3C242531751D3485D","documentHash":"1b3af02f-4fb7-4d77-af6d-21205bf5c813"}],"objectId":"651d3e0340970737b84a5b07","doi":"10.1108/medar-11-2021-1505","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MEDAR-11-2021-1505/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Why is it so hard to provide a faithful representation?

This article  develops a readily applicable econometric method for  delineation that considers functional aspects of cities and  their surroundings. We perform delineation analysis using  the data for 78 Polish core cities, grouping them by  population size. Using the satellite data on lights emitted at night, population density, commuter numbers as well  as the number of houses and apartments built in each  commune, we apply a threshold regression model to  determine the boundaries of functional urban areas. Our  main results suggest that the mean radius of functional  urban areas (FUAs) around the largest (most populous)  cities is, on average, 21 km, while it is between 13 and 16  km for smaller cities. We then test how the econometric  results compare with the perceptions of local inhabitants  through a citizen science project (CSP) conducted as a  robustness check"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709435878c28a0473b8326"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"80-113","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67f62c7dfdbe837d213ee777","67f62c7dfdbe837d213ee778","5e709435878c28a0473b8326"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479dbd","mniswId":"5382","title":"Economics and Sociology","issn":"2071-789X","eissn":"2306-3459","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"871958ee-750f-4caa-902a-4ba6ac551528"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["night-lights","core city","Poland","urban functional areas","delineation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654786153"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050e1","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ziemba","documentHash":"02eb3b20-356d-4cfb-9e35-095db5d9fb76"},{"objectId":"67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050e0","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Paliszkiewicz","documentHash":"05c2468b-c35d-4003-b02f-3b040fb13477"},{"objectId":"67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050df","name":"Rūta","lastName":"Kazlauskaitė","documentHash":"4c294aec-ee6e-4022-b669-772631e73f76"},{"objectId":"67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050de","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Ejdys","documentHash":"87184caa-06ef-41b5-821d-f6c2c8125c98"},{"objectId":"67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050dd","name":"Cong Doanh","lastName":"Duong","documentHash":"b9769151-aab3-4559-ba2f-7eb7f656a05b"},{"objectId":"67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050dc","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wach","documentHash":"37c44c88-4d21-4717-a26c-25f986c23c84"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"KORZYŃSKI","uuid":"5EB44695C70620961A97244EC82193337F08313108E364F50DB6FAF1B1BC6B5678CEF6E184FAB5581BC5213D89BD383E7C870C706E6F46F1E18C44AFDD0245B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-6457-4965","documentHash":"57388e0f-aae8-4919-80cc-831b988cfc60"},{"objectId":"5e7093a0878c28a0473ae050","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"MAZUREK","uuid":"6F14C61CD8998931267E3467C3C13EB0C7CDAFE5813551F765C5D597D1AF75DF75F1E761BCC18C3D069CB2D1D7FC5557B9B541A37BED7FF39EA320211E468741","orcidId":"0000-0002-0047-6944","documentHash":"f5ffdcde-dd89-4d89-9228-3b0e58e57fa4"}],"objectId":"64b672df4097072492b2d317","doi":"10.15678/eber.2023.110201","publicUri":"https://eber.uek.krakow.pl/index.php/eber/article/view/2113","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The dark side of generative artificial intelligence: A critical analysis of controversies and risks of ChatGPT","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective: The objective of the article is to provide a comprehensive identification and understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in business. This study sought to develop a conceptual framework that gathers the negative aspects of GAI development in management and economics, with a focus on ChatGPT.\n\nResearch Design & Methods: The study employed a narrative and critical literature review and developed a conceptual framework based on prior literature. We used a line of deductive reasoning in formulating our theoretical framework to make the study’s overall structure rational and productive. Therefore, this article should be viewed as a conceptual article that highlights the controversies and threats of GAI in management and economics, with ChatGPT as a case study.\n\nFindings: Based on the conducted deep and extensive query of academic literature on the subject as well as professional press and Internet portals, we identified various controversies, threats, defects, and disadvantages of GAI, in particular ChatGPT. Next, we grouped the identified threats into clusters to summarize the seven main threats we see. In our opinion they are as follows: (i) no regulation of the AI market and urgent need for regulation, (ii) poor quality, lack of quality control, disinformation, deepfake content, algorithmic bias, (iii) automation-spurred job losses, (iv) personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, (v) social manipulation, weakening ethics and goodwill, (vi) widening socio-economic inequalities, and (vii) AI technostress.\n\nImplications & Recommendations: It is important to regulate the AI/GAI market. Advocating for the regulation of the AI market is crucial to ensure a level playing field, promote fair competition, protect intellectual property rights and privacy, and prevent potential geopolitical risks. The changing job market requires workers to continuously acquire new (digital) skills through education and retraining. As the training of AI systems becomes a prominent job category, it is important to adapt and take advantage of new opportunities. To mitigate the risks related to personal data violation, social surveillance, and privacy violation, GAI developers must prioritize ethical considerations and work to develop systems that prioritize user privacy and security. To avoid social manipulation and weaken ethics and goodwill, it is important to implement responsible AI practices and ethical guidelines: transparency in data usage, bias mitigation techniques, and monitoring of generated content for harmful or misleading information.\n\nContribution & Value Added: This article may aid in bringing attention to the significance of resolving the ethical and legal considerations that arise from the use of GAI and ChatGPT by drawing attention to the controversies and hazards associated with these technologies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","5e7093a0878c28a0473ae050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"7-30","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050dc","67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050dd","67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050de","67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050df","5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","5e7093a0878c28a0473ae050","67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050e0","67ed34b8fdbe831b59a050e1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479df5","mniswId":"5769","title":"Entrepreneurial Business and Economics Review","issn":"2353-883X","eissn":"2353-8821","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"27f34d1f-5af5-4ee8-b4fc-2add6a8853f2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["technology adoption","ChatGPT","artificial intelligence (AI)","chatbot industry","OpenAI","technostress","digital transformation","generative artificial intelligence (GAI)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654856562"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6178b9a97523400564d4316b","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bujak","uuid":"49B2B7049FA19BDFEA5C9997BF0952835CF05E5E85D0FFE89CE2364E100A3D53EC56E5826AA53E8CE8060AE07336EA24B2D29844A64F5C702E4BEEDE942D850E","documentHash":"53001478-3703-44fb-bfa8-51bfc56f90d6"}],"objectId":"664b4c8f40970745fdea5235","doi":"10.24425/pyil.2023.147185","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/130106/PDF/PYIL_42_2022_21_Bujak_Chien-Huei%20Wu,%20Law%20and%20Politics%20on%20Export.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Chien-Huei Wu, Law and Politics on Export Restrictions.

To expand knowledge on state hope, we validated its measure by testing alternative factorial models. With two cross-sectional studies, we aimed to validate the factorial structure of the Polish version of the State Hope Scale (SHS-PL). Study 1 involved 242 Polish employees (158 women) aged 18–64 years, and Study 2 involved 953 Polish adults (704 women) aged 18 to 75 years. The results demonstrated that the bifactor model was the best representation of the structure of state hope. It simultaneously captures the global aspect of state hope and its two specific dimensions: agency and pathways. The results also revealed that the SHS-PL scores showed full scalar invariance across genders and across two age groups. Finally, the total score as well as the agency and pathways scales achieved acceptable levels of reliability (in both studies, the Cronbach's α coefficient was greater than .85 for all scales) and validity: Correlations of the SHSPL scores with dispositional hope and with positive and negative affect conformed to the theoretically expected pattern of results.

This is confirmed not only by legal doctrine and the reports of non-governmental organisations, present on the ground despite all the restrictions, but also by interim-measure orders issued by the ECtHR against the Polish government. In the first part of the text, the authors summarise the situation, recalling the most important events that took place on the Polish–Belarusian border. The second part discusses the most important obligations of the EU arising both from the treaties creating it and also from the secondary legislation adopted on their basis. The juxtaposition of the EU’s actual response and the obligations written on paper may lead to the conclusion that the EU’s actions are insufficient under EU law. Relying on the texts of legal acts and other available information, the authors argue that the EU’s actions, in a certain amount of compromise with political interests, even detract from its credibility as an organisation that also aims to protect human rights externally.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709265878c28a0473950f2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"57-86","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ed31abfdbe831b59a0211b","5e709265878c28a0473950f2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479c9e","mniswId":"496784","title":"Bialystok Legal Studies","issn":"1689-7404","metadataSource":"ERIH","documentHash":"5228ab43-134e-4735-bd8e-dd901b0ab505"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pushbacks","refugees","European Union","Council of Europe","migration","NGOs","interim measures","ECtHR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654896079"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed3641fdbe831b59a0ba8d","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Niesiobędzka","documentHash":"4480f6cf-79b2-49cc-861d-76dcfc948285"},{"objectId":"67ed3641fdbe831b59a0ba8c","name":"Ewa Wanda","lastName":"Maruszewska","documentHash":"12dc4d50-e2da-45ff-8f0d-eebda645756b"},{"objectId":"5e7093a0878c28a0473ae048","name":"SABINA","lastName":"KOŁODZIEJ","uuid":"1BA6478C8D3B5E356F5E40EB4F736DFF8D0B43EA6A4BABA84CAF16F9F43EB0CC6231E1ADF9B87EF16B86A72F359A11FB1B4B8F8EBF9FD1B3C242531751D3485D","documentHash":"1b3af02f-4fb7-4d77-af6d-21205bf5c813"}],"objectId":"655b2a1e409707162ff178e4","doi":"10.1108/cemj-08-2022-0091","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/CEMJ-08-2022-0091/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The effect of income and expense shifting on the corporate income tax evasion","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose - This paper aims to present a study on the effect of income and expense shifting on the corporate income tax evasion – an example of intentional noncompliance practiced by tax agents. The authors expected that the tool used would differentiate the extent of understatement of tax liability. Design/methodology/approach - Two experiments were conducted in which young (N = 62) and experienced (N = 68) tax agents read a scenario placing them in a position of an employee responsible for tax planning and calculations of tax liabilities. The respondents’ task was to decide about the extent of the tax liability understatement using income or expense shifting. Findings - Research demonstrated significantly higher extent of corporate income tax understatement when using income shifting compared to expense shifting in case of experienced tax agents (Study 2) and on tendency level among young tax agents (Study 1). Research limitations/implications - Results of the studies might be of interest to managers paying attention to tax procedures within the company, governmental agencies investigating corporate tax evasion, as well as educators responsible for tax agents’ initial training and lifelong learning. Originality/value - This study concentrates on tax agents who are employed in companies and corporate income tax evasion, which has not been analyzed in the literature so far."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae048"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"364-373","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae048","67ed3641fdbe831b59a0ba8c","67ed3641fdbe831b59a0ba8d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a05c","mniswId":"27472","title":"Journal of Management and Business Administration Central Europe","issn":"2450-7814","eissn":"2450-8829","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f1543a31-e597-49d0-bc3a-c88c91054ee3"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Income shifting","Domain knowledge","Expense shifting","Tax evasion"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654902936"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed3250fdbe831b59a0309a","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Staszewska","documentHash":"cb399235-80b1-4341-b558-ab406a45be2a"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473addc6","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"KUBA","uuid":"7C4132C31C9532910EFF9BB25C90D918BF5DD05ECD321FB80B6822E75820F36A36560ED84C7180E10BCFAC5847A33353483DD4FA84B4A511A419B66B57485370","orcidId":"0000-0002-9090-4737","documentHash":"f989a450-880a-4572-bd16-b64d29e3ac44"}],"objectId":"656daa4340970749a862d850","doi":"10.4467/25444654spp.22.014.15688","publicUri":"https://www.ejournals.eu/sppips/2022/Tom-29-Zeszyt-2-2022/art/21588/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Profilowanie pomocy dla bezrobotnych – dotychczasowe doświadczenia i nowe wyzwania z perspektywy praw człowieka","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The dynamic development of modern information and communication technologies, enabling data collection on a much larger scale than before, has contributed to a change in the way services are provided also in the public sector.

The article is based on an online survey conducted in spring and summer 2020 among 740 Polish and Lithuanian return migrants from the UK who returned to Poland and Lithuania. International migration helped them, above all, to acquire both English language communication skills and to learn teamwork - soft skills which are important for career development. In both groups of Polish and Lithuanian return migrants, international migration accelerated three key processes: 1. starting to make independent decisions, 2. becoming financially independent from their parents and 3. finding stable employment. In both groups, becoming financially independent was linked significantly to the high level of soft skills acquired abroad."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a05de","67ed3d8efdbe831b59a1436c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"48","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"159-174","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a05de","67ed3d8efdbe831b59a1436c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a415","mniswId":"497330","title":"Lubuski Yearbook","issn":"0485-3083","metadataSource":"ERIH","documentHash":"83b1ca55-6808-4a80-9dcb-9e39d22d8095"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["kompetencje miękkie","mobilne wchodzenie w dorosłość","migranci powrotni"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["soft skills","return migrants","mobile transitions to adulthood"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654913215"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c3048a9543c72336543a37","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Staniszewska","uuid":"4860896025565184D76485488F5AAFAFD544603B127E7EFDC9772B20E80B2BF6880ACA59BF6C259DA49D76C2D3CEC9F0F7A5A037F947E38F381DF030A7C0441D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8133-3629","documentHash":"27f635ca-5ef8-4afd-a7eb-7f51ea37d62e"},{"objectId":"6042ff059543c711bc6ea95c","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Kaczmarek-Ciesielska","uuid":"B8236C4FCC62C3BAAFBA41C19559D279AACFCAA402C9E1B1CEAED91B2A38B372FD5D2E2D348DB9DF5A969E81EFE0C617137C46020A426732FA2B62646CB8009A","documentHash":"396a5883-8270-40d0-8f7a-ad9f9dedff00"},{"objectId":"5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c63","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Grossi","uuid":"EC6A8B6AAA4ACFB3C5FDE1A1F5702A4EA5FD5597C93E1B61F71BEB460C22383A547905C702224DF4E7ACABF08203677650A6E3A4841CA046B1CB9E8BFCDC0271","documentHash":"dbdbc09c-3622-485e-9f62-31f4a9f52b5c"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae090","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"DOBIJA","uuid":"12FF93BDE76C663B7B380560E1D67E379B9D3F85183998660388FAF0A8F42003BF9F59B16F0C91EDC77E7B2256DA6783C6F337B6018EAEA1E448C6666E41EC59","orcidId":"0000-0003-2957-6882","documentHash":"7a58bc43-597e-4e58-a1cf-2d2950ace45f"}],"objectId":"662553cf40970710350a6cdb","doi":"10.5465/amproc.2023.10760abstract","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5465/amproc.2023.10760abstract","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Visualising and Measuring Public Values in Smart Cities.

We build an analytical framework using the collaborative governance and public value theories to show how smart city creators and users perceive the visualization and measurement of multiple values. We applied photo-elicitation interviews with 40 city creators and city users, and used visual sources created by the researchers. The photographs were used to expand the ideas about capturing value from various smart city projects. We analyzed public value from an economic, societal, and environmental perspective and found that public value perceived by city creators is not always aligned with city users. While we found general agreement in relation to environmental values, in the case of social and economic value, the perceptions of smart city users diverge from the those of smart city creators. We also found that the multi-actor reality and in-group pressures may influence the lack of a coherent vision of smart cities among the creators, which results in relatively lower fulfillment of users’ expectations. This paper explores how the combination of different interests, actors and values affect performance measurement in a certain reality of smart city initiatives in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae090","60c3048a9543c72336543a37","6042ff059543c711bc6ea95c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2023","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"10760","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"662553cf40970710350a6cdc","fullName":"Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management","shortName":"AOM","website":"https://aom.org/events/annual-meeting/past-annual-meetings/2023-putting-the-worker-front-and-center","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"ea45013b-f871-4628-b45c-21ed748b2032"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"662553cf40970710350a6cdd","startDate":"2023-08-04","endDate":"2023-08-08","fullName":"The 83rd Annual Meeting of the Academy of Management","shortName":"AOM","city":"Boston","country":"US","website":"https://aom.org/events/annual-meeting/past-annual-meetings/2023-putting-the-worker-front-and-center","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"435621e3-ea33-4ca4-b34d-ecf89e12cff6"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c63","5e7093a1878c28a0473ae090","60c3048a9543c72336543a37","6042ff059543c711bc6ea95c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60c9afe22467f0039ff2db53","title":"Academy of Management Proceedings (Proceedings)","issn":"0065-0668","eissn":"2151-6561","websiteLink":"https://journals.aom.org/journal/amproc","documentHash":"9d9eecb5-550b-45b6-be2a-bfd6a2b2658c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662553cf40970710350a6cde","year":"2023","volume":"2023","number":"1","documentHash":"95dc3e65-9571-4b76-b8ac-a2c1b3bce063"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654944567"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed3658fdbe831b59a0c044","name":"Ying","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"ee42d8bc-c3d8-49f2-85b8-02784af43942"},{"objectId":"67ed3658fdbe831b59a0c043","name":"Richard G.","lastName":"Cowden","documentHash":"d5fa1f59-4111-4667-9cc4-a651c4217f96"},{"objectId":"67ed3658fdbe831b59a0c042","name":"Tyler J.","lastName":"VanderWeele","documentHash":"0a1078ad-9bd7-4160-b7c6-dac5115fed45"},{"objectId":"67ed3658fdbe831b59a0c041","name":"Mattew T.","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"b067554e-da8f-4fe3-9d01-84b3da4e8872"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395135","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"BIAŁOWOLSKI","uuid":"5EA6FAFF8510554AB7FC2B6944DFFFE812E560BA3226A3041EB4630262230911203359A2BFE5EBEE409C783DB5DF9C05BA7E5400412537ACAEC0886F6101DEC3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4102-0107","documentHash":"c4f35ab4-f7d6-46ba-a632-fd79254facd2"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739512f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Węziak-Białowolska","uuid":"F93F7D3BB00DBE20DA1E85C30F715F2490FD9F9AF590C21565628D05710DA3C89E98D7DB0C6D413C7B6E34A20EC5BD147C0D461B6026AF63DC3CB16C042A832F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2711-2283","documentHash":"5571faff-c945-40da-a060-f75f2d453941"}],"objectId":"6784dad4fdbe831a38044905","doi":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.115841","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953623001983?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Psychological caring climate at work, mental health, well-being, and work-related outcomes: Evidence from a longitudinal study and health insurance data","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Psychological climate for caring (PCC) is a psychosocial factor associated with individual work outcomes and employee well-being.

Employees of a US organization with a worker well-being program provided data for the analysis. Longitudinal survey data merged with data from personnel files and health insurance claims records comprising medical information on diagnosis of depression and anxiety were used to regress each outcome on PCC at baseline, adjusting for prior values of all outcomes and other covariates. PCC was found to be associated with lower odds of subsequent diagnosed depression, an increase in overall well-being, mental health, physical health, social connectedness, and financial security, as well as a decrease in distraction at work, an increase in productivity/engagement and possibly in job satisfaction. There was little evidence of associations between PCC and subsequent diagnosed anxiety, character strengths, and work-family conflict.

The path chosen in the reviewed book Collaborative Society by Dariusz Jemielniak and Aleksandra Przegalinska is to capture a wider cultural shift that is taking place because ICT (Information and Communication Technology) tools allow people to take advantage of their willingness to cooperate. The key thesis is that the collaborative society goes far beyond the sharing economy – or economy in general. New means of digital communication, remix culture and citizen science prove that this shift is transforming social relations and our mutual relations. The authors search for the manifestations of a collaborative society in joint online production and consumption, cooperation of social activists and hacktivism, social production of knowledge, gadgets encouraging cooperation and subversive connection in digital spaces. The future of cooperation is a story about the tension between the new, communal mode of production and its distortion by capitalism. The book is a good summary of the research area and an introduction for anyone looking to explore this topic or participate in a collaborative society."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["600a892b9543c753022219d7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"55","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"93-97","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["600a892b9543c753022219d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac05ad204581b62ebb29","mniswId":"201207","title":"Zagadnienia Naukoznawstwa","issn":"0044-1619","documentHash":"94f47c53-5333-4198-9387-766246338659"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633442b14097070fbdd7cfd2","year":"2022","volume":"55","number":"3","documentHash":"27effddf-8cff-4f09-b2ed-e6f0bc365b57"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["collaborative society, sharing economy, peer production, platform capitalism, citizen science, quantified self, internet of things, hacktivism"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654971813"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed3648fdbe831b59a0bcc2","name":"Inna","lastName":"Tselinko","documentHash":"8cd824b6-f0ab-41e7-90a0-fe8d6c39d401"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b65b4","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Osiichuk","uuid":"19C0C78BEBF477C5D46FF10D37F7E5088846C07DA595B32820D38E55A1FDF346D90A09EE725E11D0A2E0E8365DE8EDFEB8D8B2A4DBCE125A7D4C243BDF33D295","documentHash":"2fb68138-792c-42ab-99dc-97566ba291b6"},{"objectId":"5e7093a0878c28a0473ae074","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"MIELCARZ","uuid":"CC96D7EDE0460FAFD826A318DB4FC14C3F6E17DBFF4C8F389F509D370248A01A4D169DB4027B7B627CB929212A04CC4ABDDB904B0368FAD22FFFD441EE05FECE","documentHash":"140887b5-c765-48fe-a40a-5fa79af0beab"}],"objectId":"664b439740970745fde9d03c","doi":"10.1108/cemj-12-2021-0156","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/CEMJ-12-2021-0156/full/html#sec003","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The right time for a big bath: asset impairment recognition in earnings management","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article investigates the patterns of asset impairment recognition in search of signs of “big bath” earnings management practices across an internationally diversified sample of public companies. It also elucidates the incentives that may underlie such practices and explores possible safeguards embedded in the existing corporate governance mechanisms. The article applied static panel and binary logit models to an international firm-level panel dataset of 1045 public companies observed between 2003 and 2018. Our empirical results suggest that recognition of asset impairment has no determinate impact on earnings volatility. Investigating the possibility of “big bath” earnings management practices, the authors found no impact of asset impairment recognition on total senior executive compensation in firms, which pay performance-based remuneration. The quality of corporate governance has appeared to impact the firms’ intertemporal proclivity to recognize asset impairment with those having the more entrenched and management-controlled boards being more likely to time impairment recognition by delaying it during exceptionally good and exceptionally bad years. While generally unlikely, recognition of asset impairment in a period with a recorded negative operating performance is found to be closely associated with key executive departures. The article corroborates the salient role of corporate governance mechanisms in shaping the intertemporal patterns of asset impairment recognition. The possible remedies to the phenomenon should be derived therefrom."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae074","5e70941c878c28a0473b65b4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"189-206","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae074","5e70941c878c28a0473b65b4","67ed3648fdbe831b59a0bcc2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a05c","mniswId":"27472","title":"Journal of Management and Business Administration Central Europe","issn":"2450-7814","eissn":"2450-8829","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f1543a31-e597-49d0-bc3a-c88c91054ee3"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Asset impairment","Earnings management","Big bath"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654971842"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5fcb8f30085dcb666aca2af6","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Pieczka","uuid":"F27CFBCCD843DAD15682D5DC8FA18B83FA14CC57C87BBC81C27E171B7996D71F93ADE4E2B7C514D3311EC38CF020C423A5D91ACB81B8DE3876217958B7523E85","orcidId":"0000-0003-4628-0549","documentHash":"50701874-5f2c-4555-a616-c0284d8bb218"},{"objectId":"5e709470878c28a0473bd028","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Miszczyński","uuid":"02974E70AFDCE1B835F7F83C8FDAB94C2A50ECEA6D03F466BE4A5DCA1EE78F384538BF69CA3862DC024313289012CE80B314C4EA0762793F6082E22A6F5756A9","documentHash":"cf1c0715-1611-4df5-8a3f-7064ef6adf71"}],"objectId":"67ed3434fdbe831b59a0442b","doi":"10.1108/cemj-02-2024-0057","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/cemj-02-2024-0057/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Meaningful app-work?

This study explores whether such work can be considered meaningful for food delivery couriers in Poland.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis research adopts a qualitative, case-study approach, conducting 30 in-depth interviews with food delivery couriers in Poland. The study investigates how these workers perceive the meaningfulness of their work, focusing on the interplay between subjective and organisational aspects of their work.\n\nFindings\nThe findings reveal that despite the precarious nature of app-based work, couriers often find meaningful experiences through perceived autonomy, gamified control and the physical demands of their job. The study highlights the dual nature of app work, where the same elements that contribute to worker engagement and a sense of independence also perpetuate exploitation and job insecurity.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe study’s reliance on a convenience sample of 30 interviews conducted via social media may not represent the broader population of food delivery couriers.

Introduction of the Bounded Leadership Model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose The main purpose of this paper is to test the relationship between leadership competencies and effectiveness, with constraints as a mediating variable, and to introduce the main assumptions of the Bounded Leadership Model (BLM).  Design/methodology/approach The total sample included 242 leaders in a top managerial position. Data were collected directly from leaders via self-reports. In total, five hypotheses were formed which related to the relationship between leadership competencies and effectiveness and the role of constraints. Hypotheses were tested by analysing several regression models and mediation effects. Moreover, internal consistency and construct validity were assessed by calculating Cronbach’s alpha and assessing the intercorrelations between study variables.  Findings The study results demonstrate that leader’s competencies are positively related to leadership effectiveness. The authors also found an indirect effect of leadership competencies on effectiveness via constraints. Overall, it can be concluded that the scales included in the BLM have satisfactory reliability and validity indicators.  Practical implications The paper examined the relationship between leadership competencies and effectiveness with constraints as a mediator. Moreover, it introduces the BLM which takes a broader view on leadership and includes variables that seem to play an important role in leaders’ adjustment and success. These findings can be applied in different training processes and also in assessment and development centres to serve as a facilitator in the process of enhancing leadership competencies and effectiveness and in overcoming leadership constraints.  Originality/value The study overcomes previous research limitations because it offers a selection of leadership competencies that play an important role in leadership effectiveness, as well as may serve as a potential facilitator in the process of overcoming individual constraints. This knowledge can be used for future research and practical purposes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","5e7093a1878c28a0473ae095","5e7093a0878c28a0473ae042"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"596-611","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae095","5e7093a0878c28a0473ae042","67ed34e9fdbe831b59a05820","5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cbf","mniswId":"13545","title":"Leadership and Organization Development Journal","issn":"0143-7739","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2d684c3f-fd3e-4072-84c8-3a12b40d60a2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Leadership","Competence","Constraints","Effectiveness","Model","Influence"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654982093"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a0878c28a0473ae046","name":"ANNA","lastName":"PUDŁO-JAREMEK","uuid":"BF6F929AF40D7928BD2F832D7099456FC9687BC573EB555F5FD2F39FE42E02160876B088B763A614D0F842677ECEE5280E9C8EF0FE88FE1A80AAF06939A0D436","documentHash":"cb15b6d5-dfa0-4b85-b063-8d2f31bab7e9"}],"objectId":"67ed3146fdbe831b59a013a2","doi":"10.36128/priw.vi52.1054","publicUri":"https://www.prawoiwiez.edu.pl/piw/article/view/1054","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"(Nowe) kompetencje Sądu.

VW and the decision of the Polish Supreme Court of 12 May 2022, both connected with the infamous “dieselgate”. The cases concerned claims of the owners of Volkswagen cars equipped with the “defeat devices” that manipulated the emissions tests. The question decided by both courts was whether claimants may enforce their tort claims for damages against the manufacturer in the Member States where the cars where acquired. CJEU found that they do and the Polish Supreme Court followed suit. The article analyses both cases against the background of existing case law of the European Court under Article 7(2) of the Brussels I Regulation. According to the well-established case law of the Court, the place of harmful event is to be understood both as the place where the event leading to damage is located, as well as the place where the damage occurred. Regarding the place of damage, the author takes the view that it occurs not in the state where the car is acquired – as found by CJEU - but where it is registered and used. This in itself should not, however, suffice to establish the jurisdiction of the court at the place of damage. In each case (and not only when the damage is purely financial) the court must confirm under the individual circumstances of the case that this place is suitable as the forum for resolving the dispute. Among these circumstances the most important is that of the foreseeability for the defendant that because of his or her actions he or she can be sued at the given forum. This possibility to foresee should be established on the basis of defendant’s actions undertaken in the forum. In cases where a defective product is the source of liability (such as in VKI v. VW) these are in particular: marketing products in that state or directing advertising activities thereto. The paper also compares European solutions with those adopted in US. The author argues that the CJEU should more bold in looking into an American standard that requires “some act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws” and thus protect the defendant from being sued in a place of damage that is loosely connected with the case."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae036"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"139-182","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae036"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a343","mniswId":"200407","title":"Problemy Prawa Prywatnego Międzynarodowego","issn":"1896-7604","eissn":"2353-9852","metadataSource":"ERIH","documentHash":"6c0894ff-207d-4428-b33d-f78dfee4832a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["rozporządzenie Bruksela I","afera spalinowa","Volkswagen","jurysdykcja krajowa","miejsce zdarzenia wywołującego szkodę","delikty"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["torts","Volkswagen","dieselgate","place of harmful event","jurisdiction","Brussels I Regulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654982656"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed33c1fdbe831b59a03d46","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Ryś","documentHash":"b384199f-da1d-4672-9fed-e5e311b69921"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d2a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Górska","uuid":"2F92749966FD9D9A45C03520226704E02A2DF287D1541D1EB4E80E157EF79684A42659B5A45A85E1EA58DFB61DDF13696BBB34BE7293FF6EA27F4AD93AF882EE","orcidId":"0000-0003-3406-5454","documentHash":"46f5fdd3-21e5-4042-93bc-1453dfaa92ad"}],"objectId":"67ed33c1fdbe831b59a03d45","doi":"10.1109/mc.2024.3502248","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Breaking Barriers: Increasing Female Participation in Hackathons","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Despite hackathons’ growing popularity, female participation remains low due to various \nreasons, such as predominantly male-dominated environments, masculinities, and practical \nchallenges such as childcare responsibilities.

In countries in Central Eastern Europe, a safe and successful transition from energy produced from coal requires societal changes, as well as public and private financing. The aim of this study is to examine and better understand how different psychological factors influence young citizens' intention to engage in activities directed at coal energy reduction financially. In our pilot study, we enlisted respondents from the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia because the analysis of the main sources of energy generation in these countries provided evidence that they are behind in embracing the European Commission's strategy and meeting the renewable energy sources target. Based on a questionnaire survey, we found that Central Eastern European citizens' intention to pay higher taxes to reduce energy use from coal was moderate. Using Ajzen's theory of planned behavior, we also found that only two variables, attitude, and subjective norms, are strong determinants of environmental intentions for young Central Eastern European citizens.

Although financial security has been shown to play a protective role in emotional well-being, little is known about the protective role of different types of family assets on mental health and well-being. Using longitudinal survey data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) collected between 2004 and 2017, we examined the role of different types of family assets in emotional well-being and depression. A multivariate proportional hazard model with time-varying covariates was used. We found that family assets may play a significant protective role against depression, loneliness, and a decreased quality of life. Different forms of family assets may play diverse roles in protecting against the risks of ill-being and mental ill-health; however, their roles in increasing the chances of overcoming ill-being are less pronounced. Promotion of saving behaviours and proper financial management can help protect against adverse well-being and health outcomes in middle-aged and older adults."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709267878c28a047395135"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"88-105","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709267878c28a04739512f","5e709267878c28a047395135","67ed2f9dfdbe831b599ffe29"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c818","mniswId":"11074","title":"Journal of Family and Economic Issues","issn":"1058-0476","eissn":"1573-3475","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2a131606-8581-4935-9083-31003af683a7"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CASP-12","Types of savings","and older adults","Middle-aged &#x0D","SHARE","Emotional well-being","Financial security","Quality of life"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655052854"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"604098189543c711bc6ea6dd","name":"Nina","lastName":"Kotula","uuid":"4E7AB44BE4BF25710A7FDB280797BDE0D7BA6A1A65D718E3DA16EBC435D4ACBFAA916D38A7724398B672F2387278F5610B993117EA4BB9706EDB4F09A88FDE40","documentHash":"636ab29c-fa05-4cc0-8c36-f0f01f3d010d"},{"objectId":"5e7094b8878c28a0473c2547","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Małagocka","uuid":"582A11FF55A8880F0100122C869885D2A75CEB8AF74DC2A7A8E78C4A88739E8066FECA6AEAE027E6F5D2D19F827BC4A25960F7E9CA5C4A58501680F01E3033A3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2544-2094","documentHash":"3f59437e-c1d8-4263-8281-3fed5922c958"}],"objectId":"67bccfcafdbe833d437b70ff","doi":"10.1108/cg-01-2024-0060","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/cg-01-2024-0060/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Meeting market and student expectations: the synergy of sustainability and educational transformation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between digital transformation and sustainable development within the context of higher education institutions.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis paper uses a systematic review methodology to analyze the intersection of digital transformation and sustainability in higher education institutions, drawing on academic sources and institutional reports.\n\nFindings\nUniversities face a dual challenge of advancing digital transformation while integrating and enhancing sustainable development, necessitating a balance between inclusivity and innovation to meet the evolving demands of a digital-centric world and global sustainability goals.

Recent theory has been introduced on reconceptualizing leadership as neurodiverse, and reconceptualizing workplaces and social phenomena as neurodiverse friendly. A recent autism and employment integrative review highlighted how there is little leadership research that addresses neurominority leadership outcomes. The review also highlighted that the majority of published research should be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes. This symposium introduces new research that utilizes mixed methods to examine neurominorities' leadership and the social influence of colleagues. The research in the symposium explores consequences of neurominority identities and how neurominority identities affect outcomes at the individual and firm levels of analysis. The symposium ends with how future neurodiversity leadership and social phenomena research can increase methodological rigor and yield positive outcomes from neurominority employee contributions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c3048a9543c72336543a37"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2024","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67d1f65cfdbe831921408343","67d1f65cfdbe831921408344","67d1f65cfdbe831921408345","67d1f65cfdbe831921408346","67d1f65cfdbe831921408347","60c3048a9543c72336543a37","67d1f65cfdbe831921408348","67d1f65cfdbe831921408349","67d1f65cfdbe83192140834a","67d1f65cfdbe83192140834b","67d1f65cfdbe83192140834c","67d1f65cfdbe83192140834d","67d1f65cfdbe83192140834e","67d1f65cfdbe83192140834f","67d1f65cfdbe831921408350"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60c9afe22467f0039ff2db53","title":"Academy of Management Proceedings (Proceedings)","issn":"0065-0668","eissn":"2151-6561","websiteLink":"https://journals.aom.org/journal/amproc","documentHash":"9d9eecb5-550b-45b6-be2a-bfd6a2b2658c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6744a1f1fdbe832ec1f59103","year":"2024","volume":"2024","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"2a64042e-7307-4923-b878-083654208a47"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655058427"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396595","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Jędrzejewski","uuid":"ED6E61854CFE3E9DED75C2DF5AC422AC0066E9675425C64256E0A29DBDD1DC36B8DAD158412994186CE4442C09E33F47A1EAC093A23067AE02A00522606D61F2","orcidId":"0000-0001-6582-202X","documentHash":"af3976ae-57a6-416e-862d-168a5facaee5"}],"objectId":"67e25d50fdbe831b5988b206","doi":"10.48292/2024-soczynski-siumuc-jedrzejewski","publicUri":"http://etykamediow.pl/media/attachments/2024/03/16/program-2023.pdf","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"ChatGPT jako rozwiązanie technologiczne wysokiego ryzyka a perspektywy jego regulacji","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"ChatGPT – technologia wysokiego ryzyka a możliwości jej regulacji.\nW ciągu ostatnich miesięcy technologia przetwarzania języka naturalnego, w szczególności ChatGPT-3, a następnie ChatGPT-4, zdobyła ogromną\npopularność, przyciągając ponad 100 mln użytkowników w ciągu pierwszych 60 dni po premierze.

In the overwhelming majority of cases, acquirers’ prior acquisition experience plays no role in shaping short-term post-acquisition returns. Lower returns are associated with serial acquirers especially if the series of acquisitions occurs within the same industry. Likewise, significantly lower cumulative returns are observed if the acquiree is a state-owned entity.

(A case Study of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal)\n\nThe aim of the article is a reconstruction of the Constitutional Tribunal’s understanding of references to foreign law and jurisprudence. The research sample consists of judgments concerning: (i) the Lisbon Treaty; (ii) shooting down a civil aircraft; (iii) control of the objectives of a political party; (iv) data retention. Other judgements are referred supplementary. The article focuses on the internal point of view of the Constitutional Tribunal. It analyses how the Tribunal describes and understands the references to foreign law and foreign case law. It also discusses how the Tribunal uses that references. The main argument is that the Tribunal does not perceive its practice (i.e. references to foreign law) as comparative constitutionalism or comparative thinking. Consequentially, maybe it is not justified for scholars to criticize this practice as comparatively flawed. The article ends with a call to view the Tribunal’s references differently since the references to foreign law are an element of the non-linguistic context of the interpretation of constitutional provisions. It is also closer to an argument from authority than a comparative one."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a047399743"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"91-115","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929f878c28a047399743"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850ccfa","mniswId":"498363","title":"Przegląd Konstytucyjny","issn":"2544-2031","metadataSource":"ERIH","documentHash":"812f7c3f-df0b-43b9-82cf-14e6b37df6cb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["comparative constitutionalism","constitution","comparative law","Poland","Constitutional Tribunal","comparative argument"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655063918"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6348c9aa7523402e34121eda","name":"OLGA","lastName":"PROTSIUK","uuid":"FDC857531FD88B09D6151FBC958AF975A9121DF28CA247CBB153681C2C0CF082BFC6D9CA315B0C86F8125EFC5DAC4F6BB24E83F52D3699F2F4F4FFA6B82209D8","orcidId":"0000-0001-6796-0493","documentHash":"e17f475d-97e2-425e-b263-b99a99450b6f"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"KORZYŃSKI","uuid":"5EB44695C70620961A97244EC82193337F08313108E364F50DB6FAF1B1BC6B5678CEF6E184FAB5581BC5213D89BD383E7C870C706E6F46F1E18C44AFDD0245B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-6457-4965","documentHash":"57388e0f-aae8-4919-80cc-831b988cfc60"}],"objectId":"67ed3425fdbe831b59a04354","doi":"10.1080/0144929x.2022.2159525","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0144929X.2022.2159525","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"What leads to cyberloafing: the empirical study of workload, self-efficacy, time management skills, and mediating effect of job satisfaction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study examined the direct and indirect relationships (via job satisfaction) between workload, self-efficacy, time management skills, and cyberloafing. Survey data were collected from 217 employees representing the retail jewellery industry. To analyse the data, structural equation modelling was performed using the AMOS software package. We discovered that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between workload, time-management skills, self-efficacy, and cyberloafing. Moreover, we found no direct effect of workload and self-efficacy on cyberloafing. However, we observed that time management skills are negatively associated with cyberloafing. Thus, the findings of this study suggest that cyberloafing is a counterproductive form of withdrawal behaviour, which is a response to job dissatisfaction associated with high workload, low self-efficacy, and poor time management skills. The research results are discussed within the context of their theoretical and practical impact. The current findings are expected to facilitate further cyberloafing research and highlight the importance of job satisfaction in employees’ cyberloafing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","6348c9aa7523402e34121eda"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"200-211","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","6348c9aa7523402e34121eda"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454772e7","mniswId":"2297","title":"Behaviour and Information Technology","issn":"0144-929X","eissn":"1362-3001","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"24613254-1981-48f7-b279-e245f8acf2f6"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["time management skills","self-efficacy","workload","Cyberloafing","job satisfaction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655063932"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a0878c28a0473ae03e","name":"JOANNA","lastName":"KIELIN-MAZIARZ","uuid":"77019331FF2177BDACEBE264CA92FC2872D9BF42D0BBDFB81F2F5E235242ECB45F1D1F3278E0A8D4FDA7E5B7EC0302A8E5937746AD3608DB8358FFEADC9EE5A9","orcidId":"0000-0003-1728-3361","documentHash":"950a7aa6-b40e-408f-8d67-4fbce4fadb07"}],"objectId":"67ed324dfdbe831b59a03064","doi":"10.26485/sw/2022/34/2","publicUri":"https://ojsltn.uni.lodz.pl/Studia-Wyborcze/article/view/1903/1692","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Stwierdzenie ważności wyborów samorządowych, protesty wyborcze, protesty wyborcze","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Artykuł stanowi próbę kompleksowego przedstawienia polskiej regulacji dotyczącej protestów wyborczych i stwierdzenia nieważności wyborów samorządowych.

Wikidata is an interdisciplinary, multilingual, open collaborative knowledge base of more than 90 million entities connected by well over a billion relationships. It acts as a web-scale platform for broader computer-supported cooperative work and linked open data, since it can be written to and queried in multiple ways in near real time by specialists, automated tools and the public.

Moreover, the authors collected daily information on content generated by companies, users, and employees such as job posts, users’ reactions to posts, and employee profiles during a 44-day period, which allowed the authors to apply panel estimation techniques to estimate the determinants of corporate opinion leadership.\nFindings – The estimation results reveal that corporate opinion leadership and business revenue are positively and significantly correlated. Furthermore, after controlling for firm fixed effects and endogeneity, The authors show that corporate, user and employee-generated content (mediated by groups and skills) have a\nsignificant impact on corporate opinion leadership.\nPractical implications – Individual online opinion leaders are currently paying considerable attention to practitioners. However, professional networking platforms have also created an opportunity to establish\ncorporate opinion leaders who may play an important role in business. The study provides useful and practical insights on the activities that companies can undertake to develop corporate opinion leadership.\nOriginality/value – This study seeks to expand previous research on opinion leadership with a focus on the corporate dimension, which is increasingly visible on professional networking platforms. Contrary to former research that collected data on perceived opinion leadership, the authors obtained data directly from LinkedIn. Moreover, the authors contribute to signaling and social identity theories by exploring how professional networking platforms constitute an environment for signaling and developing multiple professional identities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","5e7093a0878c28a0473ae050"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"61","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"223-242","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c6878c28a0473b0989","67ed3494fdbe831b59a04e87","5e7093a0878c28a0473ae050"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d55","mniswId":"13868","title":"Management Decision","issn":"0025-1747","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"22622159-0b79-4ef1-89a1-04188dc7011b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Professional networking platforms","Linkedln","Corporate opinion leadership","Social media"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655064070"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67f52babfdbe837d2132879e","name":"Iga","lastName":"Wermińska-Wiśnicka","documentHash":"78301740-133c-45ac-bb55-7a1b4786cb19"},{"objectId":"67f52babfdbe837d2132879d","name":"Olga","lastName":"Czeranowska","documentHash":"7227f1f9-330e-4882-9101-1fe95579dd00"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a05de","name":"IZABELA","lastName":"GRABOWSKA","uuid":"CC3D312828290D6281F503367E126F68870644DE25B2C9BB0D230A23B2D827E0990E7197517BF92143AA9A4E9A1830D3EE0ABF965CADDDC44A6824095BC733E7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7957-4901","documentHash":"c1823893-c3ed-496c-818f-c549dd96b6dc"}],"objectId":"67f52babfdbe837d2132879c","doi":"10.4467/25444972smpp.24.025.20741","publicUri":"https://ejournals.eu/czasopismo/smpp","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Beyond Initial Boundaries: Two Decades of Polish Young Adult Migrants’ Labour Market Positionalities in the UK Post-EU Enlargement","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Since the 2004 European Union enlargement, the United Kingdom has seen a significant influx of \nPolish migrants, many of whom initially found employment in low-skilled roles due to their imme diate availability and low entry barriers.

Design/methodology/approach – Survey data were collected among a nationwide sample of women entrepreneurs in Denmark. Findings – The spillover of positive emotions from family to work can spur competitive performance if women entrepreneurs adopt an entrepreneurial strategic posture. This intermediate role of entrepreneurial orientation is particularly prominent among women entrepreneurs who experience their market environments as highly threatening to their success. Practical implications – For practitioners, this study identifies a key mechanism, an entrepreneurial strategic direction, by which positive work energy stemming from family involvement can enhance women entrepreneurs’ business success. The study also shows how this mechanism is triggered by resource-draining competitive markets that appear hostile instead of benign. Originality/value – The adoption of an entrepreneurial posture is an unexplored but critical factor through which women entrepreneurs’ sense of happiness at work, caused by their family involvement, can be leveraged into enhanced success at the organizational level.

Driven by this axiom, researchers and practitioners have turned their attention to the drivers of innovative work behavior of managers. In this study, we investigate whether organizational-based job attitudes (workplace belongingness and management support) are related to the innovative work behavior of managers directly or through the underlying mechanism of intrapreneurial intention.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nData were gathered from 201 managers working in various industries in Kosovo. Using structural equation modeling, we tested how management support (MS) and workplace belongingness (WB) are related to innovative work behavior (IWB) as a direct relationship and mediated by intrapreneurial intentions (INI).\n\nFindings\nThe study's findings reveal that the relationship between workplace belongingness and innovative work behavior is positive and significant. The relationship between management support and innovative work behavior is insignificant, but intrapreneurial intention fully mediates this relationship. The strongest relationship attested is between intrapreneurial intention and innovative work behavior, supporting the attitude-intention-behavior nexus.\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nOur study is limited to a single-country, cross-sectional study, which hinders generalization and is susceptible to reverse causation.\n\nOriginality/value\nOur study sheds light on the attitude-intention-behavior chain and provides insights for fostering innovative work behavior among managers. This is the first study to test the influence of management support and workplace belongingness as attitudes on innovative work behavior of managers from the lens of place attachment theory and perceived organizational support theory."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709460878c28a0473bbbff"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"online","pagesFromTo":"online","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ed33fefdbe831b59a04143","67ed33fefdbe831b59a04144","67ed33fefdbe831b59a04145","5e709460878c28a0473bbbff","67ed33fefdbe831b59a04146"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c0ec","mniswId":"6193","title":"European Journal of Innovation Management","issn":"1460-1060","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b30a05c3-1ebc-4f83-af6c-e665e63dddbd"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["innovative work behavior","intrapreneurial intention","workplace belongingness","management support","managers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655064247"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709277878c28a04739625f","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Studzińska","uuid":"76A4512006B4A677648217CF9A929DFB6FBB8475D139C79E2C74BE0902DCA8F800EB45D423C05CD0E11C1E81447EDE4732BC2A64B1E8F3F6333A019E971EB905","orcidId":"0000-0003-2524-6747","documentHash":"5f93d989-b5e5-4e00-85de-50133af32bb3"}],"objectId":"67ed3148fdbe831b59a013c3","doi":"10.36128/priw.vi47.776","publicUri":"https://www.prawoiwiez.edu.pl/piw/article/view/776","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Podstawy wyłączenia sędziego posiadającego kredyt frankowy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Instytucja wyłączenia sędziego pełni istotną funkcję w zapewnieniu jego bezstronności, a tym samym jest gwarancją sprawiedliwego procesu i sprawiedliwego orzeczenia.

The system asks and answers questions related to user's personality traits and person-job competency fit to give feedback, and potentially support migrant populations. The chatbot's response database is based on reputable socio-psychological tools and can be customised. The system's backend is written with Node.js, deployed to AWS and Twilio, and joined with Facebook through Graph and Messenger APIs. To our knowledge this is the first multilingual social chatbot deployed to Facebook and designed to research and support migrant populations with feedback in Europe. It does not have personality like other bots, but it can study and feedback on migrants' personality and on other customised questionnaires e.g., job-competency fit. The aim of a social chatbot in our research project is to help engage migrants with social research using feedback information tailored to them. It can help migrants to get knowledge about their psycho-social resources and therefore to facilitate their integration process into a receiving labour market. We evaluated the chatbot on a group of 53 people, incl. 23 migrants, and we present the results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602b4f7d9543c7410626dc33","67ed3018fdbe831b59a005e1","5e7092fb878c28a0473a05de"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"51–59","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ed3018fdbe831b59a005e1","602b4f7d9543c7410626dc33","67ed3018fdbe831b59a005e2","5e7092fb878c28a0473a05de"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e712ac846e0fb0001c28033","title":"Annals of Computer Science and Information Systems","issn":"2300-5963","documentHash":"1c4738e1-5181-470d-8c90-c66d98eb6517"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655064308"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed3426fdbe831b59a0436d","name":"PETER","lastName":"GLOOR","documentHash":"01ce73c2-b935-4a9a-b2fd-18aec62ce4cd"},{"objectId":"67ed3426fdbe831b59a0436c","name":"Tamilla","lastName":"Triantoro","documentHash":"169346db-340f-4b32-bbec-86e82272e9d8"},{"objectId":"67ed3426fdbe831b59a0436b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kovbasiuk","documentHash":"486c1592-18fb-403d-9537-5b04710ecafb"},{"objectId":"60c3447c9543c723365442d6","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Sowa","uuid":"6DB0CB95AFFC78665A396A62AFD255468E62C5F0ABB01AAEE8FCA156C191EEDBE590B4168317D9C2175A3EC57385648F679A06D873047CA3B9D9CFE511FF6750","documentHash":"b06ea4ac-015b-4f26-9020-b98eae2825e9"},{"objectId":"5e709414878c28a0473b5e30","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Przegalińska-Skierkowska","uuid":"041C3D9B24FCA330A9072351F72C3B512C00270749CA78E9B8E11919C3B56D257FE6704DEC5EECBBE0B84F7F12E777928C22F7CDA547A381B3F499B8380023D9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0864-8007","documentHash":"5cf9e0d5-791c-4c24-9f18-7227bcb517bf"},{"objectId":"5e70936d878c28a0473a9519","name":"Leon","lastName":"Ciechanowski","uuid":"6F37A2C6763561599EF3660C99B6FABA730567F8BB5E9C03CE7EA7A5A697000480F08B8D32054FAC0269C8215FCA3A51ED8887D25C8AB7984B0D43A4C50D3397","orcidId":"0000-0002-4569-7222","documentHash":"80f95bf5-f961-4473-8b4a-b93da61769b6"}],"objectId":"67bcd507fdbe833d437b982f","doi":"10.1108/cemj-02-2024-0067","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/cemj-02-2024-0067/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The personality profile of early generative AI adopters: a big five perspective","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Purpose</jats:title><jats:p>This pilot study aimed to evaluate the impact of the big five personality traits on user engagement with chatbots at the early stages of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The pilot study involved 62 participants segmented into two groups to measure variables including engagement duration, task performance and future AI usage intentions.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The findings advocate for the incorporation of psychological principles into technology design to facilitate more tailored and efficient human–AI collaboration.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This pilot research study highlights the relationship between the big five personality traits and chatbot usage and provides valuable insights for customizing chatbot development to align with specific user characteristics.

The authors compare several exogenous equilibria emerging in the symmetric sub-games in which the owner offers either the environmental delegation contract or the standard sales delegation contract: abatement and social welfare (resp. emission taxes) under environmental delegation are higher (resp. lower) than under sales delegation. The present work extends their model using a game-theoretic approach to analyse the asymmetric sub-games, in which only one firm adopts the environmental contract, and adds the contract decision stage. Results show that the environmental contract never emerges as the unique sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of this non-cooperative managerial decision game. Indeed, if the green R&D technology is efficient, the sales contract emerges as the unique Pareto-inefficient Nash equilibrium. Otherwise, if the green R&D technology is inefficient, multiple Nash equilibria in pure strategies exist (coordination game).

THE RESEARCH PROBLEM AND METHODS: In order to examine if e-prescriptions, in the light of legal and social conditions, can bring additional benefits compared to paper prescriptions, statistical data and legal regulations were analysed with the use of logical-linguistic method. THE PROCESS OF ARGUMENTATION: Following the level of e-exclusion as a starting point, the progressive digitisation and the aging of societies were described, with particular emphasis on seniors. The functioning of IKP (Internet Patient Account) and e-prescription was characterised, suggesting necessary changes so that the functionality of the e-prescription would not be depended on the level of digital competence of the beneficiaries. RESEARCH RESULTS: Among seniors in Poland, digital exclusion amounts to almost 57%. The percentage of those with an active IKP (Internet Patient Ac count) application is small, particularly among the elderly. Hence, an e-prescription comes down for most patients to having information about the e-prescription printed out or receiving a 4-digit code. CONCLUSIONS, INNOVATIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Considering the high level of e-exclusion, emerging mainly in the elderly population, it is essential to implement, combined with digital solutions, legal solutions permitting the full use of health services also by people who do not use modern technologies. One such solution could be to introduce requirement to label all drugs dispensed by the pharmacy, so that also e-excluded persons could have access to the same information about the prescription and the drug that an active IKP (Internet Patient Account) user finds on his or her account."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a4878c28a0473ae441"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"13","issue":"42","pagesFromTo":"55-69","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a4878c28a0473ae441"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479ed4","mniswId":"200009","title":"Horyzonty Polityki","issn":"2082-5897","eissn":"2353-950X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"09a844c0-3efe-4176-be63-62bcdedd1427"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Internetowe Konto Pacjenta (IKP)","osoby starsze","Internet","wykluczenie cyfrowe","e‑recepta"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Health and medicine and law","ICT Information and Communications Technologies","Public Administration","Media studies"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655077820"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed31b5fdbe831b59a02194","name":"Réka","lastName":"Friedery","documentHash":"3db2f5de-902a-418a-926d-ba9bda8455a6"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a816","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Gruszczyński","uuid":"8EAFB01E80B16DC28512973B9984AA334F665EAC31A8CE9E5441FADE108D14299BBBF7BDB6B09F9FD96D37C02C70FFA615D8C7CF255C7937B171BD44CED8A78E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4780-4132","documentHash":"9f303c6f-060d-468d-b607-7839a4053342"}],"objectId":"67ed31b5fdbe831b59a02193","doi":"10.24425/pyil.2023.147177","publicUri":"https://czasopisma.inp.pan.pl/index.php/pyil/article/view/4198","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Populist Challenge of Common EU Policies : The Case of (Im)migration (2015-2018)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the major conflicts between populist and non-populist forces (movements, parties, governments) as well as the European Union (EU) institutions has manifested in the area of immigration policy. This article investigates how the influx of migrants in 2015-2016 was subsequently used by populists as a policy conflict ground within the EU. In this context, it particularly looks at how the problem of migration was framed and map the policy responses in the selected EU Member States. The article covers the 2015-2018 period and includes the following countries: France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Hungary, and Poland.\n\nThe article observes that the 2015-2016 migration crisis and the response to it led to (or reinvigorated existing) politicisation of the topic across the EU, forcing the parties from all sides of the political spectrum to take a position on it. Simultaneously, one may also observe a process of securitisation of migration in the political debate in all analysed countries. Irregular migration was construed as a security threat by many political parties and leaders, requiring emergency measures and justifying actions outside the normal bounds of political and legal procedures. While the securitisation strategy was most visible in the discourse of the right-wing populist parties, its elements were progressively taken by the mainstream parties, arguably in response to increased salience of the issue.\n\nThe article also finds a correlation between the ideological profile of the parties and their approach to the migration crisis and the proposed EU response. All the parties located close to the right extreme tended to take a strong anti-immigration and anti-EU stance. All of them also ranked high in the populist index. On the other hand, the populist parties located on the left side or in the centre of the political spectrum took a moderate stance on this issue."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a816"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"221-244","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a816","67ed31b5fdbe831b59a02194"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a2ae","mniswId":"16311","title":"Polish Yearbook of International Law","issn":"0554-498X","eissn":"0554-498X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"957ff92b-d206-4fc8-9c7d-a5ca3ab77d89"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["immigration","populism","common EU policies","national policies","migration crisis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655078000"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b65b4","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Osiichuk","uuid":"19C0C78BEBF477C5D46FF10D37F7E5088846C07DA595B32820D38E55A1FDF346D90A09EE725E11D0A2E0E8365DE8EDFEB8D8B2A4DBCE125A7D4C243BDF33D295","documentHash":"2fb68138-792c-42ab-99dc-97566ba291b6"},{"objectId":"5e7093a0878c28a0473ae074","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"MIELCARZ","uuid":"CC96D7EDE0460FAFD826A318DB4FC14C3F6E17DBFF4C8F389F509D370248A01A4D169DB4027B7B627CB929212A04CC4ABDDB904B0368FAD22FFFD441EE05FECE","documentHash":"140887b5-c765-48fe-a40a-5fa79af0beab"}],"objectId":"67ed3684fdbe831b59a0cdb9","doi":"10.1108/mf-01-2022-0053","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/MF-01-2022-0053/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Apples plus oranges: the role of business profile similarity in shaping M&A outcomes: textual analysis of transaction data from China","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose The study aims at inquiring into the relationship between acquirer–target business similarity and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transaction outcomes.  Design/methodology/approach Relying on textual analysis of acquirers' and targets' business descriptions from M&A transaction synopses, the authors establish that posttransaction operating outcomes are negatively associated with acquirer–target business similarity.  Findings While similar business profiles allow for optimization of overheads, sales growth and margins demonstrate better dynamics when acquirers and targets are more dissimilar, which allows for greater competitive gains. On average, targets are more dissimilar from acquirers than acquirers are from their competitors. The degree of competition within acquirers' industries and acquirer–competitors' business similarity are found to be positively associated with the likelihood of engaging in serial horizontal acquisitions involving more similar targets, mostly from the domestic market. Competitive pressure is evidenced to push acquirers for a faster completion of acquisition process. Cross-border acquisitions are found to be associated with lower acquirer–target and acquirer–competitors' similarity, which suggests that Chinese companies expand overseas primarily for strategic reasons of gaining a competitive edge rather than to simply improve sales.  Originality/value The paper contributes to the limited pool of empirical literature relying on text mining techniques to establish the determinants of M&A transaction outcomes. The methodology used in the study outperforms the conventional techniques of operationalization of business similarities through General Industry Classification Standard (GICS) industry matching. The study investigates the intermediating role of intraindustry competition in fostering firms' acquisitiveness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae074","5e70941c878c28a0473b65b4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"48","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1726-1753","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70941c878c28a0473b65b4","5e7093a0878c28a0473ae074"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a153","mniswId":"13884","title":"Managerial Finance","issn":"0307-4358","eissn":"1758-7743","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"28c0c202-3d55-4e60-852f-c113dc5916f9"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Business synergy","Emerging markets","Mergers and acquisitions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655078035"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399743","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ziółkowski","uuid":"7B677BE6418A44E58820F8D3FD3050B10542119ECA28CB384DA455B422AC33B4C67393C01D7009C4380F772FB3A5E402744DDCA88DDC7F39E2248D0737DBA40F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7019-7193","documentHash":"ec5e4ab4-15c9-41bd-947d-c49f7311c0a3"}],"objectId":"67ed326bfdbe831b59a03208","doi":"10.4467/25442031pko.22.007.15733","publicUri":"https://www.ejournals.eu/Przeglad-Konstytucyjny/2022/Numer-1-2022/art/21783/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Kadencyjność Rzecznika Praw Obywatelskich i zasada zaufania do państwa i stanowionego przez nie prawa.

It discusses the Tribunal’s judgement concerning the unconstitutionality of one of the provisions of the Act on the Ombudsman. According to the provision, the Ombudsman shall continue to perform duties after the end of term and until the election of the new Ombudsman.  In the Tribunal’s view, the provision provided an unconstitutional extension of the Ombudsman’s term. Since the judgement was passed by the unconstitutionally elected members of the Tribunal and it was to remove Adam Bodnar (the former Ombudsman) from the office, it has to be interpreted in the context of the current constitutional crisis in Poland. The article argues that the Tribunal’s reasoning was constitutionally wrong, logically incoherent, and far from clear if considering the well-established case-law. Moreover, the paper explains how the Tribunal and the President of the Tribunal violated the law on the assignment of judges to the Tribunal’s panels and the constitutional principle of judicial independence. The concluding remarks focus on the possible legal consequences of unlawfulness in the Polish constitutional order, which does not directly provide any review of the Tribunal’s judgements or its President’s actions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a047399743"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"167-186","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929f878c28a047399743"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850ccfa","mniswId":"498363","title":"Przegląd Konstytucyjny","issn":"2544-2031","metadataSource":"ERIH","documentHash":"812f7c3f-df0b-43b9-82cf-14e6b37df6cb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Polish Constitutional Tribunal","trust","Ombudsman","a constitutional crisis","Constitution","assignment judges to the Tribunal’s panels"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655078037"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed366bfdbe831b59a0c4ef","name":"Luciano","lastName":"Fanti","documentHash":"a25981fb-311e-4ab0-9f5b-433cd3f6ffaf"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b09ae","name":"DOMENICO","lastName":"BUCCELLA","uuid":"14C6DD3109FBB29354BCEE9ABF63F812DE490D1CC2E15B22A48C57F17EA9D9B9B762FE20115141B7DD9FDFAF80174E0AB875F692C4C9FBB4DA5012FC12AF06B2","documentHash":"8cea44cb-2ce7-491d-b15c-3ea6c48e51dd"}],"objectId":"67ed366bfdbe831b59a0c4ee","doi":"10.7866/hpe-rpe.22.3.4","publicUri":"https://hpe-rpe.org/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Indirect taxation, tax evasion and profits","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In a duopoly with differentiated products under price competition, this paper analyses the frms’ tax compliance behaviour in the presence of tax evasion to challenge the conventional wisdom that indirect taxes penalise profts.

Some believed that these systems would converge, with state intervention stabilising capitalism in the west and socialism became more democratic in the east. Michał Kalecki, in his last published article, co-written with Tadeusz Kowalik, wrote about how governments had implemented a crucial reform in the developed capitalist economies. State investment had filled the demand gap, which could potentially result in the long-term mitigation of capitalism's slumps and crises. Tadeusz Kowalik later extended this notion of the crucial reform, to the troubled socialist systems in Eastern Europe during the 1980s. He argued that previous economic reforms had failed in the socialist countries as they had not been accompanied by sufficient democratic political reforms, which needed to be extended in order to fully revitalise the socialist economies. Ultimately the proposals for a crucial reform of capitalism and socialism were not realised and these systems did not converge economically or politically.

Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the hypotheses.  Findings The results show that family-related reasons may encourage entrepreneurs to choose the stewardship strategy over the financial harvest or voluntary cessation strategies, while non-family-related reasons such as maintaining financial independence and health may encourage the choice of the financial harvest or the voluntary cessation strategy.

Firstly, thanks to it, the deficit existing in the EU could be eliminated, and secondly, the citizens of the Union would gain a tool to create an EU-wide public sphere, within which they would have a real possibility of influencing the legislative actions taken by the EU. It formally happened. The European Citizens’ Initiative, adopted over 10 years ago, potentially creates such an opportunity. However, looking at the effectiveness of its functioning, it cannot be concluded that the indicated goals have been achieved. The main problem is the too large role of the European Commission (slightly diminished by the recently introduced changes to the ECI regulation). The low efficiency of the ECI is not conducive to reducing the democratic deficit in the EU. However, the ECI creates an opportunity for discussion and public debate. It provides a basis for EU citizens to express their political positions, and the submitted initiative (albeit rarely successful) allow the conclusion that European public spheres do exist. The ECI creates a space for the citizens of different Member States to engage in a joint debate. However, this potential is not sufficiently exploited. It cannot be said that the EU’s democratic mandate has been strengthened by wider participation of citizens in the public debate. Too broad discretion by the Commission has the effect of reducing the effectiveness of the ECI. Indeed, if the application is not processed further despite the collection of a sufficient number of signatures due to the discretionary decision of the Commission, such a situation cannot be regarded as an effective implementation of the ECI. The application submitted by EU citizens as part of the ECI should not only be treated as a signal from them, and the Commission should treat it as a clear need to regulate a given area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae03e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"89-115","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae03e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850ccfa","mniswId":"498363","title":"Przegląd Konstytucyjny","issn":"2544-2031","metadataSource":"ERIH","documentHash":"812f7c3f-df0b-43b9-82cf-14e6b37df6cb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["citizens’ initiative","democratic deficit","the European Union"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655078459"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ed2f81fdbe831b599ff3f0","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bańbura-Nowak","documentHash":"53cd15d4-39d4-4e1c-99da-2636d8c8ca68"},{"objectId":"67ed2f81fdbe831b599ff3eb","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Gruszka","documentHash":"d6611b2f-b068-4906-81d6-23a2265ebc33"},{"objectId":"652608a940e3ff22d34a6ad1","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Bonarska","uuid":"D16CC980E491832003937EB8FAA9AB7DE25B5A137439658D2BA5214C974309C96B8B64D4EC7E482CA72E7D074EA2FC98DA19C545F9BDE2B6B55FFD687A0A724C","documentHash":"b57fb786-2d8f-4522-befe-5eec3de41ae0"},{"objectId":"5e7094e4878c28a0473c635f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wendołowska","uuid":"DD85485EB126301CBA795B4651EFB2597C7781A22BA5203B0A2330D0FCCCE3EBB3F5EEF9F4AC59407B9EBDF5701DE0E7DC7564C93B8725C79A556C4B389B508E","documentHash":"37e41dc3-ea90-4294-ba9a-4bb1c96e87ff"},{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b159a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bańbura-Nowak","uuid":"C30108B0788709D2EB5AC6392907AFB26F5646EB3EC06F4876456200B22BBCF5559074E89624B4F14C56F19CE2734F4633784D1A745BA91EEA16575B1FA958FD","documentHash":"bf7fa81a-7c15-44a8-8d56-5dbca8279e00"},{"objectId":"5e70932c878c28a0473a44b1","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Kałwak","uuid":"2BCFEE9F61D6FFA2EFCECADF9A4DC91231E77F77CB32A13EF13B3979C12A561CD7DBED5C724EA2EDE5463A7C4F9119691B0DB8557B4BDBB809258D571432685D","documentHash":"ec41287e-509b-4a23-800d-0106b5058ec0"},{"objectId":"5e70931e878c28a0473a30db","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sitnik-Warchulska","uuid":"08CC77ACA393EA30649E6420EAB1C795B441B18AA0BBBC6BCA24F1D419A4D4A45FBC8C28B4A7F2934B73A96AF35EB52D5584BC2EA2DBDE56D075C28DEC432FEE","documentHash":"fe2beeea-33fe-4b4a-bdfc-d6dc822a2244"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a29ce","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Gruszka-Gosiewska","uuid":"4C5DA11D77225CD76C28E464BB625EFFEC074A287EE3D0D2AD68E8AA10E3353D7D8C9ABE928BFEE67BB9230172464390CA9B70CC03977936383DE667C1D3E7E1","documentHash":"d3dd1c90-61c6-4704-be22-ad89976178c0"},{"objectId":"5e709313878c28a0473a27e8","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Opoczyńska-Morasiewicz","uuid":"3B0B82C7643847E62672280109799BCA09C9F85A7465E382690FCCE8D03D642E1CC5ACFED8FC8EBEBC454707AA93FE9D128A8B65EDE2CE7E497CB21ECE10E663","documentHash":"06b74e00-a41a-40ea-a146-ce413140557f"},{"objectId":"5e709313878c28a0473a2778","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Czyżowska","uuid":"3EBD9EB9E7DAE99E1F4C035DE4D44A510CF6F7E2B69E1BDAB6E52A88EDC340BEE57E22711F564D4D6DAD601E342195673A69D64D2593C3D3A8BC1F244C53602F","documentHash":"60e3dcd2-cdd4-4277-93c7-aaec08355f61"},{"objectId":"5e7092e8878c28a04739f0f0","name":"Bernadetta","lastName":"Izydorczyk","uuid":"D185D8252FB4398867937A053820D22220FF390F3D686DC5B99BA8DF169BB0B9DEB8F91F41C8D04EED7D81B5E3AF0699A0C345CC4A67235E5A75A72EE5F70B62","documentHash":"11420d1f-35db-4045-91ea-aa68fee24190"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739512f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Węziak-Białowolska","uuid":"F93F7D3BB00DBE20DA1E85C30F715F2490FD9F9AF590C21565628D05710DA3C89E98D7DB0C6D413C7B6E34A20EC5BD147C0D461B6026AF63DC3CB16C042A832F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2711-2283","documentHash":"5571faff-c945-40da-a060-f75f2d453941"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2025-01-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67ed2f81fdbe831b599ff3e9","doi":"10.1007/s11205-024-03498-2","publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/handle/item/542094","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Polycrisis, emotional regulation, personality traits, and well-being of young people entering adulthood","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Pomimo znacznych inwestycji w opiekę zdrowotną psychiczną oraz dostępność usług medycznych w Europie, dobrostan psychiczny młodych ludzi znajduje się w niepokojącym spadku. Pogorszenie to jest dodatkowo potęgowane przez ostatnie globalne kryzysy, w tym pandemię COVID-19, wojnę w Ukrainie, zmiany klimatyczne oraz pogłębiający się kryzys gospodarczy, prowadzący do wzrostu ubóstwa i wykluczenia społecznego. Głównym celem badania było sprawdzenie, jak młodzi ludzie wchodzący w dorosłość doświadczają polikryzysu w kontekście stresu, odpowiedzialności za kryzysy oraz postrzeganej przez siebie bliskości tych kryzysów.  W badaniu wzięło udział 403 młodych dorosłych Polaków, którzy zdawali egzaminy maturalne w latach 2020–2021. Do oceny wykorzystano następujące narzędzia: Skrócony Inwentarz Objawów 18 (Brief Symptoms Inventory 18), Skalę Trudności w Regulacji Emocji (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale), Inwentarz Osobowości zgodny z ICD-11 (Personality Inventory for ICD-11) oraz Indeks Rozwoju Osobistego (Flourishing Index).  Za pomocą analizy klas latentnych zidentyfikowano trzy odrębne profile reprezentujące różnicowane doświadczenia polikryzysu.  - Grupa 1. Głównie doświadczała stresu związanego z kryzysem gospodarczym, zgłaszała niższe poziomy depresji i utrzymywała stosunkowo stabilny dobrostan ekonomiczny.  - Grupa 2: Konfrontowała się z różnymi aspektami polikryzysu, z wyjątkiem COVID-19, i odczuwała silne poczucie odpowiedzialności za kryzys klimatyczny, doświadczając jednocześnie wyzwań emocjonalnych.  - Grupa 3: Doświadczała pełnego spektrum polikryzysu, wykazując tendencje do perfekcjonizmu i sztywności zasad, przy braku specyficznych problemów ze zdrowiem psychicznym.  Wyniki tego badania dostarczają cennych wskazówek do tworzenia modeli funkcjonowania młodych dorosłych po kryzysie oraz projektowania wczesnych, ukierunkowanych interwencji.

This deterioration is further exacerbated by recent global crises, notably the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, climate change, and the deepening economic crisis leading to increased poverty and social exclusion. The main research goal was to investigate how young people entering adulthood experience polycrisis concerning stress, responsibility for crises, and self-perceived proximity. The study involved 403 young adult Poles, taking high school final exams in the years 2020–21. Assessment tools included the Brief Symptoms Inventory 18, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Personality Inventory for ICD-11, and Flourishing Index. Using the latent class analysis, three distinct profiles were identified, representing diverse experiences of polycrisis. Group 1 primarily experienced stress related to economic crisis, reported lower depression rates and maintained relatively stable economic well-being. Group 2 confronted various aspects of polycrisis, excluding COVID-19, and carried a strong sense of responsibility for the climate crisis while experiencing emotional challenges. Group 3 experienced the full spectrum of polycrisis, showing tendencies towards perfectionism and rule rigidity, without specific mental health problems. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for developing models of young adults’ post-crisis functioning and for designing early, targeted interventions.

The findings validate a positive association between a sense of power and financial risk-taking, alongside a negative impact of cognitive load on financial risk. Notably, cognitive load moderates the relationship between power and financial risk-taking in a way that the link is positive when individuals have full access to their cognitive resources, but it becomes nonsignificant when they are under cognitive load."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942a878c28a0473b77a4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","name":"Wydział Psychologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e7a","67ed35f3fdbe831b59a0a5b2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"online","pagesFromTo":"online","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e7a","67ed35f3fdbe831b59a0a5b2","5e70942a878c28a0473b77a4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c285145479492","mniswId":"16931","title":"Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology","issn":"1747-0218","eissn":"1747-0226","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d96aad2a-eb7d-474e-929a-dce9985eab1a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cognitive load","financial risk-taking","gambling","investing","Power"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039399424"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61bab2b87523404d4a8eb1b0","name":"IVANNA","lastName":"KYLIUSHYK","uuid":"16A57BA95EB9D7F231815A8084FD2EDBBC04D42581478BE0430060A73D43B7C00F391305CF3362FCE836B09FA9E74E9AB80256ECCA77CEAC66F86E67F875E713","documentHash":"ee71006a-341a-439e-88dc-08a0183f7d4e"},{"objectId":"602ba3779543c7410626df1d","name":"Emil","lastName":"Chról","uuid":"3188D7DD6420BD34D741BFEB38923EE9EB8EA1F786BFFA840B48B46D569BA8FDC100C9DEF742B308CC7004E8AFE9AA71360AF9D98E44531D1A05C86722FF9F16","documentHash":"f33361d8-1f1f-464c-bf32-b36dc03bf36c"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a05de","name":"IZABELA","lastName":"GRABOWSKA","uuid":"CC3D312828290D6281F503367E126F68870644DE25B2C9BB0D230A23B2D827E0990E7197517BF92143AA9A4E9A1830D3EE0ABF965CADDDC44A6824095BC733E7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7957-4901","documentHash":"c1823893-c3ed-496c-818f-c549dd96b6dc"}],"objectId":"67e54fc1fdbe831b59a69808","doi":"10.4324/9781003480754","publicUri":"https://www.routledge.com/Ukrainian-Female-War-Migrants-Mobilising-Resources-for-Prospective-Social-Remittances/Grabowska-Kyliushyk-Chrol/p/book/9781032769936","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2025,"title":"Ukrainian Female War Migrants.

The book examines the human, social, psychological and economic capital Ukrainian women bring with them, alongside their participation in the local labour market, their mobilization of resources, and the acquisition of new skills and knowledge. Far from merely documenting this historic wave of migration, the book highlights the potential of Ukrainian women to become key agents in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction and development, by bringing social remittances such as ideas, practices, and norms, back home with them.\n\nIntegrating advanced statistical analysis of data from over 340 migrants with rich qualitative insights, this book will be an important resource for researchers studying migration, security, politics, sociology, and development. It also provides valuable insights and data for NGOs and policymakers working to support Ukrainian migrants in Poland and beyond."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61bab2b87523404d4a8eb1b0","5e7092fb878c28a0473a05de"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602ba3779543c7410626df1d"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a05de","61bab2b87523404d4a8eb1b0","602ba3779543c7410626df1d"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"9781032769936","pages":228,"editionNumber":"1","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Development Studies","Eastern European Politics","Demography","Race & Ethnic Studies","Citizenship - Political Sociology","Migration","Political & Economic Anthropology","Citizenship - Social Policy","Politics & International Relations","Anthropology","Gender","Gender Studies - Soc Sci","International Relations","Regulatory Policy","European Cultural Studies","Political Philosophy","Ethnic Identity","Urban Studies","Women's Studies","Global Development","Immigration Policy","Social Policy","Sociology & Social Policy","Social Work","European Studies","Political Sociology","Area Studies","Social Sciences","Gender Politics","Gender Studies","Europe - Social Policy","European Politics","Diaspora Studies","Social & Cultural Anthropology","Cultural Studies","Environment","Migration & Diaspora"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748386606383"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"600a892b9543c753022219d7","name":"JAN","lastName":"OLESZCZUK-ZYGMUNTOWSKI","uuid":"A431DC791D27C6C9D544578C442F9032CAD4C70C6DDD2BE864EE174559E086AC15AD055367765190053C30A3FAD9CEAF30EAC043773ACE09AE176DC844436196","documentHash":"2f04168b-d5d3-4bdd-ad68-b0e39d516a17"}],"objectId":"6835a248fdbe834f489d55a3","doi":"10.1080/1369118x.2025.2504608","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1369118X.2025.2504608","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Paradox of data commons: governance lessons from a health data intermediary multi-case study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The future of digitalization depends on implementing the right model for data governance, balancing rights, values, and societal goals. This research investigates a matched triple of health Data Intermediaries (DIs) – public authority Findata, data cooperative Midata, and non-governmental foundation Donate Your Data – to understand how different DI models impact data governance goals and the rules-in-use. I find that the choice of the DI model influences data governance and thus the pursued goals. But the findings also reveal a paradox, where DIs couple and balance extractivism with privacy, collectivism with self-determination, and trust with economic gain. Embracing this paradox instead of resolving it is what leads to successful governance. This study contributes to the theoretical development of data governance studies by offering insights that can support policymakers in designing effective institutions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","uid":"bvucdCQnF0trpiFVTpGjEOw","uuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","name":"Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["600a892b9543c753022219d7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","parentUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd36","rootUuid":"d5f072fd-5060-4d4e-84cd-e0313f85459f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"online","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["600a892b9543c753022219d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780cd","mniswId":"8316","title":"Information Communication and Society","issn":"1369-118X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"1e517492-e69b-4cad-88b6-cc5ec9c0ec59"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6835a248fdbe834f489d55a4","year":"2025","documentHash":"b32dd6ae-4b85-44a4-af8b-bbdfcbaef172"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Data governance, commons, data intermediary, health data, privacy, case study"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748386607671"}]
