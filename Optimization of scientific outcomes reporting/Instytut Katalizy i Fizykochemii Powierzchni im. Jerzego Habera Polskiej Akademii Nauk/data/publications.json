The suspensions and solution of silver nitrate were applied in a hydroponic culture in order to assess their influence on the germination of Triticum aestivum seeds. Studies of the damage of the cell membrane and the activity of antioxidant enzymes were carried out on the shoots and roots of the seedlings. The differences in the plant condition were assessed while analyzing photosystem II. The results showed that the AgNPs stabilized with sodium hexametaphosphate exhibited a higher toxicity toward the tested plants than silver ions with the same concentration. It was found that the AgNPs obtained using tannic acid exerted an adverse effect on the crop plants. The citrate-stabilized AgNPs were the least toxic to the seedlings.

The cinnamaldehyde (CAL), furfural (FU) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were hydrogenated under mild reaction conditions. The formation of hydrogen bronzes in Pd/WO3 and physical mixture of Pd/WO3 with supporting WO3 oxide upon exposure to H2 was also studied using the gas flow-through microcalorimetry. In both Pd/MoO3 and Pd/WO3 catalysts, the electronic interactions contributed to the promotion of selectivity toward the Cdouble bondO hydrogenation in CAL and FU, yet in Pd/MoO3 this effect was much more pronounced. On the other hand, apart from increasing the overall reaction rate, the formation of hydrogen bronzes remarkably enhances the Cdouble bondC hydrogenation in CAL, as well as the decarbonylation of FU to furan and hydrogenolysis of C–OH in HMF to 5-methylfurfural. The bronze effects are significantly stronger in HxWO3, compared to HxMoO3, which may be related to higher H-species mobility and weaker H-bonding in the W–O–H (54 kJ/mol H2) than in the Mo–O–H (100 kJ/mol H2). This may also explain very high tendency of Pd/WO3 to furan ring hydrogenation in FU and HMF as well as almost selective (>98%) hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The combination of AgNPs with bioactive substances, such as antioxidants, can lead to the development of new systems of desired anticancer properties. In this research, AgNPs were prepared with the use of diverse antioxidant combinations including gallic acid (GA), (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and caffeine (CAF). The insightful physicochemical characteristic revealed that each type of AgNPs exhibited spherical shape, comparable size distribution and negative surface charge. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) delivered the information about the chemistry of AgNP stabilizing layers, which turned out to be a crucial factor tuning toxicity of AgNPs toward murine B16 melanoma cells (B16-F0) and human skin melanoma (COLO 679) cells. EGCGAgNPs were the most cytotoxic among all the investigated AgNPs. They strongly reduced the activity of mitochondria, damaged cell membrane integrity, and penetrated inside the cells causing DNA damage. In turn, the toxicity of GAAgNPs strongly manifested via the induction of oxidative stress in the cells. It was found that CAFGAAgNPs exhibited the lowest toxicity toward the melanoma cells, which proved that a proper combination of antioxidants enable to prepare AgNPs of differentiated toxicity.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdown restricted travel for a few months in 2020, providing a unique opportunity to observe the studied mountain environment without the impact of typical tourist traffic. This study is based on the determination of antibiotic content, hydrochemical parameters, enumeration of culturable bacterial water quality indicators, antimicrobial susceptibility tests together with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) gene detection in waterborne E. coli and NGS-based bacterial community composition at six sites along the Białka river valley (one of the most popular touristic regions in Poland) in three periods: in summer and winter tourist seasons and during the COVID-19 lockdown. The results of individual measurements showed decreased numbers of bacterial indicators of water contamination (e.g. numbers of E. coli dropped from 99 × 104 CFU/100 ml to 12 CFU/100 ml at the most contaminated site) and the share of antimicrobial resistant E. coli (total resistance dropped from 21% in summer to 9% during lockdown, share of multidrug resistant strains from 100 to 44%, and ESBL from 20% in summer to none during lockdown). Antibiotic concentrations were the highest during lockdown. The use of multivariate analysis (principal component analysis – PCA and heatmaps) revealed a clear pattern of tourism-related anthropogenic pressure on the water environment and positive impact of COVID-19 lockdown on water quality. PCA distinguished three major factors determining water quality: F1 shows strong effect of anthropogenic pressure; F2 describes the lockdown-related quality restoration processes; F3 is semi-natural and describes the differences between the most pristine and most anthropogenically-impacted waters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

We studied also the temperature-programmed reduction of these oxides with hydrogen. The reaction of ethanol on CuO produced acetaldehyde and water but not hydrogen, indicating, that ethanol was oxidized over this oxide. On the other hand, acetaldehyde was produced from ethanol both by oxidation and dehydrogenation over Cu/Zr (both water and hydrogen were produced). Acetaldehyde was subsequently oxidized to acetic acid, which was next transformed to acetone.

All synthesized catalysts were active in the dehydration of ethanol reaction. Generally, the use of sonochemical assisted desilication procedure resulted in higher average pore diameter in respect to the catalysts modifed by using traditional technique.

The goal of this study is to improve the properties of LSM cathodes working in the range of 500–800 °C by the addition of YFe0.5Co0.5O3 (YFC). Monophasic YFC is synthesized and sintered at 950 °C. Composite cathodes are prepared on Ce0.8Sm0.2O1.9 electrolyte disks using pastes containing YFC and LSM powders mixed in 0:1, 1:19, and 1:1 weight ratios denoted LSM, LSM1, and LSM1, respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns of tested composites reveal the presence of pure perovskite phases in samples sintered at 950 °C and the presence of Sr4Fe4O11, YMnO3, and La0.775Sr0.225MnO3.047 phases in samples sintered at 1100 °C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals that polarization resistance increases from LSM1, by LSM, to LSM2. Differences in polarization resistance increase with decreasing operating temperatures because activation energy rises in the same order and equals to 1.33, 1.34, and 1.58 eV for LSM1, LSM, and LSM2, respectively. The lower polarization resistance of LSM1 electrodes is caused by the lower resistance associated with the charge transfer process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The as-grown films were composed of small, nanometric grains. Annealing of the films produced an increase in the grain size and gave rise to magnetic order at room temperature, although with a fraction of the films remaining in the paramagnetic state. Annealing also induced cobalt segregation to the surface of the thicker films. The measured Mössbauer spectra at low temperature were indicative of cobalt ferrite, the both films showing very similar hyperfine patterns. Annealing in oxygen or vacuum affected the cationic distribution, which was closer to that expected for an inverse spinel in the case of annealing in an oxygen atmosphere."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

We recently reported that a 3-hydroxybenzo[g]quinolone (5) can be used as a CO delivery molecule to produce anticancer and potent anti-inflammatory effects. Herein we report mechanistic studies of the visible light-induced CO release reaction of this compound. In wet CH3CN under aerobic conditions, 5 releases 0.90(2) equivalents of CO upon illumination with visible light (419 nm) to give a single depside product. Performing the same reaction under an 18O2 atmosphere results in quantitative incorporation of two labeled oxygen atoms in the depside product. Monitoring via 1H NMR and UV-vis during the illumination of 5 in CH3CN using 419 nm light revealed the substoichiometric formation of a diketone (6) in the reaction mixture. H2O2 formation was detected in the same reaction mixtures. DFT studies indicate that upon light absorption an efficient pathway exists for the formation of a triplet excited state species (5b) that can undergo reaction with 3O2 resulting in CO release. DFT investigations also provide insight into diketone (6) and H2O2 formation and subsequent reactivity. The presence of water and exposure to visible light play an important role in lowering activation barriers in the reaction between 6 and H2O2 to give CO. Overall, two reaction pathways have been identified for CO release from a 3-hydroxybenzo[g]quinolone."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

It was found that both monosaccharides adsorb on the (17,0) single walled carbon nanotube with adsorption energy strongly dependent on the number of molecules. Single molecule adsorption was stable only for GlcNAc molecule while the GlcA molecule revealed energetically quite complex picture involving the assumption of energy barrier for desorption. Hetero-disaccharides composed of GlcNAc and GlcA revealed stable surface layers. Most uniform surface layer with highly specific orientation towards surface was found for GlcNAc. Adsorption of monosaccharides weakly affects their conformation: disaccharides display only moderate reduction in the flexibility of glycosidic linkages but oligosaccharides can be more significantly deformed, exhibiting conformationally-locked kinks along the chain that impose tighter CNT-HA contact.

Innovative structures using nanotechnology have found application in diverse fields: in agricultural and food industries, where they improve the quality and safety of food; in medical and biological sciences; cosmetology; and many other areas of our lives. In this article, a particular attention is focused on carbon nanomaterials, especially graphene, as well as carbon nanotubes and carbon quantum dots that have been successfully used in biotechnology, biomedicine and broadly defined environmental applications. Some properties of carbon nanomaterials prevent their direct use. One example is the difficulty in synthesizing graphene-based materials resulting from the tendency of graphene to aggregate. This results in a limitation of their use in certain fields. Therefore, in order to achieve a wider use and better availability of nanoparticles, they are introduced into matrices, most often polysaccharides with a high hydrophilicity. Such composites can compete with synthetic polymers. For this purpose, the carbon-based nanoparticles in polysaccharides matrices were characterized. The paper presents the progress of ground-breaking research in the field of designing innovative carbon-based nanomaterials, and applications of nanotechnology in diverse fields that are currently being developed is of high interest and shows great innovative potential."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Artificial forisomes assembled from the monomer MtSEO-F1 can be used as smart biomaterials, but the molecular basis of their functionality is not understood. To determine the role of protein polymerization in forisome activity, we tested the Ca2+ association of MtSEO-F1 dimers (the basic polymerization unit) by circular dichroism spectroscopy and microscale thermophoresis. We found that soluble MtSEO-F1 dimers neither associate with Ca2+ nor undergo structural changes. However, polarization modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy revealed that aggregated MtSEO-F1 dimers and fully-assembled forisomes associate with Ca2+, allowing the hydration of poorly-hydrated protein areas. A change in the signal profile of complete forisomes indicated that Ca2+ interacts with negatively-charged regions in the protein complexes that only become available during aggregation.

The constant development of organometallic networks and the synthesis of new materials increases the efficiency of methane sorption, reaching new record amounts of gas adsorbed per gram of adsorbent. In this study, we present the optimised in-situ synthesis preparation method of Ag and Cu-modified zeolite imidazole frameworks by using ultrasonic irradiation. We proved that silver is present in ZIFs in the form of nanoparticles in the case of silver-modified materials. In contrast, in the case of copper-modified materials, the copper is present in ionic form. We also found that incorporating PVP as a stabilising agent and the modification with Ag and Cu changes the structural parameters of the prepared materials. The methane sorption results confirmed that the developed materials exhibit enhanced sorption capacity by over 100% (based on ZIF-8) and by 20% (based on ZIF-67). The highest methane adsorption at 1.6 MPa was achieved by Cu-PVP/ZIF-8 and Cu-PVP/ZIF-67, and [email protected] samples, and was equal to 112 cm³ CH4/g, 96 cm³ CH4/g and 97 cm³ CH4/g, respectively.

In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, that is, substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme's binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the “default” hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In particular, they can be applied to form Pickering emulsions and foams for “green” applications in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical industry or food processing. We demonstrated that carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals enhance foamability and foam stability when mixed with cationic surfactant ethyl lauroyl arginate (LAE), having superior properties over sulfated cellulose nanocrystals (sCNC) concerning surfactant concentration range and foam volume. Mixtures of LAE and cCNC were characterized for their hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, surface tension and surface rheological properties. The influence of electrolytes, namely, sodium chloride, guanidine hydrochloride and sodium salicylate, and the addition of concentrated urea to LAE-cCNC mixtures on foamability and foam stability were investigated. Electrolytes in the concentration of 5 mM showed a moderate effect on foam stability. In contrast, spectacular foam collapse was detected after adding concentrated urea. The preliminary rheological data from the pendant drop oscillations revealed low elastic modulus upon urea addition and the loss modulus that increased with the frequency, which suggested a viscous interfacial layer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Characteristic monolayer formation times under diffusion and flow for the nanoparticle size range were calculated. In the second part illustrative experimental results obtained for micro- and nanoparticles were discussed. Deposition at planar substrates was analyzed with emphasis focused on the stability of layers and the release kinetics of silver particles. Applicability of the quartz microbalance measurements (QCM) for quantitative studies of nanoparticle deposition kinetic was also discussed. Except for noble metal and polymer particles, representative results for virus deposition at abiotic surfaces were analyzed. Final part of the review was devoted to nanoparticle corona formation at polymer carrier particles investigated by combination of the concentration depletion, AFM, SEM and the in situ electrokinetic method.

Two solvents, with different dielectric constants, such as ethyl acetate (εr = 6) and ethanol (εr = 24.6), were examined in terms of their effect on the morphology, size, and phase composition of iron oxide composites. We calculated the laser fluence curves using the heating-melting-evaporation approach to identify the critical particle size that undergoes the phase changes first. We assessed the temperature of the particles irradiated with 390 mJ/pulse.cm2 in both solvents, including the heat dissipation between the particles and the liquid. The phase diagram of the Fe–O–C–H system was calculated to determine the temperature–pressure relationship of the system in equilibrium. We also employed an in situ GC–MS analysis to identify the volatile products during irradiation. Based on our experimental results, we concluded that the final diameter of the composites increases from 400 to 600 nm, along with the decreasing dielectric constant of the solvent, which is related to the different polarization of the organic liquid and the degree of particle agglomeration. The reduction of hematite in ethanol proceeded much faster, ending up with Fe/FeCx, while in ethyl acetate, it ended up with Fe3O4. Among all the particles, those with a diameter of 200 nm have the highest temperature and undergo the phase transition first. The temperature of a 200 nm composite particle in ethanol is slightly lower than in ethyl acetate, i.e. 1870 K as compared to 1902 K. Phase equilibrium diagrams proved the existence of Fe, FeO, and Fe3O4 as the preferred phases at about 1900 K. Our research provides a new insight into the process of submicron particle formation during pulsed laser irradiation and allows proposing a mechanism for the growth of particles of different size and phase composition depending on the solvent."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

Kinetic studies were carried out in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor in a temperature range from 433 to 513 K, pressures from 3 to 8 MPa, and GHSV from 1660 to 10,000 1/h for initial molar fractions of hydrogen from about 0.48 to 0.70, carbon dioxide from 0.05 to about 0.22, and carbon monoxide from 0 to about 0.07. Significant effects of temperature and the composition of the reaction mixture on the conversion degrees α1 and α2 were found. The Cu/Zn/Zr/Ga catalyst showed good stability over 960 h. XRD and CO2TPD characterisation were performed. Thefinally obtained results of kinetic tests were developed in the form of Langmuir–Hinshelwood kinetic equations. The numerical Levenberg–Marquardt method was used to estimate the kinetic equations. The average relative error of fitting the kinetic equations to the experimental data was 18%."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaf","uid":"brDIv_yADzjmxhA02sXUtZQ","uuid":"c1e509a2-9a9f-4bba-9ab3-4c9c463efa18","name":"Instytut Inżynierii Chemicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094bc878c28a0473c2cc4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaf","parentUuid":"c1e509a2-9a9f-4bba-9ab3-4c9c463efa18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaf","rootUuid":"c1e509a2-9a9f-4bba-9ab3-4c9c463efa18","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The nature of this practically important phenomenon has remained a mystery for the last six decades and was suggested to be related to the increased strength of zeolitic Bronsted acid sites after dealumination. We now utilize state-of-the-art infrared spectroscopy measurements and prove that during steaming, aluminum oxide clusters evolve (due to hydrolysis of Al out of framework positions with the following clustering) in the zeolitic micropores with properties very similar to (nano) facets of hydroxylated transition alumina surfaces. The Bronsted acidity of the zeolite does not increase and the total number of Bronsted acid sites decreases during steaming. O5Al(VI)-OH surface sites of alumina clusters dehydroxylate at elevated temperatures to form penta-coordinate Al1O5 sites that are capable of initiating alkane cracking by breaking the first C-H bond very effectively with much lower barriers (at lower temperatures) than for protolytic C-H bond activation, with the following reaction steps catalyzed by nearby zeolitic Bronsted acid sites. This explains the underlying mechanism behind the improved alkane cracking and alkane dehydrogenation activity of steamed zeolites: heterolytic C-H bond breaking occurs on Al-O sites of aluminum oxide clusters confined in zeolitic pores. Our findings explain the origin of enhanced activity of steamed zeolites at the molecular level and provide the missing understanding of the nature of extra-framework Al species formed in steamed/dealuminated zeolites."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

AFM studies realized under diffusion conditions proved that the adsorbed protein layer mainly consisted of aggregates in the form of compact tetramers and hexamers of a size equal to 11-12 nm. These results were consistent with vimentin adsorption kinetics under flow conditions investigated by QCM. It was established that vimentin aggregates efficiently adsorbed on the negatively charged silica sensor at pH 3.5 and 7.4, forming compact layers with the coverage reaching 3.5 mg m(-2). Additionally, the formation of the vimentin corona at polymer particles was examined using the LDV method and interpreted in terms of the electrokinetic model. This allowed us to determine the zeta potential of the corona as a function of pH and the electrokinetic charge of aggregates, which was equal to -0.7 e nm(-2) at pH 7.4 in a 10 mM NaCl solution. The anomalous adsorption of aggregates exhibiting an average negative charge on the negatively charged substrates was interpreted as a result of a heterogeneous charge distribution. These investigations confirmed that it is feasible to deposit stable vimentin layers both at planar substrates and at carrier particles with well-controlled coverage and zeta potential. They can be used for investigations of vimentin interactions with various ligands including receptors of the innate immune system, immunoglobulins, bacterial virulence factors, and spike proteins of viruses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

High structural diversity and conformational heterogeneity make it problematic to link their measurable properties to molecular features. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out at the level of classical force fields are routinely applied to study the complex processes occurring in carbohydrate-containing systems, while the usefulness of such simulations relies on the accuracy of the underlying theoretical model. In this article, we present the coarse-grained force field dedicated to glucopyranose-based carbohydrates and compatible with the recent version of the Martini force field (v. 3.0). The parameterization was based on optimizing bonded and nonbonded parameters with a reference to the all-atom simulation results and the experimental data. Application of the newly developed coarse-grained carbohydrate model to oligosaccharides curdlan and cellulose displays spontaneous formation of aggregates of experimentally identified features. In contact with other biomolecules, the model is capable of recovering the protective effect of glucose monosaccharides on a lipid bilayer and correctly identifying the binding pockets in carbohydrate-binding proteins. The features of the newly proposed model make it an excellent candidate for further extensions, aimed at modeling more complex, functionalized, and biologically relevant carbohydrates."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

PMOKE measurements revealed strong surface anisotropy (1.8 mJ/m2) favoring perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and asymmetric domain wall propagation explained by anticlockwise chirality. BLS measurements show that this chirality is induced by strong interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (+ 2.0 pJ/m). This is one of the highest values reported so far for Co layers surrounded by different layers. The observed chirality is opposite to what has been found in Co/oxide interfaces. These results and data published earlier, indicate that the strength of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction increases with the amount of stoichiometric NiO. Therefore, this work shows that NiO is the source of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df2e","uid":"b5Ysea43wzLqa4AHHfTa2yA","uuid":"c0155925-70f1-409e-bc8a-ab16902f1783","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390c83","5e709227878c28a047390c82","5e709227878c28a047390c87","5e7093af878c28a0473af256"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Understanding the mechanisms of their adsorption on natural clays opens the way to a wide range of nanobiotechnological applications and helps to clarify the origin of life on Earth. In this work, the adsorption mechanisms and behavior of aliphatic amino acids (glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine) on kaolinite surfaces have been studied by the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. The role of functional groups of aliphatic amino acids (AA) and their orientational behavior during the formation of hydrogen bonds with siloxane and hydroxyl surfaces of kaolinite have been systematically scrutinized. It has been found that the carboxyl group plays a crucial role in the mechanism of interaction between AA and kaolinite surfaces. The strongest hydrogen bonds are formed between the H-atom of the carboxyl group of AA and the O-atom of the hydroxyl surface of kaolinite. An additional hydrogen bond can be formed between the N-atom of the amino group and the surface –OH groups of kaolinite. The adsorption energy of AA on a hydroxyl surface is ~3 times higher than that on the siloxane surface. The obtained theoretical results comply with and help to explain the experimental data available in the scientific literature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The most common synthesis method, using NaOH as precipitant, is problematized by the possibility of introducing undesired Na contamination. Alkali-free synthesis is usually performed with NH3aq, a precipitant which is less efficient in incorporation of Mg into HT lattice. In the present work, organic bases, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and choline hydroxide, were successfully employed as precipitating agents in a new alkali-free route of Mg-Al HT synthesis. HT solids were also obtained with inorganic bases, NH3aq and NaOH. Characterization with X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry/differential scanning calorimetry, confirmed the formation of nanocrystalline HT compounds with all employed bases. HT prepared with NH3aq exhibited an Mg deficit, which was detrimental to the catalytic activity in base catalyzed reactions. The effect was attributed to the tendency of Mg2+ to form ammine complexes, a conclusion supported by quantum mechanical calculations. HT prepared with NaOH showed the highest crystallinity, which was unfavorable for catalytic application. The addition of starch to the synthesis medium provided a means by which to diminish the crystal size of all HT precipitates.

In this study we propose a proniosome gel comprising non-ionic surfactants that self-assemble into de-hydrated vesicles for the delivery of the natural anti-inflammatory compound berberine. By modulating the hydrating ability of the proniosome gel, berberine can be efficiently released with minimal mechanical force. A combination of sorbitan oleate (S80) and polyethlene glycol sorbitan monolaurate (T20) in a sorbitan stearate (S60)-based proniosome enables a readily hydrated gel to deliver berberine into the skin, as confirmed by ex vivo skin permeation studies. Concurrently, an in vitro model of OA using primary mouse chondrocytes demonstrated that the release of berberine at a concentration as low as 1 μg mL−1 is sufficient to restore the production of sulphated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) to levels comparable to healthy chondrocytes while avoiding the cytotoxic concentrations (IC50 = 33 μg mL−1) on skin keratinocytes. In a mouse model of OA, the optimized formulation is able to attenuate inflammation and pain and minimize cartilage degeneration. Taken together, these data demonstrate the feasibility of adopting proniosome gels as a suitable platform to deliver active molecules for the management of osteoarthritis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

It is found that urea and ethanol have significant, yet opposite influences on PSS and PDADMA solvation and interactions. Notably, ethanol is systematically depleted from solvating the charge groups but condenses at the hydrophobic backbone of PSS. As a consequence of the poorer solvation environment for the ionic groups, ethanol significantly increases the extent of counterion condensation. On the other hand, urea readily solvates both polyelectrolytes and replaces water in solvation. For PSS, urea causes disruption of the hydrogen bonding of the PSS headgroup with water. In PSS–PDADMA complexation, these differences influence changes in the binding configurations relative to the case of pure water. Specifically, added ethanol leads to loosening of the complex caused by the enhancement of counterion condensation; added urea pushes polyelectrolyte chains further apart because of the formation of a persistent solvation shell. In total, we find that the effects of urea and ethanol rise from changes in the microscopic-level solvation environment and conformation resulting from solvating water being replaced by the additive. The differences cannot be explained purely via considering relative permittivity and continuum level electrostatic screening. Taken together, the findings could bear significance in tuning polyelectrolyte materials’ mechanical and swelling characteristics via solution additives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Reference measurements were also performed for positively charged polymer particles of spherical shape and the same mass as the spheroids. Primarily, the frequency and bandwidth shifts for various overtones were measured as a function of time. It is shown that the ratio of these signals is close to unity for all overtones. These results were converted to the dependence of the frequency shift on the particle coverage, directly determined by atomic force microscopy and theoretically interpreted in terms of the hydrodynamic model. A quantitative agreement with experiments was attained considering particle slip relative to the ambient oscillating flow. In contrast, the theoretical results pertinent to the rigid contact model proved inadequate. The particle deposition kinetics derived from the QCM method was compared with theoretical modeling performed according to the random sequential adsorption approach. This allowed to assess the feasibility of the QCM technique to furnish proper deposition kinetics for anisotropic particles. It is argued that the hydrodynamic slip effect should be considered in the interpretation of QCM kinetic results acquired for bioparticles, especially viruses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934c878c28a0473a6ac6","5e709474878c28a0473bd5bb","5e709349878c28a0473a6822"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Biogas obtained from two kinds of biomass materials, i.e., plant materials (potato and beet pulp, Corn-Cob-Mix—biogas 1) and animal waste (waste from fish filleting—biogas 2) was considered. The influence of temperature, the ratio of methane/oxygen and total flows of feedstock on the catalytic performance in oxidative coupling of methane process was investigated. Comparative tests were carried out using pure methane and a mixture of methane-carbon dioxide to simulate the composition of biogas 2. The process was carried out in the presence of an Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst. Fresh and used catalysts were characterised by means of powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and low-temperature nitrogen adsorption techniques. In oxidative coupling of methane, the type of raw material used as the source of methane has a small effect on methane conversion (the differences in methane conversion are below 3%), but a significant effect on the selectivity to C2. Depending on the type of raw material, the differences in selectivity to C2 reach as high as 9%. However, the Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalyst operated steadily in the tested period of time at any feedstock composition. Moreover, it was found that CO2, which is the second main component of biogas in addition to methane, has an effect on catalytic performance. Comparative results of catalytic tests indicate that the CO2 effect varies with temperature. Below 1073 K, CO2 exerts a small poisoning effect on methane conversion, while above this temperature the negative effect of CO2 disappears. In the case of selectivity to C2+, the negative effect of CO2 was observed only at 1023 K. At higher temperatures, CO2 enhances selectivity to C2+. The effect of CO2 was established by correlating the catalytic results with the temperature programmed desorption of CO2 investigation. The poisoning effect of CO2 was connected with the formation of surface Na2CO3, whose concentration depends on temperature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","uid":"blTedeK8fuVutIuS0UC1hLA","uuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","name":"Politechnika Krakowska im.

Several parameters can contribute to this type of degradation. These paintings have a complex layered structure, typically composed of minimum four or more hygroscopic materials, each of which has different (non-linear) material properties and geometrical complexities. The mechanical degradation of canvas paintings occurs because each of these materials have diverse responses under fluctuating environmental conditions, especially temperature and relative humidity (RH). By examining the geometrical complexities and the non-linear material properties, this paper presents an investigation of three degradation phenomena under desiccation: (1) bulging formation around the corners, (2) crack formation in glue and ground layers, and (3) plastic deformation in the ground and oil paint layers.\n\nThis on-going investigation provides further insights into the global and local stress distribution in typically constructed oil canvas paintings. This includes finite element method (FEM) and extended-FEM (XFEM) computer models at various scales, under desiccation from the initial RH of 90%, and 50–10%. The models consist of four to five different materials, namely lead white oil paint, red iron oxide oil paint, rabbit skin glue, linen canvas, and a spruce stretcher. The models were constructed using several combinations of materials to conduct parametric studies on the effects of glue shrinkage in paintings due to desiccation, and changing the mechanical properties of the ground layers. The relevant geometrical and mechanical properties with respect to the stress relaxation conditions are discussed in detail.\n\nThe simulation results of the full-scale models show that the shrinkage of glue lowers the level of induced tension stresses in the paint layers in the central area of the painting due to the inward bowing of the stretcher. The inward deformation of the stretcher can be 4.5 times as large in a painting with a glue layer as in one without. This indicates the difficulty in forming cracks near the center of paintings purely by desiccation; however, in close-up cross-section model, cracks of 20 μm in length could still be observed in the ground exposed to an extreme RH change of 90% to 10%.\n\nThe analysis of cross-section models with the full geometrical complexity for the corners showed that multiple cracks are likely to form in ground and paint layers in the corners when desiccated by 40%; RH 50–10%. Furthermore, in extreme cases with stiffer ground/paint such as zinc white, cracks can form from smaller drop in RH; RH 50% to 35%. Such cracks are form in the ground layers, and therefore, are not initially visible as they are positioned below the uncracked paint layer. This result can be the possible explanation for cracks in the ground, which are initially invisible with the naked eye, but can be revealed with X-radiographs.\n\nThe results support the hypothesis that fluctuations in relative humidity can cause hidden cracks in the lower layers, which can eventually propagate further into the upper-lying paint layers of paintings. The cracks typically form when the desiccation reaches a 40% drop, but in cases of brittle materials the drop causing cracks can be lower. The actual RH drop causing cracks depends on the specific material composition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Ionic strength, salt type, and terminating layer are known to influence PEM swelling. However, knowledge of water’s microenvironment within a PEM, whether that water is affiliated with intrinsic or extrinsic ion pairs, remains lacking. Here, we examine the influence of both assembly and post-assembly conditions on the water–ion pair interactions of poly(styrene sulfonate)/poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PSS/PDADMA) PEMs in NaCl and KBr. This is accomplished by developing a methodology in which quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring is applied to estimate the number of water molecules affiliated with an ion pair (i), as well as the hydration coefficient, πsaltH2O. PSS/PDADMA PEMs are assembled in varying ionic strengths of either NaCl and KBr and then exposed post-assembly to increasing ionic strengths of matching salt type. A linear relationship between the total amount of water per intrinsic ion pair and the post-assembly salt concentration was obtained at post-assembly salt concentrations >0.5 M, yielding estimates for both i and πsaltH2O. We observe higher values of i and πsaltH2O in KBr-assembled PEMs due to KBr being more effective in doping the assembly because of KBr’s more chaotropic nature as compared to NaCl. Lastly, when PSS is the terminating layer, i decreases in value due to PSS’s hydrophobic nature. Classical and ab initio molecular dynamics provide a microstructural view as to how NaCl and KBr interact with individual polyelectrolytes and the involved water shells. Put together, this study provides further insight into the understanding of existing water microenvironments in PEMs and the effects of both assembly and post-assembly conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Knowledge of LTA adsorption at interfaces and its solution self-assembly is crucial to understanding its role in bacterial adhesion and colonisation, infections and inflammations. Here, we report the self-assembly behaviour of LTA extracted from Bacillus subtilis, a Gram-positive bacterium, in an aqueous solution using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and its adsorption behaviour at the solid–liquid interface using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). The Cryo-TEM results indicated the formation of spherical LTA micelles that decreased in size on addition of calcium chloride (CaCl2), attributed to charge neutralisation and possible formation of stable Ca2+-bridges between the phosphate groups on neighbouring LTA chains. Analysis of the SANS data from the polydisperse LTA aggregates in solution using the two Lorentzian model revealed the existence of two correlation lengths, which could respectively account for the presence of LTA micelle clusters and the local structure arising from LTA intra-molecular interactions. In the presence of CaCl2, the decrease in the correlation lengths of the clusters indicated possible disruption of H-bonding by Ca2+, leading to poorer water-LTA interactions. At higher temperatures, the correlation length corresponding to the clusters increased, indicating a temperature assisted growth caused by the fluidization of micellar core and dehydration of the polar LTA chains. AFM imaging showed that adsorption of LTA aggregates at the SiO2–water interface was significantly prompted by the addition of CaCl2, also confirmed by QCM-D measurements. These unprecedented nanoscopic structural details on the morphology of LTA aggregates in solution and at the solid–liquid interface add to our fundamental understanding of its self-assembly behaviour hitherto underexplored."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The common method for their synthesis is based on co-precipitation, with NaOH as a precipitant, and is burdened with the possibility of introducing undesired Na contamination. This work describes the use of two organic bases, tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and choline hydroxide, as precipitating agents in a novel alkali-free route for Cu–Mn–Al catalyst synthesis. To obtain fine crystalline precursors, which are considered advantageous for the preparation of active catalysts, co-precipitation was carried out in the presence of starch gel. Reference materials prepared with NaOH in the absence of starch were also obtained. Mixed oxides were produced by calcination at 450 °C. The precursors contained MnCO3 doped with Cu and Al, and an admixture of amorphous phases. Those prepared in the presence of starch were less crystalline and retained biopolymer residues. The combustion of these residues during calcination enhanced the formation of larger amounts of the Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 spinel phase, with better crystallinity in comparison to catalysts prepared from conventionally synthesized precursors. Tests of toluene combustion demonstrated that the catalysts prepared with starch performed better than those obtained in starch-free syntheses, and that the mixed oxides obtained by the alkali-free route were more active than catalysts prepared with NaOH. Catalytic data are discussed in terms of property–performance relationships."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Though the assumption is valid for most of museum interiors, it does not reflect climate conditions in historic houses and churches whose specificity lies in dynamic temperature and relative humidity (RH) variations, particularly intense in cases of operating heating systems. The present paper analyses the risk of fracture in massive wooden cultural heritage objects, particularly endangered by gradients of moisture forming in their volume due to dynamic environmental variations. The study aimed at elucidating general trends as both crack formation and propagation depend on material parameters of a specific wooden element, which can vary even within the same wood species. A two-dimensional elastic model of a massive object made of pine wood was subjected to two types of RH variations: step and sinusoidal. The critical amplitude and duration of variations inducing crack propagation were determined for both variation types. The modelling showed that the risk of fracture was significantly higher for a sinusoidal variation than for a sudden RH drop. Therefore, sinusoidal variations should be considered the worst-case condition when analysing risk of fracture in wooden objects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The determination of the precise composition of aqueous solution formulations is a key issue for the achievement of environmentally-friendly disperse systems with controllable properties and reasonable stability. The present work is focused on the investigation of synergistic interactions in aqueous systems containing Quillaja saponins and Apple pectins. Profile analysis tensiometer (PAT-1) is applied to study the surface tension and surface dilational rheology of the adsorption layers at the air/solution interface. The properties and the foam films (drainage kinetics, film thickness, disjoining pressure isotherm, critical pressure of rupture) are investigated using the thin-liquid-film (TLF) microinterferometric method of Scheludko–Exerowa and the TLF-pressure-balance technique (TLF-PBT). The results demonstrate that the structure and stability performance of the complex aqueous solutions can be finely tuned by changing the ratio of the bioactive ingredients.

The debris consists of ceramic bricks (and other wall elements), mortar, thermal insulation (usually expanded polystyrene or rockwool), smaller steel elements, pieces of wood, and glass. Such mixed debris is difficult to recycle. Separating thermal insulation that is “glued” by cement mortar to brickwork is probably the most difficult and time-consuming task in processing mixed debris. This task can be performed in a very different and fully “automatized” manner using Tenebrio molitor mealworms. The mealworms remove expanded polystyrene from brickwork surfaces and transform it into frass. In the paper, a research program aiming to prove the concept of using the mealworms of Tenebrio molitor for processing mixed debris is presented. The tests were conducted using two models of a three-layered brickwork wall, which is very common in Europe. The proposed approached was successful. Both types of used expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) were fully removed from multilayer wall specimens. The possibilities and limitations of the proposed processing method were discussed and analyzed. The conducted research proved that it is feasible to clean brickwork debris from the EPS using Tenebrio molitor mealworms. Differences in the speed of cleaning process regarding the type of EPS were noted. More research is needed to scale the process, and to find the best method for using frass. By using Tenebrio molitor mealworms, one can make the demolition process much cleaner."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602decba9543c7410626e840","5e70922b878c28a047390fb3","5e70945e878c28a0473bb9c3","5e7092b1878c28a04739ae5f","5e709227878c28a047390c3b","5e709227878c28a047390c42"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Tensile properties—modulus of elasticity and strain at break—as well as cumulative shrinkage were determined for a selection of oil paints from Mecklenburg’s Paint Reference Collection now after approximately 30 years of drying. The oil paints were found to get stiffer and more brittle with diminishing plastic deformation and increasingly elastic behaviour. For some paints, the increases in stiffness and decreases in the strain at break were dramatic during the late stage of drying. The observations modify the current physical model of paintings in which the mismatch in the response of glue-based ground layer and unrestrained wood or canvas support to variations in relative humidity (RH) has been identified as the worst-case condition for the fracturing of the entire pictorial layer. This study demonstrated that some paints were more brittle than the glue-based ground layer and as a consequence more vulnerable to cracking. The shrinkage of paints due to molecular relocation and/or evaporation of organic medium as they dry and age was measured. This shrinkage can exceed their strain at break and lead to fracturing of the oil paint layer if it is restrained by a dimensionally stable substrate. Consequently, after long-term drying, the cumulative shrinkage can cause oil paints to crack even in absence of fluctuations in RH or temperature. An example of cracking developed in an oil paint layer on the top of an undamaged ground layer in a historic panel painting was made evident by the X-ray microtomography."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

At the same time, substitutes for plastics are being sought in order to protect the environment. Biodegradable polymer composites seem to be an extremely promising material that could replace synthetic materials in the future. By encapsulating biologically active substances in a polymer matrix, directional action and controlled release of the substance are possible. The use of ozone, which has become more and more popular especially recently, allows to limit the growth of microorganisms, and the production of ozone derivatives of unsaturated fats allows to reduce the short time of its decomposition. The aim of this study was to analyse the physicochemical and bacteriostatic properties of innovative chitosan-based films containing encapsulated nanocapsules of ozonated olive oil in two concentrations. The morphology and size of the obtained nanocapsules were determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy and DLS. The largest particle size was observed for the film containing the lower ozone concentration – up to 4900 nm, in the control film 3500 nm, for the film with the highest ozone concentration, the particle size was the smallest, with the majority in the range of 100–1000 nm. Ozone content was determined by peroxidation number. The properties of the composites were characterised by infrared (IR) which proved that chitosan is a good matrix for the formation of capsules and ultraviolet (UV) which showed that the obtained composite absorbs light in the range of blue and near ultraviolet light, and the addition of nanocapsules of ozonated olive oil increased the degree of absorption and decreased the transparency. We also performed photoluminescence spectroscopy before and after storage of pork meat proving that films are sensitive to the physico-chemical and biochemical transformation products formed as a result of meat spoilage. The study of the microbiological properties included the analysis of the microbiological quality of pork meat stored under the obtained films as a function of time. The films have a bactericidal and bacteriostatic effect and the addition of ozonated olive oil capsules increases the bactericidal effect against Gram-negative bacteria. Contact angles, Water Vapour Transmission Rate and transparency were also determined and they were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis.

Our experiments show that saponin-chitosan mixtures present some remarkable properties, such as a strong amphiphilicity of the saponin and high dilational viscoelasticity. We believe this points to the presence of chitosan in the adsorption layer, despite its complete lack of surface activity. We explain this phenomenon by electrostatic interactions between the saponin as an anionic surfactant and chitosan as a polycation, leading to surface-active saponin-chitosan complexes and aggregates. Analysing the SFG intensity of the O-H stretching bands from interfacial water molecules, we found that in the case of pH 3.4 for a mixture consisting of 0.1 g/L saponin and 0.001 g/L chitosan, the adsorption layer was electrically neutral. This conclusion from SFG spectra is corroborated by results from surface tensiometry showing a significant reduction in surface tension and effects on the dilational surface elasticity strictly at saponin/chitosan ratios, where SFG spectra indicate zero net charge at the air–water interface."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The polymer particles were synthesized using the stretching procedure with consecutive oxidation of surface hydroxyl groups and coupling of polyethyleneimine. The bulk particle physicochemical properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), dynamic light scattering, and laser Doppler velocimetry. The particles were positively charged in the pH range of 3-10, exhibiting a prolate spheroid shape with an axis ratio of five. Thorough AFM and in situ optical microscopy measurements yielded the adsorption kinetics of particles under the diffusion-controlled regime. The experimental data were adequately interpreted in terms of the random sequential adsorption model with the surface blocking function derived from the scaled particle theory. The root-mean-square (rms) parameter of the layers for a broad range of particle coverage was also determined and interpreted using the topographical model developed in this work. The experiments were complemented by the measurements of the streaming potential of particle layers under various ionic strengths and pHs. The ζ (zeta)-potential data acquired in this way enabled to determine the universal hydrodynamic function describing the dependence of the streaming potential on the particle coverage. The function was used to express the ζ-potential of surfaces covered by particles in terms of substrate rms. It was argued that the acquired results, in addition to being significanct to basic science, can be exploited as useful reference systems for quantitative interpretation of bioparticle deposition on abiotic surfaces."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934c878c28a0473a6ac6","5e709474878c28a0473bd5bb","5e709349878c28a0473a6822"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In the present work, PbS films were fabricated onto a soda lime glass substrate by using an electron beam (e-beam) evaporation technique at a substrate temperature of 300 °C. Samples were annealed in an open atmosphere at a temperature range of 200–450 °C for 2 h. The deposited films were characterized for structural, optical, and electrical properties. Structural properties of PbS have been studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The results of XRD showed that the PbS thin film was crystalline in nature at room temperature with cubic crystal structure (galena) and preferential (111) and orientation (022). The morphology of the thin films was studied by FESEM, which also showed uniform and continuous deposition without any peel-off and patches. EDS analysis was performed to confirm the presence of lead and sulfur in as-deposited and annealed films. The thickness of the PbS film was found to be 172 nm, which is slightly greater than the intended thickness of 150 nm, determined by RBS. Ultraviolet-Visible-Near-Infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectroscopy revealed the maximum transmittance of ~25% for as-deposited films, with an increase of 74% in annealed films. The band gap of PbS was found in the range of 2.12–2.78 eV for as-deposited and annealed films. Hall measurement confirmed the carriers are p-type in nature. Carrier concentration, mobility of the carriers, conductivity, and sheet resistance are directly determined by Hall-effect measurement. The as-deposited sample showed a conductivity of 5.45 × 10−4 S/m, which gradually reduced to 1.21 × 10−5 S/m due to the composite nature of films (lead sulfide along with lead oxide). Furthermore, the present work also reflects the control of properties by controlling the amount of PbO present in the PbS films which are suitable for various applications (such as IR sensors)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Here, we provide for the first-time evidence of unidentified β-1,3-glucan supramolecular complexation into intricate hierarchical architectures over several length scales. We mediated these unique assemblies using a recombinantly produced β-1,3-glucan phosphorylase (Ta1,3BGP) by fine-tuning solution conditions during particle nucleation and growth. We report a synthesis of interconnected parallel hexagonal lamellae composed of 8 nm thick sheets of highly expanded paracrystals. The architecture consists of β-1,3-glucan triple-helices with considerable inter–intra hydrogen bonding within, as well as in between adjacent triple-helices. The results extend our understanding of β-1,3-glucan molecular organization and shed light on different aspects of the crystallization processes of biomolecules into structures unseen by nature.

The antibacterial effect of ozone is widely known and used, but the instability the gas causes, severely limits its application. Ozone entrapment in olive oil by its reaction with an unsaturated bond, allows for the formation of stable, therapeutically active ozone derivatives. In this study, we obtained an innovative hydrogel, based on hyaluronic acid containing micro/nanocapsules of ozonated olive oil. By combination of the biocompatible polymer with a high regenerative capacity and biologically active ingredients, we obtained a hydrogel with regenerative properties and a very weak inhibitory effect against both bacterial commensal skin microbiota and pathogenic Candida-like yeasts. We assessed the stability and rheological properties of the gel, determined the morphology of the composite, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and particle size by the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method. We also performed Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (FTIR-ATR) spectroscopy. The functional properties, including the antimicrobial potential were assessed by the microbiological analysis and in vitro testing on the HaCat human keratinocyte cell line. The studies proved that the obtained emulsions were rheologically stable, exhibited an antimicrobial effect and did not show cytotoxicity in the HaCat keratinocyte model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Based on the framework structures and porosities, five zeolites, including two faujasite (FAU), one ZSM-5 (MFI), one mesoMFI, one ZSM-22 (TON), as well as two mesoporous materials, were evaluated for I2(g) capture at room temperature and 150 °C in an iodine-saturated environment. From these preliminary studies, the three best-performing zeolites were ion-exchanged with Ag+ and evaluated for I2(g) capture under similar conditions. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy data suggest that Ag-FAU frameworks were the materials with the highest capacity for I2(g) in this study, showing ∼3× higher adsorption compared to Ag-mordenite (Ag-MOR) at room temperature, but X-ray diffraction measurements show that the faujasite structure collapsed during the adsorption studies because of dealumination. The Ag-MFI zeolites are decent sorbents in real-life applications, showing both good sorption capacities and higher stability.

The AgNPs were prepared using trisodium citrate (TCSB-AgNPs), tannic acid (TA-AgNPs), and cysteamine hydrochloride (CHSB-AgNPs). They exhibited comparable shape, size distribution, and an average size equal to 15 ± 3 nm which was confirmed with the use of transmission electron microscopy. The electrokinetic characteristics revealed that CHSB-AgNPs have positive, whereas TCSB-AgNPs and TA-AgNPs negative surface charge. First, toxicity of the silver compounds was assessed using the Phytotestkit test. Next, after transferring seedlings to pots, shoot length, leaf surface, shoot dry mass, electrolyte leakage measurement, and photosystem II (PSII) efficiency were determined. AgNPs and silver ions delivered in the form of AgNO3 reduced root and shoots length of common wheat, sorghum, and garden cress; leaves surface of garden cress and white mustard; and shoots dry mass of white mustard. The positively charged CHSB-AgNPs and silver ions delivered in the form of AgNO3 showed the greatest inhibition effect. Moreover, silver ions and positively charged CHSB-AgNPs were more toxic to PSII of model plants than negatively charged TCSB-AgNPs and TA-AgNPs. AgNPs impact differed in the case of monocots and dicots, but the size of the changes was not significant, so it concerned individual parameters. The results revealed the interaction strength, which was generally similar in all tested plants, i.e., increasing negative effect in sequence TCSB-AgNPs < TA-AgNPs < silver ions delivered in the form of AgNO3 < CHSB-AgNPs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

We report here that AOR from Aromatoleum aromaticum (AORAa) catalyzes the reduction of organic acids not only with low-potential Eu(II) or Ti(III) complexes but also with H2 as an electron donor. Additionally, AORAa catalyzes the H2-dependent reduction of NAD+ or benzyl viologen. The rate of H2-dependent NAD+ reduction equals to 10% of that of aldehyde oxidation, representing the highest H2 turnover rate observed among the Mo/W enzymes. As AORAa simultaneously catalyzes the reduction of acids and NAD+, we designed a cascade reaction utilizing a NAD(P)H-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase to reduce organic acids to the corresponding alcohols with H2 as the only reductant. The newly discovered W-hydrogenase side activity of AORAa may find applications in either NADH recycling or conversion of carboxylic acids to more useful biochemicals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Numerous research studies have been devoted to the bactericidal properties of AgNPs while less attention has been focused on their fungicidal activity. Our studies were therefore oriented toward determining the impact of AgNPs characterized by different physicochemical properties on Fusarium avenaceum and Fusarium equiseti. The main hypothesis assumed that the fungicidal properties of AgNPs characterized by comparable morphology can be shaped by stabilizing agent molecules adsorbed on nanoparticle surfaces. Two types of AgNPs were prepared by the reduction of silver ions with sodium borohydride (SB) in the presence of trisodium citrate (TC) or cysteamine hydrochloride (CH). Both types of AgNPs exhibited a quasi-spherical shape. Citrate-stabilized AgNPs (TCSB-AgNPs) of an average size of 15 ± 4 nm were negatively charged. Smaller (12 ± 4 nm), cysteamine-capped AgNPs (CHSB-AgNPs) were characterized by a positive surface charge and higher silver ion release profile. The phytopathogens were exposed to the AgNPs in three doses equal to 2.5, 5 and 10 mg L−1 over 24 and 240 h. Additionally, the impact of silver ions delivered in the form of silver nitrate and the stabilizing agents of AgNPs on the fungi was also investigated. The response of phytopathogens to these treatments was evaluated by determining mycelial growth, sporulation and changes in the cell morphology. The results of our studies showed that CHSB-AgNPs, especially at a concentration of 10 mg L−1, strongly limited the vegetative mycelium growth of both species for short and long treatment times. The cell imaging revealed that CHSB-AgNPs damaged the conidia membranes and penetrated into the cells, while TCSB-AgNPs were deposited on their surface. The fungistatic (lethal) effect was demonstrated only for silver ions at the highest concentration for the F. equiseti species in the 240 h treatment. The number of spores of both Fusarium species was significantly reduced independently of the type of silver compounds used. Generally, it was found that the positively charged CHSB-AgNPs were more fungicidal than negatively charged TCSB-AgNPs. Thereby, it was established that the stabilizing agents of AgNPs and surface charge play a crucial role in the shaping of their fungicidal properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

It was established that at pH 3.5–4 the protein adsorbed on mica and silica surfaces in the form of compact quasi-spherical aggregates with an average size of 14 nm. The maximum coverage of the layers was equal to 3 and 1 mg m−2 at pH 4 and 7.4, respectively. The experimental data were successfully interpreted in terms of theoretical results derived from modeling. The experiments performed for flat substrates were complemented by investigations of the protein corona formation at polymer particles carried out using in situ laser Doppler velocimetry technique. In this way, the zeta potential of the protein layers was acquired as a function of the coverage. Applying the electrokinetic model, these primary data were converted to the dependence of the subunit zeta potential on pH.

The physicochemical characterisation of spent catalysts revealed changes in catalysts phase compositions and reducibility. In the case of Cu/Zr/Zn, Cu/Zr/Zn/Ni and Cu/Zr/Zn/Ga catalysts, the CuO phase was reduced to metallic phase and Cu2O. Therefore, these spent catalysts exhibited lower reduction degree (Rd) in comparison with fresh catalysts. On the other hand, the addition of Mn preserved the copper on + 2 oxidation state during SRE reaction as indicated by XRD and XPS. The µRaman experiments showed that carbon deposit is formed only on the surface of Cu/Zr/Zn/Ni catalyst, which is the reason for the vast deactivation and the lower total activity of this catalyst in SRE.

Hydrophilic and negatively charged silica nanoparticles were neutralised due to the coating with chitosan. That presence of LAE led to the partial hydrophobisation of their surface, which favoured their attachment to the surface of a thin foam film. It was found that the presence of small and medium-sized (6–9 nm) hydrophobic particles in the interfacial layer of lamella foam film inhibited the coalescence and coarsening processes, which prolonged the life of the foam. Furthermore, hydrophobising of 30 nm particles allowed the formation of large aggregates precipitating from the mixture under steady-state conditions. These aggregates, however, under the conditions of the dynamic froth flotation process in the foam column, were floated into the foam layer. As a result, they were trapped in the foam film and Plateau borders, effectively preventing liquid leakage out of the foam. These results demonstrate the efficiency of using chitosan-LAE mixtures to remove silica nanoparticles from aqueous phase by foaming and flotation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

But analysis of the resulting nonlinear time series may be complicated, not least due to the lack of a definite baseline. A mathematical method to transform such irregular time series into a more useful form that oscillates around the zero line has been proposed, which preserves both the frequency and the key topological aspects of the originals in the process. To this end, the mean value theorem for integrals has been applied in constructing a base curve for nonequilibrium, periodic thermokinetic oscillations, q(t), recorded microcalorimetrically in two experiments, respectively, with oscillatory sorptions of H2 and D2 in Pd. Once the mean values are so calculated for each period of q(t), they are subjected to cubic spline interpolation to form a new nonoscillatory curve, h(t). The latter can be used as an essential baseline for the oscillatory component of the original thermokinetic time series. Crucially, the areas under both q(t) and h(t) are supposed to be strictly identical. This being confirmed, the pointwise subtraction q(t) – h(t) yields another oscillatory time series g(t), considered to be the oscillatory component extracted from the original thermokinetic data. Subsequently, the method has been applied to a further group of nine microcalorimetric time series q(t) representing thermokinetic oscillations in the H/Pd system. Using the so-constructed g(t) curves (i.e., extracted oscillatory components), a new parameter, the mean amplitude, has been defined and used for correlating the observed gradation of intensities (i.e., amplitudes) of thermokinetic oscillations with a range of experimental conditions applied. The mean amplitude turns out to be a linear function of the first ionization potential of noble gases, admixed intentionally to H2 before its contacting Pd."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In this contribution calix[6]arenes interacting with amino acids are studied with an additional aim to show that tools such as symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), functional-group SAPT (F-SAPT), and systematic molecular fragmentation (SMF) methods may provide explanations for different numbers of noncovalent bonds and of their varying strength for various calixarene conformers and guest molecules. The partitioning of the interaction energy provides an easy way to identify hydrogen bonds, including those with unconventional hydrogen acceptors, as well as other noncovalent bonds, and to find repulsive destabilizing interactions between functional groups. Various other features can be explained by energy partitioning, such as the red shift of an IR stretching frequency for some hydroxy groups, which arises from their attraction to the phenyl ring of calixarene. Pairs of hydrogen bonds and other noncovalent bonds of similar magnitude found by F-SAPT explain an increase in the stability of both inclusion and outer complexes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a79e8","63b4000b409707221444d3db","63b4000b409707221444d3da"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The mechanical properties of the canvas samples tested exhibited an anisotropy dependent on the measurement direction, being the stiffness corresponding to the weft direction greater than the warp and diagonal ones. Sizing the canvas with a layer of animal glue significantly increased its modulus of elasticity while the anisotropy of mechanical properties was kept in the composite material. The application of an animal glue-based ground layer on sized canvas increased the elasticity modulus of the system by another order of magnitude (~ 2 GPa) whereas the anisotropy of the material disappeared. The measurements were carried out in a wide range of RH from 30 to 90%. An increase in RH caused a decrease in the material stiffness. Cracking of the gesso layer, which is often responsible for the formation of cracks in paintings, was observed at strains of the order of a few thousandths. Swelling of glue sizing dominated the moisture-induced swelling of the composite material in the less stiff warp direction, completely overriding the shrinkage of the untreated canvas. In contrast, the swelling of the composite material in the stiffer weft direction was much smaller than for pure glue alone, being clearly affected by the textile."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Despite over a decade of research, the exact NO reduction steps remain unknown. Herein, using a combined spectroscopic, catalytic and DFT approach, we show that nitrosyl ions (NO+) in zeolitic micropores are the key intermediates for NO reduction. Remarkably, they react with ammonia even below room temperature producing molecular nitrogen (the reaction central to turning the NO pollutant to benign nitrogen) through the intermediacy of the diazo N2H+ cation. Experiments with isotopically labeled N-compounds confirm our proposed reaction path. No copper is required for N2 formation to occur during this step. However, at temperatures below 100 °C, when NO+ reacts with NH3, the bare Brønsted acid site becomes occupied by NH3 to form strongly bound NH4+, and consequently, this stops the catalytic cycle, because NO+ cannot form on NH4-zeolites when their H+ sites are already occupied by NH4+. On the other hand, we show that the reaction becomes catalytic on H–zeolites at temperatures when some ammonia desorption can occur (>120 °C). We suggest that the role of Cu(II) ions in Cu/zeolite catalysts for low-temperature NO reduction is to produce abundant NO+ by the reaction: Cu(II) + NO → Cu(I)⋯NO+. NO+ then reacts with ammonia to produce nitrogen and water. Furthermore, when Cu(I) gets re-oxidized, the catalytic cycle can then continue. Our findings provide novel understanding of the hitherto unknown steps of the SCR mechanism pertinent to N–N coupling. The observed chemistry of Cu ions in zeolites bears striking resemblance to the copper-containing denitrification and annamox enzymes, which catalyze transformation of NOx species to N2, via di-azo compounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Analogous characteristics of the polymer particles were acquired, including their size and zeta potential. The formation of albumin corona on the particles was investigated in situ by electrophoretic mobility measurements. The size, stability and electrokinetic properties of the particles with the corona were also determined. The particle diameter was equal to 125 nm, which coincides with the size of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. The isoelectric point of the particles appeared at a pH of 5. The deposition kinetics of the particles was determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) under diffusion and by quartz microbalance (QCM) under flow conditions. It was shown that the deposition rate at a gold sensor abruptly vanished with pH following the decrease in the zeta potential of the particles.

In our studies, we generated new structures containing 18, 36 and 72 carbon atoms. They are of different shapes including ribbons, sheets and tubes. All these new structures were obtained in virtual reactions driven by external forces. For every reaction, the energy requirement was evaluated exactly when the corresponding transition state was found or it was estimated through our new approach. A small HOMO–LUMO gap in these nanostructures indicates easy excitations and the multiple bonds network indicates their high reactivity. Both of these factors suggest that some potential applications of the new nanostructures are as components of therapeutically active carbon quantum dots, terminal fragments of graphene or carbon nanotubes obtained after fracture or growing in situ in catalytic reactions leading to the formation of carbonaceous materials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The location of drug molecules significantly impacts the kinetics of active substance release and the mechanism of internalization into the cell. This study focuses on the effect of the protonation degree of the G4PAMAM dendrimer and the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU) on the efficiency of complex formation. The most favorable conditions for constructing the G4PAMAM-5FU complex are a low degree of protonation of the dendrimer molecule with the drug simultaneously present in a deprotonated form. The fluorine components in the XPS spectra confirm the formation of the stable complex. Through SAXS and DLS methods, a decrease in the dendrimer’s molecular size resulting from protonation changes at alkaline conditions was demonstrated. The gradual closure of the dendrimer structure observed at high pH values makes it difficult for the 5FU molecules to migrate to the interior of the support structure, thereby promoting drug immobilization on the surface. The 1H NMR and DOSY spectra indicate that electrostatic interactions determine the complex formation process. Through MD simulations, the localization profile and the number of 5FU molecules forming the complex were visualized on an atomic scale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

We use finite element modeling for a thorough representation of the complex structure of an animal cell. In our model, the crucial constituent is the cell cortex—a rigid layer of cytoplasmic proteins present on the inner side of the cell membrane. It plays a vital role in the mechanical interactions between cells. The cell cortex is modeled by a three-dimensional solid to reflect its bending stiffness. This approach allows us to interpret the results of the indentation measurements and extract the mechanical properties of the individual elements of the cell structure. During the simulations, we scan a broad range of parameters such as cortex thickness and Young’s modulus, cytoplasm Young’s modulus, and indenter radius, which define cell properties and experimental conditions. Finally, we propose a simple closed-form formula that approximates the simulated results with satisfactory accuracy. Our formula is as easy to use as Hertz's function to extract cell properties from the measurement, yet it considers the cell’s inner structure, including cell cortex, cytoplasm, and nucleus."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The challenging parameters for microbolometers are the active material selection and the deposition methods. It might be a more promising way to achieve a good performance of the devices. The present work deals with the V2O5 thin films fabricated on soda lime glass substrates by using e-beam evaporation and magnetron sputtering techniques at a substrate temperature of 200 °C. Afterward, samples were annealed at 300 and 400 °C for 1 h to obtain uniform and stoichiometric thin films. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) showed that the thin films deposited by magnetron sputtering were amorphous in nature, even after annealing at elevated temperatures; however, the thin films fabricated by the electron beam evaporation technique show crystalline nature, which was improved by annealing. XRD also revealed various mixed phases of VOx in electron beam-deposited films. Optical properties were determined using UV-Visible spectroscopy, which showed a decrease in transmittance from 81% down to 57% by increasing the annealing temperature. Similarly, the band gap calculated for electron beam evaporated and magnetron sputtered V2O5 thin films was observed in the range of 1.41 to 2.25 eV. Rutherford backscattering (RBS) was performed to determine the thickness and composition of the films. Slight variations have been observed in intended and deposited thicknesses of films fabricated by e-beam and sputtering techniques. Structural properties revealed by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM) were found to be the uniform, compact and dense surface of the as-deposited and 300 °C annealed samples. However, annealing at 400 °C changed the surface morphology into nanorods in e-beam and plate-like structures in the sputtered film. EDS proved the elemental concentration of vanadium and oxygen in these V2O5 thin films. Electrical properties were investigated using the Hall measurement technique which showed better conductivity of sputtered films than e-beam deposited films. It can be concluded that the cost-effective and reliable microbolometers infrared (IR) sensors can be fabricated using annealed sputtered films."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The LAE-CNC mixtures show enhanced foaming properties. The dynamic thin-film balance technique (DTFB) was used to study the morphology, drainage and rupture of LAE-CNC thin liquid films under constant driving pressure. A total of three concentrations of surfactant and the corresponding mixtures of LAE with sulfated (sCNC) and carboxylated (cCNC) cellulose nanocrystals were studied. The sCNC and cCNC suspension with LAE formed thin films, with stability increasing with surfactant concentration and with complex rheological properties. In the presence of LAE, the aggregation of CNC was observed. While the sCNC aggregates were preferentially present in the film volume with a small fraction at the surface, the cCNC aggregates, due to their higher hydrophobicity, were preferentially located at film interfaces, forming compact layers. The presence of both types of aggregates decreased the stability of the thin liquid film compared to the one for the LAE solution with the same concentration. The addition of CNC to LAE was critical for foam formation, and foam stability was in qualitative agreement with the thin films’ lifetimes. The foam volume increased with the LAE concentration. However, there was an optimum surfactant concentration to achieve stable foam. In particular, the very resistant foam was obtained with cCNC suspensions that formed the interfaces with a complex structure and rheology.

The modern theoretical modeling techniques provide a complementary way to investigate these catalytic reactions. Experimental assay frequently does not allow an unequivocal answer to the factors controlling the reaction mechanism. On the other hand, the theoretical experiments provide a precise understanding of the molecular-level steps involved in catalytic reactions. However, modeling requires at least structural data on the enzyme and reactant, and the complexity of the enzyme systems can still be a challenge.\nIn this chapter, we are going to describe how to apply theoretical modeling methods, such as MD simulation, QM-only cluster models of enzyme active site, or QM:MM multiscale modeling to study enzyme kinetics and even to predict kinetic isotope effect (KIE). We present a full protocol that starts from the PDB structure of the enzyme, through MD simulation of enzyme: substrate complex and statistical analysis of MD trajectory, selection of a model of the active site, and study of reaction pathways. We show how theoretical predictions basing on QM-only cluster models, QM:MM model, or multiple QM:MM models derived from QM:MM:MD simulations can be correlated with experimental kinetic results.

Application of the well-known surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) reveals information of how gefitinib, a drug approved in non-small cell lung cancer therapy, connects to the silver and gold nanoparticles (AgNPs and AuNPs, respectively). Such knowledge is important in the context of using the resulting conjugates to increase the effectiveness of cancer therapy. The received data were extended by the nanoscale analysis using atomic force microscopy in combination with the surface-enhanced infrared spectroscopy (AFM-SEIRA) in tapping mode. This allows to better visualize the discussed interaction with ultra-high spatial resolution even reaching the size of the particular nanoparticle (∼15 nm). It should be noted, that the metal nanoparticle mono-layer was enough to enhance the obtained AFM-SEIRA signal, which for the conventional surface-enhanced vibrational techniques would be unattainable. Moreover, since the surface enhancement phenomenon observed in the AFM-SEIRA technique is not fully understood the comparison between this effect and the signal reinforcement in SERS was performed. The drawn conclusions suggest the complementarity of both applied techniques and try to prove the statement that the intensity AFM-SEIRA maps reveal the nature of the drug/metal nanostructure interaction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

Increased expression of LY6K is significantly associated with poor survival outcomes in many solid cancers, including cancers of the breast, ovary, gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, brain, bladder, and lung. LY6K is required for ERK-AKT and TGF-β pathways in cancer cells and is required for in vivo tumor growth. In this report, we describe a novel role for LY6K in mitosis and cytokinesis through aurora B kinase and its substrate histone H3 signaling axis. Further, we describe the structural basis of the molecular interaction of small molecule NSC243928 with LY6K protein and the disruption of LY6K-aurora B signaling in cell cycle progression due to LY6K-NSC243928 interaction. Overall, disruption of LY6K function via NSC243928 led to failed cytokinesis, multinucleated cells, DNA damage, senescence, and apoptosis of cancer cells. LY6K is not required for vital organ function, thus inhibition of LY6K signaling is an ideal therapeutic approach for hard-to-treat cancers that lack targeted therapy such as triple-negative breast cancer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Biocomposite films investigated in the past years are creating a promising future toward ecological, intelligent and active packaging. Due to their unique properties, they can be used in many areas of our life and reduce the constantly increasing pollution of our planet. The aim of our study was to obtain innovative and flexible biopolymer films based on sodium alginate and chitosan, as well as to develop methods for generating nanocapsules with turmeric extract in them. Bionanocomposites were analyzed using UV-VIS, FTIR, photoluminescence spectroscopy and SEM microscopy, while contact angles, surface free energy, particle size (DLS) and zeta potential were determined. The mechanical and colorimetric properties of the produced films were investigated, and the water content, solubility and water absorption were determined. Microbiological tests were carried out to analyze the influence of the produced films on the development of microorganisms. The results of the performed analyses allowed us to confirm the presence of curcumin nano- and microcapsules in the alginate–chitosan composite. Moreover, studies have shown that the structure of polysaccharides does not change during capsule manufacturing. The film with the highest concentration of the capsules showed better parameters in tests of solubility, water content, degree of swelling and mechanical properties. The obtained properties of the developed films allow them to be used as active and intelligent packaging materials, or as their parts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Although their existence and formation kinetics have been theoretically postulated and confirmed in many experimental reports, the investigations primarily remain qualitative in nature. In this paper we present results that, to the best of our knowledge, provide a first quantitative proof of the influence of the dynamic adsorption layer on drainage dynamics of a single foam film formed under dynamic conditions. This is achieved by measuring the drainage dynamics of single foam films, formed by air bubbles of millimetric size colliding against the interface between n-octanol solutions and air. This was repeated for a total of five different surfactant concentrations and two different liquid column heights. All three steps preceding foam film rupture, namely the rising, bouncing and drainage steps, were sequentially examined. In particular, the morphology of the single film formed during the drainage step was analyzed considering the rising and bouncing history of the bubble. It was found that, depending on the motion-induced state of adsorption layer at the bubble surface during the rising and the bouncing steps, single foam film drainage dynamics can be spectacularly different. Using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS), it was revealed that surfactant redistribution can occur at the bubble surface as a result of the bouncing dynamics (approach-bounce cycles), strongly affecting the interfacial mobility, and leading to slower rates of foam film drainage. Since the bouncing amplitude directly depends on the rising velocity, which correlates in turn with the adsorption layer of surfactants at the bubble surface during the rising step, it is demonstrated that the lifetime of surface bubbles should intimately be related to the history of their formation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

As key kinetically relevant reaction steps, the reaction intermediate CuII(NH3)4 ion hydrolyzes to CuII(OH)(NH3)3 ion to gain redox activity. The CuII(OH)(NH3)3 ion also transfers between neighboring zeolite cages to form highly reactive reaction intermediates. Via operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and SCR kinetic measurements and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate here that such kinetically relevant steps become energetically more difficult with lower support Brønsted acid strength and density. Consequently, Cu/LTA displays lower Cu atomic efficiency than Cu/CHA and Cu/AEI, which can also be rationalized by considering differences in their support topology. By carrying out hydrothermal aging to eliminate support Brønsted acid sites, both CuII(NH3)4 ion hydrolysis and CuII(OH)(NH3)3 ion migration are hindered, leading to a marked decrease in Cu atomic efficiency for all catalysts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In some experiments, CeO2 was pretreated in a vacuum at 820 K which caused a partial reduction. In other experiments, CeO2 was reduced with hydrogen at 770 K. We also used CeO2 oxidized by oxygen treatment at 670 K. At low coverages, ethoxy groups and new surface OH groups were formed and water was not produced. On the other hand, at higher loading surfaces, Ce-OH was consumed and ethoxy groups and water were formed. Three kinds of ethoxyls were found on CeO2: monodentate, bidentate, and tridentate ones. They were characterized by various frequencies of symmetrical, asymmetrical, and combinational bands of C-C-O units. The reduction of CeO2 increased the contribution of tridentate ethoxyls and the oxidation increased the contribution of monodentate ones. At higher temperatures, ethoxy groups were oxidized to acetate ions with the formation of new surface OH groups. Monodentate ethoxyls were the most reactive and tridentate ones were the least reactive during oxidation. The amounts of acetate species were the highest for the oxidized CeO2."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Here, a B–site doped BaCe0.56Zr0.2Ni0.04Y0.2O3–δ (BCZNY) electrolytes were fabricated to address this drawback. The impact of Ni addition on sintering and electrical properties was examined. By adding Ni to the B–site of BCZY, a substantial decrease in the sintering temperature was achieved, i.e., from 1600 °C (for BCZY) to 1300 °C (for BCZNY). A conductivity of 0.05 S cm−1 at 700 °C was observed for BCZNY electrolyte in a moist nitrogen environment. In addition, SrFe0.8Mo0.2O3–δ (SFM) is utilized as a symmetrical electrode material due to its high ionic and electronic conductivity. SFM electrode was synthesized via combustion process and exhibited suitable chemical and thermal compatibility with BCZY and BCZNY electrolytes up to 1100 °C. A single–phase cubic structure along with the surface morphology of electrolyte–supported symmetrical cells was confirmed by X–ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was conducted to identify the area–specific polarization resistance (ASR). The lowest ASR values of 0.037, 0.081, and 0.327 Ω cm2 at 800, 700, and 600 °C in humidified hydrogen were obtained in SFM-BCZNY composite electrode. The symmetrical cell achieved a peak power density of 254 m W cm−2 (cell configuration; SFM-BCZNY | BCZNY | SFM-BCZNY) at 800 °C. The fuel cell devices showed long–term stability of the fuel cell device for 100 h at 700 °C under a current of 120 mA cm−2. Considering the presented results, the as-prepared BCZNY is a promising protonic electrolyte for IT-SOFCs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The study focuses on a laboratory-obtained manganese dioxide/montmorillonite (MnO2/MMT) composite for removal of two types of antibiotics – amoxicillin (AMX) and ampicillin (AMP) – from aqueous solution.\n\nRESULTS\nThe composite was successfully prepared using a reduction procedure involving the reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl) to form MnO2 followed by the addition of MMT. X-ray analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were performed for characterization of physicochemical and structural properties, simultaneous thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry for estimation of thermal stability and high-performance liquid chromatography for determination of antibiotic equilibrium concentrations in aqueous solution. The precipitated MnO2 component, manifested by long fibers, corresponded to the tunnel structure of cryptomelane. In the case of MnO2/MMT it is evident that MnO2 developed short fibers with the participation of the MMT matrix. The thermal data suggested that the MnO2 phase upon contact with the clay support showed better thermal stability. The final decomposition of Mn2O3 was shifted to higher temperature of 985 °C. Adsorption procedure in a batch regimen showed sufficient sorption ability for both antibiotics with over 90% efficiency. For AMP the value of qmax was about 45 mg g−1 and for AMX it was only 21 mg g−1.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results provided valuable information for the design of a potentially inexpensive clay-based adsorbent and demonstrated the removal of two types of broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotics from aqueous solution to a sufficient degree. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Many studies are being conducted to incorporate active substances into dressings to positively impact wound healing processes. Researchers have investigated various natural additives, including plant extracts and apiproducts such as royal jelly, to enhance the properties of dressings. In this study, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-based hydrogel dressings modified with royal jelly were developed and analyzed for their sorption ability, wettability, surface morphology, degradation, and mechanical properties. The results showed that the royal jelly and crosslinking agent content had an impact on the physicochemical properties of the hydrogels and their potential for use as innovative dressing materials. This study investigated the swelling behavior, surface morphology, and mechanical properties of hydrogel materials containing royal jelly. The majority of the tested materials showed a gradual increase in swelling ratio with time. The pH of the incubated fluids varied depending on the type of fluid used, with distilled water having the greatest decrease in pH due to the release of organic acids from the royal jelly. The hydrogel samples had a relatively homogeneous surface, and no dependence between composition and surface morphology was observed.

Still, the electrochemical properties of W enzymes have received much less attention than their Mo relatives. Herein we analyse the tungsten enzyme aldehyde oxidoreductase (AOR) from the mesophilic bacterium Aromatoleum aromaticum which has been immobilised on a glassy carbon working electrode. This generates a functional system that electrochemically oxidises a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes in the presence of the electron transfer mediators benzyl viologen, methylene blue or dichlorophenol indophenol. Simulation of the cyclic voltammetry has enabled a thorough kinetic analysis of the system, which reveals that methylene blue acts as a two-electron acceptor. In contrast, the other two mediators act as single electron oxidants. The different electrochemical driving forces imparted by these mediators also lead to significantly different outer sphere electron transfer rates with AOR. This work shows that electrocatalytic aldehyde oxidation can be achieved at a low applied electrochemical potential leading to an extremely energy efficient catalytic process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Initial bubble acceleration, as well as local, maximal and terminal velocities during motion were studied as a function of motion time. Generally, two types of velocity profiles were observed. For low surface-active alkanols (C2–C4), bubble acceleration and terminal velocities diminished with the increase in solution concentration and adsorption coverage. No maximum velocities were distinguished. The situation is much more complicated for higher surface-active alkanols (C5–C10). In low and medium solution concentrations, bubbles detached from the capillary with acceleration comparable to gravitational acceleration, and profiles of the local velocities showed maxima. The terminal velocity of bubbles decreased with increasing adsorption coverage. The heights and widths of the maximum diminished with increasing solution concentration. Much lower initial acceleration values and no maxima presence were observed in the case of the highest n-alkanol concentrations (C5–C10). Nevertheless, in these solutions, the observed terminal velocities were significantly higher than in the case of bubbles moving in solutions of lower concentration (C2–C4). The observed differences were explained by different states of the adsorption layer in the studied solutions, leading to varying degrees of immobilization of the bubble interface, which generates other hydrodynamic conditions of bubble motion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Using UV-Vis, 1H NMR, and CD, structural changes of the drug depending on the pH were monitored. In the pH range of 9.0 to 10.0, the G4.0 PAMAM dendrimer can bind 1 to 10 DOX molecules, while the efficiency increases with the concentration of the drug relative to the carrier. The binding efficiency was described by the parameters of loading content (LC = 4.80–39.20%) and encapsulation efficiency (EE = 17.21–40.16%), whose values increased twofold or even fourfold depending on the conditions. The highest efficiency was obtained for G4.0PAMAM-DOX at a molar ratio of 1:24. Nevertheless, regardless of the conditions, the DLS study indicates system aggregation. Changes in the zeta potential confirm the immobilization of an average of two drug molecules on the dendrimer’s surface. Circular dichroism spectra analysis shows a stable dendrimer-drug complex for all the systems obtained. Since the doxorubicin molecule can simultaneously act as a therapeutic and an imaging agent, the theranostic properties of the PAMAM-DOX system have been demonstrated by the high fluorescence intensity observable on fluorescence microscopy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The relationship between the dynamics of aggregation and activity loss under various pH conditions and in the presence of glucose, serving as a stabilizer, was analysed using spectrophotometric techniques and dynamic light scattering. pH 8.5 was indicated as a representative environment in which the enzyme, despite relatively low activity, shows high stability and the highest total product yield. Based on a series of inactivation experiments, the mechanism of thermal inactivation at pH 8.5 was modelled. The irreversible first-order mechanism of R-HPED inactivation in the temperature range of 47.5–60 °C was verified by isothermal and multi-temperature evaluation of data, confirming that in the alkaline pH 8.5, R-HPED aggregation is the secondary process occurring at already inactivated protein molecules.

Furthermore, an important aspect in the implementation of any additives and formulations is their environmental impact. The properties of the esters depend on the type of sugar used and the hydrophobic component. In this work, selected physicochemical properties of new sugar esters based on lactose, glucose and galactose and hydroxy acids derived from bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoates are shown for the first time. Values for critical aggregation concentration, surface activity and pH make it possible that these esters could compete with other commercially used esters of similar chemical structure. The investigated compounds showed moderate emulsion stabilization abilities presented on the example of water-oil systems containing squalene and body oil. Their potential environmental impact appears to be low, as the esters are not toxic to Caenorhabditis elegans even at concentrations much higher than the critical aggregation concentration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In the past decades, we have witnessed the accumulation of PU waste and its detrimental environmental impacts. PUs have been identified as one of the most toxic polymers leaching hazardous compounds derived both from the polymer itself and the additives used in production. Further environmental impact assessment, identification and characterization of substances derived from PU materials and establishing efficient degradation strategies are crucial. Thus, a selection of eight synthetic model compounds which represent partial PU hydrolysis products were synthesized and characterized both in terms of toxicity and suitability to be used as substrates for the identification of novel biocatalysts for PU biodegradation. Overall, the compounds exhibited low in vitro cytotoxicity against a healthy human fibroblast cell line and virtually no toxic effect on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans up to 500 µg mL−1, and two of the substrates showed moderate aquatic ecotoxicity with EC50 values 53 µg mL−1 and 45 µg mL−1, respectively, on Aliivibrio fischeri. The compounds were successfully applied to study the mechanism of ester and urethane bond cleaving preference of known plastic-degrading enzymes and were used to single out a novel PU-degrading biocatalyst, Amycolatopsis mediterranei ISP5501, among 220 microbial strains.

The force field used for carbohydrates was the GLYCAM-06j version, while functionalized carbon nanotubes (fCNT) were described using version two of the general amber force field. We found a series of significant differences in carbohydrate-fCNT adsorption strength depending on the monosaccharide molecule and protonation state of surface carboxyl groups. GlcNAc and GalNAc reveal a strong adsorption on fCNT with deprotonated carboxyl groups, and a slightly weaker adsorption on the fCNT with protonated carboxyl groups. On the contrary, GlcA weakly adsorbs on fCNT. The change in protonation state of surface carboxyl groups leads to the reversal orientation of GlcNAc and GalNAc in reference to the fCNT surface, while GlcA is not sensitive to that factor. Adsorption of decameric oligomers on the surface of fCNT weakens with the increasing number of monosaccharide units. Chondroitin adsorbs weaker than hyaluronic acid and incorporation of four Ch molecules leads to partial detachment of them from the fCNT surface. The glycan–fCNT interactions are strong enough to alter the conformation of carbohydrate backbone; the corresponding conformational changes act toward a more intensive contact of glycan with the fCNT surface. Structural and energetic features of the adsorption process suggest the CH-π interaction-driven mechanism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The basicity of oxides was followed by CO2 adsorption, and their ability to oxidize was investigated by H2-TPR. It has been found that ethanol reacts with surface OH groups forming ethoxy groups and water. Some oxides: ZrO2, CuO/ZrO2, Al2O3, and Ga2O3 contain several kinds of OH groups (terminal, bidentate, and tridentate) and terminal hydroxyls react with ethanol in the first order. Two kinds of ethoxyls are formed on these oxides: monodental and bidental ones. On the other hand, only one kind of ethoxy group is formed on CuO and NiO. The amount of ethoxy groups correlates with the basicity of oxides. The biggest amount of ethoxyls is produced on the most basic: ZrO2, CuO/ZrO2, and Al2O3, whereas the smallest amount of ethoxyls is produced on CuO, NiO, and Ga2O3, i.e., on oxides of lower basicity. SiO2 does not form ethoxy groups. Above 370 K ethoxy groups on CuO/ZrO2, CuO, and NiO are oxidized to acetate ions. The ability of oxides to oxidize ethoxyl groups increases in the order NiO < CuO < CuO/ZrO2. The temperature of the peak in the H2-TPR diagram decreases in the same order."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Full dealumination resulted in the development of a mesoporous structure and specific surface area (BET) with a twofold decrease in the total acidity and basicity of Zn-BEA, and the formation of Lewis acid sites and basic sites of predominantly medium strength, as well as the removal of Brønsted acid sites from the surface. In the presence of the ZnSiBEA catalyst, which had the lowest total acidity and basicity, the obtained selectivity of 86–94% and yield of 30–33% for propene (at 923 K) exceeded the values for ZnAlSiBEA and ZnAlBEA.

In this work, the nuclear quantum dynamics of hydrogen in a palladium-decorated cubic polymorph of tungsten oxide, Pd/cWO(3), are characterized by the technique of neutron Compton scattering augmented by ab initio harmonic lattice modeling. The deeply penetrating nature of the neutron scattering process, the lack of spectroscopic selection rules, the inherent high sensitivity to hydrogen, the high energy and momentum resolution for hydrogen, and the mass selectivity of the technique render the neutron Compton scattering a very potent and unique tool for investigating the local dynamics of hydrogen species in bulk matrices. The total neutron Compton scattering response of hydrogen is described in terms of the hydrogen momentum distribution. The distribution is deconvoluted under the assumption of three pools of hydrogen with distinctly different nuclear quantum dynamical behavior: (i) hydrogen-terminated beta-palladium hydride, (ii) hydrogen in acid centers (OH+ groups) on the surface of the cubic phase of tungsten oxide, and (iii) quasi-free atomic hydrogen inside the saturated hydrogen bronze resulting from the spillover process. The ab initio modeling of lattice dynamics yields theoretical predictions for the values of the widths of proton momentum distributions in the first two hydrogen pools, which allows for obtaining the contribution and the width of the momentum distribution of the quasi-free atomic hydrogen resulting from the hydrogen spillover process. The analysis reveals that the local binding strength of the quasi-free hydrogen is characterized by the values of nuclear momentum distribution width, nuclear kinetic energy, and force constant of the underlying potential of the mean force close to those of free, unconstrained hydrogen atomic species in a gas of non-interacting particles described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Moreover, this picture of the local dynamics of the quasi-free hydrogen is consistent with the proton polaron model of hydrogen-induced coloration of bulk hydrogenated WO3."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c9878c28a0473b0b7c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The main challenge still lingers regarding the exact mechanism of particle formation due to the non-equilibrium kinetic by-products resulting from the localized alternative, fast, high-temperature nature of the process. Here, the authors analyze the bond breaking/formation of copper or copper (II) interfaces with ethanol during the absorption of pulses for Cu-CuO-Cu2O formation applicable as an electrocatalyst in ethanol oxidation fuel cells. This study includes but is not limited to, a comprehensive discussion of the interaction between nano-laser pulses and suspension for practical control of the synthesis process. The observed exponential and logarithmic changes in the content of heterostructures for the CuO-ethanol and Cu-ethanol samples irradiated with different fluences are interpreted as the dominant role of physical and chemical reactions, respectively, during the pulsed laser irradiation of suspensions synthesis.

We report that the observed adsorption behavior rises from an interplay of i) the change in the number of possible peptide-surface ion pairs between the charged moieties and ii) repulsive electrostatic interactions between the polypeptide molecules. For low pH values, polypeptide adsorption was strongest and stable monolayers were formed. However, electrostatic repulsion between the polypeptides led to a relatively low maximum surface coverage. On the other hand, higher pH led to more weakly bound, but significantly denser, peptide films with limited stability. Simulations indicate that electrostatic interactions are the main driving force for adsorption, while hydrogen bonding and non-specific interactions also contribute. Additionally, the important role of the counterions of the negatively charged quartz surface that form a positively charged ion adlayer is highlighted. Ion release of the condensed sodium ions at the charged surface occurs via displacement by polypeptide adsorption. The mechanisms revealed by this work provide systematic guidelines to engineering active surfaces of charged peptides with controlled surface coverage and reversible binding."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Given that EVs are a new element of the communication within the ovarian follicle, extensive research is needed to optimize method of their isolation. The aim of the study was to assess size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) as a tool for effective EVs isolation from porcine ovarian follicular fluid. The characterization of EVs was performed by nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, mass spectrometry and Western blot. We determined EVs concentration, size distribution, zeta potential, morphology, purity, and marker proteins. Our results show that SEC is an effective method for isolation of EVs from porcine follicular fluid.

This work shows that ultra-stable zeolite Y (USY) possesses small particles of amorphous material located in the porous structure, as detected via 29Si MAS NMR and STEM. They are washed out by the chemical treatment with 0.2 M TBAOH without deterioration or modification of the crystal structure of zeolite. Contrarily, the treatment of this zeolite with NaOH-containing solutions, results in major changes in porosity and acidity of the samples. TBAOH-treated sample showed significantly different NMR spectra of adsorbed 129Xe, containing two separate signals and powder-like line shapes recorded at low temperatures. It was ascribed to the higher loading of xenon atoms in supercages. The cleaning of the sample from the debris located in micropores increases the accessible volume in supercages, therefore xenon atoms could occupy the cages in higher quantities. This treatment method could be used for fine-tuning of ultra-stable zeolite Y crystals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

They can have both positive (accelerating the normal healing process) and negative effects (causing cancer) on disease progression and have potential applications in gene therapy and wound healing. However, their short half-life, low stability, and susceptibility to degradation by enzymes at body temperature make them easily degradable in vivo. To improve their effectiveness and stability, growth factors require carriers for delivery that protect them from heat, pH changes, and proteolysis. These carriers should also be able to deliver the growth factors to their intended destination. This review focuses on the current scientific literature concerning the physicochemical properties (such as biocompatibility, high affinity for binding growth factors, improved bioactivity and stability of the growth factors, protection from heat, pH changes or appropriate electric charge for growth factor attachment via electrostatic interactions) of macroions, growth factors, and macroion-growth factor assemblies, as well as their potential uses in medicine (e.g., diabetic wound healing, tissue regeneration, and cancer therapy). Specific attention is given to three types of growth factors: vascular endothelial growth factors, human fibroblast growth factors, and neurotrophins, as well as selected biocompatible synthetic macroions (obtained through standard polymerization techniques) and polysaccharides (natural macroions composed of repeating monomeric units of monosaccharides). Understanding the mechanisms by which growth factors bind to potential carriers could lead to more effective delivery methods for these proteins, which are of significant interest in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative and civilization diseases, as well as in the healing of chronic wounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Two types of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) and a commercial product, labeled here as TiO2Com, were selected for the studies. The yield and chemical parameters of herbage did not improve significantly in response to the TiO2 treatment, in comparison to the control group (CONT). The crude protein content of silage was significantly lower in the TiO2Com-treated group than in the TiO2NPs2 group (117 vs. 129 g kg−1 dry matter (DM)). The use of water-soluble carbohydrates during fermentation was limited in the TiO2NPs2 and TiO2Com groups. The fermentation pattern was similar for each investigated group, and a significant difference in pH values was noted between the TiO2NPs2 (pH = 4.49) and CONT (pH = 4.68) group. Lactic acid concentration was the highest in the TiO2NPs1 group (94.8 g kg−1 DM), and the difference relative to the CONT group (83.2 g kg−1 DM) was statistically significant.

materials in the world which can be synthesized by various methods. The most common one is a carbothermic or magnesiothermic reduction of B2O3 performed at high temperatures, where the obtained powder still requires grinding and purification. The goal of this research is to present the possibility of synthesizing B4C nanoparticles from elements via vapor deposition and modifying the morphology of the obtained powders, particularly those synthesized at high temperatures. B4C nanoparticles were synthesized in the process of direct synthesis from boron and carbon powders heated at the temperature of 1650 °C for 2 h under argon and characterized by using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, and dynamic light scattering measurements. The physicochemical characteristics of B4C nanoparticles were determined, including the diffusion coefficients, hydrodynamic diameter, electrophoretic mobilities, and zeta potentials. An evaluation of the obtained B4C nanoparticles was performed on several human and mouse cell lines, showing the relation between the cytotoxicity effect and the size of the synthesized nanoparticles. Assessing the suitability of the synthesized B4C for further modifications in terms of its applicability in boron neutron capture therapy was the overarching goal of this research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Here, we present a novel extension of the capabilities of this method by assisting epitaxial growth with the presence of an external magnetic field (MF). MF-assisted epitaxial growth was implemented under ultra-high vacuum conditions thanks to specialized sample holders for generating in-plane or out-of-plane MF and dedicated manipulator stations with heating and cooling options. The significant impact of MF on the magnetic properties was shown for ultra-thin epitaxial magnetite films grown on MgO(111). Using in situ and ex situ characterization methods, scanning tunneling microscopy, conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy, and the magneto-optic Kerr effect, we showed that the in-plane MF applied during the reactive deposition of 10 nm Fe3O4(111)/MgO(111) heterostructures influenced the growth morphology of the magnetite films, which affects both in-plane and out-of-plane characteristics of the magnetization process. The observed changes are explained in terms of modification of the effective magnetic anisotropy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Two series of composites were obtained: one derived from cetyltrimethylammonium organomontmorillonite (CTA-Mt), exfoliated in 1-hexanol, and the other from sodium form of montmorillonite (Na-Mt) dispersed by formation of an inverse microemulsion in 1-hexanol. The TiO2 content ranged from 16 to 64 wt.%. The composites were characterized with X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The Na-Mt-derived component was shown to undergo transformation to CTA-Mt, as indicated by basal spacing of 17.5 nm, due to the interaction with the CTABr surfactant in inverse microemulsion. It was also better dispersed and intermixed with TiO2 nanoparticles. As a result, the TiO2/Na-Mt series displayed superior textural properties, with specific surface area up to 256 m2g−1 and pore volume up to 0.247 cm3g−1 compared with 208 m2g−1 and 0.231 cm3g−1, respectively, for the TiO2/CTA-Mt counterpart. Members of both series were uniformly mesoporous, with the dominant pore size around 5 nm, i.e., comparable with the dimensions of titania nanoparticles. The advantage of the adopted synthesis method is discussed in the context of other preparative procedures used for manufacturing of titania-clay composites."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

TGF-β signaling suppresses the anti-tumor immune response in a tumor microenvironment, allowing sustained tumor growth. TGF-β plays an important role in normal physiology; thus it is no surprise that the clinical development of effective and safe TGF-β inhibitors has been hampered due to their high toxicity. We discovered that increased expression of LY6K in cancer cells led to increased TGF-β signaling and that inhibition of LY6K could lead to reduced TGF-β signaling and reduced in vivo tumor growth. LY6K is a highly cancer-specific protein, and it is not expressed in normal organs except in the testes. Thus, LY6K is a valid target for developing therapeutic strategies to inhibit TGF-β signaling in cancer cells. We employed in vitro pull-down assays and molecular dynamics simulations to understand the structural determinants of the TGF-β receptor complex with LY6K. This combined approach allowed us to identify the critical residues and dynamics of the LY6K interaction with the TGF-β receptor complex. These data are critical in designing novel drugs for the inhibition of TGF-β in LY6K expressing cancer, induction of anti-tumor immune response, and inhibition of tumor growth and metastatic spread."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

It resulted in the progressive leaching of the Mg2+ from the octahedral sheets of the Laponite structure and their capture on the surface of PCH composites increasing the Mg/Si ratio. The increase of Mg/Si ratio was accompanied by the decline of the (Mg3OH) absorption bands intensity attributed to Laponite and discussed regarding the formation of dispersed nanostructured MgO moieties capable of adsorbing CO2. CO2-TPD temperature-programmed desorption technique revealed that sorption and stabilization of CO2 molecules are related to the coordination of oxygen sites in the formed MgO lattice and that edge and corner sites facilitate the interaction of CO2 molecules with O2− sites on MgO. Doping of PCH resulted also in the nucleation of nanocrystalline α-Fe2O3 able to capture CO2 with strength and stability higher than MgO.

The effect of sodium (Na) doping in these films was studied. The synthesis of the films was performed at temperatures of 60, 70, and 80 °C for 5 min. The microstructure of the SnS films analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed a compact morphology of the films deposited at 80 °C. The edges of the SnS grains were rounded off with the addition of a commercial surfactant. The thickness of different SnS layers deposited on the copper substrate was found to be 230 nm from spectroscopic ellipsometry and cross-section analysis using SEM. The deposition parameters such as temperature, surfactant addition, and sodium doping time did not affect the thickness of the layers. From the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, the size of the SnS crystallites was found to be around 44 nm. Depending on the process conditions, Na doping affects the size of the crystallites in different ways. A study of the conductivity of SnS films provides a specific conductivity value of 0.3 S. The energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) equipped with the SEM revealed the Sn:S stoichiometry of the film to be 1:1, which was confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The determined band-gap of SnS is equal to 1.27 eV and is in good agreement with the literature data."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091dc878c28a04738d45d","uid":"bESWdwjKrFoZdBw4GPQn1yQ","uuid":"ea249e84-ad7b-4dc3-b21d-4175f8ed6be2","name":"Centrum Badań i Rozwoju Technologii dla Przemysłu S.A.","affiliatedPersonIDs":["64f1792d40970739aafd97bf"],"parentId":"5e7091dc878c28a04738d45d","parentUuid":"ea249e84-ad7b-4dc3-b21d-4175f8ed6be2","rootId":"5e7091dc878c28a04738d45d","rootUuid":"ea249e84-ad7b-4dc3-b21d-4175f8ed6be2","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The model takes into account the most important deposition processes observed in historic buildings: Brownian and turbulent diffusion, gravitational settling, turbophoresis, and thermophoresis. The developed model is expressed as a function of important parameters characterizing historic interiors: the friction velocity - capturing the effect of the indoor airflow intensity, the difference between the temperature of the air and the surface, and surface roughness. In particular, a new form of the thermophoretic term was proposed to account for an important mechanism of surface soiling driven by frequent large temperature differences between indoor air and surfaces in historic buildings. The form adopted allowed the temperature gradients to be calculated down to low distances from the surfaces and showed insignificant dependence of the temperature gradient on the diameter of particles, which yielded a meaningful physical description of the process. The predictions of the developed model agreed with the outcome of the previous models, in turn correctly interpreting the experimental data. The model was used in simulating the total deposition velocity in a small-size church taken as an example of a historic building, heated in the cold period. The model adequately predicted the deposition processes and proved to be able to map magnitudes of deposition velocities for specific surface orientations. The crucial effect of the surface roughness on the deposition paths was documented."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In the present study, the Stöber process was used to investigate the effect of parameters, such as reagent concentration and synthesis temperature, on the resulting silica particle size and structure. The optimal conditions for successfully obtaining homogeneous particles in the mesoscale range with high reproducibility were investigated. Several synthesis procedures and their dependence on the reaction temperature were presented to allow the selection of the assumed diameter of silica spheres. The numerous samples obtained were examined for size, homogeneity, structure, and specific surface area. On the basis of specific surface area measurements and nuclear magnetic resonance studies, the internal hierarchical structure of the spherical silica was confirmed as consisting of a solid core and layers of secondary spheres covered by a solid shell. Structural studies (X-ray Spectroscopy, X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure, and nuclear magnetic resonance), together with infrared vibrational spectroscopy, showed no dependence of the structure of the obtained mesospheres on the concentration of reagents and the size of the obtained particles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

In this study, polyacrylic acid conjugated cerium oxide (PAA-CeO) nanoparticles were synthesized in a 50-60 nm size range with a zeta potential of - 35 mV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed a mixed valence state of Ce4+ and Ce3+. PAA-CeO nanoparticles were safe for undifferentiated (UN-) and retinoic acid-differentiated (RA-) human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and reduced the extent of cell damage evoked by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In the H2O2 model of cell damage PAA-CeO did not affect the caspase-3 activity (apoptosis marker) but attenuated the number of propidium iodide-positive cells (necrosis marker). In the 6-OHDA model, nanoparticles profoundly reduced necrotic changes and partially attenuated caspase-3 activity. However, we did not observe any impact of PAA-CeO on intracellular ROS formation induced by H2O2. Further, the flow cytometry analysis of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled PAA-CeO revealed a time- and concentration-dependent cellular uptake of nanoparticles.

Although it has already gained attention from the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, thanks to its hydrating and cell-protecting properties, the reaction mechanism of its final synthesis step is still not fully understood. The ultimate step of ectoine biosynthesis is catalysed by the ectoine synthase enzyme (EctC), which requires an iron ion for substrate binding and overall enzymatic activity. Even though a crystal structure for Paenibacillus lautus EctC—substrate complex is available (PDB: 5ONN), it is not very informative with respect to the geometry of the active site because: (1) the crystal was obtained at a pH value far from the enzyme’s pH optimum, (2) the electron density at the Fe position is weak, and (3) the Fe-ligand distances are too long. To fill this gap, in this work we have used classical molecular dynamics simulations to model the enzyme-substrate (N-gamma-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid) complex of Paenibacillus lautus EctC (PlEctC). Since PlEctC is a homodimeric protein, MD simulations were carried out for a dimer with various plausible occupancies by the substrate and for two plausible coordination geometries around the catalytic Fe ion: tetrahedral and octahedral. MD results revealed that the presence of the ligand has a stabilising effect on the protein structure, most notably on a short helix 112–118, which flanks the entrance to the active site. The most important amino acids for substrate binding are Trp21, Arg25, Asn38, Thr40, and Tyr52, which were also identified in the crystal structure. Importantly, the substrate can easily adopt a conformation suitable for the progress of the catalytic reaction, and it does so spontaneously for the octahedral 6-coordinate geometry of the iron cofactor or with a low energy penalty (ca. 3 kcal/mol) in the case of 4-coordinate tetrahedral geometry. Simulations for different substrate occupancy states did not reveal any signs of cooperativity between the two monomers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

PEMs and PECs are very tunable because their structure and properties are influenced by factors such as pH, ionic strength, salt type, humidity, and temperature. Therefore, it is increasingly important to understand how these factors affect PECs and PEMs on a molecular level. In this Feature Article, we summarize our contributions to the field in the development of approaches to quantify the swelling, thermal properties, and dynamic mechanical properties of PEMs and PECs. First, the role of water as a plasticizer and in the glass-transition temperature (Tg) in both strong poly(diallyldimethylammonium)/poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PDADMA/PSS) and weak poly(allylamine hydrochloride)/poly(acrylic acid) (PAH/PAA) systems is presented. Then, factors influencing the dynamics of PECs and PEMs are discussed. We also reflect on the swelling of PEMs in response to different salts and solvent additives. Last, the nature of water’s microenvironment in PEMs/PECs is discussed. A special emphasis is placed on experimental techniques, along with molecular simulations. Taken together, this review presents an outlook and offers recommendations for future research directions, such as studying the additional effects of hydrogen-bonding hydrophobic interactions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Analytical results were derived for particles of various shapes such as cylinders (rods), disks, ellipsoids, hemispheres (caps), etc. It was shown that for all particles, their root-mean-square (rms) parameter exhibited a maximum at the coverage about 0.5, whereas the skewness was a monotonically decreasing function of the coverage. This enabled a facile determination of the particle coverage in the layer, even if the shape and size were not known. The validity of the analytical results was confirmed by computer modeling and experimental data acquired by AFM measurements for polymer nanoparticle deposition on mica and silica. The topographical analysis developed in this work can be exploited for a quantitative characterization of self-assembled layers of nano- and bioparticles, e.g., carbon nanotubes, silica and noble metal particles, DNA fragments, proteins, vesicles, viruses, and bacteria at solid surfaces. The acquired results also enabled a proper calibration, in particular the determination of the measurement precision, of various electron and scanning probe microscopies, such as AFM."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In this study, silver and gold nanoparticles were synthesized within a hyaluronic acid matrix utilizing distilled water and distilled water treated with low-pressure, low-temperature glow plasma in an environment of air and argon. Electron microscopy, UV-Vis and FTIR spectra, water, and mechanical measurements were conducted to investigate the properties of nanometallic composites. This study also examined their microbiological properties. This study demonstrated that the properties of the composites differed depending on the preparation conditions, encompassing physicochemical and microbiological properties. The application of plasma-treated water under both air and argon had a significant effect on the size and distribution of nanometals. Silver nanoparticles were obtained between the range of 5 to 25 nm, while gold nanoparticles varied between 10 to 35 nm.

Its genome contains an unprecedentedly large number of genes involved in detoxifying and transporting xenobiotics, including 80 genes that code for UDP glycosyltransferases (UGTs). These enzymes were acquired via horizontal gene transfer from bacteria after loss in the Chelicerata lineage. UGTs are well-known for their role in phase II metabolism; however, their contribution to host adaptation and acaricide resistance in arthropods, such as T. urticae, is not yet resolved. TuUGT202A2 (Tetur22g00270) has been linked to the ability of this pest to adapt to tomato plants. Moreover, it was shown that this enzyme can glycosylate a wide range of flavonoids. To understand this relationship at the molecular level, structural, functional, and computational studies were performed. Structural studies provided specific snapshots of the enzyme in different catalytically relevant stages. The crystal structure of TuUGT202A2 in complex with UDP-glucose was obtained and site-directed mutagenesis paired with molecular dynamic simulations revealed a novel lid-like mechanism involved in the binding of the activated sugar donor. Two additional TuUGT202A2 crystal complexes, UDP-(S)-naringenin and UDP-naringin, demonstrated that this enzyme has a highly plastic and open-ended acceptor-binding site. Overall, this work reveals the molecular basis of substrate promiscuity of TuUGT202A2 and provides novel insights into the structural mechanism of UGTs catalysis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The films displayed favourable properties, including appropriate thickness, transparency, and moisture content, essential for packaging purposes. Moreover, the films exhibited excellent moisture absorption rate and barrier properties, attributed to the high concentration of CMCNa and the inclusion of a CA. These films presented no significant effect of crosslinking and bioactive components on their mechanical strength, as evidenced by tensile strength and elongation at break values. Thermal stability was demonstrated in the distinct weight loss events at different temperature ranges, with crosslinking contributing to slightly enhanced thermal performance. Furthermore, the films showed varying antioxidant activity levels, influenced by temperature and the solubility of the films in different media, indicating their potential for diverse applications. Overall, these bioactive films showed promise as versatile materials with desirable properties for food packaging and related applications, where the controlled release of bioactive components is advantageous for enhancing the shelf life and safety of food products.

Chemical deposition of ZnO thin films by the SILAR method allowed to deposit hexagonal films with a thickness of about 200 nm. The morphology, elemental and phase composition of the films were characterized by Scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction. The band gap (1.4 eV for SnSx and 3.3 eV for ZnO), as well as the high light absorption coefficient of SnSx films (1–2) × 104 cm–1 were determined. The obtained ZnO/SnSx/ITO heterostructures formed by the electrodeposition–SILAR cycle showed a photoEMF value of 198 mV.

Results showed that CA protected mouse primary neuronal cell cultures against hydrogen peroxide-induced damage more efficiently than ED or EB. The neuroprotective effects of CA were associated with attenuation of reactive oxygen species level and increased mitochondrial membrane potential but not with a reduction in caspase-3 activity. None of the tested substances was protective against glutamate or oxygen-glucose deprivation-evoked neuronal cell damage, and EB even increased the detrimental effects of these insults. Further experiments using the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells showed that CA but not ED or EB attenuated the cell damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and that the composition of culture medium is the critical factor in evaluating neuroprotective effects in this model.

The potential to control community-wide responses has also sparked numerous recent biotechnological innovations. However, our capacity to utilize intercellular communication is hindered due to a scarcity of complementary signalling systems and a restricted comprehension of interconnections between these systems caused by variations in their dynamic range. In this study, we utilize uniform manifold approximation and projection and extended-connectivity fingerprints to explore the available chemical space of QS signalling molecules. We investigate and experimentally characterize a set of closely related QS signalling ligands, consisting of N-acyl homoserine lactones and the aryl homoserine lactone p-coumaroyl, as well as a set of more widely diverging QS ligands, consisting of photopyrones, dialkylresorcinols, 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-ol and autoinducer-2, and define their performance. We report on a set of six signal- and promoter-orthogonal intercellular QS signalling systems, significantly expanding the toolkit for engineering community-wide behaviour. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ligand diversity can serve as a statistically significant tool to predict much more complicated ligand-receptor interactions. This approach highlights the potential of dimensionality reduction to explore chemical diversity in microbial dynamics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The structure of many proteins potentially allows for two types of immobilization of a therapeutic agent, either on the outer surface of the protein or within the protein structure. The existence of two active sites in BSA’s structure, the so-called Sudlow I and II, was confirmed. The conducted research involved determining the effectiveness of BSA as a potential carrier of 5-fluorouracil (5FU). 5-fluorouracil is a broad-spectrum anticancer drug targeting solid tumors. The research was carried out to estimate the physicochemical properties of the system using complementary measurement techniques. The optimization of the complex formation conditions made it possible to obtain significant correlations between the form of the drug and the effective localization of the active substance in the structure of the protein molecule. The presence of two amino groups in the 5FU structure contributes to the deprotonation of the molecule at high pH values (pH > 8) and the transition to the anionic form (AN1 and AN3). To investigate the binding affinity of the tautomeric form with BSA, UV-vis absorption, fluorescence quenching, zeta potential, QCM-D, and CD spectroscopic studies were performed. The experimental research was supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and molecular docking. The simulations confirm the potential location of 5FU tautomers inside the BSA structure and on its surface."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Among the various applications of these materials, energy storage and conversion have gained particular importance in light of the ongoing energy crisis. In this review, a critical evaluation is presented, focusing on the fundamentals, recent developments, and future perspectives of two-dimensional materials as anodes in lithium-ion batteries. The emphasis of this evaluation lies specifically on the years between 2010 and 2023. The review will primarily delve into the design and manipulation of advanced interface architectures for anodes, the latest developments, and the composition structure-property relationship of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MXenes, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), tungsten sulfide (WS2), and black phosphorous (BP). The main focus of the presented review revolves around modification techniques that hold great potential in energy storage applications and other energy-related fields. The exceptional characteristics of these materials, including efficient ion transport across layers and large surface areas facilitating enhanced ion adsorption and accelerated surface redox reactions, contribute to their promising performance. While we have accumulated about twenty years of experience in energy conversion applications, particularly in lithium-ion batteries, we found that a large number of articles have been published on electrodes and electrolytes. However, a critical discussion about the composition structure-property relationship, along with challenges and optimizing strategies for anodes, is still lacking. Therefore, this review aims to fill that gap. Additionally, an overview of recent research advances is provided, focusing on the application of 2D materials in advanced energy storage systems beyond conventional lithium-ion batteries. Key findings and strategies employed to address associated challenges are examined while considering the prospects of these materials in the field."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Analysis of the three-dimensional structure forms the basis for further insight into how they function and comparison of crystal structure with solution-state conformation(s) is particularly relevant, which has been performed for the disaccharide β-L-Fucp-(1→4)-α-D-Glcp-OMe. In water solution the conformational space at the glycosidic linkage between the two sugar residues is identified from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as having a low-energy exo-syn conformation, deviating somewhat from the solid-state conformation, and two anti-conformational states, i.e., anti-ϕ and anti-ψ, indicating flexibility at the glycosidic linkage. NMR data were obtained from 1D 1H,1H-NOESY and STEP-NOESY experiments, measurement of transglycosidic 3JCH coupling constants and NMR spin-simulation. The free energy profile of the ω torsion angle computed from MD simulation was in excellent agreement with the rotamer distribution from NMR experiment being for gt:gg:tg 38 : 53 : 9, respectively, with a proposed inter-residue O5′⋯HO6 hydrogen bond being predominant in the gg rotamer. Quantum mechanics methodology was used to calculate transglycosidic NMR 3JCH coupling constants, averaged over a conformational ensemble of structures representing various rotamers of exocyclic groups, in good to excellent agreement with Karplus-type relationships previously developed. Furthermore, 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts were calculated using the same methodology and were found to be in excellent agreement with experimental data."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In this study, we explore the potential of the proton-conducting BCM0.025Y electrolyte by creating a composite with La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3–δ (LSCF) to form triple conducting electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). The formation of the LSCF-BCM0.025Y composite enhances both the three-phase reaction interface length and the concentration of oxygen vacancies, contributing to improved dissociation rates and enhanced oxygen adsorption. The desired characteristics, including density, structure, composition, electrochemical performance, and thermal stability, have been confirmed through a comprehensive set of analyses including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. The cell configuration of Ni-YSZ | BCZY | LSCF-BCM0.025Y exhibited a remarkable maximum power density (MPD) of 418.7 mW cm−2, which is approximately 29 % higher than that achieved with a typical LSCF cathode (325.6 mW cm−2) at an operating temperature of 600 °C. The outstanding performance and enduring stability of the LSCF-BCM0.025Y composite over a 500 h period demonstrate its potential as a promising cathode material for intermediate-temperature SOFCs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Our main objective was to determine how the grafting technique (grafting-from and grafting-to) and the oxidation level of CQD affect the functionalization. We found a series of significant differences in the structure of the CQD-PAMAM nanohybrid depending on the grafting approach and oxidation level of CQD. The “grafting-to” approach reveals a uniform extent of surface coverage by dendrimers, regardless of the oxidation level of CQD. Meanwhile, in the “grafting-from” case, the percentage of surface coverage by dendrimers was strongly determined by the topology of CQD. We also observed that, for a given grafting approach, the increase in the oxidation level of CQD leads to a more compact structure of grafted dendrimers and provides stronger interfacial energy between the two main components of the nanocomposites. Among the interfacial interactions, it was found that the electrostatic force and hydrogen bonding between the charged groups of dendrimers and CQD play a crucial role in controlling the architecture and stability of the formed structures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Principles of phase equilibrium are here employed to derive a general kinetic solution that predicts the evolution of the mass and size of biological assemblies. Thermodynamically, protein PS is determined by two measurable concentration limits: the saturation concentration and the critical solubility. Due to surface tension effects, the critical solubility can be higher than the saturation concentration for small, curved nuclei. Kinetically, PS is characterized by the primary nucleation rate constant and a combined rate constant accounting for growth and secondary nucleation. It is demonstrated that the formation of a limited number of large condensates is possible without active mechanisms of size control and in the absence of coalescence phenomena. The exact analytical solution can be used to interrogate how the elementary steps of PS are affected by candidate drugs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The synthesized BaCe0.97M0.03O3-δ (M = Sm, Gd) electrolyte was compared to BaCe0.97M0.03O3-δ (M = Sm, Gd) synthesized with a typical chemical combustion route. The structural analysis confirmed the orthorhombic phase of all perovskite electrolytes while the microstructural analysis revealed dense microstructure for electrolytes synthesized with bio-chelating agents compared to those synthesized with chemical combustion route. The compositional analysis confirmed the presence of all elements and the thermal analysis established the stability within the SOFC operating temperature range of BaCe0.97M0.03O3-δ (M = Sm, Gd) synthesized with both routes. The electrochemical measurements exhibited a maximum power density of 0.47 W cm−2 for BaCe0.97M0.03O3-δ (M = Sm) synthesized with lemon juice as a chelating agent suggesting its potential use as an efficient electrolyte for IT-SOFCs.

In this study, we investigate the impact of Cu doping on the sintering mechanism, electrical performance, and stability of BaCe0.7Zr0.1Dy0.2-xO3-δ (BCZD) electrolyte. The morphology, composition, structure, and chemical state of BCZD electrolytes were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Remarkably, the sintering temperature of BCZD is reduced to 1200 °C through Cu doping Furthermore, the introduction of Cu as a dopant induces Ba exsolution from the BCZD crystal lattice alongside the generation of oxygen vacancies. XPS measurements confirmed that vacancy concentrations increase with increasing Cu doping concentrations. However, as the Cu content surpasses 2 mol%, the exsoluted Cu reacts with Ba, leading to the formation of BaCuO2. Accumulation of BaCuO2 at the grain boundaries adversely affects the conductivity and stability of Cu-doped BCZD, in a humidified atmosphere where it exhibits significant instability. Notably, BCZD with 2 mol% Cu content demonstrates a conductivity of 2.7 × 10-2 S cm−1 and maintains stability for up to 420 h in the H2/3%H2O atmosphere at 600 °C. In contrast, BCZD with 5 mol% Cu content exhibits a conductivity of 1.9 × 10-2 S cm−1 at 600 °C but experiences continuous degradation in a humidified atmosphere, ultimately leading to failure within 30 h. The 2 % Cu-doped BCZD exhibits high conductivity and stability at intermediate temperatures, rendering it highly suitable for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

For the role of catalysts, we used six strains of entomopathogenic filamentous fungi (Beauveria bassiana KCh J1.5, Beauveria caledonica KCh J3.3, Isaria fumosorosea KCh J2, Isaria farinosa KCh KW1.1, Isaria tenuipes MU35, and Metarhizium robertsii MU4). The substrate (2) was obtained by carrying out an enzymatic 1,2-dehydrogenation on an increased scale (3.5 g/L) using a recombinant cholest-4-en-3-one Δ1-dehydrogenase (AcmB) from Sterolibacterium denitrificans. All selected strains were characterized by the high biotransformation capacity for the used substrate. As a result of the biotransformation, six steroid derivatives were obtained: 11α-hydroxypregn-1,4-diene-3,20-dione (3), 6β,11α-dihydroxypregn-1,4-diene-3,20-dione (4), 6β-hydroxypregn-1,4-diene-3,11,20-trione (5), 6β,17α-dihydroxypregn-1,4-diene-3,20-dione (6), 6β,17β-dihydroxyandrost-1,4-diene-3-one (7), and 12β,17α-dihydroxypregn-1,4-diene-3,20-dione (8). The results show evident variability of the biotransformation process between strains of the tested biocatalysts from different species described as entomopathogenic filamentous fungi. The obtained products were tested in silico using cheminformatics tools for their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, proving their potentially high biological activities. This study showed that the obtained compounds may have applications as effective inhibitors of testosterone 17β-dehydrogenase. Most of the obtained products should, also with a high probability, find potential uses as androgen antagonists, a prostate as well as menopausal disorders treatment. They should also demonstrate immunosuppressive, erythropoiesis-stimulating, and anti-inflammatory properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Reference measurements were also performed for polymer particles of a spherical shape and the same diameter as the spheroid shorter axis. Primarily, the frequency and dissipation shifts for various overtones were measured as a function of time. These kinetic data were transformed into the dependence of the complex impedance, scaled up by the inertia impedance, upon the particle size to the hydrodynamic boundary layer ratio. The results obtained for low particle coverage were interpolated, which enabled the derivation of Sauerbrey-like equations, yielding the real particle coverage using the experimental frequency or dissipation (bandwidth) shifts. Experiments carried out for a long deposition time confirmed that, for spheroids, the imaginary and real impedance components were equal to each other for all overtones and for a large range of particle coverage. This result was explained in terms of a hydrodynamic, lubrication-like contact of particles with the sensor, enabling their sliding motion. In contrast, the experimental data obtained for spheres, where the impedance ratio was a complicated function of overtones and particle coverage, showed that the contact was rather stiff, preventing their motion over the sensor. It was concluded that results obtained in this work can be exploited as useful reference systems for a quantitative interpretation of bioparticle, especially bacteria, deposition kinetics on macroion-modified surfaces."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934c878c28a0473a6ac6","5e709474878c28a0473bd5bb","5e709349878c28a0473a6822"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

We applied the previously proposed two-step methodology, combining classical MD simulations and subsequent ab initio (QM) calculations, performed on a rationally subsampled set of molecular configurations. We found that, regardless of the number of molecular configurations considered, the level of theory, and the weighting scheme applied, none of the QM approaches is capable of predicting the correct conformational equilibrium of sulfated iduronates as long as the tight counterion binding is not considered. Multicenter, ring-shape-specific binding of either Na+ or Ca2+ ions drastically shifts the conformational equilibrium of the pyranose ring in sulfated iduronates toward 1C4 but does not significantly affect the conformation of non-sulfated compounds. A similar shift is observed upon the protonation of carboxyl groups in all iduronates. In addition, we report a set of average J-coupling constant values related to vicinal protons bound to the pyranose ring of iduronates and corresponding to each of the three main groups of ring conformers, i.e., 4C1, B/S (boat/skew boat), and 1C4. In combination with the conformational energies or with the experimental data, these values allowed the relative proportions of the ring conformers to be estimated and the Karplus-type equations linking the 3JHH-coupling constants to the torsion angles within the pyranose ring to be refined."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The hydrogels were cross-linked with N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA), simultaneously grafting the resulting polymer onto SA. The findings of the FTIR spectroscopy showed that all of the hydrogels were effectively synthesized and sodium alginate was chemically bonded with the poly(sodium acrylate) matrix. DSC analysis of the melting heat and glass transition parameters indicated that the hydrogel structure had changed as a result of the cross-linking process. Sodium alginate and MBA were tested at different concentrations to determine how they affected the hydrogel properties. A very high content of the biopolymer, i.e., sodium alginate, was used in our research, up to 33 wt%. This resulted in durable and stable hydrogels with a very high ability to uptake water, comparable to hydrogels based on synthetic polymers only. The ability to swell is inversely proportional to the quantity of MBA present. By increasing the amount of sodium alginate in the hydrogel, the ability of the hydrogel to absorb water is reduced. However, water uptake remains relatively high at 350 g·g−1, even for the hydrogel with the highest SA content."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The results indicate that material properties such as densities, phase transition temperatures, and Young moduli are accurately reproduced by the ReaxFF-CHO force field. The reactive dynamics analysis yielded crucial insights into the surface composition of fragmented polymers. Both polymers exhibited backbone breakage, leaving -CH2· and –CH·- radicals as terminals.

Phosphate chemical conversion coatings (CaP) and polylactic acid (PLA) biopolymer coatings are biocompatible and promising for the corrosion protection of Mg alloys.

Three types of surface modification, CaP, PLA, and a combined CaP-PLA coating were obtained on the surface of the magnesium alloy WE43. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy were employed to characterize the surface and interfacial morphology, along with the composition of the coatings before and after corrosion experiments. The protective performance of obtained coatings was examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and immersion testing in Hank's solution. Coated samples showed significantly improved corrosion resistance. The values of polarization resistance based on impedance measurements were 164; 8688; 69,410; and 228,369 Ω cm2 for WE43 alloy, CaP, PLA, and CaP-PLA coatings, respectively.

In general, the results revealed virtually no effect from substituting H2O by ACMW but distinct albeit relatively weak effects for intermediate adsorption times for D2O as the aqueous phase. In the final stage of adsorption, established after around 10 h, the equilibrium adsorption and the dilational rheological behavior of all protein layers under investigation are only very weakly affected by the presence of D2O.

To this end, cube- and disc-like structures were synthesized using a metal ion-mediated hydrothermal route. Thereafter, some of the samples were annealed at 500 °C for 3 h. Our paper combines the experimental part with theoretical calculations of the obtained materials’ band edge positions. The results reveal that—aside from hematite—the as-synthesized discs also contain γ-FeOOH and β-Fe2O3 phases, which transform into α-Fe2O3 during annealing. The hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, and adsorption kinetics measurements show that the cube-like samples exhibit the highest affinity for cationic, whereas the discs have an affinity for anionic dye. Measurements of the wall zeta potential also reveal that annealing the discs modifies their surface state and ability to adsorb molecules. Photocatalytic tests show that the as-synthesized powders have better photocatalytic performance toward methylene blue decomposition than the annealed ones. The observed small changes in the concentration of the MO during illumination result from the energy band structure of the cube-like crystal orientation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Preventing or limiting stresses in these structures, generated by the loss or gain of moisture, requires an understanding of the relevant processes and risks. A three-dimensional elastic model of a panel painting was used to analyse surface stresses and understand how crack patterns are developed in the two-layer structure of the pictorial layer—the gesso and the paints. Two historically important paint types were considered—egg tempera and oil paints, laid on a gesso produced following historical procedures. Two scenarios of stress development were analysed: permanent cumulative drying shrinkage of paints or gesso, owing to gradual loss of water or evolution of the molecular composition of the binders, and moisture-induced cyclic swelling of the wood substrate. Ratios of distances between cracks in the tangential and longitudinal directions of a wood panel to the layer thickness were estimated for increasing magnitudes of materials’ dimensional change in the two scenarios. The critical values of the ratios for which stress in the midpoint between the cracks dropped below the value inducing strain at break in the materials and saturation of the crack patterns occurred, was approximately 3–4 or 5–6 for the paints and the gesso, respectively. The critical distance normalized to the gesso thickness between cracks parallel to the wood grain induced by cyclic swelling of the wood substrate due to relative humidity variation in the range of 50–70% was 6.

According to the IR results, only a small fraction of all surface hydroxyls were sufficiently basic to react with CO2. The partial dehydroxylation changed the proportion of the concentrations of O2− and OH− on the oxides. We also elaborated upon a new method to determine the total concentration of basic sites via CO2 desorption monitored using IR.

A multitude of experimental methods and theoretical approaches have been developed to serve the research progress in this large domain of colloid and interface science, including the area of soft colloids such as foams and emulsions. From classical methods like surface tension adsorption isotherms, surface pressure-area measurements for spread layers, and surface rheology probing the dynamics of adsorption, nowadays, advanced surface-sensitive techniques based on spectroscopy, microscopy, and the reflection of light, X-rays and neutrons at liquid/fluid interfaces offers important complementary sources of information. Apart from the fundamental characteristics of protein adsorption layers, i.e., surface tension and surface excess, the nanoscale structure of such layers and the interfacial protein conformations and morphologies are of pivotal importance for extending the depth of understanding on the topic. In this review article, we provide an extensive overview of the application of three methods, namely, ellipsometry, X-ray reflectometry and neutron reflectometry, for adsorption and structural studies on proteins at water/air and water/oil interfaces. The main attention is placed on the development of experimental approaches and on a discussion of the relevant achievements in terms of notable experimental results. We have attempted to cover the whole history of protein studies with these techniques, and thus, we believe the review should serve as a valuable reference to fuel ideas for a wide spectrum of researchers in different scientific fields where proteins at soft interface may be of relevance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The mass transfer rate constants and the maximum protein coverages were determined for the bare silica at pH 4.0 and theoretically interpreted in terms of the hybrid random sequential adsorption model. These results were used as reference data for the analysis of adsorption kinetics at larger pHs. It was shown that the adsorption on bare silica rapidly decreased with pH and became negligible at pH 7.4. The albumin adsorption on PARG-functionalized silica showed an opposite trend, i.e., it was negligible at pH 4 and attained maximum values at pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl, the conditions corresponding to the blood serum environment.

With excellent hole transport properties and uniform compact morphology, the solution-processed CuSCN layer suppresses the leakage current and improves charge selectivity in an n-i-p-type solar cell structure. The device without the HTL (FTO/CdS/Sb2S3/Au) delivers a modest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.54%, which increases to 2.46% with the introduction of CuSCN (FTO/CdS/Sb2S3/CuSCN/Au). This PCE is a significant improvement compared with the previous reports of planar Sb2S3 solar cells employing CuSCN. CuSCN is therefore a promising alternative to expensive and inherently unstable organic HTLs.

The careful reglueing procedure allowed multiple fracturing tests to be carried out that not only improved statistics of the measurements but also provided insight into the variation of the fracture toughness across the paint film observed for some paints. The latter was due to pigment sedimentation or chemical change of the oil binder as a result of the easier access of oxygen from the side open to the air. For the lead white paint, used over centuries both in paint films and oil grounds, the GIc values more than doubled from 18 to 39 J/m2 for three consecutive cracks formed at an increasing distance from one side of the paint film. The study demonstrated that fracture toughness corresponding to the first crack formation in aged oil paints ranged between 10 and 40 J/m2, relatively low values compared to the animal glue-based ground in paintings. In consequence, oil paints are more vulnerable to crack initiation and growth induced by tensile stress than the ground layer. The measurements filled the gap in the knowledge required for the analysis of fracturing or delamination processes in paintings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Such drug carriers play a crucial role in enhancing the bioavailability of active substances, affecting therapy efficiency and precision.

Recent research has focused on bionanocomposite structures based on biopolymers, including lipids, polysaccharides, and proteins. This review paper is focused on the description of lipid-containing nanocomposite carriers (including liposomes, lipid emulsions, lipid nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid carriers), polysaccharide-containing nanocomposite carriers (including alginate and cellulose), and protein-containing nanocomposite carriers (e.g., gelatin and albumin). It was demonstrated in many investigations that such carriers show the ability to load therapeutic substances efficiently and precisely control drug release. They also demonstrated desirable biocompatibility, which is a promising sign for their potential application in drug therapy. The development of bionanocomposite drug carriers indicates a novel approach to improving drug delivery processes, which has the potential to contribute to significant advances in the field of pharmacology, improving therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Temperature effects remain unclear because the temperature dependence of both the dielectric constant and polymer–solvent interaction parameter can yield lower and/or upper critical solution phase behaviors for PECs. Further, secondary interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, can affect the temperature response of a PEC. That is, mixtures of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes can exhibit phase separation upon lowering and/or increasing the mixture’s temperature. Here, the phase behavior of poly(diallylmethylammonium)/poly(acrylic acid) (PDADMA/PAA) complexes under varying KBr ionic strengths, mixing ratios, and temperatures at a fixed pH (in which PAA hydrogen bonding can occur) is examined. At room temperature, the PDADMA/PAA PECs exhibit four different phase states: precipitate, coexisting precipitate and coacervate, solid-like gel, and coacervate. Variable-temperature optical microscopy reveals the upper critical solution temperature (UCST) at which each phase transitioned to a solution state. Interestingly, the UCST value is highly dependent on the original phase of the PEC, in which solid-like precipitates exhibit higher UCST values. Large-scale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support that precipitates exhibit kinetic trapping, which may contribute to the higher UCST values observed in the experiment. Taken together, this study highlights the significance of temperature on the phase behavior of PECs, which may play a larger role in stimuli-responsive materials, membraneless organelles, and separations applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Complexation is one of the most effective and widespread ways to increase the cathodic polarization, as well as the convergence of deposition potentials of copper and tin. In this work we studied the combined effect of thiourea and N-octylpyridinium bromide additives on the kinetics of Cu, Sn, and Cu-Sn electrocrystallization from sulfuric acid electrolytes.

All silver nanoparticles forms used moderately limited the growth of maize, without significantly affecting normalized difference vegetation indexes.

The eukaryotic microbiome, richer in the studied substrate, turned out to be more sensitive, showing greater qualitative and quantitative changes than the bacteriome. silver nanoparticles did not reduce the occurrence of mycorrhizal fungi, enriched the occurrence of Acidobacteriota and, with the exception of trisodium citrate reduction/sodium borohydride stabilization type, enriched the beneficial bacteria of Devosia.

The experimental work was made possible by the preparation of several tempera paints, mimicking the historical materials, in the form of large specimens. Lead white, azurite, and yellow ochre were selected as pigments, and egg yolk and rabbit skin glue as binding media. The water vapour sorption and the moisture-related swelling of the paints were dominated by the proteinaceous components of the binders. The linear hygroscopic expansion coefficient of the dried egg yolk binder was approximately 1 × 10−4 per 1% RH, several times less than the coefficient of the collagen glue (4 × 10−4 per 1% RH). The moduli of elasticity of egg tempera paints at the RH mid-range were comparable to the moduli of aged oil paints, whilst the modulus of elasticity of the distemper paint was close to values measured for animal glue-based grounds. The paints experienced the transition from brittle to ductile states on increasing RH. The egg tempera paints were found to be more brittle than the distemper paint, gessoes, and, generally, aged oil paints. The observations modify a frequently used laminar model of panel paintings in which the mismatch in the response of glue-based ground layer and wood substrate to variations in RH has been identified as the worst-case condition for the fracturing of the entire pictorial layer. This study demonstrated that tempera could be more brittle than the ground layer and in consequence more vulnerable to cracking."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Every approved drug has an indication, which refers to the therapeutic use of that drug for treating a particular medical condition. While the Large Language Model (LLM), a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, has recently demonstrated effectiveness in translating between molecules and their textual descriptions, there remains a gap in research regarding their application in facilitating the translation between drug molecules and indications (which describes the disease, condition or symptoms for which the drug is used), or vice versa. Addressing this challenge could greatly benefit the drug discovery process. The capability of generating a drug from a given indication would allow for the discovery of drugs targeting specific diseases or targets and ultimately provide patients with better treatments. In this paper, we first propose a new task, the translation between drug molecules and corresponding indications, and then test existing LLMs on this new task. Specifically, we consider nine variations of the T5 LLM and evaluate them on two public datasets obtained from ChEMBL and DrugBank. Our experiments show the early results of using LLMs for this task and provide a perspective on the state-of-the-art.

The Martini force field is currently the most widely adopted parameter set for such simulations. The functional form of this and several other CG force fields enforces secondary protein structure support by employing a variety of harmonic potentials or restraints that favor the protein’s native conformation. We propose a straightforward method to calculate the energetic consequences of transitions between predefined conformational states in systems in which multiple factors can affect protein conformational equilibria. This method is designed for use within the Martini force field and involves imposing conformational transitions by linking a Martini-inherent elastic network to the coupling parameter λ. We demonstrate the applicability of our method using the example of five biomolecular systems that undergo experimentally characterized conformational transitions between well-defined structures (Staphylococcal nuclease, C-terminal segment of surfactant protein B, LAH4 peptide, and β2-adrenergic receptor) as well as between folded and unfolded states (GCN4 leucine zipper protein). The results show that the relative free energy changes associated with protein conformational transitions, which are affected by various factors, such as pH, mutations, solvent, and lipid membrane composition, are correctly reproduced. The proposed method may be a valuable tool for understanding how different conditions and modifications affect conformational equilibria in proteins."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

A novel semi-organic method for synthesizing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using bio-based chelating fuels (Beta vulgaris subsp., Spinacia oleracea, and Ipomoea batatas) reduces the undesirable impurities. The study also showcases the impact of bio-based chelating fuel on various characteristics of AgNPs in comparison to synthetic chelating fuel. The antimicrobial efficacy of the synthesized AgNPs in conjunction with honey was also assessed against E. coli. The XRD analysis showed cubic structure of AgNPs. The FESEM and TEM analysis showed that the well-connected spherical-shaped AgNPs (∼3–120 nm diameter) while EDS confirmed the presence of Ag in all samples. The TEM analysis also revealed layers of carbonates in AgNPs synthesized using bio-based chelating fuels. XPS investigation confirmed the absence of any prominent impurities in prepared samples and AgNPs have not experienced oxidation on their surface. However, notable surface charging effects due to the uneven conductivity of the particles were observed. The broth dilution method showed that all mixtures containing AgNPs in combination with honey exhibited a significant bacterial growth reduction over a period of 120 h. The highest growth reduction of ∼75 % is obtained for the mixture having AgNPs (Ipomoea batatas) while the least growth reduction of ∼51 % is obtained for the mixture having AgNPs (Beta vulgaris subsp.).

Linseed oil served as the main oil phase, while beeswax acted as a gelling and emulsifying agent. Tween compounds are non-ionic surfactants composed of hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts, allowing for the formation of a stable system with promising properties. Surface wetting analysis of the obtained oleogels, FT-IR spectroscopy, and determination of relative and absolute humidity over time, as well as optical microscope analysis and rheological analysis of the obtained oleogels, were conducted as part of the research. The results indicate that increasing the amount of Tween 20 decreases the hydrophilicity of the oleogel, while Tween 80 exhibits the opposite effect. Surface energy analysis suggests that a higher content of Tween 20 may lead to a reduction in the surface energy of the oleogels, which may indicate greater material stability.

A potential solution to significantly reduce pollution is to replace current synthetic materials with readily biodegradable plastics. Moreover, to meet the demands of technological advancements, it is essential to develop materials with unprecedented properties to enhance their functionality. Polysaccharide composites demonstrate significant potential in this regard. Polysaccharides possess exceptional film-forming abilities and are safe for human use, biodegradable, widely available, and easily modifiable. Unfortunately, polysaccharide-based films fall short of meeting all expectations. To address this issue, the current study focused on incorporating carbon quantum dots (CQDs), which are approximately 10 nm in size, into the structure of a starch/chitosan biocomposite at varying concentrations. This modification has improved the mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposites. The inclusion of nanoparticles led to a slight reduction in solubility and an increase in the swelling degree. The optical characteristics of the obtained films were influenced by the presence of CQDs, and the fluorescence intensity of the nanocomposites changed due to the specific heavy metal ions and amino acids used. Consequently, these nanocomposites show great potential for detecting these compounds. Cellular viability assessments and comet assays confirm that the resulting nanocomposites do not exhibit any cytotoxic properties based on this specific analytic method. The tested nanocomposites with the addition of carbon quantum dots (NC/CD II and NC/CD III) were characterised by greater genotoxicity compared to the negative control. The positive control, the starch/chitosan composite alone, was also characterised by a greater induction of chromatin damage in mouse cells compared to a pure mouse blood sample."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In this study, novel detection approaches and computational chemistry methods were introduced to update the widely-accepted acid-base interaction theory. Microflotation tests confirm that the hematite flotation recovery was easily depressed by NS under the acid or alkaline conditions rather than the neutral condition. Zeta potential measurement shows that NS could change the zeta potential of hematite, while the shift amplitude ranked as alkaline > acid > neutral, indicating the most suitable pH range is the alkaline condition. XPS analysis reveals that NS could chemisorbed onto Fe atoms of hematite surface via C-O groups in the whole studied pH range. It was further verified using AFM tests, in which the NS has a stronger interaction force under the alkaline environment. MDS further indicates that the interaction energy between NS and the (0 0 1) hematite surface was three times greater than others under alkaline conditions. In general, the interaction force at the interface between the hematite surface and NS was a strong chemical adsorption at the alkaline conditions while there was weak chemisorption and hydrogen bonding under the neutral or acidic conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The beneficial effects of food on human health are actively promoted by health professionals and nutritionists. This growing awareness is influencing the increasing range of functional foods and the pursuit of more innovative solutions. Recent research indicates that spherical nanoparticles have the potential to be used as functional biomaterials in the food industry, particularly for encapsulating hydrophobic natural phytochemicals. Techniques and systems based on micro- and nano-encapsulation are of great importance in the food and pharmaceutical industries. It is of paramount importance that encapsulation materials are safe for use in food. The aim of this study was to obtain micelles containing extracts from chokeberry fruit pomace using egg yolk powder (EYP) for emulsification (as a source of lecithin) and egg white powder (EWP) for stabilisation. The structural properties of the micelles in the resulting powders were characterised using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed the presence of spherical micellar structures between 500 and 1000 nm in size. The water activity and water content of the obtained powders were determined, and the thermal (DSC) and antioxidant properties were investigated. The results indicated that the powder with the micellar structures had a higher stability compared to the powder obtained by simple mixing without the use of encapsulation techniques."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Using research techniques like UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, thermal-shift assay and HPLC, we investigated the catalytic and structural stability of S-HPED over a wide temperature range and within the pH range of 5.5 to 9.0 under storage and reaction conditions. The relationship between aggregation and inactivation of the enzyme in various pH environments was also examined and interpreted. At pH 9.0, where the enzyme exhibited no aggregation, we characterized thermally induced enzyme inactivation. Through isothermal and multitemperature analysis of inactivation data, we identified and confirmed the first-order inactivation mechanism under these pH conditions and determined the kinetic parameters of the inactivation process. Additionally, we report the positive impact of glucose as an enzyme stabilizer, which slows down the dynamics of S-HPED inactivation over a wide range of pH and temperature and limits enzyme aggregation.

In the conducted research, the conditions for the formation of the active G4.0 PAMAM complex with doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) were optimized. The physicochemical properties of the system were monitored using dynamic light scattering (DLS), circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopy. The Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D) method was chosen to determine the preferential conditions for the complex formation. The highest binding efficiency of the drug to the cationic dendrimer was observed under basic conditions when the DOX molecule was deprotonated. The decrease in the zeta potential of the complex confirms that DOX immobilizes through electrostatic interaction with the carrier's surface amine groups. The binding constants were determined from the fluorescence quenching of the DOX molecule in the presence of G4.0 PAMAM. The two-fold way of binding doxorubicin in the structure of dendrimers was visible in the Isothermal calorimetry (ITC) isotherm. Fluorescence spectra and release curves identified the reversible binding of DOX to the nanocarrier. Among the selected cancer cells, the most promising anticancer activity of the G4.0-DOX complex was observed in A375 malignant melanoma cells.

The bpy-ligated Cu(II) chlorodiketonate complex 3-ClO4 is inherently more reactive with O2 than the 6-Ph2TPA-ligated analog 1-ClO4. Added chloride is needed to facilitate O2 reactivity for 1-ClO4 but not for 3-ClO4 at 25(1) °C. Evaluation of kobs for the reaction of 1-ClO4 with O2 under pseudo first-order conditions as a function of the amount of added chloride ion produced saturation type behavior. The bpy-ligated 3-ClO4 exhibits different behavior, with rate enhancement resulting from both the addition of chloride ion and water. Computational studies indicate that the presence of water lowers the barrier for O2 activation for 3-ClO4 by ∼12 kcal/mol whereas changing the anion from perchlorate to chloride has a smaller effect (lowering of the barrier by ∼3 kcal/mol). Notably, the effect of water for 3-ClO4 is of similar magnitude to the barrier-lowering chloride effect found in the O2 activation pathway for 1-ClO4. Thus, both systems involve lower energy O2 activation pathways available, albeit resulting from different ligand effects. Probing the effect of added benzoate anion, it was found that the chloro substituent in the diketonate moiety of 1-ClO4 and 3-ClO4 will undergo displacement upon treatment of each complex with tetrabutyl ammonium benzoate to give Cu(II) benzoyloxydiketonate complexes (4 and 5). Complexes 4 and 5 exhibit slow O2-dependent Csingle bondC cleavage in the presence of added chloride ion. These results are discussed in the context of the chemistry identified for various divalent metal chlorodiketonate complexes, which have relevance to catalytic systems and metalloenzymes that mediate O2-dependent Csingle bondC cleavage within diketonate substrates."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Research on such materials will allow the development of innovative foaming technologies that minimise the negative environmental effects of foaming compounds without losing the properties of the final product."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In order to provide improved interaction between BNC and the active compound, and thus to modulate the release kinetics, the TEMPO oxidation of BNC support was carried out. A mix of actinomycins from bacterial fermentation (ActX) were used as natural antimicrobial agents with an established bioactivity profile and clinical use. BNC and TEMPO-oxidized BNC films with incorporated active compounds were obtained and analyzed by FTIR, SEM, XPS, and XRD. The ActX release profiles were determined in phosphate-buffer solution, PBS, at 37 °C over time. FTIR analysis confirmed the improved incorporation and efficiency of ActX adsorption on oxidized BNC due to the availability of more active sites provided by oxidation. SEM analysis indicated the incorporation of ActX into the less-dense morphology of the TEMPO-oxidized BNC in comparison to pure BNC. The release kinetics of ActX were significantly affected by the BNC structure, and the activated BNC sample indicated the sustained release of active compounds over time, corresponding to the Fickian diffusion mechanism. Antimicrobial tests using Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 confirmed the potency of this BNC-based system for biomedical applications, taking advantage of the capacity of modified BNC to control and modulate the release of bioactive compounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Questions about the most suitable size of drops and bubbles have been solved now on the basis of dimensionless numbers. The consideration of the standard deviation between measured and calculated liquid profiles as a sensitive measure for the applicability of PAT provides a tool for its correct use. For solutions of highly surface-active compounds, bulk depletion effects can cause systematic errors in the analysis of adsorption kinetics, equations of state, and the visco-elastic interfacial behavior of liquid adsorption layers. Great progress has been made in measurements of interfacial dilational rheology with large amplitude perturbations providing additional information about structure and dynamics of complex adsorption layers. Also, first attempts are successfully made to use artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the efficiency of PAT applications.

Through a combination of ex-situ and in-situ techniques along with DFT simulations, distinct mechanisms and active phases in these catalysts are revealed. In silver catalysts, dispersed cationic Ag+ species are crucial for methane activation, while in palladium catalysts, palladium primarily exists in metallic form during coupling.

The same catalysts were used for the conversion of n-butanol to butenes and n-butyl-ether under similar conditions, determined using a flow microreactor with the conventional gas chromatography downstream analysis. The catalysts included the Wells-Dawson type heteropolyacids, H6P2W18O62 and H6P2Mo18O62, supported on TiO2 and/or BN. The activity orders obtained in those methods were compared to that obtained by the ammonia sorption using the gas-flow through microcalorimeter at 150 ºC.

In the present work, TiO2 NPs corresponding to anatase, rutile, or an anatase/rutile/brookite mixture were obtained at 80 °C by an inverse microemulsion method in a ternary system of water/cetyltrimethylammonium bromide/1-hexanol in a weight ratio of 17:28:55. The only synthesis variables were the preparation of the aqueous component and the nature of the Ti precursor (Ti(IV) ethoxide, isopropoxide, butoxide, or chloride). The materials were characterized with X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, FTIR and Raman vibrational spectroscopies, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The synthesis products differed significantly not only in phase composition, but also in crystallinity, textural properties, and adsorption properties towards water. All TiO2 NPs were active in the photocatalytic decomposition of rhodamine B, a model dye pollutant of wastewater streams. The mixed-phase anatase/rutile/brookite nanopowders obtained from alkoxy precursors showed the best photocatalytic performance, comparable to or better than the P25 reference. The exceptionally high photoactivity was attributed to the advantageous electronic effects known to accompany multiphase titania composition, namely high specific surface area and strong surface hydration. Among the single-phase materials, anatase samples showed better photoactivity than rutile ones, and this effect was associated, primarily, with the much higher specific surface area of anatase photocatalysts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

However, in liquids, a quantitative analysis of the experimental results is often intricate because of the complex interplay of hydrodynamic and adhesion forces varying with the physicochemical properties of adsorbates and functionalized QCM-D sensors. In the present paper, we dissect the role of hydrodynamics for the analytically tractable case of stiff contact, whereas the adsorbed rigid particles oscillate with the resonator without rotation. Under the assumption of the low surface coverage, we theoretically study the excess shear force exerted on the resonator, which has two contributions: (i) the fluid-mediated force due to flow disturbance created by the particle and (ii) the force exerted on the particle by the fluid and transmitted to the sensor via contact. The theoretical analysis enables an accurate interpretation of the QCM-D impedance measurements. It is demonstrated inter alia that for particles of the size comparable with protein molecules, the hydrodynamic force dominates over the inertial force and that the apparent mass derived from QCM independently of the overtone is about 10 times the Sauerbrey (inertial) mass. The theoretical results show excellent agreement with the results of experiments and advanced numerical simulations for a wide range of particle sizes and oscillation frequencies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Remarkably, its redox cofactor specificity is pH-dependent with the phosphorylated cofactors favored at lower and the dephospho-forms at higher pH. BaDH also shows different steady-state kinetic behavior with the two cofactor forms. From a structural model, the pH-dependent shift may affect the charge of a histidine in the 2′-phosphate-binding pocket of the redox cofactor binding site. The enzyme is phylogenetically affiliated to a new subbranch of the Zn-containing alcohol dehydrogenases, which share this conserved residue. BaDH appears to have some specificity for its substrate, but also turns over many substituted benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde variants, as well as compounds containing a conjugated C=C double bond with the aldehyde carbonyl group. However, compounds with an sp3-hybridised C next to the alcohol/aldehyde group are not or only weakly turned over.

Although the objects usually have acclimatized to the natural climate variability, preventing risks related to any kind of modification of their environment requires an understanding of the object’s response to the expected changes. In the present study, an analysis of the risk of cracking related to continuous or intermittent heating, or the transfer to hypothetically ideal conditions in a conservation studio was performed for the case of elements of Veit Stoss’ altarpiece (1477–1489) preserved in St. Mary’s Basilica in Krakow, Poland. Massive sculptures carved in lime wood and approximately one meter in diameter were analysed. The study aimed at determining safe margins of environment modifications that would not cause propagation of cracks that are known to have accumulated in wood during centuries of the altarpiece’s existence. The mechanical properties of lime wood were determined experimentally to feed the numerical model. The energy release rates around the tips of cracks of various depths in a wooden sculpture were calculated using the finite element analysis and compared with the critical value of the parameter triggering the fracture propagation in the material, derived from the fracture energy measurement. It was shown that the church interior housing the altarpiece can be heated to 11 °C during the cold season to provide human comfort. The allowable duration of intermittent heating events to more comfortable 18 °C that would induce drops in RH of up to 40% was assessed as 12 h. The study demonstrated that moving the sculptures to the conservation studio would have to be done with extreme caution as it would be connected with risks depending on the depth of existing cracks and the duration of the RH change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The ground-state geometric structures were proposed and compared with the available literature data derived from EXAFS experiments done for Cu-TiO2 materials. Copper atoms prefer to aggregate and form larger clusters on TiO2, as seen from the computed nucleation energies. The models were characterised by the following electronic properties: electronic band structure, natural population charges, and frontier orbitals (HOMO, LUMO, and SOMO). The copper phase becomes oxidised once it is deposited on titania. The charge distribution in the resulting structures indicates that the atoms that are the closest to the Cu-TiO2 interface would become the active sites for catalytic processes; copper atoms would act as electrophilic, while oxygen atoms would act as nucleophilic. The calculated binding energies between the two phases show that the formation of the composite system is favourable from the thermodynamic point of view, and the interaction between the small copper clusters and the titania surface is mostly of electrostatic nature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The transmission of the external fields to the sample is realized using a system of specialized sample holders, advanced transfers, and dedicated manipulators.

This study presents the synthesis methodology and investigations of olive oil-based oleogels, which are among the healthiest and most valuable vegetable fats, rich in unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants such as vitamin E. Two types of surfactants were used: TWEEN 80, which lowers surface tension and stabilizes emulsions, and SPAN 80, which acts in oil-dominated phases. The oleogels were enriched with lidocaine, an active substance commonly used as a pain reliever and local anesthetic. This research characterized the obtained oleogels regarding their medical applications, paying particular attention to the influence of surfactant type and amount as well as the active substance on their physicochemical properties. Structural analyses were also conducted using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, alongside rheological and sorption studies, and the wettability of the materials was evaluated.

The novel materials designed in this work circumvent these problems by immobilizing TiO2 NPs on the surface of exfoliated clay minerals. A series of TiO2/clay mineral composites were obtained using five different clay components: the Na-, CTA-, or H-form of montmorillonite (Mt) and Na- or CTA-form of laponite (Lap). The TiO2 component was prepared using the inverse microemulsion method. The composites were characterized with X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, thermal analysis, and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms. It was shown that upon composite synthesis, the Mt interlayer became filled by a mixture of CTA+ and hydronium ions, regardless of the nature of the parent clay, while the structure of Lap underwent partial destruction. The composites displayed high specific surface area and uniform mesoporosity determined by the size of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The best textural parameters were shown by composites containing clay components whose structure was partially destroyed; for instance, Ti/CTA-Lap had a specific surface area of 420 m2g−1 and a pore volume of 0.653 cm3g−1. The materials were tested in the photodegradation of methyl orange and humic acid upon UV irradiation. The photocatalytic activity could be correlated with the development of textural properties. In both reactions, the performance of the most photoactive composites surpassed that of the reference commercial P25 titania."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Preventing or limiting humidity-induced stresses in these structures requires an understanding of the relevant processes and risks. A three-dimensional model of a canvas painting was used to analyse stresses and crack development in the two-layer structure comprised of a glue-sized canvas on a wooden stretcher with a layer of stiff chalk-glue ground representing a pictorial layer in historic canvas paintings. The model was subjected to a large relative humidity fall which induced shrinkage of the glue-sized canvas. The modelling revealed that when a stretcher with flexible wooden bars is considered, high tensile stresses arise in the ground layer at the corners of the painting, and cracks are formed in these areas in the direction perpendicular to the painting’s diagonal. Ratios of critical distances between cracks to the ground layer thickness for which stresses in the midpoints between the cracks dropped to below the level inducing fracture in the material were estimated for various magnitudes of the relative humidity drop and thicknesses of the ground layer. Increasing ground layer thickness limits the hygric response of the sized canvas and makes the paintings less vulnerable to humidity variations. The ratio of stress along the diagonal calculated for painting with one crack to the solution without cracks was described by the double Lorentz function. A simple procedure of calculating stress variations along the diagonal—using the function—on a sequential addition of cracks was developed. Cracks in central parts of canvas painting were found to be induced by permanent cumulative drying shrinkage of the oil-based paints and grounds due to the evolution of the molecular composition of the oil binder. The outcome of the modelling indicated that the risk of cracking of the pictorial layers in canvas paintings due to drops in ambient relative humidity was small."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The influence of the type of glycosidic linkage in either homo- or heterooligomers on the nature of conformational transitions was also considered. For this purpose, two different theoretical methods were used: quantum mechanics (QM) at the DFT level with the EGO (Enforced Geometry Optimization) approach previously tested also for other saccharide systems, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within hybrid interaction potentials, which take into account both the ab initio (QM) level of theory and classical molecular mechanics (MM) force fields. This allowed to characterize in detail the structural and energetic properties of the conformational transition occurring upon the influence of external, mechanical forces (e.g. ring conformations at the path of ring-inversion process as well as the energies corresponding to initial, final and intermediate states). The results indicate qualitatively various responses against the applied force, depending on the G:M ratio, which have their source in differing topologies of glycosidic linkage in either G or M units.

Added salt disrupts polycation–polyanion intrinsic ion pairs, lowering a hydrated PEC’s glass transition temperature (Tg). However, the relative influence of counterion type on the PEC’s Tg is not well understood. Here, the effect of anion type (NaCl, NaBr, NaNO3, and NaI) on the Tg of solid-like, hydrated PECs composed of poly(diallydimethylammonium) (PDADMA)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) is investigated. With increasing the chaotropic nature of the salt anion, the Tg decreases. The relative differences are attributed to the doping level, the amount of bound water, the mobility of water molecules within the PECs, and the strength of interactions between the PEs. For all studied salt concentrations and salt types, the Tg followed the scaling of −1/Tg ≈ ln([IP]/[H2O]), in which [IP]/[H2O] is the ratio of intrinsic pairs to water. The scaling estimates that about 7 to 17% of the intrinsic ion pairs should be weakened for the PEC to partake in a glass transition. Put together, this study highlights that the Tg in PECs is impacted by the salt anion, but the mechanism of the glass transition remains unchanged."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Effectively designing a hybrid nanocarrier requires a deep understanding of the interactions of the hybrid nanoparticle with the drug to ensure drug stability and therapeutic efficiency. In this study, we utilized fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the adsorption behavior of a doxorubicin (DOX) anticancer drug onto a zwitterion/PAMAM/CQD hybrid nanocarrier. The hybrid nanoparticles were composed of CQD, at two oxidation levels, grafted with PAMAM dendrimers of generation 3 (G3) or 4 (G4) decorated with zwitterion monomers. Our work reveals that the generation of the grafted dendrimer was the primary determinant of efficient adsorption of DOX, unlike the oxidation level of CQD or dendrimer surface chemistry. After grafting, the G4 dendrimers assume a more stretched conformation compared to the G3 dendrimers. This allowed DOX molecules to penetrate inside the dendritic cavities of G4 dendrimers, resulting in enhanced drug protection. The hydrophobic interaction, between the aromatic structure of DOX molecules and the nonpolar parts of dendrimers, has been proven to play a crucial role in mediating the adsorption of drug molecules. These findings provide valuable insights to assist in the design of a zwitterion/PAMAM/CQD hybrid nanoplatform for drug delivery applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The accuracy of the theoretical model describing this degree of freedom influences the quality of the results obtained from MD calculations based on this model. This article focuses on the following two issues related to the conformation of the glycosidic linkage. First, we describe the results of a comparative analysis of the predictions of three carbohydrate-dedicated classical force fields for MD simulations, namely, CHARMM, GLYCAM, and GROMOS, in the context of different parameters of structural and energetic nature related to the conformation of selected types of glycosidic linkages, α(1 → 4), β(1 → 3), and β(1 → 4), connecting glucopyranose units. This analysis revealed several differences, mainly concerning the energy levels of the secondary and tertiary conformers and the linkage flexibility within the dominant exo-syn conformation for α(1 → 4) and β(1 → 3) linkages. Some aspects of the comparative analysis also included the newly developed, carbohydrate-dedicated Martini 3 coarse-grained force field. Second, to overcome the time-scale problem associated with sampling slow degrees of freedom in polysaccharide chains during MD simulations, we developed a coarse-grained (CG) model based on the data from MD simulations and designed for Monte Carlo modeling. This model (CG MC) is based on information from simulations of short saccharide chains, effectively sampled in atomistic MD simulations, and is capable of extrapolating local conformational properties to the case of polysaccharides of arbitrary length. The CG MC model has the potential to estimate the conformations of very long polysaccharide chains, taking into account the influence of secondary and tertiary conformations of glycosidic linkages. With respect to the comparative analysis of force fields, the application of CG MC modeling showed that relatively small differences in the predictions of individual force fields with respect to a single glycosidic linkage accumulate when considering their effect on the structure of longer chains, leading to drastically different predictions with respect to parameters describing the polymer conformation, such as the persistence length."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The preferred binding sites for hydrogen atom are determined. The hydrogen adopts a Cu-H-Ti bridging position when bound to Cu1-(TiO2)34 or Cu7-(TiO2)34 or Cu-H-Cu when bound to Cu2-(TiO2)34 or Cu4-(TiO2)34. In Cun-(TiO2)34 with n = 3, 5, 6 the H atom sits in the three coordinate site, similar to that found for its favourable position while on Cu(111). The population analysis reveals that in the selected cases, n = 1, 2, 5, 7, the hydrogen binding exhibits three centre two electron bond character. In all the cases studied here the adsorbate has a hydride character. Among the studied clusters, those containing 1, 4, and 7 copper atoms exhibit moderate Gibbs free H binding energies indicating them as the best candidates for hydrogen evolution. The obtained results are compared with data available in literature for metallic copper and other materials having isolated single Cu atom sites. Considering Cu atom efficiency as well as wide availability and use of the titania as a support, these materials may be competitive for H2 generation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The spectroscopic considerations have been enriched by the precise physicochemical characterization of PtNPs. The obtained data show that the applied monolayers ensure sufficient AFM–SEIRA signal enhancement, therefore allowing to perform a detailed description of erlotinib (a drug approved in non–small cell lung cancer therapy) adsorption on these surfaces with ultra–high spatial resolution. The main finding of AFM-SEIRA investigations revealed similar adsorption geometry of erlotinib on both 20-nm and 55-nm PtNP monolayers via the quinazoline and –CH2 moieties. Moreover, the application of PtNPs monolayers with different nanoparticle sizes allowed to visualize two mechanisms of plasmon coupling effect − either between neighbouring NPs or between NPs and AFM tip, as can be seen on AFM-SEIRA intensity maps."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The Ramachandran plot, displaying the set of torsional angles, phi (Φ) and psi (Ψ), of the protein backbone, serves as a popular and convenient tool for secondary structure analysis and interpretation. However, identifying subtle changes in protein structure is often hindered in traditional Ramachandran plot, especially with the large amount of data generated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this paper, we proposed a useful and efficient tool, that is, differential Ramachandran plot (dRama), which enables to compare protein structures and extract the differences, providing a highly readable graphical representation. dRama is available at: https://github.com/MaksWolf44/dRama."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

These instruments provide an efficient way to collect sorption isotherm data and kinetic data. A typical method for defining equilibrium after a step change in relative humidity (RH) is using a particular threshold value for the rate of change in mass with time. Recent studies indicate that commonly used threshold values yield substantial errors and that further measurements are needed at extended hold times as a basis to assess the accuracy of abbreviated equilibration criteria. However, the mass measurement accuracy at extended times depends on the operational stability of the instrument. Published data on the stability of automated sorption balances are rare. An interlaboratory study was undertaken to investigate equilibration criteria for automated sorption balances. This paper focuses on the mass, temperature, and RH stability and includes data from 25 laboratories throughout the world. An initial target for instrument mass stability was met on the first attempt in many cases, but several instruments were found to have unexpectedly large instabilities. The sources of these instabilities were investigated and greatly reduced. This paper highlights the importance of verifying operational mass stability of automated sorption balances, gives a method to perform stability checks, and provides guidance on identifying and correcting common sources of mass instability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a63aa","5e709346878c28a0473a634f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

This paper explores the potential use of poly-L-lysine/rhamnolipids and poly-L-glutamic acid/ethyl lauroyl arginate mixtures, for foam formation and stabilization. Two complementary methods were employed to investigate the synergistic and antagonistic effects of these mixed polyelectrolyte/surfactant systems: (1) the thinning and rupture of thin foam films formed under dynamic conditions were monitored using a dynamic fluid-film interferometer (DFI), and (2) foamability tests were conducted using a standard dynamic foam analyzer (DFA).

Therefore, in this manuscript, for the first time assessment of the potential application of biodegradable bacterially derived poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (P(3HO)) doped with functional 2D nanoparticles as a more sustainable active packaging material has been investigated. In particular, P(3HO) combined with two types of layered double hydroxide (LDHs) modified with α-tocopherol (type of vitamin E) was applied for the fabrication of polymeric nanocomposite films and a comprehensive investigation of their structure and relevant properties (mechanical, barrier, bactericidal, and antioxidative) was performed. Permeation study revealed that P(3HO)-based films with 4 wt% tocopherol-modified nanoparticles meet the barrier requirements for storing fruits and vegetables, whereas antibacterial assay indicated inhibited growth of Gram-positive bacteria (particularly S. Aureus). Monitoring of polyphenols (PPH) content in strawberries after 6 days of storage at room conditions showed a slightly higher level of PPH with reference to fresh fruits, which indicates the preserved freshness of strawberries kept in P(3HO) containing 4 wt% Zn-based LDHs modified with tocopherol contrary to fruits kept in commercial polypropylene packaging which led to significant drop in PPH content. Thus, the application-focused experiments indicated that investigated P(3HO)-based nanocomposites are promising candidates for more sustainable active packaging that may extend the shelf-life of fruits and protect consumers from food-borne pathogenic bacteria."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

While excited state dynamics are well explored for either neutral or fully protonated porphyrins, the intermediate region has not yet been explored, although their potential implications for photocatalytic reactions are evident. This study explores how partial protonation affects the nature and properties of photoexcited states of tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP) using steady-state and nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. Global-fit analysis of the decay curves revealed the formation of a protonated excited triplet state from the neutral triplet state, as well as the long lifetimes of these species of up to 120 μs. The photoexcited triplet state of TCPP functions as a photobase, which was confirmed by computational analysis of the electron density of the exited states showing increased nucleophilicity at the unprotonated nitrogen atoms of the porphyrin core. These findings indicate that photoinduced protonated excited triplet states can function as electron acceptors with anodically shifted redox potentials, opening new pathways for porphyrin-based photoreactions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

This generalizable approach involves incorporating a series of de novo-designed sequences with α-helical conformation and genetically encoding them into biologically inspired intrinsically disordered repeating motifs. The new ELP variants maintain structural conformation and showed tunable supramolecular self-assembly out of thermal equilibrium with phase behavior in vitro. This work illustrates the effective translation of the predicted molecular designs in structural and functional materials.

This study focuses on egg-tempera paints, whose mechanical characteristics have been minimally explored so far. Various formulations using two natural ochre pigments were investigated. Initially, the pigments were characterized to identify compositional and morphological differences. Rheological analysis was conducted to study the liquid properties of the formulations. Tensile tests and dynamic mechanical analysis were performed on unsupported dry paints to assess their mechanical properties. Additionally, single-sided NMR was used non-invasively to probe the network mobility before and after nine months of aging, providing insights into the network tightness. It was found that ochre-based paints display significant brittleness. The viscoelastic properties of tempera paints are predominantly influenced by the type of earth pigments used and the pigment-to-binder ratio. Importantly, the liquid properties were found to correlate with the solid-state behavior, emphasizing the critical role of formulation in the final performance of tempera paints."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Currently, numerous studies are focused on developing new methods for CPZ delivery; however, the knowledge regarding its conjugates with metal nanoparticles remains limited. The aim of this study was to prepare CPZ conjugates with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and evaluate their biological activity on human lymphocytes (HUT-78 and COLO 720L), as well as human (COLO 679) and murine (B16-F0) melanoma cells, in comparison to the effects induced by unconjugated CPZ molecules and AuNPs with well-defined properties. During the treatment of cells with CPZ, AuNPs, and CPZ-AuNP conjugates, changes in mitochondrial activity, membrane integrity, and the secretion of lipid peroxidation mediators were studied using standard biological assays such as MTT, LDH, and MDA assays. It was found that positively charged CPZ-AuNP conjugates more effectively reduced cell viability compared to AuNPs alone. The dose-dependent membrane damage was correlated with oxidative stress resulting from exposure to CPZ-AuNP conjugates.

A typical thin film Sb2S3 solar cell using low-cost solution-based methods (such as hydrothermal deposition) utilizes a toxic CdS film with a narrow bandgap (2.4 eV) as the electron transport layer (ETL). Wide bandgap (3.1–3.4 eV) non-toxic TiO2 meets the optoelectronic requirements for a Cd-free ETL alternative but the hydrothermal deposition of Sb2S3 on TiO2 results in a non-uniform island-like growth, which is unsuitable for semitransparent applications (utilizing less than 100 nm Sb2S3). Therefore, in this study, using the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method, an ultrathin ZnS layer (1–3 nm) is coated on TiO2 as a surface modification layer to improve the nucleation and growth characteristics of Sb2S3 during hydrothermal deposition. The introduction of ZnS results in a pinhole-free compact mirrorlike Sb2S3 film similar to that obtained on CdS. The optimized solar cells based on CdS, TiO2, and TiO2-ZnS ETLs showed photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.2 %, 5.1 %, and 4.3 %, respectively. A comprehensive comparative study is then reported highlighting the relationship between morphology, optoelectronic properties, and photovoltaic performance of the Sb2S3 films grown on the three ETLs. Furthermore, utilizing the excellent film morphology of Sb2S3 on TiO2-ZnS ETL, semitransparent solar cells were fabricated using an ultrathin Au (<10 nm) electrode. Semitransparent solar cells using 65 and 80 nm Sb2S3 absorber layers on TiO2-ZnS obtained PCEs (and average visible transmittances, AVTs) of 3.3 % (11.2 %) and 3.6 % (8.8 %), respectively.

However, numerous challenges emerge prior to beneficiation, such as the declining quality of ore, necessitating further liberation. This deterioration results in higher energy, water, and reagent consumption. A froth flotation chemicals market analysis reveals an anticipated growth of around 30 % in the next five years, signaling a concerning trend due to the frequent toxicity associated with these chemicals. With increasingly stringent environmental regulations, there is a pressing need to explore more sustainable and non-toxic solutions. Polymers play a significant role in mineral processing as either depressants, flocculants or dispersants. The potential of natural green polymers in these capacities is actively being studied. This review delves into the relatively novel use of polymers as collectors, examining their performance and adsorption mechanisms. Among the papers reviewed, collectors formulations based on either natural or synthetic non-toxic polymers have emerged as environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional collectors. The utilization of polymers opens possibilities for creating nanoparticles, conventional polymers, temperature-responsive polymers and block copolymers with functionalities tailored for specific separation processes. These polymers have shown promising results, achieving recoveries and grades comparable to or better than conventional collectors. Additionally, they could address the challenge of declining ore quality, effectively handling finely ground particles and slimes. Properties such as those in temperature-responsive polymers can be used not only to induce hydrophobicity but also to allow the recycling of the collector for future applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The study\nmonitored the influence of the ionized form of the doxorubicin molecule on the efficiency of complex formation. The deprotonated form of doxorubicin occurs under basic conditions in the pH range of 9.0−10.0. In the presence of doxorubicin, changes in the zeta potential of the complex concerning the initial system are observed. These changes result from electrostatic interactions between the drug molecules and external functional groups. Based on changes in the absorbance intensity of UV−vis spectra, the binding of the drug in the polymer structure is observed depending on the pH of the environment and the molar ratio. Optimal conditions for forming complexes occur under alkaline conditions. UV−vis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed the stability of the formed dendrimer-DOX complex. Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to gain a deeper insight into the molecular mechanism of DOX adsorption on and within the G4.0 PAMAM dendrimers. It was observed that the protonation state of both the dendrimer and DOX significantly influences the adsorption stability. The system exhibited high stability at high pH values (∼9−10), with DOX molecules strongly adsorbed on the dendrimer surface and partially within its bulk. However, under lower pH conditions, a reduction in adsorption strength was observed, leading to the detachment of DOX clusters from the dendrimer structure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Therefore, this in vitro study aimed to compare the effects of CBD in a wide range of concentrations on oxidative stress and excitotoxic-related cell damage. Results showed that low concentrations of CBD ameliorated the H2O2-evoked cell damage of primary cortical neuronal cell culture. However, higher concentrations of CBD alone (5–25 μM) decreased the viability of cortical neurons in a concentration-dependent manner and aggravated the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Neuroprotection mediated by CBD in primary neurons against H2O2 was not associated with a direct influence on ROS production nor inhibition of caspase-3, but we found protective effects of CBD at the level of mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation. However, CBD had no protective effect on the glutamate-induced cell damage of cortical neurons, and in higher concentrations, it enhanced the toxic effects of this cell-damaging factor. Likewise, CBD, depending on its concentration, at least did not affect or even enhance cortical cellular damage exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). Finally, we showed that CBD in submicromolar or low micromolar concentrations significantly protected human neuronal-like SH-SY5Y cells against H2O2- and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell damage. Our data indicate that CBD has a dual effect on oxidative stress-induced neuronal death-in low concentrations, it is neuroprotective, but in higher ones, it may display neurotoxic activity. On the other hand, in excitotoxic-related models, CBD was ineffective or enhanced cell damage. Our data support the notion that the neuroprotective effects of CBD strongly depend on its concentration and experimental model of neuronal death."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Micromagnetic simulations are used to construct a corresponding phase diagram of the stability of the imprinted antiferromagnetic vortex state.

Management of the risk requires tools which quantitatively relate the risk of fire to the characteristics of buildings and collections and the effectiveness of fire protection measures. Such tools must be accessible to, and useful for, conservation professionals and related decision-makers. To address the challenge, a module assessing fire risk for collections in museums has been developed on the HERIe online digital decision-supporting platform using the methodology proposed by Jean Tétreault transformed into a mathematical algorithm. It takes into account building characteristics and the proportion of the collection stored in showcases, as well as the vulnerability of the collection materials to heat, combustion, smoke, and water. This information is used to forecast loss to collection value over a selected time horizon. Fire likelihood is estimated from the fire statistics available in the user’s country, area, or organization.

This study aimed to synthesize bilayer foamed oleogels using Ecogel™ as an emulsifier—a natural gelling and emulsifying agent commonly used to stabilize emulsions. Ecogel™ is multifunctional, particularly in cosmetic formulations, where it aids in creating lightweight cream gels with a cooling effect. However, the specific goal of this study was to investigate the physicochemical properties of oleogels formed with Ecogel™, Tween 80, gelatin, and glycerin. The combination of these ingredients has not been studied before, particularly in the context of bilayer foamed oleogels. The biphasic nature of the resulting materials was explored, consisting of a uniform lower phase and a foamed upper layer. Several analytical techniques were employed, including FT-IR spectrophotometric analysis, moisture content evaluation, surface wettability measurements, microscopic imaging, and rheological studies, in addition to surface energy determination. The results demonstrated that the addition of Tween 80 significantly improved the stability and rigidity of the oleogels. Furthermore, storage at reduced temperatures after synthesis enhanced the material’s stabilizing properties. These materials also showed an affinity for interacting with non-polar compounds, indicating potential applications in skincare, especially for interaction with skin lipids."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

G-quadruplexes, four-stranded structures formed by guanine-rich sequences, are stabilized by Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and monovalent cations like potassium. These structures exhibit diverse topologies and are implicated in critical genomic regions such as telomeres and promoter regions of oncogenes, playing significant roles in gene expression regulation, genome stability, and cellular aging. I-motifs, formed by cytosine-rich sequences under acidic conditions and stabilized by hemiprotonated cytosine–cytosine (C:C+) base pairs, also contribute to gene regulation despite being less prevalent than G4s. This review highlights the factors influencing the stability and dynamics of these structures, including sequence composition, ionic conditions, and environmental pH. Molecular dynamics simulations and high-resolution structural techniques have been pivotal in advancing our understanding of their folding and unfolding mechanisms. Additionally, the article discusses the therapeutic potential of small molecules designed to selectively bind and stabilize G4s and i-motifs, with promising implications for cancer treatment. Furthermore, the structural properties of these DNA forms are explored for applications in nanotechnology and molecular devices. Despite significant progress, challenges remain in observing these structures in vivo and fully elucidating their biological functions. The review underscores the importance of continued research to uncover new insights into the genomic roles of G4s and i-motifs and their potential applications in medicine and technology. This ongoing research promises exciting developments in both basic science and applied fields, emphasizing the relevance and future prospects of these intriguing DNA structures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The ethoxyl groups that also form on ZnO do not contain surface OH groups, but the mechanism of their formation is different. On ZnO, ethoxy groups are formed by the reaction of ethanol with surface oxygens. The presence of ethoxyls on ZnO decreases the basicity because some surface oxygens are already engaged in the bonding of ethoxyl groups. The effect of ammonia adsorption on basicity is different for each oxide. For Ga2O3, ammonia adsorption increases the basicity of neighbouring oxygen sites. Ammonia is not adsorbed on MgO; therefore, it does not change the basicity of this oxide. Ammonia adsorbed on ZnO forms coordination bonds with Zn sites; it does not change the number of basic sites but changes how carbonate species are bonded to surface sites."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Here, we study the formation of a BSA protein corona (PC) around amino-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-NH2) in the presence of different buffers (Tris, BES, cacodylate, phosphate, and citrate) at the same pH (7.15) and different concentrations (10, 50, and 100 mM). We find that BSA adsorption is buffer specific, with the adsorbed amount of BSA being 4.4 times higher in the presence of 100 mM Tris (184 ± 3 mg/g) than for 100 mM citrate (42 ± 2 mg/g). That is a considerable difference that cannot be explained by conventional theories. The results become clearer if the interaction energies between BSA and MSN-NH2, considering the electric double layer (EEDL) and the van der Waals (EvdW) terms, are evaluated. The buffer specific PC derives from buffer specific zeta potentials that, for MSN-NH2, are positive with Tris and negative with citrate buffers. A reversed sign of zeta potentials can be obtained by considering polarizability-dependent dispersion forces acting together with electrostatics to give the buffer specific outcome. These results are relevant not only to our understanding of the formation of the PC but may also apply to other bio- and nanosystems in biological media."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

To mitigate the non-specific, high toxicity of PTX towards cardiomyocytes, we propose the application of newly synthesized SDS-based polyelectrolyte multicore nanocapsules. This study aims to verify the hypothesis that SDS-based NCs can mitigate the cytotoxic effects of PTX on cardiac cells and serve as effective nanocarriers for this drug. We investigated two types of multicore NCs with differing polyelectrolyte coatings: poly-L-lysine (PLL) and a combination of PLL with poly-L-glutamic acid (PGA). The cytotoxicity of the formulated nanosystems was evaluated using HL-1 cardiomyocytes. Oxygraphy, flow cytometry, spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry, fluorescence microscopy, and RT-PCR were employed to assess disruptions in cardiac cellular homeostasis. Our data revealed that, among the tested NCs, SDS/PLL/PGA/PTX exhibited reduced cardiotoxicity and were better tolerated by HL−1 cardiomyocytes compared to SDS/PLL/PTX or PTX alone. In addition, SDS/PLL/PGA/PTX showed a marginal disruption of mitochondria’s homeostasis, and no changes in APT level and intracellular calcium concentrations were observed. These findings underscore the potential of SDS-based multicore nanocarriers in anticancer therapy, particularly due to diminished cardiotoxicity and long-term stability in the biological fluids."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

This study presents an in-depth evaluation of the environmental implications of producing nanocomposites using poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (P(3HO)), a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer that holds great promise as an alternative to traditional plastics, in combination with calcium-, and zinc-based double-layered hydroxides (LDH) modified with the antioxidant α-tocopherol. Utilising the ReCiPe impact assessment method, we identified critical environmental impact categories, including fine particle formation, global warming potential, and toxicity. The analysis revealed that the biosynthesis of P(3HO) is the primary contributor to environmental impact, with electricity consumption accounting for approximately 95% of the overall effect. Purification processes significantly increase environmental impact, mainly due to the extra electricity used for freezing, centrifugation and evaporation. The preparation of nanoparticles contributes to the overall environmental impact, but its scale is reasonably differentiated and spans from 0,3% for Ca/Al nanoparticles to 9.9% for Zn/Al-toc variants, respectively. Although producing these eco-friendly polymers involves significant energy consumption, they present a viable long-term alternative to petroleum-based polymers. Specific life cycle management decisions, like recovering substrates, using renewable energy sources, or gaining overall process improvement, could bring significant environmental benefits. Investigated materials show substantial potential in biomedical coatings and active packaging applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The samples were composed of polymer molecules with molecular weight 30 000 amu and 2% of branched carbon atoms. The calculations were carried out using various force fields i.e. Amber pairwise additive force field and four types of many body reactive force fields like AIREBO, AIREBO-M, ReaxFF and ci-ReaxFF. For each force field the material properties of the samples were determined i.e.: Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength and share modulus using the determined stress–strain curves. The samples were subjected to mechanical cleaving by applying an external forces in order to generate surfaces of LDPE. These surfaces were analyzed in terms of their chemical composition and number and types of radical ends formed on the surfaces. Additionally, the samples were subjected to shock compression in order to produce more deeper chemical transformations which should be more representative to naturally degraded nanoplastics. We conclude that the CHO ReaxFF force field is the most reliable for generating degraded LDPE surfaces which can be next used in standard molecular dynamics involving interaction of nanoplastic with proteins or lipid membranes, for instance. © 2023 The Author(s)"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations of zinc/carbimazole and zinc/methimazole solutions were carried out to determine the effect of drugs on the hydration sphere of Zn2+ ions. It was shown that the electroreduction of Zn2+ in the presence of methimazole and carbimazole occurs in two steps and the first one determines the kinetics of the entire process. The presence of both drugs in the solution and the increase in the concentration of the supporting electrolyte reduce the degree of hydration of the depolarizer ions and the hydration of the electrode surface, what is a factor favoring the rate of electroreduction. Based on theoretical studies, the formation of stable complexes between Zn2+ and the molecules of both drugs in a solution was considered unlikely. However, active complexes can be formed between depolarizer ions and molecules adsorbed at the electrode surface. They constitute a bridge facilitating charge exchange during the electrode reaction, revealing the catalytic abilities of methimazole and carbimazole. In the range of cdrug ≤ 1 × 10−3 mol dm−3, carbimazole is a better catalyst, whereas in the range of cdrug ≥ 5 × 10−3 mol dm−3, it is methimazole. The effectiveness of both compounds in catalyzing the first stage of the electrode reaction increases with the increase in the NaClO4 concentration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a6","5e7092f5878c28a0473a0087"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Because of the enormous number of people suffering from AD, this disease has become one of the world’s major health and social problems. The presence of tau lesions clearly correlates with cognitive impairments in AD patients, thus, tau is the target of potential treatments against AD, just next to amyloid-β. The exact mechanism of tau aggregation has not been understood in detail so far, especially a little is known on the structural rearrangements of tau aggregates at the growth phase. The research into tau conformation at each step of the aggregation pathway will contribute to designing effective therapeutic approaches. To follow the secondary structure of individual tau aggregates at the growth phase, we applied tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). The nanospectroscopic approach enabled us to follow the structure of individual aggregates occurring in the subsequent phases of the tau aggregation. We applied multivariate data analysis to extract the spectral differences for tau aggregates at different aggregation phases. Moreover, atomic force microscopy (AFM) allowed tracking of the morphological alterations for species occurring with the progression of tau aggregation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["624512287523402df09a212a","5e709425878c28a0473b72aa","602e0fad9543c7410626eb76","5e709447878c28a0473b97c3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

This study aimed to fill this gap in understanding the role of artificial snowmaking in dissemination of antibiotics, bacterial contaminants, antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and genetic determinants (ARGs) thereof. Technical snow and water used for its production were examined from 11 ski stations located in four river catchments, varying in anthropopressure and the presence/absence of storage reservoirs where water is collected before snowmaking. Culturable E. coli were found in all water intakes with clear reduction/elimination during snowmaking. Fourteen antimicrobial agents were detected using UHPLC/MS/MS. Concentration and prevalence of antimicrobials differed between the catchments; the sites located downstream of long-term stay health centers were most severely contaminated. Two antibiotics of restricted use (vancomycin and linezolid) were detected downstream of hospitals. Antimicrobial resistance of 158 E. coli strains was tested using disk diffusion method. The resistance to penicillins (e.g. ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) was most frequent and in general followed the pattern of antibiotic consumption rather than antibiotic concentration in water. Extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL) genes were detected using PCR tests: 66.46 % (105 out of 158) strains possessed at least one ARG among which blaTEM was most frequent, followed by blaCTX-M and blaSHV.\nOur study indicates that the major sources of aquatic environment and technical snow contamination with antimicrobial agents are effluents from long-term stay medical centers, while bacterial contamination (including ARB and ARGs) stems from municipal WWTPs, i.e. the main hubs of antimicrobial resistance transfer to the environment. The storage reservoir construction may aid in reducing the transfer rate of pollutants and micropollutants from contaminated water to technical snow."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

This study employs pulsed laser melting to transform colloidal copper/magnetite nanoparticles into surface-active submicron CuxFe3-xO4-CuyO-CuzFe1-z composite particles, tailored for ethanol oxidation fuel cells. The findings reveal that colloidal particles tend to cluster into either homogeneous or heterogeneous aggregates, mediated by the surrounding liquid. This clustering aids the formation of desired phases during pulsed laser processing. Temperature-dependent thermodynamic phase transitions, combined with pulse-driven heating-cooling dynamics, promote copper oxidation and magnetite reduction, achieving both compositional control and microstructural surface activation. The synthesized heterostructures demonstrated excellent performance in ethanol oxidation, both as primary catalytic materials and as activity-enhancing supports for platinum. Oxidation state analysis post electrocatalysis indicated a reduction in graphite bonds and an increase in oxygen bonds, attributed to the high oxygen content of the catalysts’ surface. The electrocatalysis ethanol oxidation process generated potent oxidizing agents, including ozone, oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, with the ability of degrading the sp2 hybrid structure of graphite. Despite their submicron size, the kinetically activated composite particles exhibited exceptional surface activity, positioning them as cost-effective alternatives to the conventional catalysts for fuel cell technologies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The first step involved all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) modeling of physicochemical characteristics yielding PARG molecule conformations, its contour length, and the cross-section area. It was also shown that PARG molecules, even in concentrated electrolyte solutions (100 mM NaCl), assume a largely elongated shape with an aspect ratio of 36. Using the parameters derived from MD, the PARG adsorption kinetics at the silica/electrolyte interface was calculated using the random sequential adsorption approach. These predictions were validated by optical reflectometry measurements. It was confirmed that the molecules irreversibly adsorbed in the side-on orientation and their coverage agreed with the elongated shape of the PARG molecule predicted from the MD modeling. These theoretical and experimental results were used for the interpretation of the quartz crystal microbalance measurements carried out under various pH conditions. A comprehensive analysis unveiled that the results stemming from the hydrodynamic theory postulating a lubrication-like (soft) contact of the macroion molecules with the sensor adequately reflect the adsorption kinetics. The range of validity of the intuitively used Sauerbrey model was also estimated. It was argued that acquired results can be exploited to control macroion adsorption at solid/liquid interfaces. This is essential for the optimum preparation of their supporting layers used for bioparticle immobilization and shell formation at nanocapsules in targeted drug delivery."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Moreover, we support several of the computational predictions experimentally, providing evidence for the predicted H/D-exchange reactions into the product and at the glycyl radical site. Our data indicate that the hydrogen transfer reactions between the active site glycyl and cysteine are principally reversible, but their rates differ strongly depending on their stereochemical orientation, transfer of protium or deuterium, and the presence or absence of substrates or products in the active site. This is particularly evident for the isotope exchange of the remaining protium atom of the glycyl radical to deuterium, which appears dependent on substrate or product binding, explaining why the exchange is observed in some, but not all, glycyl-radical enzymes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709318878c28a0473a2beb","5e709482878c28a0473bec02"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Therefore, the impact of three types of AuNPs on Chlorella vulgaris was studied after short-term exposure. The AuNPs were prepared using sodium borohydride (SB), cysteamine hydrochloride (CH) and trisodium citrate (TC). Microscopic imaging revealed that the AuNPs were characterized by quasi-spherical shape and an average size within the range 9–12 nm. CHSBAuNPs were positively charged whereas TCAuNPs and SBAuNPs were negatively charged. The results of studies showed that the exposure to each type of AuNPs led to the dose-dependent decrease of growth rate of C. vulgaris biomass. The swelling of the cells was observed especially at concentration of 5 mg L−1. For all treatments, significant changes in efficiency of the photosystem II were detected. Each type of AuNPs applied in concentration of 1 mg L−1 caused an increase and in concentration of 5 mg L−1 a decrease of photosynthetic pigments content. Based on recorded Raman spectra, it was found that the cell chemical composition was disturbed radically after the treatment with SBAuNPs and CHSBAuNPs. It was established that the changes in the morphology and physiology of C. vulgaris cells, as a result of the exposure on the AuNPs, were strongly dependent on the surface properties of AuNPs. Nevertheless, it was impossible to indicate the most harmful type of AuNPs. Obtained findings did not confirm that the stabilization of AuNPs by molecules of well-documented toxicity lead to the increase of their toxic effects. It was not confirmed that positively charged CHSBAuNPs, stabilized by cysteamine, were more harmful for C. vulgaris than negatively charged TCAuNPs and SBAuNPs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","uid":"blTedeK8fuVutIuS0UC1hLA","uuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","name":"Politechnika Krakowska im.

This study introduces the sonochemical route to obtain a bimetallic CuPd-HKUST-1 metal–organic framework (MOF), replacing the conventional solvothermal synthesis method. The developed synthesis method allowed for obtaining bimetallic CuPd-HKUST-1 crystals or a CuPd-HKUST-1-son-def composite with Pd nanoparticles when orthophosphoric acid was used during the sonochemical synthesis. Several techniques, including low-temperature nitrogen adsorption, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared and μRaman spectroscopies, and density functional theory modeling, comprehensively characterized the obtained materials. The sonochemically synthesized CuPd-HKUST-1 is characterized by a significantly increased specific surface area equal to 1792 m2 g–1, which is 41% higher than its conventionally obtained counterpart. The catalytic activity of the obtained materials was tested in a cyclohexene oxidation reaction under 10 bar of O2 conditions. Sonically synthesized CuPd-HKUST-1-son showed exceptional selectivity, promoting the production of cyclohexanol. The enhanced selectivity toward cyclohexanol is due to many well-distributed Cu- and Pd-active sites confirmed by in situ FTIR spectroscopy using CO as a probe molecule. The obtained results confirmed that sonochemistry is a versatile tool for the development and optimization of MOF-based catalysts, allowing the design and tuning of specific functionalities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

For an accurate ab initio description of the material properties, the electronic band structure must be known and theoretically reproduced with high fidelity. Here, we ask a question which of the ab initio methods compare the best to the experimental photoemission intensities from bcc Fe. We confront the photoemission data from Fe(001) thin film grown on Au(001) to the photoemission simulations based on different ab initio initial band structures: density functional theory (DFT) in the local density approximation (LDA) and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA corrected with many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation. We find the best comparison for the GW results. As a second step, we discuss how the calculated intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) in bcc Fe depends on the choice of the method that describes the electronic band structure and Fermi level position. We find very large differences in AHC between the three theoretical approaches and show that the AHC found for the experimental Fermi level location within the GW band structure is the closest to the literature results of transport experiments. This finding improves our understanding of not only the anomalous Hall effect itself, but also other related phenomena, such as the anomalous Nernst effect."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Usually, the adhesivity of cells is tuned by an appropriate biocompatible layer. Here, synthetic poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC), natural chitosan, and heparin (existing in an extracellular matrix) were selected to assembly PDADMAC/heparin and chitosan/heparin films. The physicochemical properties of macroion multilayers were determined by streaming potential measurements (SPM), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM-D), and optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS). The topography of the wet films was imaged using atomic force microscopy (AFM).\nThe adhesion of preosteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 on those well-characterized polysaccharide-based multilayers was evaluated using a resonant waveguide grating (RWG) based optical biosensor and digital holographic microscopy. The latter method was engaged to investigate long-term cellular behavior on the fabricated multilayers.\n(PDADMAC/heparin) films were proved to be the most effective in inducing cellular adhesion. The cell attachment to chitosan/heparin–based multilayers was negligible. It was found that efficient adhesion of the cells occurs onto homogeneous and rigid multilayers (PDADMAC/heparin), whereas the macroion films forming “sponge-like” structures (chitosan/heparin) are less effective, and could be employed when reduced adhesion is needed.\nPolysaccharide-based multilayers can be considered versatile systems for medical applications. One can postulate that the presented results are relevant not only for modeling studies but also for applied research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3a12","5e709315878c28a0473a296a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

EuO exhibits unique properties of hosting both weakly dispersive nearly fully polarized Eu 4f bands, as well as O 2p levels indirectly exchange-split by the interaction with Eu nearest neighbors. Our temperature-dependent spin-ARPES data directly demonstrate the exchange splitting in O 2p\n and its vanishing at the Curie temperature. Our calculations with a Hubbard U term reveal a complex nature of the local exchange splitting on the oxygen site and in conduction bands. We discuss the mechanisms of indirect exchange in the O 2p levels by analyzing the orbital resolved band characters in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. The directional effects due to spin-orbit coupling are predicted theoretically to be significant in particular in the Eu 4f band manifold. The analysis of the shape of spin-resolved spectra in the Eu 4f spectral region reveals signatures of hybridization with O 2p states, in agreement with the theoretical predictions. We also analyze spectral changes in the spin-integrated spectra throughout the Curie temperature, and demonstrate that they derive from both the magnetic phase transition and effects due to sample aging, unavoidable for this highly reactive material."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The effect of dopants and different chelating agents on the characteristics of synthesized LaBaZrXY electrolytes was investigated in detail. XRD confirmed the perovskite structure of LaBaZrGdY, LaBaZrMnY, and LaBaZrCeY. FESEM micrographs confirmed dense microstructures for all synthesized materials at 1150 °C. Prominent crystal growth and densification were observed for LBZCeY synthesized with oxalic acid. FTIR confirmed the presence of functional groups related to perovskite materials. The highest conductivity of 0.21 S cm−1 and 0.18 S cm−1 was observed for LBZCeY synthesized by both methods. The electrochemical performance of LBZCeY prepared with spinach extract, and oxalic acid yielded a maximum power density of 0.35 W cm−2 and 0.61 W cm−2 at 600 °C, respectively.

However, establishing a good measuring system with well-defined interaction with the analyte is of challenge. It requires selection of special biological structures and methods for their deposition on various surfaces without losing biological properties. In this case, it is necessary to select the appropriate interactions that can be measured using techniques routinely used in the solid-state physics and applying of special procedures for the study of biological objects. It has been well established that a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) plays a key role in bio interface science.\n\nThe combination of QCM-D with other label-free methods like atomic force microscopy (AFM) or surface plasmon resonance (SPR) leads to the determination of several critical physicochemical parameters allowing the monitoring of biological systems at the interface. A great advantage of the above methods is conducting research in “in situ” conditions, which is of enormous importance in the case of biological systems. The kinetics of biomolecules adsorption and desorption can be determined, and consequently, both the association and dissociation constant of the system can be estimated, i.e., the system's parameters unattainable with other measurement methods. It should be emphasized that understanding model systems that are well-defined makes it possible to extrapolate knowledge to other systems with high application potential."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In these areas, climate neutral circular economy strategies to minimize human impact on the environment can be successfully applied. Among these strategies, treated wastewater reuse and retaining water in storage reservoirs deserve particular attention. This study aimed to determine if recycled water produced with two circular economy systems, namely membrane bioreactor treatment plant (MBR) with UV-light effluent disinfection and a storage reservoir, is safe enough for further use in green areas irrigation in summer and artificial snow production in winter. The assessment was based on the presence and concentration of antimicrobial agents, antibiotic resistant bacteria, antibiotic resistance genes, bacterial community composition and diversity. The treated water and wastewater was compared with natural water in their vicinity. Both systems fulfill the criteria set by the European Union in terms of reclaimed water suitable for reuse. Although the MBR/UV light wastewater treatment substantially reduced the numbers of E. coli and E. faecalis (from e.g. 32,000 CFU/100 ml to 20 CFU/100 ml and 15,000 CFU/100 ml to nearly 0 CFU/ml), bacteria resistant to ampicillin, aztreonam, cefepime, ceftazidime, ertapenem and tigecycline, as well as ESBL-positive and multidrug resistant E. coli were highly prevalent in MBR-treated wastewater (88.9 %, 55.6 %, 33.3 %, 22.2 % and 11.1 % and 44.4 and 55.6 %, respectively). Applying additional tertiary treatment technology is recommended. Retaining water in storage reservoirs nearly eliminated bacterial contaminants (e.g. E. coli dropped from 350 CFU/100 ml to 10 CFU/100 ml), antibiotic resistant bacteria, resistance genes (none detected in the storage reservoir) and antibiotics (only enrofloxacin detected once in the concentration of 3.20 ng/l). Findings of this study point to the limitations of solely culture-based assessment of reclaimed water and wastewater while they may prove useful in risk management and prevention in wastewater reuse."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709313878c28a0473a276b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

We present here the results of spectroscopic (electronic absorption and emission, circular dichroism, and electron paramagnetic resonance), spectroelectrochemical, and computational (based on density functional theory) investigations into the mechanism of pheophytin, a degradation that occurs in the presence of Cu ions and $O_{2}$. The processes leading to the formation of the linear form of tetrapyrrole are very complex and involve the weakening of the methine bridge due to an electron withdrawal by Cu(II) and the activation of $O_{2}$, which provides protection to the free ends of the opening macrocycle. These mechanistic insights are related to the naturally occurring damage to the photosynthetic apparatus of plants growing on metal-contaminated soils."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709316878c28a0473a2ade","5e709312878c28a0473a25fb","601137619543c74f831550a7","5e709313878c28a0473a27ae"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

Tybalt, and on plant resistance to seedling blight. Seed germination, α-amylase activity in seeds, morphology and infestation of seedlings by pathogens were assessed in a hydroponic treatment. Growth rate, PSII efficiency, heading and yield of the same plants were then analysed in pot culture. Results showed that the AgNPs and silver ions had a negative effect on roots, but reduced seedling blight and improved leaf area compared to the control. In addition, the AgNPs reduced with sodium borohydride in the presence of trisodium citrate at concentrations of 10 and 20 mg L−1 stimulated germination, α-amylase activity and shoot length, which was not observed in the case of silver ions and the AgNPs reduced with sodium hypophosphite in the presence of sodium hexametaphosphate. In a pot experiment, the AgNPs improved plant growth, PSII efficiency, accelerated heading and increased yield-related parameters compared with the control. Results revealed the interaction strength in the following order: TCSB-AgNPs > SHSH-AgNPs > silver ions.

This study aimed at the analysis of the effect of the silver shell thickness of nickel@silver core@shell (Ni@Ag) nanoparticles (NPs) on the fabrication and conductive properties of deposited coatings.\nMethods: The process of the synthesis of Ni@Ag NPs with various silver shell thicknesses was developed. The physicochemical properties (size, stability against aggregation process) of synthesized Ni@Ag nanoparticles were analyzed. The films based on ink containing Ni@Ag NPs with different silver shell thicknesses were fabricated and sintered in a temperature range of 120–300 °C and at times from 15 to 90 min. The dependence of their conductive properties on the applied temperature and time as well as silver shell thickness was evaluated.\nResults: Ni NPs were coated with 10, 20, 30, 35, 45, and 55 nm silver shell thickness. The resistivity of coatings based on obtained NPs depends on the thickness of the Ag shell and the sintering temperature. After sintering at 300 °C, the highest decrease in its value (at an optimal sintering time of 60 min) from about 100 μΩ·cm to 9 μΩ·cm was observed when the thickness of the shell increased from 10 to 55 nm. At the lowest sintering temperature (120 °C) the highest conductivity (about 50% of that for bulk nickel) was obtained for films based on Ni@Ag NPs with 45 and 55 nm of the silver shell thickness.\nDiscussions: The analysis of the resistivity of the sintered films showed that higher conductivity was obtained for the coatings formed from Ni@Ag NPs with the thicker Ag shell; moreover, thicker shells allowed a lowering of sintering temperature due to higher conductivity and a lower melting point of silver in comparison to nickel NPs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

For this purpose, a 7-month incubation experiment and two-year pot experiments were conducted. The pattern of both experiments was analogous and included: soil without fertilization (C); soil fertilized with NPK mineral fertilizers (MF); soil with NPK + 3 or 6% lignite (MF+CW3%, MF+CW6%) and 3% zeolite-carbon composite (NaX-C); soil with NPK + 3 or 6% leonardite (MF+CL3%, MF+CL6%) and 3% zeolite-carbon composite (NaX-C). The test plant in the pot experiment was the Kosynier variety of maize. The soil material was used to estimate the abundance of general bacteria, mold fungi, actinomycetes (actinomycetales), ammonification bacteria and bacteria from the Azotobacter genus. The study found that the application of lignite and leonardite combined with a NaXC composite had generally contributed to a significant increase in the total nitrogen content and a decrease in the total carbon content in soil in the pot experiment. In general, the mineral-organic mixtures had a stimulating effect on the analyzed groups of soil microorganisms in both experiments, but the dominant groups in the pot experiment were total bacteria and ammonifying bacteria, while in the incubation experiment, fungi and actinomycetes were the prevalent groups.

Significant differences between the selected AAS were observed. Moreover, the results obtained under equilibrium and dynamic conditions were remarkably different in terms of surface activity. The surface tension measurements (equilibrium conditions) indicated that the C12-ALA/C8OH mixture exhibits the highest synergistic effect. For the C12-LEU/C8OH system, a moderate synergism was observed, while for C12-PHE/C8OH, the effect was antagonistic. In contrast, in foamability experiments (dynamic conditions), all of the studied AAS/C8OH mixtures exhibited a spectacular synergistic effect at a wide concentration range. The observed effect was referred to as convection-activated surface activity of AAS/C8OH mixtures. The obtained experimental results were interpreted on the molecular level via all-atom detail molecular dynamics simulations (MD). The observed phenomenon was connected with the hydrogen bond-mediated aggregate formation in the bulk solution. Such aggregates act as reservoirs of surfactant molecules for supplementation of the adsorption coverage at the freshly formed liquid/gas interface. Additionally, the differences between the specific AAS were explained via the interplay of AAS–AAS and AAS-C8OH hydrogen bond affinities. The presented results showed an interesting example of a foaming system in which the surface activity can be controlled in situ via convection. This finding also significantly expands the range of potentially interesting molecules that can be used as efficient foaming additives and impacts the current understanding of the role of hydrogen bonding in designing of tuneable surfactant mixtures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

The repair process of DSBs is crucial to the maintenance of genomic integrity in all forms of life. However, the limitations of sensitivity and special resolution of analytical techniques make it difficult to investigate the local effects of chemotherapeutic drugs on DNA molecular structure. In this work, we exposed DNA to the anticancer antibiotic bleomycin (BLM), a damaging factor known to induce DSBs. We applied a multimodal approach combining (i) atomic force microscopy (AFM) for direct visualization of DSBs, (ii) surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to monitor local conformational transitions induced by DSBs, and (iii) multivariate statistical analysis to correlate the AFM and SERS results. On the basis of SERS results, we identified that bands at 1050 cm−1 and 730 cm−1 associated with backbone and nucleobase vibrations shifted and changed their intensities, indicating conformational modifications and strand ruptures. Based on averaged SERS spectra, the PLS regressions for the number of DSBs caused by corresponding molar concentrations of bleomycin were calculated. The strong correlation (R2 = 0.92 for LV = 2) between the predicted and observed number of DSBs indicates, that the model can not only predict the number of DSBs from the spectra but also detect the spectroscopic markers of DNA damage and the associated conformational changes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

These factors may lead to the formation of single- or double-strand breaks. Recently, an atomic force microscopy emerged as an attractive tool for determination of the length of DNA fragments deposited at surfaces, allowing quantification of double-strand breaks (DSBs). In spite of this, the length of objects provided via AFM is strictly related to the image spatial resolution, which in consequence leads to underestimation of DSBs quantity. To correct this deficiency, we provide here a novel methodology based on statistics of DNA fragments length. This approach allows for highly accurate determination of the DSBs number. Moreover, we provide the software that enables to automatically calculate the number of DSBs according to the described methodology. Finally, the method is applied for characterization of the DNA plasmid fragmentation by bleomycin - an anticancer chemotherapeutic drug."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709425878c28a0473b72aa","5e709312878c28a0473a253f","5e709316878c28a0473a2a5b","5e709313878c28a0473a27f0","5e709325878c28a0473a3a3b","5e709447878c28a0473b97c3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

A theoretical model enabling the characterization of the adsorption behavior and physicochemical properties of this type of biodegradable surfactants, based on molecular structure, would be beneficial for assessment of their usefulness in colloids and interface science in comparison with typical surface-active substances. In this paper, the adsorption behaviour of synthesized amino acid surfactants at the liquid/gas interface was analyzed experimentally (by surface tension measurements using two independent techniques) and theoretically by means of an elaborate model, considering the volume of the surfactant hydrophilic “head” and its ionization degree. It was shown that the adsorption behavior of the synthesized compounds can be successfully described by the proposed model, including the Helfand–Frisch–Lebowitz isotherm based on the equation of state of 2D hard disk-like particles, with molecular properties of surfactant particles obtained using molecular dynamics simulations (MDS). Model parameters allow for direct comparison of physicochemical properties of synthesized amino acid surfactants with other ionic and non-ionic surface-active substances. Furthermore, it was revealed that intermolecular hydrogen bonds allow the formation of surfactant dimers with high surface activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.
