They are probably the first attempts at exploring the issue included in the title. Already during his studies, the author conducted intensive study of the life and music of Józef Madeja (1892–1968). Having exceptional merit to the Polish school of clarinet, this musician was affiliated with Poznań between 1919 and 1968, apart from a break during the Second World War. Madeja was the first clarinettist in Poland to play concerts with orchestras as a soloist. His educational work had a truly pioneering character and was not limited to his being a  teacher of clarinet class. Madeja also conducted oboe and bassoon classes. As he was aware of a  lack of educational literature written in Polish, he wrote the first clarinet, oboe and bassoon methods. With time, he began composing solo and chamber pieces, concertos and even large-scale instrumental forms. Although Józef Madeja’s music had remained forgotten for many years, it is fascinating material for study today. The author of the paper founded in 2019 the Józef Madeja Association. This organization handles e.g. research on 20th-century Poznań composers, the music of its patron, and organizes a  festival named after him. The author of the paper has presented a number of times the music of Józef Madeja at national and international conferences and festivals, and is planning on recording a CD in the not-too-distant future. For the purposes of this work, queried was the music of composers connected with Poznań: Tadeusz Szeligowski, Tadeusz Zygfryd Kassern, Walerian Gniot, Jerzy Młodziejowski, Aleksander Szeligowski, Jan Astriab and Zdzisław Wysocki. In the paper, addressed was, moreover, the topic of Józef Madeja’s collaboration with other composers in order to add new works to the Polish clarinet repertoire. The clarinet music of the 20th-century Poznań composers, although partially forgotten, is fascinating material for research. In the music of the aforementioned composers, one may find a number of fine pieces, both solo and chamber, worthy of being performed in great concert halls. The author cherishes the hope that this paper will inspire the young musicians to familiarize themselves with the music of the 20th-century Poznań composers fading into oblivion today."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5b","uid":"bW6Ra7aqrppfAT4VXY3YtpQ","uuid":"ef468625-bba7-4557-8b5b-d6caea8d296c","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.

Its main focus is to recognize the distinction between the collections aimed for the musical amateurs and those created for the professional musicians of the time. However, between those two quite unique groups, one may notice certain similarities, which are also highlighted and discussed by the author of this article. It seems that the 18th-century fashion for arranging the most popular songs, airs, concertos and sonatas for keyboard instruments created a wide and diverse group of transcriptions, which today are mostly forgotten. Among the names of the composers whose works were transcribed for mostly harpsichord and organ are: Georg Friedrich Händel, Francesco Geminiani, Arcangelo Corelli, Charles Avison and many others. These transcriptions present many technical difficulties for potential performers, but they also raise many questions, which (if answered) can provide us with valuable clues about the musicians, and their practice, from the past. This article attempts to find answers to some of those questions and to describe the most interesting and important features of those pieces. Its main goal is to bring back this forgotten repertoire and potentially encourage modern musicians to include it in their performances."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5b","uid":"bW6Ra7aqrppfAT4VXY3YtpQ","uuid":"ef468625-bba7-4557-8b5b-d6caea8d296c","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.

An Attempt to Analyse the Artistic Interpretation and Characteristic Features of the Pianist’s Performance"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Is a set of recordings of works by a given composer performed by one artist artistically justified? Creators would usually writ their works for many years, search, perfect themselves, their workshop and musical language. The works and their form were refined, and the range of means used broadened. Is it possible for a pianist to fully reflect the complexity of these processes in the course of several months or years of recording, to mature together with the works recorded? With a certain bitterness one has to admit that this happens extremely rarely, and may concern (although not always; see, for example, the complete Mozart concertos performed by Murray Perahia) the greatest of the ... greatest. These are few and far between. And they usually do not make repetitive recordings, but focus on the works that they like, love and have carried inside them for years. They have become a part of themselves, hence the full identification of the performer with the performed work. Finding such interpretations/creations is accompanied by great joy and happiness from the possibility of communing with music, if not in a congenial, then in an outstanding performance. Certainly in the case of Karol Szymanowski’s complete piano works these are the interpretations of Jerzy Godziszewski. The artist ‘nurtured’ them for a very long time and, in the first half of the 1980s, he performed the complete set during a series of recitals presented in various centres. Between 1993 and 1997 he recorded them on four CDs (Polskie Radio PRCD 1261–1264, released in 1998, winning a ‘Fryderyk’ award). The tone of his interpretation may not be too optimistic, as his use of dark, saturated colours gravitates towards melancholy or even decadence. This is a beautiful, deep, ‘cloudy’ interpretation of Szymanowski’s work."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5b","uid":"bW6Ra7aqrppfAT4VXY3YtpQ","uuid":"ef468625-bba7-4557-8b5b-d6caea8d296c","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.

The author tries to argue with Wilfrid Mellers’s opinion voiced in his book François Couperin and the French Classical Tradition criticizing all pieces for harpsichord from the late baroque period. Wilfrid Mellers calls the last French harpsichordists the musical Bouchers, referring to the name of the famous and controversial roccoco painter François Boucher. The author identifies and analyses selected elements of these compositions which may prove or disprove the Mellers’ hypothesis. She gives the historical context and tries to explain the natural changes and innovations that formed the style of the keyboard music in the second half of the 18th century. In the article one may find references to the visual arts and their most famous creators, e.g. Antoine Watteau or Peter-Paul Rubens, as well as references to the applied art from the roccoco period. The article analyses the musical form, melody, harmony, ornamentation and pedagogical aspects that may be observed in the harpsichord compositions from this period and written by the last generation of the French harpsichordists. The author puts a new perspective on those well-known composers and their works to give a better understanding of their value and importance in the history of music."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5b","uid":"bW6Ra7aqrppfAT4VXY3YtpQ","uuid":"ef468625-bba7-4557-8b5b-d6caea8d296c","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.

Distance learning was implemented in schools, and its implementation took various forms. Teachers faced the challenge of searching for new, previously unused teaching e-tools. Music education, which is a distinct part of education, was placed in an unusual situation: lack of physical and direct contact with the class. The limitations and unequal access to e-educational tools among students and teachers have become an impulse for research in the field of didactics. Many applications, programs and websites devoted to music education, created before and during the pandemic, can also be successfully used during on-site teaching, becoming an interesting and useful variety of music classes. The aim of the article is to indicate the pedagogical tools used in distance music education. It presents selected platforms, programs and applications to implement the assumptions of online music education."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5b","uid":"bW6Ra7aqrppfAT4VXY3YtpQ","uuid":"ef468625-bba7-4557-8b5b-d6caea8d296c","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.
