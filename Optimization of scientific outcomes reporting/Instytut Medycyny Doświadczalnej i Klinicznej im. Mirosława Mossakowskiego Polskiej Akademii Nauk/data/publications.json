Methods based on the structure analysis provide more complete\ninformation on residue conservation in evolutionary processes. This is crucial for the determination of evolutionary\nrelationships between proteins and for the identification of recurrent structural patterns present in biomolecules\ninvolved in similar functions. However, algorithmic structural alignment is much more difficult than multiple sequence\nalignment. This study is devoted to the development and applications of DAMA—a novel effective environment\ncapable to compute and analyze multiple structure alignments.\nResults: DAMA is based on local structural similarities, using local 3D structure descriptors and thus accounts for\nnearest-neighbor molecular environments of aligned residues. It is constrained neither by protein topology nor by\nits global structure. DAMA is an extension of our previous study (DEDAL) which demonstrated the applicability of\nlocal descriptors to pairwise alignment problems. Since the multiple alignment problem is NP-complete, an effective\nheuristic approach has been developed without imposing any artificial constraints. The alignment algorithm\nsearches for the largest, consistent ensemble of similar descriptors. The new method is capable to capture most of\nthe biologically significant similarities present in canonical test sets and is discriminatory enough to prevent the\nemergence of larger, but meaningless, solutions. Tests performed on the test sets, including protein kinases, demonstrate\nDAMA’s capability of identifying equivalent residues, which should be very useful in discovering the biological\nnature of proteins similarity. Performance profiles show the advantage of DAMA over other methods, in particular\nwhen using a strict similarity measure QC, which is the ratio of correctly aligned columns, and when applying\nthe methods to more difficult cases.\nAvailability and implementation: DAMA is available online at http://dworkowa.imdik.pan.pl/EP/DAMA. Linux\nbinaries of the software are available upon request."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In the crystal structure, dimers of anion-cation pairs stabilized by H-bonding and ionic interactions. Some less common interaction types, like C=N···C-NH3+ (σ-hole) interactions, hydrazone–aromatic interactions and dispersive contacts of the CF3 groups are also present in the crystal. Satisfactory reproduction of the solid state IR and VCD spectra required that quantum-chemical calculations be done on a tetramer (four cation-anion pairs) cut out from the crystal structure, exhibiting key intermolecular interactions. Ten DFT functionals were assessed as to the agreement between the calculated and experimental spectra. Various approaches to scaling of the calculated frequencies were applied. The best results were yielded with individual (optimized) frequency scaling factors (FSFs) and band half-widths at half maximum-(HWHM) for four separate spectral subregions. The best matching between the experimental and theoretical spectra (according to SimIR, SimVCD and SimVDF indices) was found for the B3PW91 functional, however, a few other functionals follow closely in the ranking.

subjective cognitive decline (SCD) associated with amyloid positivity is limited.\n\nMethods\nIn 1640 persons with SCD from 20 Amyloid Biomarker Study cohort, we investigated the associations of SCD-specific characteristics (informant confirmation, domain-specific complaints, concerns, feelings of worse performance) demographics, setting, apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) ε4 carriership, and neuropsychiatric symptoms with amyloid positivity.\n\nResults\nBetween cohorts, amyloid positivity in 70-year-olds varied from 10% to 76%. Only older age, clinical setting, and APOE ε4 carriership showed univariate associations with increased amyloid positivity. After adjusting for these, lower education was also associated with increased amyloid positivity.

In this context, manganese (Mn2+)-based nanoparticles have been greatly investigated, due to their valuable use as a contrast agent, improving signal intensity and specificity in MRI (manganese-enhanced MRI, MEMRI). Additionally, Mn2+ can act as scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), commonly present in the inflammatory processes of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of the present study was to develop nanoreactors, which can be used as contrast-agent in MEMRI. Several blends of methacrylated gellan gum (GG-MA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were embedded with different types of manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles and further physico-chemically characterized. Dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, water uptake and degradation studies were performed. In vitro cytotoxicity of the different formulations was also evaluated using an immortalized rat fibroblast cell line L929, up to 72 h of culturing. Synthesized nanoparticles were obtained with an average size of 70 nm and round-shaped morphology. The stability of the different formulations of hydrogels was not affected by nanoparticles' concentration or HA ratio. The presence of synthesized MnO2 (MnO2_S) nanoparticles reduced hydrogels' cytocompatibility, whereas the commercially available type 1 (MnO2_C1) nanoparticles were less toxic to cells. Additionally, cell proliferation and viability were enhanced when a lower content of HA was present. Higher concentrations (75 and 100 ng/mL) of MnO2_S and MnO2_C1 nanoparticles did not negatively affected cell viability, whereas the opposite effect was observed for the commercial type 2 (MnO2_C2) nanoparticles. Further studies are required to evaluate the potential application of the most promising nanoreactors' formulations for combined application in MEMRI and as ROS scavengers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Growing evidence suggests that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is linked to glioma pathogenesis, although it is still unclear whether it is a cause or an effect of this process. Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs), a family of six antioxidant proteins, may promote or inhibit carcinogenesis, depending on the tumor type and stage. The current knowledge on their expression, regulation and functions in glioma is scarce. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of PRDXs expression in distinct glioma subtypes and non-tumor brain tissues was conducted using gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), REpository for Molecular BRAin NeoplasiaDaTa (REMBRANDT), The Chinese Glioma Atlas (CGGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. The association between gene expression and patient survival was investigated. DNA methylation, mutations, copy number alterations of deregulated PRDXs as well as the correlation between gene expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were assessed. The analysis revealed overexpression of PRDX1, PRDX4, and PRDX6 in most histological glioma types compared to the non-tumor tissues, while PRDX2, PRDX3 and PRDX5 expression remained unaltered. The expression of PRDX4 and PRDX6 was higher in mesenchymal than proneural and classical glioma subtypes. Moreover, lower expression of PRDX1, PRDX4 and PRDX6 was observed in tumors with a glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) compared to non-G-CIMP tumors, as well as in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant and 1p/19q co-deleted gliomas compared to the wild-type counterparts. High expression of PRDX1, PRDX4 or PRDX6 correlated with poor survival of glioma patients. PRDX1 and PRDX6 displayed a positive correlation with different immune cell population in low grade gliomas and, to a lesser extent, in glioblastoma. PRDX1 expression exhibited negative correlation with DNA methylation. These results indicate that high expression of PRDX1, PRDX4 and PRDX6 is associated with poor outcome in gliomas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

ALF may result in a spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms that encompasses cognitive impairment, coma, and often death, collectively defined as acute hepatic encephalopathy.

Our systematic literature review based on the last decade’s reports involving a total of 852 ALF patients, determined 205 altered circulating miRNAs, of which 25 miRNAs were altered in the blood, regardless of study design and methodology. Selected 25 miRNAs, emerging predominantly from the analyses of samples obtained from acetaminophen overdosed patients, represent the most promising biomarker candidates for a diagnostic panel for symptomatic ALF. We discussed the role of selected miRNAs in the context of tissue-specific origin and its possible regulatory role for molecular pathways involved in blood–brain barrier function. The defined several common pathways for 15 differently altered miRNAs were relevant to cellular community processes, indicating loss of intercellular, structural, and functional components, which may result in blood-brain barrier impairment and brain dysfunction. However, a causational relationship between circulating miRNAs differential expression, and particular clinical features of ALF, has to be demonstrated in a further study."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

PGC-1α is implicated in the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative disorders; therefore, a deep understanding of its functioning in the nervous system may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. The central nervous system (CNS)-specific isoforms of PGC-1α have been recently identified, and many functions of PGC-1α are assigned to the particular cell types of the central nervous system. In the mice CNS, deficiency of PGC-1α disturbed viability and functioning of interneurons and dopaminergic neurons, followed by alterations in inhibitory signaling and behavioral dysfunction. Furthermore, in the ALS rodent model, PGC-1α protects upper motoneurons from neurodegeneration. PGC-1α is engaged in the generation of neuromuscular junctions by lower motoneurons, protection of photoreceptors, and reduction in oxidative stress in sensory neurons. Furthermore, in the glial cells, PGC-1α is essential for the maturation and proliferation of astrocytes, myelination by oligodendrocytes, and mitophagy and autophagy of microglia. PGC-1α is also necessary for synaptogenesis in the developing brain and the generation and maintenance of synapses in postnatal life.

So far, the radiopharmaceuticals used in this approach have been based on the endogenous agonist of NK1R, Substance P or on its close analogues. Herein, we used a well-known, small molecular NK1R antagonist, L732,138, as the basis for the radiopharmaceutical vector. First, 14 analogues of this compound were evaluated to check whether extending the parent structure with linkers of different lengths would not deteriorate the NK1R binding. The tested analogues had affinity similar to or better than the parent compound, and none of the linkers had a negative impact on the binding. Next, five DOTA conjugates were synthesized and used for labelling with 68Ga and 177Lu. The obtained radioconjugates turned out to be fairly lipophilic but showed rather limited stability in human plasma. Evaluation of the receptor affinity of the (radio)conjugates showed that neither the chelator nor the metal negatively impacts the NK1R binding. The 177Lu-radioconjugates exhibited the binding characteristics towards NK1R similar or better than that of the 177Lu-labelled derivative of Substance P, which is in current clinical use. The experimental results presented herein, along with their structural rationalization provided by modelling, give insight for the further molecular design of small molecular NK1R-targeting vectors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Society of Cardiology: cardiovascular disease statistics 2021","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aims This report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas Project updates and expands upon the widely cited 2019 report in presenting cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics for the 57 ESC member countries. Methods and results Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, left-sided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are similar to 30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures. Conclusion Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be met across ESC member countries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

neurological disorders. However, to date, its effectiveness remains unsatisfactory due to low precision and efficacy of cell delivery; poor survival of transplanted cells; and inadequate monitoring of their fate in vivo. Fortunately, different bio-scaffolds have been proposed as cell carriers to improve the accuracy of cell delivery, survival, differentiation, and controlled release of embedded stem cells. The goal of our study was to establish hydrogel scaffolds suitable for stem cell delivery that also allow non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We focused on alginate-based hydrogels due to their natural origin, biocompatibility, resemblance to the extracellular matrix, and easy manipulation of gelation processes. We optimized the properties of alginate-based hydrogels, turning them into suitable carriers for transplanted cells. Human adipose-derived stem cells embedded in these hydrogels survived for at least 14 days in vitro. Alginate-based hydrogels were also modified successfully to allow their injectability via a needle.

At present, based on a comprehensive evaluation of existing and contemporary studies, important questions arise regarding the causal role of amyloid and tau protein in the pathogenesis of AD (Morris et al., 2018). Analyzes of the available evidence does not allow obvious conclusion that amyloid, and especially tau protein, plays a key role in the etiology of AD (Morris et al., 2018). Evaluation of new data shows that accumulation of amyloid and altered tau protein is not the main cause of AD and more research is needed (Morris et al., 2018). As for the two substances planted to contribute to the development of AD, recent data indicate that the changes of amyloid and tau protein level and structure is triggered by some as yet unspecified factors, and then the triggered amyloid and tau protein interact with each other, exerting synergistic toxic effects on neurons and damaged neurons initiate the development of AD (Morris et al., 2018). It is certain that the pathology of amyloid and tau protein is currently ruled out as the sole cause of the development of dementia, as it cannot explain why about half of the world’s population have accumulation of different kinds of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the absence of dementia (Atlante et al., 2020). In these people, it was observed that the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles increased exponentially with age (Atlante et al., 2020). In addition, it was noted that the appearance of hippocampus atrophy in elderly people with normal cognitive performance was not dependent on the presence of level and structure of amyloid (Atlante et al., 2020). Moreover, a multicenter study found that in patients diagnosed with AD, about one-third of the cases had no brain amyloid (Atlante et al., 2020)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Society of Cardiology: cardiovascular disease statistics 2021: Executive Summary","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aims\nThis report from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Atlas Project updates and expands upon the widely cited 2019 report in presenting cardiovascular disease (CVD) statistics for the 57 ESC member countries.\n\nMethods and results\nStatistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, leftsided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are ∼30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures.\n\nConclusion\nRisk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be met across ESC member countries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Cyclin D2 knockout (cD2-KO) mice exhibit reduced numbers of new hippocampal neurons; however, the proliferation deficiency and the dysregulation of adult neurogenesis in the SVZ required further investigation. In this report, we characterized the differentiation potential of each subpopulation of the SVZ neural precursors in cD2-KO mice. The number of newly generated cells in the SVZs was significantly decreased in cD2-KO mice compared to wild type mice (WT), and was not accompanied by elevated levels of apoptosis. Although the number of B1-type quiescent precursors (B1q) and the overall B1-type activated precursors (B1a) were not affected in the SVZ neurogenic niche, the number of transit-amplifying progenitors (TaPs) was significantly reduced. Additionally, the subpopulations of calbindin D28k and calretinin interneurons were diminished in the olfactory bulbs of cD2-KO mice. Our results suggest that cyclin D2 might be critical for the proliferation of neural precursors and progenitors in the SVZ-the transition of B1a into TaPs and, thereafter, the production of newly generated interneurons in the olfactory bulbs. Untangling regulators that functionally modulate adult neurogenesis provides a basis for the development of regenerative therapies for injuries and neurodegenerative diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

Platelets are the reservoir of transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-β1), a multipotent cytokine involved in the maintenance of, i.a., central nervous system homeostasis. Here, we analyzed the effect of a decrease in TGF-β1 active form on synaptic proteins levels, and brain electrophysiology, in mice after intraperitoneal (ip) administration of TGF-β1 antibody (anti-TGF-β1; 1 mg/mL). Next, we correlated it with a thrombocytopenia-induced TGF-β1 decrease, documented in an azoxymethane-induced (AOM; 100 mM ip) model of ALF, and clarified the impact of TGF-β1 decrease on blood–brain barrier functionality. The increase of both synaptophysin and synaptotagmin in the cytosolic fraction, and its reduction in a membrane fraction, were confirmed in the AOM mice brains. Both proteins’ decrease in analyzed fractions occurred in anti-TGF-β1 mice. In turn, an increase in postsynaptic (NR1 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, postsynaptic density protein 95, gephyrin) proteins in the AOM brain cortex, but a selective compensatory increase of NR1 subunit in anti-TGF-β mice, was observed. The alterations of synaptic proteins levels were not translated on electrophysiological parameters in the anti-TGF-β1 model. The results suggest the impairment of synaptic vesicles docking to the postsynaptic membrane in the AOM model. Nevertheless, changes in synaptic protein level in the anti-TGF-β1 mice do not affect neurotransmission and may not contribute to neurologic deficits in AOM mice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, it requires the development of unified protocols for both safe and efficient cell acquisition and clinical usage. The therapeutic effect of fat grafts (containing stem cells) in non-healing wounds has been discussed in previous studies, although the application requires local or general anaesthesia. The treatment of MSC derived from adipose tissue (ASC) could be a less invasive method, and efficient delivery could lead to more favourable outcomes, which should encourage clinicians to use such therapeutic approaches more frequently. Therefore, the aim of this study was to optimise the methods of ASC isolation, culture and administration while maintaining their high survival, proliferation and colonisation potential. The ASC were isolated by an enzymatic method and were characterised according to International Society for Cellular Therapy and International Federation for Adipose Therapeutics and Science guidelines. To assess the opportunity to obtain a sufficient number of cells for transplantation, long-term cell cultures in two oxygen concentrations (5% vs. 21%) were conducted. For these cultures, the population doubling time, the cumulative time for cell population doublings and the rate of cell senescence were estimated. In a developed and pre-defined protocol, ASC can be efficiently cultured at physiological oxygen concentrations (5%), which leads to faster proliferation and slower cell senescence. Subsequently, to select the optimal and minimally invasive methods of ASC transplantation, direct cell application with an irrigator or with skin dressings was analysed. Our results confirmed that both the presented methods of cell application allow for the safe delivery of isolated ASC into wounds without losing their vitality. Cells propagated in the described conditions and applied in non-invasive cell application (with an irrigation system and dressings) to treat chronic wounds can be a potential alternative or supplement to more invasive clinical approaches."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Among CK2 inhibitors, benzimidazole and isothiourea derivatives hold a dominant position. While targeting glioma tumour cells, they show limited toxicity towards normal cells. Research in recent years has shown that these compounds can be suitable as components of combined therapies with hyperbaric oxygenation. Such a combination increases the susceptibility of glioma tumour cells to cell death via apoptosis. Moreover, researchers planning on using any other antiglioma investigational pharmaceutics may want to consider using these agents in combination with CK2 inhibitors. However, different compounds are not equally effective when in such combination. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of treatment and optimize the treatment regimen. In addition, the role of CK2 in gliomagenesis and maintenance seems to have been challenged recently, as some compounds structurally similar to CK2 inhibitors do not inhibit CK2 while still being effective at reducing glioma viability and invasion. Furthermore, some newly developed inhibitors specific for CK2 do not appear to have strong anticancer properties. Further experimental and clinical studies of these inhibitors and combined therapies are warranted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Accordingly, multifunctional biomimetic, biocompatible, and stimuli-responsive materials based on hydrogels have attracted much interest. Within this framework, the design of nanostructured materials that do not require any external energy source is beneficial for developing a platform for sensing glucose in body fluids. In this article, we report the realization and application of an innovative platform consisting of two outer layers of a nanocomposite plasmonic hydrogel plus one inner layer of electrospun mat fabricated by electrospinning, where the outer layers exploit photoinitiated free radical polymerization, obtaining a compact and stable device. Inspired by the exceptional features of chameleon skin, plasmonic silver nanocubes are embedded into a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-based hydrogel network to obtain enhanced thermoresponsive and antibacterial properties. The introduction of an electrospun mat creates a compatible environment for the homogeneous hydrogel coating while imparting excellent mechanical and structural properties to the final system. Chemical, morphological, and optical characterizations were performed to investigate the structure of the layers and the multifunctional platform. The synergetic effect of the nanostructured system’s photothermal responsivity and antibacterial properties was evaluated. The sensing features associated with the optical properties of silver nanocubes revealed that the proposed multifunctional system is a promising candidate for glucose-sensing applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The studies with lymphoscintigraphy (LSC) and magnetic resonance (MR) lymphography show altered transport index and enlarged lymphatic vessels (LVs). Our studies aimed to investigate the superficial lymph flow, water accumulation, skin and subcutaneous tissue elasticity, and the possibility of using this information to diagnose lipedema.Methods and Results: Fifty patients with lipedema and 50 control subjects (women) were included. The Indocyanine Green (ICG) lymphography, LSC, skin water measurement, skin durometry, and deep tissue tonometry were done in all participants. ICG lymphography revealed: (1) Slower lymph flow in lipedema patients; after 3 minutes of feet movement in a horizontal position, the ICG-dyed lymph reached the upper calf level in 8% of lipedema patients compared with 56% in the control group (p < 0.0001). (2) More than three LVs were noticed more often in lipedema patients. (3) The higher number of abnormal LV images at all limb levels and during each observation stage with a statistically significant number of foggy and dilated. (4) Statistically significant higher fluorescent intensity in all limb levels. Skin water concentration was higher in the feet in lipedema (p = 0.000189).Conclusion: Our studies have shown the differences in superficial lymph flow and water concentration between lipedema and normal limbs. Data proove the usefulness of ICG lymphography, skin water concentration and skin and subcutaneous tissue elasticity measurements in diagnosing lipedema."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The response of major cell subpopulations in the draining lymph nodes to skin infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis was assessed using the rat model. After massive subepidermal infection, a cytometric evaluation showed an increase in cytotoxic and helper T lymphocytes and major subpopulations of the innate immune response. Three weeks later, signs of inflammation reduction with an increase in the content of memory T helper lymphocytes and effector memory T cytotoxic lymphocytes were observed. After skin re-infection, a rapid response of cytotoxic, helper, and memory T lymphocytes, memory B lymphocytes and plasmablasts, and macrophages was detected. In addition, a reduction in the number of naïve B lymphocytes, activated MHC class II+ cells, and some cells of the innate immune system was observed. T regulatory lymphocyte response after the initial and secondary S. epidermidis skin infection was not detected. The morphometric evaluation showed significant changes in the main cell subpopulations in each functional zone of the node and then confirmed the efficient elimination of the administered antigen, as evidenced by the observations on day 28. Notably, after re-infection, the cellular response did not exceed the level after the initial infection and was reduced in many cell subpopulations. Understanding how the lymph nodes eliminate S. epidermidis can provide valuable insights into creating immunological therapies against infections with saprophytes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Therefore, this study aimed at assessing changes in the transcriptional activity of estrogen receptor (ER) α and β genes (ESR1 and ESR2, respectively) in the adipose tissues of obese individuals before and after weight loss and verifying whether epigenetic mechanisms were involved in this phenomenon. ESR1 and ESR2 mRNA and miRNA levels were evaluated using real-time PCR in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of 78 obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2) and 31 normal-weight (BMI = 20–24.9 kg/m2) individuals and in 19 SAT samples from post-bariatric patients. ESR1 and ESR2 methylation status was studied using the methylation-sensitive digestion/real-time PCR method. Obesity was associated with a decrease in mRNA levels of both ERs in SAT (p < 0.0001) and ESR2 in VAT (p = 0.0001), while weight loss increased ESR transcription (p < 0.0001). Methylation levels of ESR1 and ESR2 promoters were unaffected. However, ESR1 mRNA in the AT of obese subjects correlated negatively with the expression of hsa-miR-18a-5p (rs = −0.444), hsa-miR-18b-5p (rs = −0.329), hsa-miR-22-3p (rs = −0.413), hsa-miR-100-5p (rs = −0.371), and hsa-miR-143-5p (rs = −0.289), while the expression of ESR2 in VAT correlated negatively with hsa-miR-576-5p (rs = −0.353) and in SAT with hsa-miR-495-3p (rs = −0.308). In conclusion, obesity-associated downregulation of ER mRNA levels in adipose tissue may result from miRNA interference."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Neurons of patients with genetic neurodegenerative diseases often exhibit mitochondrial fragmentation, reflecting an imbalance in mitochondrial fusion and fission (mitochondrial dysdynamism). Charcot–Marie–Tooth (CMT) disease type 2A is the prototypical disorder of impaired mitochondrial fusion caused by mutations in the fusion protein mitofusin (MFN)2. Yet, cultured CMT2A patient fibroblast mitochondria are often reported as morphologically normal. Metabolic stress might evoke pathological mitochondrial phenotypes in cultured patient fibroblasts, providing a platform for the pre-clinical individualized evaluation of investigational therapeutics. Here, substitution of galactose for glucose in culture media was used to redirect CMT2A patient fibroblasts (MFN2 T105M, R274W, H361Y, R364W) from glycolytic metabolism to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, which provoked characteristic mitochondrial fragmentation and depolarization and induced a distinct transcriptional signature. Pharmacological MFN activation of metabolically reprogrammed fibroblasts partially reversed the mitochondrial abnormalities in CMT2A and CMT1 and a subset of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease patients, implicating addressable mitochondrial dysdynamism in these illnesses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In many of papers devoted to this compound, NAT is referenced to as an ‘NK1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist’ or a ‘substance P (SP) antagonist’. Some of the studies treated NAT as a tool compound to interrogate NK1R function in a particular condition. Surprisingly however, no biochemical data on NAT/NK1R interaction have been available. On testing NAT in radioligand receptor binding assay, we found that this compound displays no significant binding to either human or rat NK1R up to millimolar concentrations. In light of this, the repeated claim of NAT being NK1R antagonist is an error. The use of NAT as a tool compound in NK1R-related studies should be discontinued. Some of the conclusions regarding the involvement of SP/NK1R axis in acute CNS injury or neurodegenerative diseases may then require careful rethinking. On the other hand, given interesting neuroprotective properties of NAT, the issue whether it acts by specific interactions with some molecular target or by unspecific physicochemical mechanisms needs be investigated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of group II mGlu receptors activation after experimental birth asphyxia (hypoxia-ischemia) on the expression of factors involved in apoptosis and neuroprotective neurotrophins. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) on 7-day-old rats was used as an experimental model. The effects of intraperitoneal application of mGluR2 agonist LY379268 (5 mg/kg) and the specific mGluR3 agonist NAAG (5 mg/kg) (1 h or 6 h after HI) on apoptotic processes and initiation of the neuroprotective mechanism were investigated. LY379268 and NAAG applied shortly after HI prevented brain damage and significantly decreased pro-apoptotic Bax and HtrA2/Omi expression, increasing expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. NAAG or LY379268 applied at both times also decreased HIF-1α formation. HI caused a significant decrease in BDNF concentration, which was restored after LY379268 or NAAG administration. HI-induced increase in GDNF concentration was decreased after administration of LY379268 or NAAG. Our results show that activation of mGluR2/3 receptors shortly after HI prevents brain damage by the inhibition of excessive glutamate release and apoptotic damage decrease. mGluR2 and mGluR3 agonists produced comparable results, indicating that both receptors may be a potential target for early treatment in neonatal HI."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

A glutamatergic system dysfunction has been reported to be implicated in the pathomechanism of AD. Therefore, in the current study we characterized the transcriptional profile of glutamate-related genes in transgenic AbPP V717I (TgAD) and sporadic (SAD, streptozotocin-induced) models of AD. Genes encoding glutamate membrane-bound (GLAST, GLT1, EAAC1) and vesicular (VGLUT1-3) transporters as well as ionotropic (AMPA, NMDA) and metabotropic (mGluR3, mGluR5) receptors were analysed. Based on qPCR analysis, we observed a discrepancy between TgAD and SAD mice in the profile of targeted genes. We noticed age-dependent upregulation of genes encoding VGLUT1, NMDAR1 and mGluR3 in 12-month-old TgAD mice. In the SAD model upregulation of genes encoding AMPAR1 and NMDAR1 as well as downregulation of GLAST, VGLUT3 and mGluR5 were found. Next, the effect of fingolimod (FTY720) was indicated. In the TgAD model, the drug reversed altered transcription of the mGluR3 glutamate receptor to the control level, whereas in the SAD model it downregulated the genes encoding VGLUT1, AMPAR2 and mGluR3. Interestingly, FTY720 influenced mGluR3 mRNA in both examined models.

The unique behavioral and metabolic characteristics of smokers with type 2 diabetes warrants a randomized clinical trial of the smoking cessation drug varenicline.\n\nOBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of varenicline in patients with type 2 diabetes with an intention to quit smoking.\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial recruited patients from 6 outpatient clinics in 5 hospitals in Catania, Italy. Patients with type 2 diabetes, who were smoking at least 10 cigarettes a day, and who intended to quit smoking were screened for eligibility. Eligible patients were randomized to either varenicline or placebo treatment. The trial consisted of a 12-week treatment phase followed by a 40-week follow-up, nontreatment phase. Intention-to-treat data analysis was performed from December 2020 to April 2021.\n\nINTERVENTIONS Varenicline, 1 mg, twice daily or matched placebo administered for 12 weeks. Patients in both treatment groups also received smoking cessation counseling.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy end point of the study was the continuous abstinence rate (CAR) at weeks 9 to 24. Secondary efficacy end points were the CAR at weeks 9 to 12 and weeks 9 to 52 as well as 7-day point prevalence of abstinence at weeks 12, 24, and 52.\n\nRESULTS A total of 300 patients (mean [SD] age, 57.4 [0.8] years; 117 men [78.0%] in varenicline group and 119 men [79.3%] in placebo group) were randomized to receive varenicline (n = 150) or placebo (n = 150). The CAR at weeks 9 to 24 was significantly higher for the varenicline than placebo group (24.0% vs 6.0%; odds ratio [OR], 4.95; 95% CI, 2.29-10.70; P < .001). The CARS at weeks 9 to 12 (31.3% vs 7.3%; OR. 5.77; 95% CI, 2.85-11.66; P < .001) and weeks 9 to 52 (18.7% vs 5.3%; OR. 4.07; 95% CI, 1.79-9.27; P < .001) as well as the 7-day point prevalence of abstinence at weeks 12, 24, and 52 were also significantly higher for the varenicline vs placebo group. The most frequent adverse events occurring in the varenicline group compared with the placebo group were nausea (41[27.3%] vs 17 [11.4%]), insomnia (29 [19.4%] vs 19 [12.7%]). abnormal dreams (19 [12.7%] vs 5 [3.4%]). anxiety (17 [11.4%] vs 11 [7.3%]), and irritability (14 [9.4%] vs 8 [5.4%]). Serious adverse events were infrequent in both groups and not treatment-related.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this trial showed that inclusion of varenicline in a smoking cessation program is efficacious in achieving long-term abstinence without serious adverse events. Varenicline should be routinely used in diabetes education programs to help patients with type 2 diabetes stop smoking."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Increased oxidative stress has been identified in glioma cells, in particular in glioma stem-like cells. Studies have shown that these cells harbor potent antioxidant defenses, although endogenous protection against nitrosative stress remains understudied. The enhancement of oxidative or nitrosative stress offers a potential target for triggering glioma cell death, but whether oxidative and nitrosative stresses can be combined for therapeutic effects requires further research. The optimal approach of harnessing oxidative stress for anti-glioma therapy should include the induction of free radical-induced oxidative damage and the suppression of antioxidant defense mechanisms selectively in glioma cells. However, selective induction of oxidative/nitrosative stress in glioma cells remains a therapeutic challenge, and research into selective drug delivery systems is ongoing. Because of multifactorial mechanisms of glioma growth, progression, and invasion, prospective oncological therapies may include not only therapeutic oxidative/nitrosative stress but also inhibition of oncogenic kinases, antioxidant molecules, and programmed cell death mediators."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Substitution of aspartic acid for neutral asparagine at position 5 of MLCFpep dramatically enhanced its\nability to stimulate S1-induced polymerization and enabled it to initiate polymerization of G-actin in the absence\nof S1.\nConclusions: These and other results presented in this work suggest that the modulation of myosin motor activity\nby N-terminal ELC peptides is exerted through a change in actin filament conformation rather than through\nblocking the A1 ELC-actin interaction.\nGeneral significance: The results imply the possibility of enhancing therapeutic effects of these peptides by\nmodifications of their sequence."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

It is generally well accepted that smoking enhances the harmful effects of elevated blood glucose levels, accelerating the vascular damage seen in patients with diabetes. Smoking cessation has clear benefits in terms of reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, there is less evidence for the impact of smoking cessation on other diabetes-related complications. Studies in people with diabetes have shown improvement as well as temporary deterioration in glycemic control after ceasing smoking. Only a few studies have described the effect of quitting smoking on insulin resistance and lipid parameters, however, their results have been inconclusive. In this situation, healthcare professionals should not assume that cessation of smoking will improve metabolic parameters in patients with diabetes. It seems they should, first of all, emphasize the prevention of weight gain that may be associated with quitting smoking. The lack of data regarding the metabolic effects of smoking and smoking cessation in diabetes is very disappointing and this area needs to be addressed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The aim of this study was to compare PPG increments in Asian versus non-Asian adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), who were insulin-naïve or insulin-experienced, from the phase 3 insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) clinical trials.\nMethods\n\nThis was a post hoc analysis of data from 13 phase 3, randomised, parallel-group, open-label IDegAsp trials in patients with T2D. The pooled baseline clinical data were analysed for insulin-naïve and insulin-experienced groups; and each group was split into subgroups of Asian and non-Asian patients, respectively, and analysed accordingly. Baseline self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values at breakfast, lunch and the evening meal (before and 90 min after each meal) were used to assess PPG increments. The estimated differences in baseline SMBG increment between the Asian and non-Asian subgroups were analysed.\nResults\n\nClinical data from 4750 participants (insulin-naïve, n = 1495; insulin-experienced, n = 3255) were evaluated. In the insulin-naïve group, the postprandial SMBG increment was significantly greater in the Asian versus the non-Asian subgroup at breakfast (estimated difference 28.67 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval [CI] 18.35, 38.99; p < 0.0001), lunch (17.34 mg/dL, 95% CI 6.47, 28.21; p = 0.0018) and the evening meal (16.19 mg/dL, 95% CI 5.04, 27.34; p = 0.0045). In the insulin-experienced group, the postprandial SMBG increment was significantly greater in the Asian versus non-Asian subgroup at breakfast (estimated difference 13.81 mg/dL, 95% CI 9.19, 18.44; p < 0.0001) and lunch (29.18 mg/dL, 95% CI 24.22, 34.14; p < 0.0001), but not significantly different at the evening meal.\nConclusion\n\nIn this post hoc analysis, baseline PPG increments were significantly greater in Asian participants with T2D than in their non-Asian counterparts at all mealtimes, with the exception of the evening meal in insulin-experienced participants. Asian adults with T2D may benefit from the use of regimens that control PPG excursions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Preclinical studies have shown that transplanted cells can differentiate into neurons and glial cells and improve neurological function. To fully demonstrate and evaluate the potential of stem cell transplantation, the delivery process, long-term tracking, viability, and function of the transplanted cells must be carefully monitored. Imaging techniques that are the most frequently used for stem cell tracking are magnetic resonance, radioactive, and optical imaging. Interventional, real-time magnetic resonance imaging enables precise and safe delivery of stem cells to desired regions in the brain. MRI is also characterized by excellent spatial resolution for long-term cell tracking; however, currently used tracers such as superparamagnetic iron oxide particles do not allow for accessing cell viability. Reporter gene technology allows for studying cell viability; however, so far, reliable reporter genes are only available for preclinical studies. In clinical studies, cell tracking was performed with magnetic resonance metal-based tracers and radionuclide imaging. Eventually, numerous techniques were developed to modify the function of transplanted stem cells by external stimuli, e.g., light and ultrasounds. Activation and deactivation of cell functions can be monitored in real time with more advanced imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

became clear that developing cell and/or tissue specific cultures would open a myriad of new opportunities for medical research. Expertise in various in vitro models has been developing over decades, so nowadays we benefit from highly specific in vitro systems imitating every organ of the human body. Moreover, obtaining sufficient number of standardized cells allows for cell transplantation approach with the goal of improving the regeneration of injured/disease affected tissue. However, different cell types bring different needs and place various types of hurdles on the path of regenerative neurology and regenerative cardiology. In this review, written by European experts gathered in Cost European action dedicated to neurology and cardiology-Bioneca, we present the experience acquired by working on two rather different organs: the brain and the heart. When taken into account that diseases of these two organs, mostly ischemic in their nature (stroke and heart infarction), bring by far the largest burden of the medical systems around Europe, it is not surprising that in vitro models of nervous and heart muscle tissue were in the focus of biomedical research in the last decades. In this review we describe and discuss hurdles which still impair further progress of regenerative neurology and cardiology and we detect those ones which are common to both fields and some, which are field-specific. With the goal to elucidate strategies which might be shared between regenerative neurology and cardiology we discuss methodological solutions which can help each of the fields to accelerate their development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Over the last few years, hundreds of clinical trials have been initiated in a wide panel of indications. Disorders and injuries of the nervous system still remain a challenge for the regenerative medicine. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the optimal cells for the central nervous system restoration as they can differentiate into mature cells and, most importantly, functional neurons and glial cells. However, their application is limited by multiple factors such as difficult access to source material, limited cells number, problematic, long and expensive cultivation in vitro, and ethical considerations. On the other hand, according to the available clinical databases, most of the registered clinical trials involving cell therapies were carried out with the use of mesenchymal stem/stromal/signalling cells (MSCs) obtained from afterbirth or adult human somatic tissues. MSCs are the multipotent cells which can also differentiate into neuron-like and glia-like cells under proper conditions in vitro; however, their main therapeutic effect is more associated with secretory and supportive properties. MSCs, as a natural component of cell niche, affect the environment through immunomodulation as well as through the secretion of the trophic factors. In this review, we discuss various therapeutic strategies and activated mechanisms related to bilateral MSC–NSC interactions, differentiation of MSCs towards the neural cells (subpopulation of crest-derived cells) under the environmental conditions, bioscaffolds, or co-culture with NSCs by recreating the conditions of the neural cell niche."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Oxygen tension is one of the major\nfactors influencing cell metabolism and thus, modulating cellular response to pathophysiological\nconditions. In this context, the presented study aimed at the development of a protocol for efficient\nculture of rat neonatal glial cells (microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) in oxygen concentrations relevant to the nervous tissue. The protocol allows for obtaining three major cell populations,\nwhich play crucial roles in sustaining tissue homeostasis and are known to be activated in response\nto a wide spectrum of external stimuli. The cells are cultured in media without supplement addition\nto avoid potential modulation of cell processes. The application of active biomolecules for coating\nculturing surfaces might be useful for mirroring physiological cell interactions with extracellular\nmatrix components. The cell fractions can be assembled as cocultures to further evaluate investigated\nmechanisms, intercellular crosstalk, or cell response to tested pharmacological compounds.

Conversely, CD24 expression did not correlate with survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), whereas CD47 did. CD24 was also highly expressed on MCL cell lines, where treatment with CD24 antibody clones SN3 or ML5 potently induced phagocytosis, with SN3 yielding >90% removal of MCL cells and triggering phagocytosis of primary patient-derived MCL cells by autologous macrophages. Treatment with CD24 mAb was superior to CD47 mAb in MCL and was comparable in magnitude to the effect observed in carcinoma lines. Reversely, CD24 mAb treatment was less effective than CD47 mAb treatment in DLBCL. Finally, phagocytic activity of clone SN3 appeared at least partly independent of antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), suggesting CD24/Siglec-10 checkpoint activity, whereas clone ML5 solely induced ADCP. In conclusion, CD24 is an immunotherapeutic target of potential clinical relevance for MCL, but not DLBCL."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

A review of the most important models available would provide an insight into the appropriate targets to be addressed in the treatment of different forms of human hypertension. In the animal models discussed a special attention is given to the status and pathophysiological role of nitric oxide and its interaction with reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Another focus of the review are the processes running in the renal medulla which are still insufficiently explored. Deficient nitric oxide synthesis and its reduced bioavailability are important determinants of hypertension since NO is recognized as a major control factor of vascular tone homeostasis. For decades perfusion of the renal medulla has also been regarded as one of the blood pressure control factors and, noteworthily, the renal medulla belongs to the tissues with the highest NO content. The list of most often applied animal hypertension models reviewed here includes variants of salt-induced hypertension, the models with genetic background: such as spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl salt sensitive (SS/SR) rats, Goldblatt 2K–1C hypertensive rats, and also the pharmacologically-plus-dietary salt-induced model known as DOCA-salt hypertension."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

MethodsThe experiments were performed on male Wistar rats subjected to a transient global cerebral ischemia of 5 min duration (2-vessel occlusion model) and preconditioned or not with HBO for 5 preceding days (1 h HBO at 2.5 atmosphere absolute [ATA] daily). In subgroups of preconditioned rats, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was administered 30 min prior to each preconditioning session. Twenty-four hours and 7 days post-ischemia, after neurobehavioral assessment, the brains were collected and evaluated for morphological changes and quantitative immunohistochemistry of cell markers and apoptosis-related proteins. ResultsWe observed reduced damage of CA1 pyramidal cells in the HBO preconditioned group only at 7 days post-ischemia. However, both at early (24 h) and later (7 days) time points, HBO-PC enhanced the tissue expression of 20S core particle of the proteasome and of the nestin, diminished astroglial reactivity, and reduced p53, rabbit anti-p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), and rabbit anti-B cell lymphoma-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) expressions in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. HBO-PC also improved T-maze performance at 7 days. Proteasome inhibitor abolished the beneficial effects of HBO-PC on post-ischemic neuronal injury and functional impairment and reduced the ischemic alterations in the expression of investigated proteins.

The functional polymerase complex of these viruses is composed of two proteins: a large protein (L) and a phosphoprotein (P). The replication of viruses from this order depends on Hsp90 chaperone activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibition results in the degradation of mononegaviruses L protein, with exception of the rabies virus, for which the degradation of P protein was observed. Here, we demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibition does not affect the expression of rabies L and P proteins, but it inhibits binding of the P protein and L protein into functional viral polymerase. Rabies and the vesicular stomatitis virus, but not the measles virus, L proteins can be expressed independently of the presence of a P protein and in the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor. Our results suggest that the interaction of L proteins with P proteins and Hsp90 in the process of polymerase maturation may be a process specific to particular viruses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Since the repertoire of the possible therapies is very limited, novel therapeutic strategies require new drugs as well as new approaches. The multiple roles played by L-tryptophan (Trp) in tumorigenesis of GBM and the previously found antiproliferative properties of Trp-bearing dendrimers against this malignancy prompted us to design novel polyfunctional peptide-based dendrimers covalently attached to N1-alkyl tryptophan (Trp) residues. Their antiproliferative properties against GBM and normal human astrocytes (NHA) and their antioxidant potential were tested. Methods: Two groups of amphiphilic peptide dendrimers terminated with N1-butyl and N1-aminopentane tryptophan were designed. The influence of dendrimers on viability of NHA and human GBM cell lines, displaying different genetic backgrounds and tumorigenic potentials, was determined by the MTT test. The influence of compounds on the clonogenic potential of GBM cells was assessed by colony-formation assay. Dendrimers were tested for radical scavenging potency as well as redox capability (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP models). Results: Several peptide dendrimers functionalized with N1-alkyl-tryptophan at 5 µM concentration exhibited high selectivity towards GBM cells retaining 85–95% viable NHA cells while killing cancer cells. In both the MTT and colony-formation assays, compounds 21 (functionalized with N1-butyl-Trp and (+)8 charged) and 25 (functionalized with N1-aminopentane-Trp and (+)12 charged) showed the most promise for their development into anticancer drugs. According to ABTS, DPPH, and FRAP antioxidant tests, dendrimers functionalized with N1-alkylated Trp expressed higher ROS-scavenging capacity (ABTS and DPPH) than those with unsubstituted Trp. Conclusions: Peptide dendrimers functionalized with N1-alkyl-tryptophan showed varying toxicity to NHA, while all were toxic to GBM cells. Based on their activity towards inhibition of GBM viability and relatively mild effect on NHA cells the most advantageous were derivatives 21 and 25 with the respective di-dodecyl and dodecyl residue located at the C-terminus. As expected, peptide dendrimers functionalized with N1-alkyl-tryptophan expressed higher scavenging potency against ROS than dendrimers with unsubstituted tryptophan."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6319d2474097073416d65f0f","5e70937a878c28a0473aa96b","5e7093b5878c28a0473af87c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Small aggregates (oligomers) of alpha-synuclein have been shown to be the most relevant neurotoxic species and are targeted by anle138b, an orally bioavailable small molecule compound which shows strong disease-modifying effects in animal models of synucleinopathies.\n\nMethods Anle138b was studied in a single-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy subjects. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1 for sentinel subjects and 1:5 for main group) to placebo or anle138b (dose range 50 mg to 300 mg per day), respectively. In addition, the effect of food on the pharmakokinetics of anle138b in healthy subjects was exam-ined in doses of 150 mg per day. Participants were randomized to treatment sequence (fed -> fasted) or (fasted -> fed). Treatment was administered orally in hard gelatine capsules containing either 10 mg or 30 mg of anle138b or excipient only. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, the secondary endpoint was pharmakokinetics. Data from all randomized individuals were evaluated. Clinicaltrials.gov-identifier: NCT04208152. EudraCT-number: 2019-004218-33.\n\nFindings Between December 17(th), 2019 and June 27(th), 2020 196 healthy volunteers were screened and 68 participants were enrolled. Of these, all completed the study per protocol. There were no major protocol deviations. Adverse events in this healthy volunteer trial were mostly mild and all fully recovered or resolved prior to discharge.

In some CMT patients, a few weak sequence variants toward other CMT genes are detected instead of one leading CMT mutation. Thus, the presence of a few variants in different CMT-associated genes raises the question concerning the pathogenic status of one of them. In this study, we aimed to analyze the pathogenic effect of c.664G>A, p.Glu222Lys variant in the GDAP1 gene, whose mutations are known to be causative for CMT type 4A (CMT4A). Due to low penetrance and a rare occurrence limited to five patients from two Polish families affected by the CMT phenotype, there is doubt as to whether we are dealing with real pathogenic mutation. Thus, we aimed to study the pathogenic effect of the c.664G>A, p.Glu222Lys variant in its natural environment, i.e., the neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line. Additionally, we have checked the pathogenic status of p.Glu222Lys in the broader context of the whole exome. We also have analyzed the impact of GDAP1 gene mutations on the morphology of the transfected cells. Despite the use of several tests to determine the pathogenicity of the p.Glu222Lys variant, we cannot point to one that would definitively solve the problem of pathogenicity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afe74"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Mitochondrial damage can be alleviated by various mechanisms including mitochondrial network remodelling, mitochondrial elimination and mitochondrial protein biogenesis. However, the mechanisms regulating relationships between these phenomena are poorly understood. We hypothesized that mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), a mitochondrial GTPase involved in mitochondrial fusion, mitochondria trafficking and mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) tethering, may act as one of linking and regulatory factors in neurons following ischemic insult. To verify this assumption, we performed temporal oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD/R) on rat cortical primary culture to determine whether Mfn2 protein reduction affected the onset of mitophagy, subsequent mitochondrial biogenesis and thus neuronal survival. We found that Mfn2 knockdown increased neuronal susceptibility to OGD/R, prevented mitochondrial network remodelling and resulted in prolonged mitophagosomes formation in response to the insult. Next, Mfn2 knockdown was observed to be accompanied by reduced Parkin protein levels and increased Parkin accumulation on mitochondria. As for wild-type neurons, OGD/R insult was followed by an elevated mtDNA content and an increase in respiratory chain proteins. Neither of these phenomena were observed for Mfn2 knockdown neurons. Collectively, our findings showed that Mfn2 in neurons affected their response to mild and transient OGD stress, balancing the extent of defective mitochondria elimination and positively influencing mitochondrial respiratory protein levels. Our study suggests that Mfn2 is one of essential elements for neuronal response to ischemic insult, necessary for neuronal survival."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The lack of statistical significance could result from a relatively small number of patients involved in clinical trials or highly incoherent study protocols.

The pathogenesis of these diseases is poorly understood, and no effective treatment is available. As VPS13 genes are evolutionarily conserved, the effects of the pathogenic mutations could be studied in model organisms, including yeast, where one VPS13 gene is present. In this review, we summarize advancements obtained using yeast. In recent studies, vps13Δ and vps13-I2749 yeast mutants, which are models of chorea-acanthocytosis, were used to screen for multicopy and chemical suppressors. Two of the suppressors, a fragment of the MYO3 and RCN2 genes, act by downregulating calcineurin activity. In addition, vps13Δ suppression was achieved by using calcineurin inhibitors. The other group of multicopy suppressors were genes: FET4, encoding iron transporter, and CTR1, CTR3 and CCC2, encoding copper transporters. Mechanisms of their suppression rely on causing an increase in the intracellular iron content. Moreover, among the identified chemical suppressors were copper ionophores, which require a functional iron uptake system for activity, and flavonoids, which bind iron. These findings point at areas for further investigation in a higher eukaryotic model of VPS13-related diseases and to new therapeutic targets: calcium signalling and copper and iron homeostasis. Furthermore, the identified drugs are interesting candidates for drug repurposing for these diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f58","5e7093bb878c28a0473afe74"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Unraveling peculiarities of podocyte energy metabolism notablyunder diabetic conditions will provide insights into the pathogenesis of diabeticnephropathy. Intracellular metabolism in the cortical area of podocytes is regulatedby glycolysis, whereas energy balance in the central area is controlled by oxidativephosphorylation and glycolysis. High glucose concentrations were recently reportedto force podocytes to switch from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation toglycolysis, resulting in lactic acidosis.

However, whether Dexras1 participates in dysdifferentiation\nof oligodendrocytes and myelin injury after SAH has yet to be examined, which is the reason for\ncreating the research content of this article.

Immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and Western blotting\nmethods, were used to investigate the effects of Dexras1 on demyelination, glial cell activation, and\ndifferentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) after SAH. Primary rat brain neurons were\ntreated with oxyhemoglobin to verify the association between Dexras1 and cAMP-CREB. The results\nshowed that Dexras1 levels were significantly increased upon in vivo SAH model, accompanied by\nOPC differentiation disturbances and myelin injury. Dexras1 overexpression significantly worsened\nOPC dysdifferentiation and myelin injury after SAH. In contrast, Dexras1 knockdown ameliorated\nmyelin injury, OPC dysdifferentiation, and glial cell activation. Further research of the underlying\nmechanism discovered that the cAMP-CREB pathway was inhibited after Dexras1 overexpression in\nthe in vitro model of SAH. This study is the first to confirm that Dexras1 induced oligodendrocyte\ndysdifferentiation and myelin injury after SAH by inhibiting the cAMP-CREB pathway.

In the present article, we review possible mechanisms underlying the effects of hyponatremia on cerebral blood vessels and discuss the potential role of hyponatremia in the development of large vessels and microvascular spasm, taking into consideration the presence of vasopressin and natriuretic peptides."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Subgroup analyses with factors for baseline HbA1c categories and their interaction with treatment group, as well as analyses within the HbA1c subgroups, were conducted. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were performed for baseline HbA1c subgroups of 6.5% or less and more than 6.5%.\n\nResults\nOf the 9876 eligible participants, 3921 and 5955 had a baseline HbA1c of less than 7% and 7% or higher, respectively. Mean baseline HbA1c was 6.3% and 8.0% and the mean duration of diabetes was 9.0 and 11.6 years in the respective subgroups. The less than 7% subgroup was slightly older and less frequently insulin-treated. There was no evidence of a differential dulaglutide treatment effect on body mass index (BMI) reduction, cardiovascular or safety outcomes of interest between the baseline HbA1c subgroups. Treatment-by-baseline HbA1c group interaction was significant for HbA1c change from baseline (P < .001), with a greater reduction in the subgroup with higher baseline HbA1c values. Sensitivity analyses by baseline HbA1c subgroups of 6.5% or less and more than 6.5% showed similar results.\n\nConclusions\nThe reduced incidence of cardiovascular events, and the reduction in BMI in participants treated with once-weekly dulaglutide, were independent of the baseline HbA1c level. Conversely, participants with a higher baseline HbA1c level had greater reductions in HbA1c. Dulaglutide has a positive benefit–risk profile and can be considered in patients with comparatively well-controlled HbA1c levels seeking optimal metabolic control and cardiovascular benefits."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We aimed to investigate hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory responses in a transgenic mouse model of AD (AβPP V717I) overexpressing AβPP and mimicking early-onset AD. The cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine and the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine were used to investigate the effects of drugs, used to treat AD cognitive dysfunction, on breathing in hypoxia and hypercapnia. We found a significant increase in the respiratory response to hypercapnia and no difference in the hypoxic response in APP+ mice, compared with the control group (APP−). Memantine had no effect on respiration in either group, including responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Rivastigmine depressed resting ventilation and response to hypercapnia irrespective of the mice genotype. Reduction in hypoxia-augmented ventilation by rivastigmine was observed only in APP+ mice, which exhibited lower acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus. Treatment with rivastigmine reduced the enzyme activity in both groups equally in the hippocampus and brainstem. The increased ventilatory response to hypercapnia in transgenic mice may indicate alterations in chemoreceptive respiratory nuclei, resulting in increased CO2 sensitivity. Rivastigmine is a potent reductant of normoxic and hypercapnic respiration in APP+ and APP− mice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Slow monomer diffusion rates and rugged free energy landscapes disfavor swift self-assembly of orderly amyloid architectures within timescales accessible to all-atom MD. Here, we conduct a multiscale MD study of the amyloidogenic self-assembly of insulin: a small protein with a complex topology defined by two polypeptide chains interlinked by three disulfide bonds. To avoid kinetic traps, unconventional preplanarized insulin conformations are used as amyloid building blocks. These starting conformers generated through uniaxial compression of the native monomer in various spatial directions represent 6 distinct (out of 16 conceivable) two-dimensional (2D) topological classes varying in N-/C-terminal segments of insulin’s A- and B-chains being placed inside or outside of the central loop constituted by the middle sections of both chains and Cys7A–Cys7B/Cys19B–Cys20A disulfide bonds. Simulations of the fibrillar self-assembly are initiated through a biased in-register alignment of two, three, or four layers of flat conformers belonging to a single topological class. The various starting topologies are conserved throughout the self-assembly process resulting in polymorphic amyloid fibrils varying in structural features such as helical twist, presence of cavities, and overall stability. Some of the protofilament structures obtained in this work are highly compatible with the earlier biophysical studies on insulin amyloid and high-resolution studies on insulin-derived amyloidogenic peptide models postulating the presence of steric zippers. Our approach provides in silico means to study amyloidogenic tendencies and viable amyloid architectures of larger disulfide-constrained proteins with complex topologies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, dysregulation of hippocampal neurogenesis with aging, injury, depression and neurodegenerative disease leads to debilitating cognitive impacts. These debilitating symptoms deteriorate the quality of life in the afflicted individuals. Impaired hippocampal neurogenesis is especially difficult to rescue with increasing age and neurodegeneration. However, the potential to boost endogenous Wnt signaling by influencing pathway modulators such as receptors, agonists, and antagonists through drug and cell therapy-based interventions offers hope. Restoration and augmentation of hampered Wnt signaling to facilitate increased hippocampal neurogenesis would serve as an endogenous repair mechanism and contribute to hippocampal structural and functional plasticity. This review focuses on the possible interaction between neurogenesis and Wnt signaling under the control of antidepressants and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to overcome debilitating symptoms caused by age, diseases, or environmental factors such as stress. It will also address some current limitations hindering the direct extrapolation of research from animal models to human application, and the technical challenges associated with the MSCs and their cellular products as potential therapeutic solutions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is expressed almost exclusively in the striatum and its inhibition is suggested to offer potential treatment in disorders associated with basal ganglia. We evaluated the selectivity, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, pharmacokinetics and potential adverse effects of a novel PDE10A inhibitor, CPL500036, in vivo.\n\nMethods: The potency of CPL500036 was demonstrated by microfluidic technology, and selectivity was investigated in a radioligand binding assay against 44 targets. Cardiotoxicity in vitro was evaluated in human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)-potassium channel-overexpressing cells by the patch-clamp method and by assessing key parameters in 3D cardiac spheroids. Cytotoxicity was determined in H1299, HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cell lines. The Ames test was used for genotoxicity analyses. During in vivo studies, CPL500036 was administered by oral gavage. CPL500036 exposure were determined by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and plasma protein binding was assessed. The bar test was employed to assess catalepsy. Prolactin and glucose levels in rat blood were measured by ELISAs and glucometers, respectively. Cardiovascular safety in vivo was investigated in dogs using a telemetry method.\n\nResults: CPL500036 inhibited PDE10A at an IC50 of 1 nM, and interacted only with the muscarinic M2 receptor as a negative allosteric modulator with an IC50 of 9.2 µM. Despite inhibiting hERG tail current at an IC25 of 3.2 μM, cardiovascular adverse effects were not observed in human cardiac 3D spheroids or in vivo. Cytotoxicity in vitro was observed only at > 60 μM and genotoxicity was not recorded during the Ames test. CPL500036 presented good bioavailability and penetration into the brain. CPL500036 elicited catalepsy at 0.6 mg/kg, but hyperprolactinemia or hyperglycemic effects were not observed in doses up to 3 mg/kg.\n\nConclusion: CPL500036 is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable PDE10A inhibitor with a good safety profile distinct from marketed antipsychotics. CPL500036 may be a compelling drug candidate."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Cancer is typically driven by a combination of germline andsomatic mutations accumulating during an individual's lifetime. Yet, many centenariansreach exceptionally old age without experiencing cancer. It was suggested thatcentenarians have more robust DNA repair and mitochondrial function, allowingimproved maintenance of DNA stability. In this study, we applied real‐time quantitativePCR to examine the expression ofATMin lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from 15 healthyfemale centenarians and 24 younger female donors aged 21–88 years. We observedhigherATMmRNA expression of in LCLs from female centenarians compared with bothwomen aged 21–48 years (FD = 2.0,p= .0016) and women aged 56–88 years (FD = 1.8,p= .0094. Positive correlation was found betweenATMmRNA expression and donorsage (p= .0028). Levels of hsa‐miR‐181a‐5p, which targetsATM, were lower in LCLs fromcentenarians compared with younger women. Our findings suggest a role for ATM inprotection from age‐related diseases, possibly reflecting more effective DNA repair,thereby reducing somatic mutation accumulation during aging. Further studies arerequired for analyzing additional DNA repair pathways in biosamples from centenariansand younger age men and women."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

To understand this compensation, we compared global protein landscapes upon the proteasome inhibition with carfilzomib, in normal fibroblasts, cells of multiple myeloma, and cancers of lung, colon, and pancreas. Molecular chaperones, autophagy, and endocytosis-related proteins are the most prominent vulnerabilities in combination with carfilzomib, while targeting of the HSP70 family chaperones HSPA1A/B most specifically sensitizes cancer cells to the proteasome inhibition. This suggests a central role of HSP70 in the suppression of the proteasome downregulation, allowing to identify pathways impinging on HSP70 upon the proteasome inhibition. HSPA1A/B indeed controls proteasome-inhibition-induced autophagy, unfolded protein response, and endocytic flux, and directly chaperones the proteasome machinery. However, it does not control the NRF1/2-driven proteasome subunit transcriptional bounce-back. Consequently, targeting of NRF1 proves effective in decreasing the viability of cancer cells with the inhibited proteasome and HSP70."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In the light of contradictory data reported, detailed mechanism of regulation of enzymes activity based on electrostatic interactions between hydrolase molecule and bacterial CW surface remains unknown. Here, we report a comprehensive study on this phenomenon using as a model two novel PG hydrolases, SpM23_A, and SpM23_B, which although share the same bacterial host, similarities in sequence conservation, domain architecture, and structure, display surprisingly distinct net charges (in 2D electrophoresis, pI 6.8, and pI 9.7, respectively). We demonstrate a strong correlation between hydrolases surface net charge and the enzymes activity by modulating the charge of both, enzyme molecule and bacterial cell surface. Teichoic acids, anionic polymers present in the bacterial CW, are shown to be involved in the mechanism of enzymes activity regulation by the electrostatics-based interplay between charged bacterial envelope and PG hydrolases. These data serve as a hint for the future development of chimeric PG hydrolases of desired antimicrobial specificity. IMPORTANCE This study shows direct relationship between the surface charge of two recently described enzymes, SpM23_A and SpM23_B, and bacterial cell walls. We demonstrate that by (i) surface charge probing of bacterial strains collection, (ii) reduction of the net charge of the positively charged enzyme, and (iii) altering the net charge of the bacterial surface by modifying the content and composition of teichoic acids. In all cases, we observed that lytic activity and binding strength of SpM23 enzymes, are regulated by electrostatic interactions with the bacterial cell envelope and that this interaction contributes to the determination of the spectrum of susceptible bacterial species.

Methylmercury (MeHg) is a well-known environmental toxicant that bioaccumulates in fish and shellfish. It readily crosses the placental barrier, making it a threat to correct fetal development. Despite being comprehensively investigated for years, this compound has not been assessed for its in vitro mitochondrial toxicity under different oxygen conditions. In this study, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were used to evaluate the dependence of the expression of genes associated with pluripotency and mitochondria on atmospheric (21% O2) and low (5% O2) oxygen concentrations upon MeHgCl treatment. We showed that the toxicity of MeHgCl was strongly related to an increased mtDNA copy number and downregulation of the expression of an mtDNA replication and damage repair-associated gene POLG1 (Mitochondrial Polymerase Gamma Catalytic Subunit) in both tested oxygen conditions. In addition, the viability and mitochondrial membrane potential of hiPSCs were significantly lowered by MeHgCl regardless of the oxygen concentration. However, reactive oxygen species accumulation significantly increased only under atmospheric oxygen conditions; what was associated with increased expression of TFAM (Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial) and NRF1 (Nuclear Respiratory Factor 1) and downregulation of PARK2 (Parkin RBR E3 Ubiquitin Protein Ligase). Taken together, our results demonstrated that MeHgCl could induce in vitro toxicity in hiPSCs through altering mitochondria-associated genes in an oxygen level-dependent manner. Thus, our work suggests that oxygen should be considered a factor was modulating the in vitro toxicity of environmental pollutants. Typical atmospheric conditions of in vitro culture significantly lower the predictive value of studies of such toxicity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

On the other hand, microglia also participate in the repair process. The dualistic role of these cells results from the fact that various states of their activation are associated with specific phenotypes. The M1 phenotype is responsible for the production of proinflammatory mediators, whereas the M2 microglia release anti-inflammatory and trophic factors and take part in immunosuppressive and neuroprotective processes. The histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (SB) shows anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in some animal models of brain injury. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of sodium butyrate on the proliferation and M1/M2 polarization of primary microglial cells after oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro.\n\nMethods\nPrimary microglial cultures were prepared from 1-day-old rats, subjected to the OGD procedure and treated with SB (0.1 mM, 1 mM and 10 mM). The effect of OGD and SB on microglial proliferation was assessed by double immunofluorescence, and microglial phenotypes were evaluated by qPCR.\n\nResults\nThe OGD procedure stimulated the proliferation of microglia after 24 h of culturing, and SB treatment reduced the division of these cells. This effect was inversely proportional to the SB concentration. The OGD procedure increased proinflammatory CD86 and IL1β gene expression and reduced the expression of the anti-inflammatory M2 markers arginase and CD200 in microglia.\n\nConclusions\nSB can change the polarization of microglia after OGD from an unfavourable M1 to a beneficial M2 phenotype. Our results show that SB is a potential immunosuppressive agent that can modulate microglial activation stimulated by ischaemic-like conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus and temporal cortex, genes related to Alzheimer’s disease, such as the amyloid protein precursor (APP), β-secretase (BACE1), presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and 2 (PSEN2), are deregulated by ischemia. The pattern of change in the CA1 area of the hippocampus covers all genes tested, and the changes occur at all post-ischemic times. In contrast, the pattern of gene changes in the CA3 subfield is much less intense, does not occur at all post-ischemic times, and is delayed in time post-ischemia relative to the CA1 field. Conversely, the pattern of gene alterations in the temporal cortex appears immediately after ischemia, and does not occur at all post-ischemic times and does not affect all genes. Evidence therefore suggests that various forms of dysregulation of the APP, BACE1 and PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes are associated with individual neuronal cell responses in the CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus and temporal cortex with reversible cerebral ischemia. Scientific data indicate that an ischemic episode of the brain is a trigger of amyloidogenic processes.

The interplay between aggregation-prone and aggregation-resistant fragments within a single polypeptide chain remains obscure. Here, we examine fibrillization behavior of two chimeric peptides, ACC1–13E8 and ACC1–13E8(L/D), in which the highly amyloidogenic fragment of insulin (ACC1–13) is extended by an octaglutamate segment composed of all-L (E8), or alternating L/D residues (E8(L/D)). As separate entities, ACC1–13 readily forms fibrils with the infrared features of parallel β-sheet while E8 forms antiparallel β-sheets with the distinct infrared characteristics. This contrasts with the profoundly aggregation-resistant E8(L/D), although L/D patterns have been hypothesized as compatible with aggregated α-sheets. ACC1–13E8 and ACC1–13E8(L/D) are found to be equally prone to fibrillization at low pH, or in the presence of Ca2+ ions. Fibrillar states of both ACC1–13E8 and ACC1–13E8(L/D) reveal the infrared features of highly ordered parallel β-sheet without evidence of β2-aggregates (ACC1–13E8) or α-sheets (ACC1–13E8(L/D)). Hence, the preferred structural pattern of ACC1–13 overrides the tendency of E8 to form antiparallel β-sheets and enforces the fibrillar order in E8(L/D). We demonstrate how the powerful amyloid stretch determines the overall amyloid structure forcing non-amyloidogenic fragments to participate in its native amyloid pattern."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fe3b9543c72336543806","5e709358878c28a0473a7b5f","638725c540970727ca7a61e8","638725c540970727ca7a61e9"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","uid":"bnXIe5Gp0q3Tkxqm6btR47Q","uuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","name":"Instytut Wysokich Ciśnień Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7b5f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","parentUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","rootUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Therefore, now is the right timing to delve into the stepping stones that underpin this success and pay tribute to the underlying scientists. From this perspective, advances in mRNA engineering have proven crucial to the rapidly growing role of this molecule in healthcare. Development of consecutive generations of cap analogs, including anti-reverse cap analogs (ARCAs), has significantly boosted translation efficacy and maintained an enthusiasm for mRNA research. Nucleotide modification to protect mRNA molecules from the host’s immune system, followed by finding appropriate purification and packaging methods, were other links in the chain enabling medical breakthroughs. Currently, vaccines are the central area of mRNA research, but it will reach far beyond COVID-19. Supplementation of missing or abnormal proteins is another large field of mRNA research. Ex vivo cell engineering and genome editing have been expanding recently. Thus, it is time to recognize mRNA pioneers while building upon their legacy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that the mechanism of Givinostat is associated with the alleviation of inflammation. For this purpose, we analyzed the microglial response and the effect on molecular mediators (chemokines/cytokines) that are crucial for inducing cerebral damage after neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. Seven-day-old rat pups were subjected to unilateral carotid artery ligation followed by 60 min of hypoxia (7.6% O2). Givinostat (10 mg/kg b/w) was administered in a 5-day regimen. The effects of Givinostat on HI-induced inflammation (cytokine, chemokine and microglial activation and polarization) were assessed with a Luminex assay, immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Givinostat treatment did not modulate the microglial response specific for HI injury. After Givinostat administration, the investigated chemokines and cytokines remained at the level induced by HI. The only immunosuppressive effect of Givinostat may be associated with the decrease in MIP-1α. Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia produces an inflammatory response by activating the proinflammatory M1 phenotype of microglia, disrupting the microglia–neuron (CX3CL1/CX3CR1) axis and elevating numerous proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines.

The hazard of higher baseline levels of 1/eGFR and natural log transformed ACR (calculated as ln [ACR × 100] to eliminate negative values) and their interaction for incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), kidney outcomes, and deaths was estimated. The hazard of the geometric mean of these two baseline measures (the kidney disease index or KDI) was also assessed.\n\nResults\nA non-linear relationship was observed between 1/eGFR and all three outcomes, and between ln [ACR × 100] and the kidney outcome. There was also a negative interaction between these two risk factors with respect to MACE and death. Conversely, a linear relationship was noted between the KDI and all three outcomes. People in the highest KDI fifth experienced the highest incidence of MACE, death, and the kidney outcome (4.43, 4.56, and 5.55/100 person-years respectively).

In the analysis of mechanisms regulating microglial phagocytosis, we focused on the bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins: Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4, the acetylation code readers that control gene expression in cooperation with transcription factors. We used pharmaco- logical (JQ1) and genetic (siRNA) inhibition of BET proteins in murine microglial cell line BV2. Inhibition of BET proteins reduced the phagocytic activity of BV2, as determined by using a fluores-cent microspheres-based assay and fluorescently labelled amyloid-beta peptides. Gene silencing ex- periments demonstrated that all brain-existing BET isoforms control phagocytosis in microglia. From a set of 84 phagocytosis-related genes, we have found the attenuation of the expression of 14: Siglec1, Sirpb1a, Cd36, Clec7a, Itgam, Tlr3, Fcgr1, Cd14, Marco, Pld1, Fcgr2b, Anxa1, Tnf, Nod1, upon BET inhibition. Further analysis of the mRNA level of other phagocytosis-related genes which were involved in the pathomechanism of Alzheimer’s disease demonstrated that JQ1 significantly re-duced the expression of Cd33, Trem2, and Zyx. Our results indicate the important role of BET pro-teins in controlling microglial phagocytosis; therefore, targeting BET may be the efficient method of modulating microglial activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Blood–brain barrier (BBB) impairment, resulting from increased vascular permeability, has been reported in acute and chronic HE. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a well-documented result of HE mainly affecting astrocytes, but much less so in the BBB-forming endothelial cells. Here we review literature reports and own experimental data obtained in HE models emphasizing alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and function as a possible contributor to the status of brain endothelial cell mitochondria in HE. Own studies on the expression of the mitochondrial fusion-fission controlling genes rendered HE animal model-dependent effects: increase of mitochondrial fusion controlling genes opa1, mfn1 in cerebral vessels in ammonium acetate-induced hyperammonemia, but a decrease of the two former genes and increase of fis1 in vessels in thioacetamide-induced HE. In endothelial cell line (RBE4) after 24 h ammonia and/or TNFα treatment, conditions mimicking crucial aspects of HE in vivo, we observed altered expression of mitochondrial fission/fusion genes: a decrease of opa1, mfn1, and, increase of the fission related fis1 gene. The effect in vitro was paralleled by the generation of reactive oxygen species, decreased total antioxidant capacity, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as increased permeability of RBE4 cell monolayer to fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran. Electron microscopy documented enlarged mitochondria in the brain endothelial cells of rats in both in vivo models. Collectively, the here observed alterations of cerebral endothelial mitochondria are indicative of their fission, and decreased potential of endothelial mitochondria are likely to contribute to BBB dysfunction in HE."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Until now, more than two thousand pathogenic variants of the SCN1A gene have been identified and different pathogenic mechanisms (loss vs. gain of function) described, but the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the deficits exhibited by patients are not fully elucidated. Additionally, the phenotypic variability proves the involvement of other genetic factors in its final expression. This is the reason why animal models and cell line models used to explore the molecular pathology of SCN1A-related disorders are only of limited use. The results of studies based on such models cannot be directly translated to affected individuals because they do not address each patient’s unique genetic background. The generation of functional neurons and glia for patient-derived iPSCs, together with the generation of isogenic controls using CRISPR/Cas technology, and finally, the 3D brain organoid models, seem to be a good way to solve this problem.

However, the ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) rodents use to communicate their emotional states can be measured. USV have therefore become a particularly useful tool in brain disease models. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are considered an animal model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia. However, the specifics of SHR's behavior have not been fully described and there is very little data on their USV. Recently, we developed a communication model, in which Wistar rats are exposed to pre-recorded playbacks of aversive (22-kHz) or appetitive (50-kHz) USV, and their vocal responses depend on the extent of prior fear conditioning (0, 1, 6 or 10 shocks). Here, we investigated SHR's behavior and heart rate (HR) in our communication model, in comparison to Wistar rats employed as controls. In general, SHR emitted typical USV categories, however, they contained more short 22-kHz and less 50-kHz USV overall. Moreover, fewer SHR, in comparison with Wistar rats, emitted long 22-kHz USV after fear conditioning. SHR did not show a 50-kHz playback-induced HR increase, while they showed a profound 22-kHz playback-induced HR decrease. Finally, the number of previously delivered conditioning shocks appeared to have no effect on the investigated vocal, locomotor and HR responses of SHR. The phenomena observed in SHR are potentially attributable to deficits in emotional perception and processing. A lower number of 50-kHz USV emitted by SHR may reflect observations of speech impairments in human patients and further supports the usefulness of SHR to model ADHD and schizophrenia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Several studies have identified that glioma cancer stem cells (GCSCs) play important roles in tumor-initiating features in malignant gliomas. GCSCs are a small population in the brain that presents an essential role in the metastasis of glioma cells to other organs. These cells can self-renew and differentiate, which are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of glioma. Therefore, targeting GCSCs might be a novel strategy for the treatment of glioma. Accumulating evidence revealed that several signaling pathways, including Notch, TGF-β, Wnt, STAT3, AKT, and EGFR mediated GCSC growth, proliferation, migration, and invasion. Besides, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including miRNAs, circular RNAs, and long ncRNAs have been found to play pivotal roles in the regulation of GCSC pathogenesis and drug resistance. Therefore, targeting these pathways could open a new avenue for glioma management. In this review, we summarized critical signaling pathways involved in the stimulation or prevention of GCSCs tumorigenesis and invasiveness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The follow-up was 24 weeks after the first intervention (5/6 NX). The treatment regimens were initiated 6 weeks after 5/6 NX and 2 weeks after ACF creation.\n\nResults\nThe final survival in untreated group was 15%. The treatment with ETA receptor antagonist alone or ACEi alone and the combined treatment improved the survival rate to 64%, 71% and 75%, respectively, however, the difference between the combination and either single treatment regimen was not significant. The combined treatment exerted best renoprotection, causing additional reduction in albuminuria and reducing renal glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury as compared with ACE inhibition alone.\n\nConclusions\nOur results show that treatment with ETA receptor antagonist attenuates the CKD- and CHF-related mortality, and addition of ETA receptor antagonist to the standard blockade of RAS by ACEi exhibits additional renoprotective actions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The current review revealed that AgNPs increase the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and selectively damage neurons in the brain of immature rats exposed pre and postnatally. Among the AgNP-induced molecular mechanisms underlying toxic insult is cellular stress, which can consequently lead to cell death. Glutamatergic neurons and NMDAR-mediated neurotransmission also appear to be a target for AgNPs during the postnatal period of exposure.

Here, we also hypothesize a core role for it in endogenous neuroprotection, i.e., the natural adaptive mechanisms protecting the brain from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) episode. An example of endogenous neuroprotection is ischemia-resistance of the hippocampal regions comprising the CA2, CA3, CA4 and dentate gyrus subfields (here abbreviated to CA2-4,DG) which can be contrasted with the ischemia-vulnerable CA1 region. In the work detailed here, we used a gerbil model of transient cerebral ischemia to examined Nrf2 activation in CA1 and CA2-4,DG, in a control group, and post I/R episode. Data obtained indicate enhanced Nrf2 activity in CA2-4,DG as compared with CA1 in the control, with this difference seen to persist even after I/R. While I/R does indeed cause further activation of Nrf2 in CA2-4,DG, it is associated with slight and transient activation in CA1. Sub-regional differences in Nrf2 activity correlate with immunoreactivity of Keap1 (an Nrf2 suppressor) and Nrf2 target proteins, including heme oxygenase 1, the catalytic and modulatory sub-units of glutamate-cysteine ligase, and glutathione peroxidase 1. Pharmacological Nrf2 activation by sulforaphane results in protection of CA1 after I/R episode. Our results therefore suggest that high Nrf2 activity in CA2-4,DG may guarantee resistance of this region to I/R, potentially explaining the differential sensitivities of the hippocampal regions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

There is lack of studies describing neurophysiological abnormalities in peripheral nerves in case of patients who had Sars Cov 2 infection. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in peripheral nervous system in case of COVID 19 survivors. Materials and Methods In presented study 45 COVID 19 survivors who had nerve conduction study (NCS) were involved. Results were compared to control group consisted of healthy patients who had nerve conduction study before COVID 19 pandemic. Results In our study group neurophysiological abnormalities were present in case of both sensory and motor nerves fibers. The most significant reduction of NCS parameters was observed in case of sensory action potential amplitude of sural nerve. Moreover, that correlation was the most significant in case of amplitude and conduction velocity in sensory and motor neuron fibers both in arms and legs. Those abnormalities were observed even 6 months after COVID 19. Conclusions and Clinical Implications Further investigation needs to be done regarding the polyneuropathies associated with human coronaviruses, and we should answer the question whether the virus directly damages peripheral nerves or factors mediating inflammatory response are responsible for the neural damage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The neurodegenerative character of ALS was an appealing target for stem cell-based regenerative approaches. Different types of stem cells have been transplanted in both preclinical and clinical settings, but no convincing outcomes have been noted. Human glial restricted precursors (hGRPs) transplanted intraventricularly to neonatal, immunodeficient mice rescued lifespan of dysmyelinated mice. Intraspinal injection of hGRPs also provided benefits in the mouse model of ALS. Therefore, we have recently developed an immunodeficient model of ALS (double mutant SOD1/rag2), and, in this study, we tested the strategy previously used in dysmyelinated mice of intraventricular transplantation of hGRPs to immunodeficient mice. To maximize potential therapeutic benefits, the cells were implanted into neonates. We used magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the progression of neurodegeneration and therapeutic responses. A cohort of animals was devoted to survival assessment. Postmortem analysis included immunohistochemistry, Nissl staining, and Western blots. Cell transplantation was not associated with improved animal survival, slowing neurodegeneration, or accumulation of misfolded superoxide dismutase 1. Postmortem analysis did not reveal any surviving hGRPs. Grafting into neonatal immunodeficient recipients did not prevent ALS-induced cell loss, which might explain the lack of positive therapeutic effects. The results of this study are in line with the modest effects of clinical neurotransplantations. Therefore, we urge stem cell and ALS communities to develop and implement cell tracking methods to better understand cell fates in the clinic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Immature organisms are particularly susceptible to various insults during development. The biological characteristics of immature organisms are different from those of adults, and dictate the consequences of exposure to various toxic substances, including AgNPs. Nanoparticles are highly reactive and can easily cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) to accumulate in brain tissues. It is therefore important to investigate the molecular mechanisms of AgNP-induced neurotoxicity in the developing brain. Immature 2-week-old rats were exposed to a low dose of AgNPs (0.2 mg/kg b.w.) over a long period. Subsequently, brain tissues of the animals were subjected to ultrastructural and molecular analyses to determine endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Ultrastructural markers of ER stress, such as pathological alterations in the ER and elongated forms of mitochondria accompanied by autophagy structures, were confirmed to be present in AgNP-exposed rat brain. Evidence for induction of ER stress in neurons was also provided by molecular markers. Upregulation of genes related to the ER-stress-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway, such as GRP78, PERK, and CHOP ATF-6, was observed at the transcriptional and translational levels. The results show that prolonged exposure of immature rats to a low dose of AgNPs during the developmental period leads to induction of ER stress in the neurons of the developing brain. Simultaneously, in response to AgNP-induced ER stress, neurons promote protective mechanisms that partially compensate for ER stress by regulating the biodynamic processes of mitochondria and autophagy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Plasma concentration of ANGPTL4, IL-6, TNF-α and lipids were determined in samples collected from 11 male runners before the marathon, immediately after the run and at 90 min of recovery. Plasma ANGPTL4 increased during exercise from 55.5 ± 13.4 to 78.1 ± 15.0 ng/ml (P < 0.001). This was accompanied by a significant increase in IL-6, TNF-α, free fatty acids (FFA) and glycerol (Gly) and a decrease in triacylglycerols (TG). After 90 min of recovery ANGPTL4 and TG did not differ from the exercise values, while plasma IL-6, TNF-α, FFA and Gly concentration were significantly lower. The exercise-induced increase in plasma concentration of ANGPTL4 correlated positively with the rise in plasma IL-6, TNF-α, FFA and Gly and negatively with the duration of the run. The increase in plasma IL-6 and TNF-α correlated positively with the rise in Gly. Summarizing, marathon running induced an increase in plasma ANGPTL4 and the value was higher in faster runners. The increase in plasma FFA, IL-6 and TNF-α concentration during a marathon run may be involved in plasma ANGPTL4 release, which could be a compensatory mechanism against FFA-induced lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. All of the analyzed cytokines may stimulate lipolysis during exercise."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

They are composed of\npeptidoglycan that provides rigidity to sustain internal turgor and ensures\nisolation from the external environment.

The main players in this process are peptidoglycan hydrolases, a\nlarge group of enzymes with diverse specificities and different mechanisms\nof action. They are commonly, but not exclusively, found in prokaryotes.\nAlthough in most cases, these enzymes share the same molecular function,\nnamely peptidoglycan hydrolysis, they are leveraged to perform a variety of\nphysiological roles. A well-investigated family of peptidoglycan hydrolases is\nM23 peptidases, which display a very conserved fold, but their spectrum of lytic\naction is broad and includes both Gram- positive and Gram- negative bacteria.\nIn this review, we  summarize the structural, biochemical, and functional\nstudies concerning the M23 family of peptidases based on literature and\ncomplement this knowledge by performing large-scale analyses of available\nprotein sequences. This review has led us to gain new insight into the role of\nsurface charge in the activity of this group of enzymes.

Mutations in SCN1A are linked to heterogenous epileptic phenotypes of various types, severity, and patient prognosis. Here we generated iPSC lines from fibroblasts obtained from three individuals affected with DRVT carrying distinct mutations in the SCN1A gene (nonsense mutation p.Ser1516*, missense mutation p.Arg1596His, and splicing mutation c.2589+2dupT). The iPSC lines, generated with the non-integrative approach, retained the distinct SCN1A gene mutation of the donor fibroblasts and were characterized by confirming the expression of the pluripotency markers, the three-germ layer differentiation potential, the absence of exogenous vector expression, and a normal karyotype.

Despite recent advances, the precise link between these factors and brain disorders is incompletely understood. This review aims to briefly outline the most relevant aspects that differ between men and women in ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders (AD, PD, HD, ALS, and SM).

Agonist binding to the receptor stimulates GDP/GTP exchange within the heterotrimeric G protein complex, whereas recent structures of GPCR–G protein complexes revealed that the H5, S1 and S2 domains of Gα are involved in binding the active receptor, earlier studies showed that a short peptide analog derived from the C-terminus (H5) of the G protein transducin (Gt) is sufficient to stabilize rhodopsin in an active form.Methods  We have used Molecular Dynamics simulations along with biological evaluation by means of radio-ligand binding assay to study the interactions between Gαi-derived peptide (G-peptide) and the μ-opioid receptor (μOR).ResultsHere, we show that a Gαi-derived peptide of 12 amino acids binds the μ-opioid receptor and acts as an allosteric modulator. The Gαi-derived peptide increases μOR affinity for its agonist morphine in a dose-dependent way.ConclusionsThese results indicate that the GPCR–Gα peptide interaction observed so far for only rhodopsin can be extrapo-lated to μOR. In addition, we show that the C-terminal peptide of the Gαi subunit is sufficient to stabilize the active con-formation of the receptor.

In cornu ammonnis 2–3, dentate gyrus (CA2-3,DG) regions of the hippocampus, neurons are resistant to 5-min ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) insult, while cornu ammonnis 1 (CA1) is found to be I/R-vulnerable. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used to study the expression of genes involved in these phenomena. It requires stable and reliable genes for normalization, which is crucial for comparable and reproducible analyses of expression changes of the genes of interest. The aim of this study was to determine the best housekeeping gene for the I/R gerbil model in two parts of the hippocampus in controls and at 3, 48, and 72 h after recanalization. We selected and tested six reference genes frequently used in central nervous system studies: Gapdh, Actb, 18S rRNA, Hprt1, Hmbs, Ywhaz, and additionally Bud23, using RefFinder, a comprehensive tool based on four commonly used algorithms: delta cycle threshold (Ct), BestKeeper, NormFinder, and geNorm, while Hprt1 and Hmbs were the most stable ones in CA2-3,DG. Hmbs was the most stable in the whole hippocampal formation. This indicates that the general use of Hmbs, especially in combination with Gapdh, a highly expressed reference gene, seems to be suitable for qRT-PCR normalization in all hippocampal regions in this model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In that context, receiving more and more consideration as a promising therapeutic method is the activation of natural adaptive mechanisms (endogenous neuroprotection) – an approach that seeks to enhance and/or stimulate the endogenous processes of plasticity and protection of the neuronal system that trigger the brain's intrinsic capacity for self-defence. Ischemic preconditioning is a classic example of endogenous neuroprotection, being the process by which one or more brief, non-damaging episodes of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) induce tissue resistance to subsequent prolonged, damaging ischemia. Another less-known example is resistance to an I/R episode mounted by the hippocampal region consisting of CA2, CA3, CA4 and the dentate gyrus (here abbreviated to CA2-4, DG). This can be contrasted with the ischemia-vulnerable CA1 region. There is not yet a good understanding of these different sensitivities of the hippocampal regions, and hence of the endogenous neuroprotection characteristic of CA2-4, DG. However, this region is widely reported to have properties distinct from CA1, and capable of generating resistance to an I/R episode. These include activation of neurotrophic and neuroprotective factors, greater activation of anti-excitotoxic and anti-oxidant mechanisms, increased plasticity potential, a greater energy reserve and improved mitochondrial function. This review seeks to summarize properties of CA2-4, DG in the context of endogenous neuroprotection, and then to assess the potential utility of these properties to therapeutic approaches. In so doing, it appears to represent the first such addressing of the issue of ischemia resistance attributable to CA2-4, DG."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the clinical evidence for vitiligo cell-based therapies taking into account the required procedures and equipment necessary to carry them out as well as their effectiveness in repigmentation, assessed using the percentage of repigmentation of the treated area. This review was conducted by assessing 55 primary clinical studies published in PubMed and ClinicalTrails.gov between 2000 and 2022. This review concludes that the extent of repigmentation, regardless of the treatment method, is highest in stable localized vitiligo patients. Moreover, therapies that combine more than one cell type, such as melanocytes and keratinocytes, or more than one method of treatment, such as the addition of NV-UVB to another treatment, increase the chances of >90% repigmentation.

Unfortunately, scientific reports are inconsistent and much of the NSCs research has been conducted on rodents rather than human cells for ethical reasons or due to insufficient cell material. Therefore, a question arises as to whether or which conclusions drawn on the isolation, cell survival, proliferation, or cell fate observed in vitro in rodent NSCs can be introduced into clinical applications. This paper presents the effects of different spatial, nutritional, and dissociation conditions on NSCs’ functional properties, which are highly species-dependent. Our study confirmed that the discrepancies in the available literature on NSCs survival, proliferation, and fate did not only depend on intra-species factors and applied environmental conditions, but they were also affected by significant inter-species variability. Human and rodent NSCs share one feature, i.e., the necessity to be cultured immediately after isolation, which significantly maintains their survival. Additionally, in the absence of experiments on human cells, rat NSCs biology (neurosphere formation potential and neural differentiation stage) seems closer to that of humans rather than mice in response to environmental factors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The inhibition of the angiogenesis process by the VEGF/VEGFR-2/NRP-1 pathway raises interest in the search for such interaction inhibitors for the purpose of the early diagnosis and treatment of angiogenesis-dependent diseases. In this work we designed and tested peptide-based radiocompounds that selectively bind to the neuropilin-1 co-receptor and prevent the formation of the pro-angiogenic VEGF-A165/NRP-1 complex. Three biomolecules, A7R and retro-inverso DR7A peptides, and the branched peptidomimetic Lys(hArg)-Dab-Pro-Arg (K4R), conjugated with macrocyclic chelator through two linkers’ types, were labeled with theranostic scandium-44 radionuclide, and studied in vitro as potential targeted radiopharmaceuticals. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) studies showed no negative effect of the introduced biomolecules’ changes and high NRP-1 affinity in the case of A7R- and K4R-radiocompounds and a lack affinity for DR7A-radiocompounds. All radiopeptides showed a hydrophilic nature as well as high stability against ligand exchange reactions in cysteine/histidine solutions. Unfortunately, all radiocompounds showed unsatisfactory nano-scale stability in human serum, especially for use as therapeutic radioagents. Further work is ongoing and focused on the search for angiogenesis inhibitors that are more human serum stable."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473968fb","640743ef4097073534a144d1","5e709359878c28a0473a7cb3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","uid":"bhtjxujYsJBDWqZPLXLXOmg","uuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","name":"Instytut Chemii i Techniki Jądrowej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b526f","640743ef4097073534a144d0","5e709410878c28a0473b5ab9","640743ef4097073534a144cf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","parentUuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","rootUuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Chronic exposure to a low dose of MeHgCl (1 nM) disrupted the development of EBs under both oxygen conditions. However, only EBs exposed to MeHgCl at 21% O2 revealed downregulation of mtDNA copy number, increased oxidative DNA damage and DNA fragmentation, as well as disturbances in SOX17 (endoderm) and TBXT (mesoderm) genes expression.

Chirality measure values can be understood as sensitive descriptors of molecular shape. In this study, we evaluated the role of quantitative chirality (measures) in the binding of androgens to their receptor. We demonstrate that a simple Quantitative StructureActivity Relationship equation correlating the binding affinity with the partial charges of pharmacophoric oxygen atoms is significantly improved upon introducing quantitative chirality descriptors as additional variables. In such models, the charge descriptors account for the strength of the formed hydrogen bonds. However, the picture is completed by the chirality measures that indirectly contain information on the geometries of the hydrogen bond networks and subtle differences in the van der Waals contacts connected with different local or global shapes of the molecules. The model case studied here (11 simple and very similar steroids) proves that both global and local chirality is important in the androgen binding to their receptors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

As the research on protein-coding genes brought significant yet only incremental progress in the development of anticancer therapy, much attention is now devoted to understanding the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in various types of cancer. Recent years have brought about the awareness that ncRNAs recognized previously as “dark matter” are, in fact, key players in shaping cancer development. Moreover, breakthrough discoveries concerning the role of a new group of ncRNAs, circular RNAs, have evidenced their high importance in many diseases, including malignancies. Therefore, in the following review, we focus on the role of circular RNAs in cancer, particularly in cancer stem-like cells, summarize their mechanisms of action, and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art toolkits to study them."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Lung diseases continue to be the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Many of the therapies currently used to treat these diseases have limited efficacy or are associated with side effects. Therefore, there is a constant pursuit for new drugs and therapies, and LF is frequently considered a therapeutic agent and/or adjunct to drug-based therapies for the treatment of lung diseases. This article focuses on a review of the existing and most up-to-date literature on the contribution of the beneficial effects of LF on the treatment of lung diseases, including asthma, viral infections, cystic fibrosis, or lung cancer, among others. Although in vitro and in vivo studies indicate significant potency of LF in the treatment of the listed diseases, only in the case of respiratory tract infections do human studies seem to confirm them by demonstrating the effectiveness of LF in reducing episodes of illness and shortening the recovery period. For lung cancer, COVID-19 and sepsis, the reports are conflicting, and for other diseases, there is a paucity of human studies conclusively confirming the beneficial effects of LF."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of 30 h of complete SD combined with prolonged, moderate exercise (SDE) on human psychomotor performance. Eleven endurance-trained men accustomed to overnight exertion were tested twice: in well-slept and non-fatigued conditions (Control) and immediately after 30 h of SDE. They performed a multiple-choice reaction time test (MCRT) at rest and during each workload of the graded exercise test to volitional exhaustion. At rest, the MCRT was shorter after SDE than in the Control (300 ± 13 ms vs. 339 ± 11 ms, respectively, p < 0.05). During graded exercise, there were no significant differences in MCRT between groups, but the fastest reaction was observed at lower workloads after SDE (158 ± 7 W vs. 187 ± 11 W in Control, p < 0.05). The total number of missed reactions tended to be higher after SDE (8.4 ± 0.7 vs. 6.3 ± 0.8 in Control, p = 0.06). In conclusion, SDE is different from SD alone; however, well-trained men, accustomed to overnight exertion can maintain psychomotor abilities independently of the extent of central fatigue. Exercise can be used to enhance psychomotor performance in sleep-deprived subjects in whom special caution is required in order to avoid overload."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec9","uid":"b61xtrk_7aMtYlgdTtxB1KQ","uuid":"c866ff49-25fe-4636-b4ec-5c14998e9eef","name":"Centralny Instytut Ochrony Pracy - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5abb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec9","parentUuid":"c866ff49-25fe-4636-b4ec-5c14998e9eef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec9","rootUuid":"c866ff49-25fe-4636-b4ec-5c14998e9eef","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The switch between mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis can be affected by many factors, including the oxygen concentration and the spatial form of culture. This study compared the metabolic features of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (ASCs) and dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs) cultivated as monolayer or spheroid culture under 5% O2 concentration (physiological normoxia) and their impact on MSCs therapeutic abilities. Results: We observed that the cells cultured as spheroids had a slightly lower viability and a reduced proliferation rate but a higher expression of the stemness-related transcriptional factors compared to the cells cultured in monolayer. The three-dimensional culture form increased mtDNA content, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), especially in DFATs-3D population. The DFATs spheroids also demonstrated increased levels of Complex V proteins and higher rates of ATP production. Moreover, increased reactive oxygen species and lower intracellular lactic acid levels were also found in 3D culture. Conclusion: Our results may suggest that metabolic reconfiguration accompanies the transition from 2D to 3D culture and the processes of both mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis become more active. Intensified metabolism might be associated with the increased demand for energy, which is needed to maintain the expression of pluripotency genes and stemness state."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

Current knowledge shows that even small changes in the cell environment may result in obtaining a subpopulation of cells with different therapeutic properties. For this reason, the conditions of UC transportation, cell isolation, and cultivation and the banking of cells destined for clinical use should be unified and optimized. In this project, we tried various protocols for cell vs. bioptat isolation, banking, and transport in order to determine the most optimal. The most efficient isolation method of WJ-MSCs was chopping the whole umbilical matrix with a scalpel after vessel and lining membrane removal. The optimal solution for short term cell transportation was a multi-electrolyte fluid without glucose. Considering the use of WJ-MSCs in cell therapies, it was important to investigate the soluble secretome of both WJ bioptats and WJ-MSCs. WJ-MSCs secreted higher levels of cytokines and chemokines than WJ bioptats. WJ-MSCs secreted HGF, CCL2, ICAM-1, BDNF, and VEGF. Since these cells might be used in treating neurodegenerative disorders, we investigated the impact of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on WJ-MSCs’ features. In the presence of CSF, the cells expressed consecutive neural markers both at the protein and gene level: nestin, β-III-tubulin, S-100-β, GFAP, and doublecortin.

These unfavorable phenomena can be partially restored by hormone replacement therapy, suggesting a significant role for estrogen in the regulation of adipocytes’ function. Indeed, preclinical studies proved the involvement of these hormones in adipose tissue development, metabolism, and inflammatory activity. However, the relationship between estrogen and obesity is bidirectional. On the one hand-their deficiency leads to excessive fat accumulation and impairs adipocyte function, on the other-adipose tissue of obese individuals is characterized by altered expression of estrogen receptors and key enzymes involved in their synthesis. This narrative review aims to summarize the role of estrogen in adipose tissue development, physiology, and in obesity-related dysfunction. Firstly, the estrogen classification, synthesis, and modes of action are presented. Next, their role in regulating adipogenesis and adipose tissue activity in health and the course of obesity is described.

Recently, some articles have highlighted the link between Alzheimer’s disease and dietary cholesterol. It was found that elevated levels of some of its fractions in the brain and circulation affect metabolism. Summary: Previous studies have considered the relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and oxidized cholesterol molecules in the brain. To date, there are limited data available on the relationship between oxidized cholesterol in the brain and Alzheimer’s disease. There is a link between a diet high in cholesterol and its oxidized forms, leading to hypercholesterolemia, which is one of significant risk factors of dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. Oxidized cholesterol can be absorbed in the small intestine and cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to increased inflammation and endogenous oxidative process. Animal-origin foods are sources of oxidized cholesterol, with cholesterol oxidation beginning already after slaughter and occurring during storage and processing. Key Messages: High-heat food preparation and storage of cooked products in the refrigerator followed by subsequent heating may significantly increase the amount of oxidized cholesterol products. Therefore, a diet low in cholesterol oxidation products and high in plants with antioxidative properties seems to be most preventable and should be implemented as early as possible."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Mitochondrial dysfunction often accompanies podocyte damage and is associated with an increase in oxidative stress and apoptosis. beta-Aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) belongs to natural beta-amino acids and is known to exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. BAIBA has been reported to be involved in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, but unknown is whether BAIBA influences podocyte bioenergetics. The present study showed that human podocytes express the BAIBA receptor, Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor type D (MRGPRD), which is sensitive to BAIBA stimulation. The treatment of podocytes with L-BAIBA significantly increased their respiratory parameters, such as basal and maximal respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and spare respiratory capacity. We also found that L-BAIBA altered mitochondrial quantity, size, and shape, promoting organelle elongation and branching. L-BAIBA significantly upregulated peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) and transcription factor A mitochondrial (TFAM), indicating an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis. Our results demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism of mitochondrial dynamics in podocytes, which may be important for maintaining their functions in the renal filtration barrier and prompting further investigations of preventing or ameliorating mitochondrial damage in podocytes in pathological states."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In anesthetized SHR, untreated or pretreated with EET-A, we assessed early responses of blood pressure (MAP), renal hemodynamics and excretion, and indices of nitric oxide (NO) activity, to bilateral noninvasive renal denervation (DNX). DNX significantly decreased MAP, with or without EET-A pretreatment. Renal perfusion decreased in EET-A treated but not in control rats. After EET-A pretreatment DNX decreased renal excretion of sodium and total solutes, compared to increasing tendency in untreated rats. In EET-A treated but not in untreated SHR denervation reduced the excretion of NO metabolites. Antihypertensive action of EET-A in anesthetized SHR was not clearly dependent on renal nerve activity. On the other hand, DNX unmasked the unexpected effect of EET-A to lower renal perfusion. The mechanism of this novel finding is unclear, as is also the simultaneous post-denervation decrease in renal excretion, again, observed only under EET-A treatment.

This study evaluated the internalization mechanisms, bio-distribution, and neurotoxicity of NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ UCNPs in rat organotypic hippocampal slices. TEM results showed that UCNPs were easily internalized by hippocampal cells and co-localized with selected organelles inside neurons and astrocytes. Moreover, the UCNPs were taken into the neurons via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Propidium iodide staining and TEM analysis did not confirm the adverse effects of UCNPs on hippocampal slice viability and morphology. Therefore, UCNPs may be a potent tool for bio-imaging and testing new therapeutic strategies for brain diseases in the future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

As TIAs cause disabilities and often precede full-scale strokes, the effects of TIA are investigated to develop neuroprotective therapies. We analyzed changes in mitochondrial network dynamics, mitophagy and biogenesis in sections of gerbil hippocampus characterized by a different neuronal survival rate after 5-minute ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) insult.\n\nOur research revealed a significantly greater mtDNA/nDNA ratio in CA2–3, DG hippocampal regions (5.8 ± 1.4 vs 3.6 ± 0.8 in CA1) that corresponded to a neuronal resistance to I/R. During reperfusion, an increase of pro-fission (phospho-Ser616-Drp1/Drp1) and pro-fusion proteins (1.6 ± 0.5 and 1.4 ± 0.3 for Mfn2 and Opa1, respectively) was observed in CA2–3, DG. Selective autophagy markers, PINK1 and SQSTM1/p62, were elevated 24-96 h after I/R and accompanied by significant elevation of transcription factors proteins PGC-1α and Nrf1 (1.2 ± 0.4, 1.78 ± 0.6, respectively) and increased respiratory chain proteins (e.g., 1.5 ± 0.3 for complex IV at I/R 96 h).\nContrastingly, decreased enzymatic activity of citrate synthase, reduced Hsp60 protein level and electron transport chain subunits (0.88 ± 0.03, 0.74 ± 0.1 and 0.71 ± 0.1 for complex IV at I/R 96 h, respectively) were observed in I/R-vulnerable CA1. The phospho-Ser616-Drp1/Drp1 was increased while Mfn2 and total Opa1 reduced to 0.88 ± 0.1 and 0.77 ± 0.17, respectively. General autophagy, measured as LC3-II/I ratio, was activated 3 h after reperfusion reaching 2.37 ± 0.9 of control.\nThis study demonstrated that enhanced mitochondrial fusion, followed by late and selective mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis might together contribute to reduced susceptibility to TIA."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Importantly, mTOR hyperactivity seems to be linked with the pathobiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Recent studies suggest the potential involvement of microtubule (MT) network dysfunction in the neuropathology of “mTORopathies”, including ASD. Cytoskeletal reorganization could be responsible for neuroplasticity disturbances in ASD individuals. Thus, the aim of this work was to study the effect of Tsc2 haploinsufficiency on the cytoskeletal pathology and disturbances in the proteostasis of the key cytoskeletal proteins in the brain of a TSC mouse model of ASD. Western-blot analysis indicated significant brain-structure-dependent abnormalities in the microtubule-associated protein Tau (MAP-Tau), and reduced MAP1B and neurofilament light (NF-L) protein level in 2-month-old male B6;129S4-Tsc2tm1Djk/J mice. Alongside, pathological irregularities in the ultrastructure of both MT and neurofilament (NFL) networks as well as swelling of the nerve endings were demonstrated. These changes in the level of key cytoskeletal proteins in the brain of the autistic-like TSC mice suggest the possible molecular mechanisms responsible for neuroplasticity alterations in the ASD brain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Although SPL activity leads to a decrease in the available pool of S1P in the cell, at the same time, hexadecenal and phosphoethanolamine, compounds with potential biological activity, are generated. The increased expression and/or activity of SPL, and hence the imbalance between S1P and the end products of its cleavage, were demonstrated in several pathological states. On the other hand, loss-of-function mutations in the SPL encoding gene are a cause of severe developmental impairments. Recently, special attention has been paid to neurodegenerative diseases as the most common pathologies of the nervous system.

Therefore, any deregulation of purine-dependent signalling mediated by stimulation of specific adenosine and purinergic receptor subtypes: P1, P2X, or P2Y, can lead to functional deficits and the development of neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In this study, we investigated the changes in expression and activity of selected purinergic receptors during rat brain development in an animal model of ASD. Pregnant dams received an intraperitoneal injection of valproic acid (VPA; 450 mg/kg body weight) at embryonic day (ED) 12.5, around the time of neural tube closure. Subsequently, changes in the expression and activity of specific purinergic receptor subtypes were analysed at ED19, an important prenatal stage of brain development. Our results suggest that prenatal VPA exposure leads to a significant increase in the level and activity of adenosinergic receptors A1, A2b and A3, which are involved in the regulation of progenitor cell proliferation and nerve growth, and upregulation of purinergic P2X2/P2X3 receptors, which in turn may contribute to the postnatal neuroanatomical abnormalities and synaptic dysfunction. Conversely, the significant downregulation of P2Y1 and P2X7 receptors, together with their reduced activity in the embryonic VPA brain, may indicate disturbances in the processes of neuronal precursor migration and differentiation, dendritic and axonal formation, and glutamate/GABA imbalance, thereby altering neuronal excitability.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the development-dependent changes in the mitochondrial function of MIA-exposed offspring, which may contribute to autism-like deficits. MIA was evoked by the single intraperitoneal administration of lipopolysaccharide to pregnant rats at gestation day 9.5, and several aspects of mitochondrial function in fetuses and in the brains of seven-day-old pups and adolescent offspring were analyzed along with oxidative stress parameters measurement. It was found that MIA significantly increased the activity of NADPH oxidase (NOX), an enzyme generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the fetuses and in the brain of seven-day-old pups, but not in the adolescent offspring. Although a lower mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied by a decreased ATP level was already observed in the fetuses and in the brain of seven-day-old pups, persistent alterations of ROS, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, and lower ATP generation with concomitant electron transport chain complexes downregulation were observed only in the adolescent offspring. We suggest that ROS observed in infancy are most likely of a NOX activity origin, whereas in adolescence, ROS are produced by damaged mitochondria. The accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria leads to the intense release of free radicals that trigger oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, resulting in an interlinked vicious cascade."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This indicates an important role of astrocytes in the development of the disease. Astrocytes derived from a transgenic mouse model expressing human Tau, exhibit changes in cellular markers of astrocyte neuroprotective function related to the glutamate-glutamine cycle (GGC), representing a key part of astrocyte-neuron integrity. Here, we focused on investigating the functional properties of key GGC components involved in the astrocyte-neuron network associated with Tau pathology in vitro. Mutant recombinant Tau (rTau) carrying the P301L mutation was added to the neuronal cultures, with or without control astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM), to study glutamine translocation through the GGC. We demonstrated that mutant Tau in vitro induces neuronal degeneration, while control astrocytes response in neuroprotective way by preventing neurodegeneration. In parallel with this observation, we noticed the Tau-dependent decline of neuronal microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2), followed by changes in glutamine (Gln) transport. Exposure to rTau decreases sodium-dependent Gln uptake in neurons and that effect was reversed when cells were co-incubated with control ACM after induction of rTau dependent pathology. Further, we found that neuronal Na+-dependent system A is the most specific system that is affected under rTau exposure. In addition, in rTau-treated astrocytes total Na+-dependent uptake of Gln, which is mediated by the N system, increases. Altogether, our study suggest mechanisms operating in Tau pathology may be related to the alterations in glutamine transport and recycling that affect neuronal-astrocytic integrity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In this study, we aimed to examine the advantages of the use of water dispersible and highly bioavailable form of standardized turmeric extract (Curcuma longa L.)—NOMICU® L-100 (N) in the formulation of probiotic yogurt in comparison with the standard turmeric extract (TE). The antimicrobial activity of both supplements was studied and compared in the context of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. The N maintains the level of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-2 in yogurt at the recommended level (7–9 log CFU/g) throughout the storage period. NOMICU® L-100 also has a higher inhibitory capacity for the growth of yeast and fungi. The evaluation of quality indicators of yogurt with N and TE at the level of 0.2% proves that yogurt with N has original taste properties. A lower degree of syneresis was noted for yogurt with TE (0.2%), but its sensory properties are unacceptable to the consumer due to the appearance of a bitter taste. In conclusion, based on the obtained results, it has been proven that the use of NOMICU® L-100 (0.2%) in the composition of yogurt provides a product of functional direction with stable quality and safety indicators, which can be stored for at least 28 days."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709214878c28a04738fb1c","5e7094d7878c28a0473c4ff0","5e7094d9878c28a0473c533c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In this work, we examine the proregenerative potentialof two peptides, G11 (a trypsin-resistant analogue of growth hormone-releasing hor-mone [GHRH]) and biphalin (opioid peptide), and their combination in vitro on humanfibroblasts (BJ). G11, biphalin and their combination exhibited no toxicity against BJcells. On the contrary, these treatments significantly stimulated proliferation andmigration of fibroblasts. Under inflammatory conditions (LPS-induced BJ cells), wenoticed that the tested peptides decreased the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin 1β(IL-1β). This was correlatedwith diminished phosphorylation levels of p38 kinase, but not those of ERK1/2. Wefound also that G11, biphalin and their combination activated the ERK1/2 signallingpathway, which has been previously implicated in promigratory activity of someregeneration enhancers, including opioids or GHRH analogues.

We analyzed the placebo group of the REWIND CV Outcomes Trial to compare several anthropometric measures as baseline risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D).MethodsData from the REWIND trial placebo group (N = 4952) were analyzed. All participants had T2D, age >= 50 years, had either a previous CV event or CV risk factors, and a BMI of >= 23 kg/m(2). Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate if BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist circumference (WC) were significant risk factors for major adverse CV events (MACE)-3, CVD-related mortality, all-cause mortality, and heart failure (HF) requiring hospitalization. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and additional baseline factors selected by LASSO method. Results are presented for one standard deviation increase of the respective anthropometric factor.ResultsParticipants in the placebo group experienced 663 MACE-3 events, 346 CVD-related deaths, 592 all-cause deaths, and 226 events of HF requiring hospitalization during the median follow-up of 5.4 years. WHR and WC, but not BMI, were identified as independent risk factors of MACE-3 (hazard ratio [HR] for WHR: 1.11 [95% CI 1.03 to 1.21]; p = 0.009; HR for WC: 1.12 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.22]; p = 0.012). WC adjusted for hip circumference (HC) showed the strongest association with MACE-3 compared to WHR, WC, or BMI unadjusted for each other (HR: 1.26 [95% CI 1.09 to 1.46]; p = 0.002). Results for CVD-related mortality and all-cause mortality were similar. WC and BMI were risk factors for HF requiring hospitalization, but not WHR or WC adjusted for HC (HR for WC: 1.34 [95% CI 1.16 to 1.54]; p < 0.001; HR for BMI: 1.33 [95% CI 1.17 to 1.50]; p < 0.001). No significant interaction with sex was observed.ConclusionsIn this post hoc analysis of the REWIND placebo group, WHR, WC and/or WC adjusted for HC were risk factors for MACE-3, CVD-related mortality, and all-cause mortality; while BMI was only a risk factor for HF requiring hospitalization. These findings indicate the need for anthropometric measures that consider body fat distribution when assessing CV risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, pathological changes associated with the development of PD may also alter respiration and can lead to chronic episodes of hypoxia and hypercapnia. The mechanism behind impaired ventilation in PD is unclear. Therefore, in this study, we explore the hypercapnic ventilatory response in a reproducible reserpine-induced (RES) model of PD and parkinsonism. We also investigated how dopamine supplementation with L-DOPA, a classic drug used to treat PD, would affect the breathing and respiratory response to hypercapnia. Reserpine treatment resulted in decreased normocapnic ventilation and behavioral changes manifested as low physical activity and exploratory behavior. The respiratory rate and the minute ventilation response to hypercapnia were significantly higher in sham rats compared to the RES group, while the tidal volume response was lower. All of this appears to be due to reduced baseline ventilation values produced by reserpine. L-DOPA reversed reduced ventilation, indicating a stimulatory effect of DA on breathing, and showed the potency of DA supplementation in restoring normal respiratory activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

In order to find a new, systemic marker common to the course of congenital hyperammonemias, we decided to measure the plasma level of S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), which is associated with cerebral impairment. Further, we analyzed three mechanistically diverged but linked with oxidative–nitrosative stress biochemical parameters: 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), a measure of plasma proteins’ nitration; advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), a measure of protein oxidation; and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, a measure of anti-oxidative enzymatic capacity. The plasma biomarkers listed above were determined for the first time in congenital hyperammonemia. Also, the level of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators (i.e., IL-12, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10) and chemokines (IP-10, MCP-1, MIG, and RANTES) were quantified. S100B was positively correlated with plasma ammonia level, while noticeable levels of circulating 3-NT in some of the patients’ plasma did not correlate with ammonia concentration. Overall, the linear correlation between ammonia and S100B but not standard oxidative stress-related markers offers a unique perspective for the future identification and monitoring of neurological deficits risk-linked with hyperammonemia episodes in patients with inherited hyperammonemias.

Transcriptomic\nanalysis of stable GOKM- and OSKM-hiTSCs reveals 94 hTSC-specific genes\nthat are aberrant specifically in OSKM-derived hiTSCs. Through time-courseRNA-seq analysis, H3K4me2 deposition and chromatin accessibility, we\ndemonstrate that GOKM exert greater chromatin opening activity than OSKM.\nWhile GOKM primarily target hTSC-specific loci, OSKM mainly induce the\nhTSC state via targeting hESC and hTSC shared loci.

Disturbances in the level and functioning of NTFs can lead to many diseases of the nervous system, including degenerative diseases, mental diseases, and neurodevelopmental disorders. Each CNS disease is characterized by a unique pathomechanism, however, the involvement of certain processes in its etiology is common, such as neuroinflammation, dysregulation of NTFs levels, or mitochondrial dysfunction. It has been shown that NTFs can control the activation of glial cells by directing them toward a neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory phenotype and activating signaling pathways responsible for neuronal survival. In this review, our goal is to outline the current state of knowledge about the processes affected by NTFs, the crosstalk between NTFs, mitochondria, and the nervous and immune systems, leading to the inhibition of neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and thus the inhibition of the development and progression of CNS disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Recently, upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) doped with lanthanide ions have attracted significant attention. Methods: The efficient internalization of UCNPs by cells was confirmed, and their precise cellular localization was determined by electron microscopy and confocal studies. Results: UCNPs colocalized only with specific organelles, such as early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes. Furthermore, experiments with chemical inhibitors confirmed the involvement of endocytosis in UCNPs internalization and helped select several mechanisms involved in internalization. Exposure to selected UCNPs concentrations did not show significant cytotoxicity, induction of oxidative stress or ultrastructural changes in cells. Conclusion: This study suggests that UCNPs offer new diagnostic options for biomedical infrared imaging."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The aim of this study is to assess the real-life trends and to determine factors associated with the choice of anticoagulation therapy in patients with APE. This is a single center prospective open study. We followed 178 consecutive patients admitted to the tertiary clinical center with APE proven with computed tomography (CT) scan within period of 24 months. A total number of 178 patients with APE were enrolled in the study. 48.9% of subjects were hospitalized in cardiology department. As a prolonged anticoagulant therapy 35.7% of study cohort received direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), 35.1% LMWH, and 29.2% vitamin K antagonists (VKA), respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between the departments regarding frequency of prescribing anticoagulants (p=0.15). The multivariable analysis showed that oral anti-coagulants (OACs) were less likely to be prescribed than LMWH in patients with malignancy, history of major bleeding, serious medical condition and altered mental status. OACs were preferred over LMWH in symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). VKA were significantly less likely to be chosen than DOACs in patients with history of orthopaedics procedure.

The binding affinity of the compounds for human MOR was determined in competitive radioligand binding assays, using fentanyl as standard. For the assays with sigma 1R, a sigma 1R agonist (SKF10047) was employed. The most active analogue was 6d which moderately binds to MOR with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) = 1.9 mu M and to sigma 1R with IC50 = 6.9 mu M.

In this work, we use the CABS-dock tool in two diverse modeling tasks: 1) predicting the structures of amyloid protofilaments and 2) identifying cleavage sites in the peptide substrates of proteolytic enzymes. In the first case, simulations of the simultaneous docking of amyloidogenic peptides indicated that the CABS model can accurately predict the structures of amyloid protofilaments which have an in-register parallel architecture. Scoring based on a combination of symmetry criteria and estimated interaction energy values for bound monomers enables the identification of protofilament models that closely match their experimental structures for 5 out of 6 analyzed systems. For the second task, it has been shown that CABS-dock coarse-grained docking simulations can be used to identify the positions of cleavage sites in the peptide substrates of proteolytic enzymes. The cleavage site position was correctly identified for 12 out of 15 analyzed peptides. When combined with sequence-based methods, these docking simulations may lead to an efficient way of predicting cleavage sites in degraded proteins. The method also provides the atomic structures of enzyme-substrate complexes, which can give insights into enzyme-substrate interactions that are crucial for the design of new potent inhibitors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Here, we employ kinetic assays, atomic force microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and molecular dynamics simulations to study fibrillization patterns of two chimeric peptides, ACC1–13E8 and ACC1–13K8, in which a potent amyloidogenic stretch derived from the N-terminal segment of the insulin A-chain (ACC1–13) is coupled to octaglutamate or octalysine segments, respectively. While large electric charges prevent aggregation of either peptide at neutral pH, stoichiometric mixing of ACC1–13E8 and ACC1–13K8 triggers rapid self-assembly of two-component fibrils driven by favorable Coulombic interactions. The low-symmetry nonpolar ACC1–13 pilot sequence is crucial in enforcing the fibrillar structure consisting of parallel β-sheets as the self-assembly of free poly-E and poly-K chains under similar conditions results in amorphous antiparallel β-sheets. Interestingly, ACC1–13E8 forms highly ordered fibrils also when paired with nonpolypeptide polycationic amines such as branched polyethylenimine, instead of ACC1–13K8. Such synthetic polycations are more effective in triggering the fibrillization of ACC1–13E8 than poly-K (or poly-E in the case of ACC1–13K8). The high conformational flexibility of these polyamines makes up for the apparent mismatch in periodicity of charged groups. The results are discussed in the context of mechanisms of heterogeneous disease-related amyloidogenesis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936e878c28a0473a964d","602e12609543c7410626ebbd","634f612b752340623bbe6531","5e709358878c28a0473a7b5f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In this study, we investigated whether prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) induces changes in purinergic receptor expression in adolescence and whether it corresponds to glial cell activation. Pregnant dams were subjected to an intraperitoneal injection of VPA at embryonic day 12.5. In the hippocampi of adolescent male VPA offspring, we observed an increase in the level of P2X1, with concomitant decreases in P2X7 and P2Y1 receptors. In contrast, in the cortex, the level of P2X1 was significantly reduced. Also, significant increases in cortical P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors were detected. Additionally, we observed profound alterations in microglial cell numbers and morphology in the cortex of VPA animals, leading to the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. The changes in glial cells were partially reduced via a single administration of a non-selective P2 receptor antagonist. These studies show the involvement of purinergic signalling imbalance in the modulation of brain inflammatory response induced via prenatal VPA exposure and may indicate that purinergic receptors are a novel target for pharmacological intervention in ASDs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We investigated how P1R activity affects renal circulation and excretion in diabetic (DM) and normoglycaemic (NG) rats; the receptors’ interactions with bioavailable NO and H2O2 were also explored. The effects of adenosine deaminase (ADA, nonselective P1R inhibitor) and P1A2a-R-selective antagonist (CSC) were examined in anaesthetised rats, both after short-lasting (2-weeks, DM-14) and established (8-weeks, DM-60) streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemia, and in normoglycaemic age-matched animals (NG-14, NG-60, respectively). The arterial blood pressure, perfusion of the whole kidney and its regions (cortex, outer-, and inner medulla), and renal excretion were determined, along with the in situ renal tissue NO and H2O2 signals (selective electrodes). The ADA treatment helped to assess the P1R-dependent difference in intrarenal baseline vascular tone (vasodilation in DM and vasoconstriction in NG rats), with the difference being more pronounced between DM-60 and NG-60 animals. The CSC treatment showed that in DM-60 rats, A2aR-dependent vasodilator tone was modified differently in individual kidney zones. Renal excretion studies after the ADA and CSC treatments showed that the balance of the opposing effects of A2aRs and other P1Rs on tubular transport, seen in the initial phase, was lost in established hyperglycaemia. Regardless of the duration of the diabetes, we observed a tonic effect of A2aR activity on NO bioavailability. Dissimilarly, the involvement of P1R in tissue production of H2O2, observed in normoglycaemia, decreased. Our functional study provides new information on the changing interaction of adenosine in the kidney, as well as its receptors and NO and H2O2, in the course of streptozotocin diabetes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are responsible for viral polyprotein cleavage—a process crucial for viral survival and replication. Recently it was shown that 2-phenylbenzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one (ebselen), an organoselenium anti-inflammatory small-molecule drug, is a potent, covalent inhibitor of both the proteases and its potency was evaluated in enzymatic and antiviral assays. In this study, we screened a collection of 34 ebselen and ebselen diselenide derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and Mpro inhibitors. Our studies revealed that ebselen derivatives are potent inhibitors of both the proteases. We identified three PLpro and four Mpro inhibitors superior to ebselen. Independently, ebselen was shown to inhibit the N7-methyltransferase activity of SARS-CoV-2 nsp14 protein involved in viral RNA cap modification. Hence, selected compounds were also evaluated as nsp14 inhibitors. In the second part of our work, we employed 11 ebselen analogues—bis(2-carbamoylaryl)phenyl diselenides—in biological assays to evaluate their anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in Vero E6 cells.

However, due to issues associated with grafting, especially the surgical risks and soaring prices of the procedures, alternatives are being extensively sought and researched. Fibrous and non-fibrous materials, synthetic substitutes or cell-based products are just a few examples of research directions explored as potential solutions. A very promising subgroup of these replacements involves hydrogels. Biomaterials resembling the bone extracellular matrix and therefore acting as three-dimensional scaffolds, providing the appropriate mechanical support and basis for cell growth and tissue regeneration. Additional possibility of use of various stimuli in the form of growth factors, cells, etc., within the hydrogel structure, extends their use as bioactive agent delivery platforms and acts in favor of their further directed development.

Altered splicing patterns are observed in many different tumors and affect all hallmarks of cancer: growth signal independence, avoidance of apoptosis, unlimited proliferation, invasiveness, angiogenesis, and metabolism. In this review, we focus on the interplay between driver oncogenes and alternative splicing in cancer. On one hand, oncogenic proteins—mutant p53, CMYC, KRAS, or PI3K—modify the alternative splicing landscape by regulating expression, phosphorylation, and interaction of splicing factors with spliceosome components. Some splicing factors—SRSF1 and hnRNPA1—are also driver oncogenes. At the same time, aberrant splicing activates key oncogenes and oncogenic pathways: p53 oncogenic isoforms, the RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway, the PI3K-mTOR pathway, the EGF and FGF receptor families, and SRSF1 splicing factor. The ultimate goal of cancer research is a better diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients. In the final part of this review, we discuss present therapeutic opportunities and possible directions of further studies aiming to design therapies targeting alternative splicing mechanisms in the context of driver oncogenes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We hypothesized hybrid epicardial-endocardial ablation (HA) would have superior effectiveness compared to CA, including repeat (rCA), in PersAF/LSPAF. Methods: CEASE-AF (NCT02695277) is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled trial. Nine hospitals in Poland, Czech Republic, Germany, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands enrolled eligible participants with symptomatic, drug refractory PersAF and left atrial diameter (LAD) > 4.0 cm or LSPAF. Randomization was 2:1 to HA or CA by an independent statistician and stratified by site. Treatment assignments were masked to the core rhythm monitoring laboratory. For HA, pulmonary veins (PV) and left posterior atrial wall were isolated with thoracoscopic epicardial ablation including left atrial appendage exclusion. Endocardial touch-up ablation was performed 91–180 days post-index procedure. For CA, endocardial PV isolation and optional substrate ablation were performed. rCA was permitted between days 91–180. Primary effectiveness was freedom from AF/atrial flutter/atrial tachycardia >30-s through 12-months absent class I/III anti-arrhythmic drugs except those not exceeding previously failed doses. It was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population who had the index procedure and follow-up data. Major complications were assessed in the ITT population who had the index procedure. Thirty-six month follow-up continues. Findings: Enrollment began November 20, 2015 and ended May 22, 2020. In 154 ITT patients (102 HA; 52 CA), 75% were male, mean age was 60.7 ± 7.9 years, mean LAD was 4.7 ± 0.4 cm, and 81% had PersAF. Primary effectiveness was 71.6% (68/95) in HA versus 39.2% (20/51) in CA (absolute benefit increase: 32.4% [95% CI 14.3%–48.0%], p < 0.001).

common intracranial tumors in adults. Abnormal microRNA (miRNA) expression plays a role in their pathogenesis. Change in miRNA expression level can be caused by impaired epigenetic regulation of miRNA-encoding genes. We found the genomic region covering the MIR193B gene to be DNA hypermethylated in meningiomas based on analysis of genome-wide methylation (HumanMethylation450K Illumina arrays). Hypermethylation of MIR193B was also confirmed via bisulfite pyrosequencing. Both hsa-miR-193b-3p and hsa-miR-193b-5p are downregulated in meningiomas. Lower expression of hsa-miR-193b-3p and higher MIR193B methylation was observed in World Health Organization (WHO) grade (G) II/III tumors as compared to GI meningiomas. CCND1 mRNA was identified as a target of hsa-miR-193b-3p as further validated using luciferase reporter assay in IOMM-Lee meningioma cells. IOMM-Lee cells transfected with hsa-miR-193b-3p mimic showed a decreased cyclin D1 level and lower cell viability and proliferation, confirming the suppressive nature of this miRNA. Cyclin D1 protein expression (immunoreactivity) was higher in atypical than in benign meningiomas, accordingly to observations of lower hsa-miR-193b-3p levels in GII tumors. The commonly observed hypermethylation of MIR193B in meningiomas apparently contributes to the downregulation of hsa-miR-193b-3p. Since hsa-miR-193b-3p regulates proliferation of meningioma cells through negative regulation of cyclin D1 expression, it seems to be an important tumor suppressor in meningiomas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The use of models based on induced pluripotent stem cells or oligodendrocyte-like cell lines has many advantages but raises significant questions, such as inaccurate reproduction of neural tissue or genetic instability. Moreover, in a specific case of studying the biology of neonatal OPCs, it is particularly difficult to find good representative model, due to the unique metabolism and features of these cells, as well as neonatal brain tissue. The following study evaluates two methods of isolating OPCs from rat pups as a model for in vitro studies. The first protocol is a modification of the classical mixed glial culture with series of shakings applied to isolate the fraction of OPCs. The second protocol is based on direct cell sorting and uses magnetic microbeads that target the surface antigen of the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell—A2B5. We compared the performance of these methods and analyzed the purity of obtained cultures as well as oligodendrocyte differentiation. Although the yield of OPCs collected with these two methods is similar, both have their advantages and disadvantages. The OPCs obtained with both methods give rise to mature oligodendrocytes within a few days of culture in ITS-supplemented serum-free medium and a 5% O2 atmosphere (mimicking the endogenous oxygen conditions of the nervous tissue)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Neuropathy affects 25% of people with diabetes mellitus. The evaluation of disease severity is still a challenge for modern medicine. Many screening instruments are based primarily on clinical criteria. There is a lack of a simple, reliable and precise scoring system that could improve the classification of neuropathy and monitor disease progression using not only clinical criteria but also electroneurography. There is a need to find sensitive neurography parameters that reflect peripheral nerve impairments in this group of patients.\n\nObjectives. This study aimed to create a scoring system for diabetic neuropathy, based on electroneurography criteria, that reflects the natural course of the disease. A new scoring system will improve the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\nMaterials and methods. A total of 113 patients with distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (DSPN) were involved in the study. Median, ulnar, sural, tibial, and peroneal nerves were examined. Parameters such as amplitude, conduction velocity, distal latency, and F wave latency were analyzed. The results of nerve conduction studies in the investigated group were compared to those of the control group, which consisted of 61 healthy volunteers.\n\nResults. The most sensitive parameter of peripheral nerve impairment severity was a reduction of the sensory action potential amplitude in the peroneal nerve by 72.8% (p < 0.05). The observation of changes in sensory action potential amplitudes in the peroneal nerve is the most important element of our scoring system.\n\nConclusions. A new electroneurography scoring system of DSPN severity should be based on sensory and motor action potential amplitudes that reflect axonal loss in the examined nerves and the nature of the disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Ren-2 transgenic rats (TGR) were employed as a model of ANG II-dependent hypertension. HF was induced by creating the aorto-caval fistula (ACF). One week after ACF creation or sham-operation, the animals were prepared for studies evaluating in vivo RBF autoregulatory capacity and the pressure-natriuresis characteristics after stepwise changes in renal arterial pressure (RAP) induced by aortic clamping. In ACF TGR the basal mean arterial pressure, RBF, urine flow (UF), and absolute sodium excretion (UNaV) were all significantly lower tha n in sham-operated TGR. In the latter, reductions in renal arterial pressure (RAP) significantly decreased RBF whereas in ACF TGR they did not change. Stepwise reductions in RAP resulted in marked decreases in UF and UNaV in sham-operated as well as in ACF TGR, however, these decreases were significantly greater in the former. Our data show that compared with sham-operated TGR, ACF TGR displayed well-maintained RBF autoregulatory capacity and improved slope of the pressure-natriuresis relationship. Thus, even though in the very early HF stage renal dysfunction was demonstrable, in the HF model of ANG II-dependent hypertensive rat such dysfunction and the subsequent HF decompensation cannot be simply ascribed to impaired renal autoregulation and pressure-natriuresis relationship."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Previous studies reported a relationship between the course of COVID‑19 and a history of cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD).\nObjectives: We aimed to analyze the influence of CV risk factors, established CVD, and treatment with CV drugs on short- and long‑term survival in patients hospitalized for COVID‑19.\nPatients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed data of patients hospitalized in 13 COVID‑19 hospitals in Poland (between March and October 2020). Individual deaths during the follow‑up were recorded until March 2021.\nResults: Overall, 2346 patients with COVID‑19 were included (mean age, 61 years; 50.2% women). A total of 341 patients (14.5%) died during the hospitalization, and 95 (4.7%) died during the follow‑up. Independent predictors of in‑hospital death were older age, a history of established CVD, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), while treatment with renin‑angiotensin‑aldosterone system blockers or statins was associated with a lower risk of death during hospitalization. Factors that independently predicted death during the follow‑up were older age, a history of established CVD, CKD, and a history of cancer. The presence of CV risk factors did not increase the odds of death either in the hospital or during the follow‑up. Of note, higher systolic blood pressure and oxygen blood saturation on admission were associated with better short- and long‑term prognosis.\nConclusion: Established CVD and CKD were the main predictors of mortality during both the hospitalization and the follow‑up in the patients hospitalized for COVID‑19, while the use of CV drugs during the hospitalization was associated with better prognosis. The presence of CV risk factors did not increase the odds of in‑hospital and postdischarge death."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709321878c28a0473a351b","5e7094dd878c28a0473c5960","607168479543c745d80e5c45","5e7093ce878c28a0473b11dd","5e709322878c28a0473a35bb"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Astrocyte-derived Gln is the precursor for the two most important neurotransmitters in the central nervous system (CNS), which are the excitatory neurotransmitter Glu and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. In addition to their roles in neurotransmission, these amino acids can be used as alternative substrates in brain metabolism that enable metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons in the glutamate–glutamine cycle (GGC). The disturbed homeostasis of these amino acids within the tripartite synapse may be involved in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases. Interactions between astrocytes and neurons in terms of Gln, Glu, and GABA homeostasis were studied in different phases of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) in Lewis rats. The results of the study showed a decrease in the transport (uptake and release) of Gln and GABA in both neuronal and astrocyte-derived fractions. These effects were fully or partially reversed when the EAE rats were treated with memantine, a NMDA receptor antagonist. Changes in the expression and activity of selected glutamine/glutamate metabolizing enzymes, such as glutamine synthase (GS) and phosphate-activated glutaminase (PAG), which were affected by memantine, were observed in different phases of EAE. The results suggested perturbed homeostasis of Gln, Glu, and GABA during EAE, which may indicate alterations in neuron–astrocyte coupling and dysfunction of the tripartite synapse. Memantine appears to partially regulate the disturbed relationships between Gln, Glu, and GABA."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However,\nwhether and how these two systems are related to each other is still unknown. Of interest, both factors are\ndysregulated in developing and adult brain diseases, including white matter injury and cancer, making the\nunderstanding of their reciprocal interactions of potential importance for identifying new targets and strategies\nfor myelin repair. Here, by a combined pharmacological and biotechnological approach, we examined regulatory\nmechanisms linking WNT signaling to GPR17 expression in OLs. We first analyzed the relative expression of\nmRNAs encoding for GPR17 and the T cell factor/Lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (TCF/LEF) transcription\nfactors of the canonical WNT/β-CATENIN pathway, in PDGFRα+ and O4+ OLs during mouse post-natal development. In O4+ cells, Gpr17 mRNA level peaked at post-natal day 14 and then decreased concomitantly to the\nphysiological uprise of WNT tone, as shown by increased Lef1 mRNA level. The link between WNT signaling and\nGPR17 expression was further reinforced in vitro in primary PDGFRα+ cells and in Oli-neu cells. High WNT tone\nimpaired OL differentiation and drastically reduced GPR17 mRNA and protein levels. In Oli-neu cells, WNT/\nβ-CATENIN activation repressed Gpr17 promoter activity through both putative WNT response elements (WRE)\nand upregulation of the inhibitor of DNA-binding protein 2 (Id2). We conclude that the WNT pathway influences\nOL maturation by repressing GPR17, which could have implications in pathologies characterized by dysregulations of the OL lineage including multiple sclerosis and oligodendroglioma."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In physiological conditions, they play a protective role against autoimmunity and an excessively exuberant inflammatory response, but in cancer, they inhibit the immunological response and elimination of tumor cells. Immunotherapy-mediated blockade of these receptors can enhance the anti-tumor activity of T lymphocytes. Of major interest in this context are two independently acting receptors known as T cell inhibitory receptors. These are cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). Immunotherapeutics/antibodies that block these receptors and a ligand for the PD-1 receptor (PD-L1) have been developed. Patients with melanoma are treated using antibodies against IC, including anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) and anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab, nivolumab). For these therapies a bunch of predictive and prognostic factors. Immunotherapy predictive biomarkers can be categorized into three broad groups: tumor genome and neoantigen biomarkers (PD-1/PD-L1, tumor mutational burden); tumor microenvironment biomarkers (tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte); and systemic biomarkers (e.g., peripheral blood cell biomarkers, biomarkers of circulating tumor DNA, microbiota). In this work, the first two groups of biomarkers will be described. In the histopathology analyses, intratumoral biomarkers like PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 as well as immune cell infiltration and circulating immune and tumor cells have predictive value for therapy efficacy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Tight control of transport across the barrier means that most drugs, particularly large size, which includes powerful biologicals, cannot reach their targets in the brain. Notwithstanding the remarkable advances in characterizing the cellular nature of the BBB and consequences of BBB dysfunction in pathology (brain metastasis, neurological diseases), it remains challenging to deliver drugs to the CNS. Herein, we outline the basic architecture and key molecular constituents of the BBB. In addition, we review the current status of approaches that are being explored to temporarily open the BBB in order to allow accumulation of therapeutics in the CNS. Undoubtedly, the major concern in field is whether it is possible to open the BBB in a meaningful way without causing negative consequences. In this context, we have also listed few other important key considerations that can improve our understanding about the dynamics of the BBB."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, injury and inflammation may deteriorate lymphatic' s endothelial and muscle cells and valves. In consequence, lymphatic vessels (LVs) become insufficient. Their contraction strength and rate slow down, and then lymph flow stops. Our study aimed to investigate the changes in lymph flow in early lymphedema cases.Methods and Results: In 36 patients with unilateral lymphedema stages 0 and I, we performed indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography, lymphoscintigraphy, skin water concentration, and stiffness measurement. We compared lymph flow velocity, LVs' appearance, contraction pattern, and rate between swollen and healthy limbs. ICG lymphography revealed (1) slower lymph flow after 3 minutes of foot movement; in lower calf level, lymphatics are seen in 22 (61.1%) swollen limbs compared with 36 (100%) healthy limbs (p < 0.0001); (2) dye spots in the foot (47.1%) and calves (13.9%) in swollen limbs; (3) dilated foot (41.7%) and calves' lymphatics (52.8%); (4) different patterns of lymphatics contractility with slower contractions rate and (5) higher fluorescent intensity in edema limbs. There was higher skin water concentration at foot and ankle level and higher skin stiffness in the foot.Conclusions: Our studies have shown the distortion in lymphatic function as dilatation, slower lymph flow, slower contraction rate, presence of areas with occluded lymphatics (dermal backflow in foot and calves-focal edema), and higher skin water concentration in these regions in limbs with early lymphedema. ICG lymphography can be used for the early detection of LV insufficiency, which allows early prophylactic implementation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

While contemplating modifications to the typical NK1R pharmacophore, we wondered whether the CF3 groups common for many NK1R ligands, could be replaced with some other moiety. Our attention was drawn by the SF5 group, and so we designed, synthesized, and tested ten novel SF5-containing compounds for NK1R affinity. All analogues exhibit detectable NK1R binding, with the best of them, compound 5 a, (3-bromo-5-(pentafluoro-λ6-sulfanyl)benzyl acetyl-L-tryptophanate) binding only slightly worse (IC50=34.3 nM) than the approved NK1R-targeting drug, aprepitant (IC50=27.7 nM). Molecular docking provided structural explanation of SAR. According to our analysis, the SF5 group in our compounds occupies a position similar to that of one of the CF3 groups of aprepitant as found in the crystal structure. Additionally, we checked whether the docking scoring function or energies derived from Fragment Molecular Orbital quantum chemical calculations may be helpful in explaining and predicting the experimental receptor affinities for our analogues. Both these methods produce moderately good results. Overall, this is the first demonstration of the utility of the SF5 group in the design of NK1R ligands."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

A rapidly growing collection of data suggests that the proper regulation of autophagic machinery may provide an efficient tool for suppressing the development of cancer. In this light, AgNPs have emerged as a potential anti-cancer agent to support therapy of the disease. This review summarizes current data indicating the dual role of AgNP-induced autophagy and highlights factors that may influence its protective vs. its toxic potential. It also stresses that our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of autophagy machinery in cancer cells, as well as AgNP-triggered autophagy in both normal and diseased cells, remains insufficient."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The Golgi is a highly dynamic cellular organelle and can be fragmented into ministacks under both physiological and pathological conditions. This phenomenon has also been observed in several neurodegenerative disorders; however, the structure of the Golgi apparatus (GA) in human patients suffering from epilepsy has not been described so far. The aim of this study was to assess the changes in GA architecture in epilepsy.MethodsGolgi visualisation with immunohistochemical staining in the neocortex of adult patients who underwent epilepsy surgery; 3D reconstruction and quantitative morphometric analysis of GA structure in the rat hippocampi upon kainic acid (KA) induced seizures, as well as in vitro studies with the use of Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM in primary hippocampal neurons upon activation were performed.ResultsWe observed GA dispersion in neurons of the human neocortex of patients with epilepsy and hippocampal neurons in rats upon KA-induced seizures. The structural changes of GA were reversible, as GA morphology returned to normal within 24 h of KA treatment. KA-induced Golgi fragmentation observed in primary hippocampal neurons cultured in vitro was largely abolished by the addition of BAPTA-AM.ConclusionsIn our study, we have shown for the first time that the neuronal GA is fragmented in the human brain of patients with epilepsy and rat brain upon seizures. We have shown that seizure-induced GA dispersion can be reversible, suggesting that enhanced neuronal activity induces Golgi reorganisation that is involved in aberrant neuronal plasticity processes that underlie epilepsy. Moreover, our results revealed that elevated cytosolic Ca2+ is indispensable for these KA-induced morphological alterations of GA in vitro.\n\nThe neuronal Golgi apparatus is fragmented in the human brain of patients with epilepsy and rat brain upon seizures. Seizure-induced GA dispersion can be reversible, suggesting that enhanced neuronal activity induces Golgi reorganization that is involved in aberrant neuronal plasticity processes that underlie epilepsy. The driving force behind KA-induced Golgi fragmentation is the elevated cytosolic Ca2+.image"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

Although these tumors are sensitive to radiotherapy/chemotherapy, the standard treatment for localized MCS is only surgical resection, and there are no established treatment guidelines for patients with advanced and metastatic MCS. Due to the low incidence of MCS, the pathology of these tumors is still unknown, and other therapeutic options are lacking. Some studies show the potential role of the PDGF/PPI3K/AKT, PKC/RAF/MEK/ERK, and pRB pathways, and BCL2 overexpression in the pathogenesis of MCS. These findings provide an opportunity to use protein kinases and BCL2 inhibitors as potential therapy in MCS. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about MCS diagnosis and treatment options. We show the immunological and molecular biomarkers used in the diagnosis of MCS. In addition, we discuss the known prognostic and predictive factors in MCS. Finally, we present the novel trends, including targeted therapies and ongoing clinical trials using protein kinase inhibitors and the death receptor 5 (DR5) agonist, which may be the focus of future MCS treatment studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This area of knowledge integrates and compiles all concepts and strategies dealing with the neurorestoration. Although currently, this discipline has already been well recognized by physicians and scientists throughout the world, this article aimed at broadening its knowledge to the academic circle and the public society. Here we shortly introduced why and how Neurorestoratology was born since the fact that the central nervous system (CNS) can be repaired and the subsequent scientific evidence of the neurorestorative mechanisms behind, such as neurostimulation or neuromodulation, neuroprotection, neuroplasticity, neurogenesis, neuroregeneration or axonal regeneration or sprouting, neuroreplacement, loop reconstruction, remyelination, immunoregulation, angiogenesis or revascularization, and others. The scope of this discipline is the improvement of therapeutic approaches for neurological diseases and the development of neurorestorative strategies through the comprehensive efforts of experts in the different areas and all articulated by the associations of Neurorestoratology and its journals. Strikingly, this article additionally explores the \"state of art\" of the Neurorestoratology field. This includes the development process of the discipline, the achievements and advances of novel neurorestorative treatments, the most efficient procedures exploring and evaluating outcome after the application of pioneer therapies, all the joining of a multidisciplinary expert associations and the specialized journals being more and more impact. We believe that in a near future, this discipline will evolve fast, leading to a general application of cell-based comprehensive neurorestorative treatments to fulfill functional recovery demands for patients with neurological deficits or dysfunctions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The extent to which genetic risk, as identifed by Genome Wide\nAssociation Study (GWAS), correlates to disease prevalence in diferent populations has not been investigated systematically. Here, we studied 14 diferent complex disorders and explored whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) based\non current GWAS correlate to disease prevalence within Europe and around the world. A clear variation in GWASbased genetic risk was observed based on ancestry and we identifed populations that have a higher genetic liability\nfor developing certain disorders. We found that for four out of the 14 studied disorders, PRS signifcantly correlates\nto disease prevalence within Europe. We also found signifcant correlations between worldwide disease prevalence\nand PRS for eight of the studied disorders with Multiple Sclerosis genetic risk having the highest correlation to disease prevalence. Based on current GWAS results, the across population diferences in genetic risk for certain disorders\ncan potentially be used to understand diferences in disease prevalence and identify populations with the highest\ngenetic liability. The study highlights both the limitations of PRS based on current GWAS but also the fact that in some\ncases, PRS may already have high predictive power. This could be due to the genetic architecture of specifc disorders\nor increased GWAS power in some cases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Epigenetic modifi cations include DNA methylation and products of active demethylation, post-translational modifi cations of histone proteins (methylation, acetylation and others) and non-coding RNA, especially short non-coding RNA – miRNA. Some epigenetic modifi cations are inherited (so-called non-genetic inheritance) and some are imposed de novo. The epigenome is constant but not immutable as it is subtly modifi ed by endogenous and environmental factors, enabling the cell to respond to changing environmental conditions. Changes accumulate in the epigenome throughout life; this unfavorable process is called epigenetic drift. Age-related changes in the methylation of specifi c CpGs in the genome are used to create epigenetic clocks to assess epigenetic and chronological age and together with other parameters, to create biological clocks that, in addition, assess health status and disease risk. Epigenetic drift is also observed in oral structures. Changes in the methylation level of selected CpGs allow for a fairly precise assessment of the age of these structures. The level of DNA methylation in the oral structures is affected by various environmental factors, including infections and the type of diet."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Cumulative evidence documents that the non-coding single-stranded RNAs, micro RNAs (miRs) control the BBB functioning. However, miRs’ involvement in BBB breakdown in HE is still underexplored. Here, we hypothesized that in rats with acute liver failure (ALF) or rats subjected to hyperammonemia, altered circulating miRs affect BBB composing proteins.\n\nMethods\nTransmission electron microscopy was employed to delineate structural alterations of the BBB in rats with ALF (thioacetamide (TAA) intraperitoneal (ip.) administration) or hyperammonemia (ammonium acetate (OA) ip. administration). The BBB permeability was determined with Evans blue dye and sodium fluorescein assay. Plasma MiRs were profiled by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), followed by in silico analysis. Selected miRs, verified by qRT-PCR, were examined in cultured rat brain endothelial cells. Targeted protein alterations were elucidated with immunofluorescence, western blotting, and, after selected miR mimics transfection, through an in vitro resistance measurement.\n\nResults\nChanges in BBB structure and increased permeability were observed in the prefrontal cortex of TAA rats but not in the brains of OA rats. The NGS results revealed divergently changed miRNA-ome in the plasma of both rat models. The in silico analysis led to the selection of miR-122-5p and miR-183-5p with their target genes occludin and integrin β1, respectively, as potential contributors to BBB alterations. Both proteins were reduced in isolated brain vessels and cortical homogenates in TAA rats. We documented in cultured primary brain endothelial cells that ammonia alone and, in combination with TNFα increases the relative expression of NGS-selected miRs with a less pronounced effect of TNFα when added alone. The in vitro study also confirmed miR-122-5p-dependent decrease in occludin and miR-183-5p-related reduction in integrin β1 expression.\n\nConclusion\nThis work identified, to our knowledge for the first time, potential functional links between alterations in miRs residing in brain endothelium and BBB dysfunction in ALF."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

PS1 undergoes phosphorylation at 353 and 357 serines upon enhanced activity and elevated levels of the GSK3β isoform. PS1 mutations surrounding these serines may alter the stability of the β-catenin complex. Such mutations are found in some cases of familial early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (fEOAD), but their functional impact remains obscure. One of such variants of PS1, the A360T substitution, is located close to GSK3β-targeted serine residues. This variant was recently demonstrated in the French population, but more detail is needed to understand its biological effects. To assess the significance of this variant, we employed functional studies using a fibroblast cell line from an Alzheimer’s disease case (a female proband) carrying the A360T mutation. Based on functional transcriptomic, cellular, and biochemical assays, we demonstrated atypically impaired β-catenin/GSK3β signaling in the A360T patient’s fibroblasts. In detail, this was characterized by a decreased level of active cytosolic β-catenin and bound by PS1, an increased level of nuclear β-catenin, an increased level of inhibited GSK3β phosphorylated on Ser9, and enhanced interaction of GSK3β(Ser9) with PS1. Based on the transcriptomic profile of the A360T fibroblasts, we proposed a dysregulated transcriptional activity of β-catenin, exemplified by increased expression of various cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclins, such as cyclin D1, potentially inducing neurons’ cell cycle re-entry followed by apoptosis. The A360T cells did not exhibit significant amyloid pathology. Therefore, cell death in this PS1 cytosolic loop mutation may be attributed to impaired β-catenin/GSK3β signaling rather than amyloid deposition per se. We further estimated the biological and clinical relevance of the A360T variant by whole exome sequencing (WES). WES was performed on DNA from the blood of an A360T female proband, as well as an unrelated male patient carrying the A360T mutation and his mutation-free daughter (both unavailable for the derivation of the fibroblast cell lines).

However, the lack of standardization in the common analysis method, RT-qPCR, and specifically in the normalization step, has resulted in inconsistent data across studies, hindering miRNA clinical implementation as well as basic research. To address this issue, this study proposes an optimized protocol for key steps in miRNA profiling, which incorporates absorbance-based haemolysis detection for assessing sample quality, double spike-in controls for miRNA isolation and reverse transcription, and the use of 7 stable normalizers verified in an aging population, including healthy subjects and individuals at different stages of Alzheimer's disease (140 subjects). The stability of these 7 normalizers was demonstrated using our novel method called BestmiRNorm for identifying optimal normalizers. BestmiRNorm, developed utilizing the Python programming language, enables the assessment of up to 11 potential normalizers. The standardized application of this optimized RT-qPCR protocol and the recommended normalizers are crucial for the development of miRNAs as biomarkers for AD and other ageing-related diseases in clinical diagnostics and basic research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

Increased glutamine uptake and enhanced glutaminolysis are key metabolic features of many cancers. Glutamine is metabolized by glutaminase (GA), which is encoded by two genes: GLS and GLS2. In contrast to isoforms arising from the GLS gene, which clearly act as oncoproteins, the role of GLS2 products in tumorigenesis is far from well understood. While in some cancer types GLS2 is overexpressed and drives cancer development, in some other types it is downregulated and behaves as a tumor suppressor gene. In this review, we describe the essential functions and regulatory mechanisms of human GLS2 and the cellular compartments in which GLS2 has been localized. Furthermore, we present the context-dependent oncogenic and tumor-suppressor properties of GLS2, and delve into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This study aimed to verify whether lymphedema itself or together with commensal bacterial flora infection contributes to the severity of local inflammation. Edema was induced by interruption of the lymph flow in the rat’s hind limb. Immune cell infiltrates were examined by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Nine-day edema alone did not affect immune cell content in the skin but resulted in a decrease in CD4+ T helper lymphocytes and monocytes in the draining popliteal lymph nodes. In turn, local saprophytic Staphylococcus epidermidis infection of the edematous limb resulted in dense infiltrates of CD68+ macrophages and monocytes, MHC class II antigen-presenting cells, CD90+ stem cells, thymocytes, and immature B cells in the skin, accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in density of CD4+ T helper lymphocytes and monocytes, OX62+ dendritic cells, CD68+ macrophages and monocytes, HiS48+ granulocytes, CD90+ stem cells, thymocytes, and immature B cells in the draining popliteal lymph nodes. These results indicate that the combination of edema and saprophytic bacteria infection induces severe inflammation in the peripheral tissues and results in a delay of antibacterial protection processes in neighboring lymphatic organs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

An expert consensus adapted the Uniform Dataset (UDS)-3 for European centers, the clinician's UDS (cUDS). This study assessed its implementation acceptability and feasibility.\nMethods\nWe developed a survey investigating barriers, facilitators, and willingness to implement the cUDS. With a mixed-methods design, we analyzed data from academic memory clinics.\nResults\nSeventy-eight percent of responding clinicians were experienced neuropsychologists/psychologists and 22% were medical specialists coming from 18 European countries. Sixty-five percent clinicians were willing to implement cUDS. General barriers related to implementation (43%) and clinical-methodological domains (21%). Favorable clinicians reported finances (15%) and digitalization (9%) as facilitating, but unavailability of local norms (23%) as hindering. Unfavorable clinicians reported logistical (23%) and time issues (18%).\nDiscussion\nDespite challenges, data showed moderate clinicians' acceptability and requirements to improve feasibility. Nonetheless, these results come from academic clinicians. The next steps will require feasibility evaluation in non-academic contexts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

A special place is occupied by technologies based on virtual reality (VR). VR tools have already played a significant role in both basic and clinical neuroscience due to their high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity and, above all, high ecological value. Objective: Being in a digital world affects the functioning of the body as a whole and its individual systems. The data obtained so far, both from experimental and modeling studies, as well as (clinical) observations, indicate their great and promising potential, but apart from the benefits, there are also losses and negative consequences for users. Methods: This review was conducted according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework across electronic databases (such as Web of Science Core Collection; PubMed; and Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online and Wiley Online Library) to identify beneficial effects and applications, as well as adverse impacts, especially on brain health in human neuroscience. Results: More than half of these articles were published within the last five years and represent state-of-the-art approaches and results (e.g., 54.7% in Web of Sciences and 63.4% in PubMed), with review papers accounting for approximately 16%. The results show that in addition to proposed novel devices and systems, various methods or procedures for testing, validation and standardization are presented (about 1% of articles). Also included are virtual developers and experts, (bio)(neuro)informatics specialists, neuroscientists and medical professionals. Conclusions: VR environments allow for expanding the field of research on perception and cognitive and motor imagery, both in healthy and patient populations. In this context, research on neuroplasticity phenomena, including mirror neuron networks and the effects of applied virtual (mirror) tasks and training, is of interest in virtual prevention and neurogeriatrics, especially in neurotherapy and neurorehabilitation in basic/clinical and digital neuroscience."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Angiogenesis around tumors is a major factor allowing for their growth and spread. Disrupting NRP-1/VEGF complex formation is thus a promising pathway for the development of new anticancer pharmaceuticals. A large body of work has been produced in the last two decades detailing the development of inhibitors of NRP-1/VEGF complex formation. Among those were peptide A7R and its smaller derivatives KXXR and K(Har)XXR. It has been previously reported that replacement of the XX backbone with triazole residues has a positive effect on the proteolytic stability of inhibitors. It has also been reported that a higher dihedral angle range restriction of the XX backbone has a positive effect on the activity of inhibitors. In this work, we have designed new triazole derivatives of K(Har)XXR inhibitors with substitution allowing for higher range restriction of the XX backbone. The obtained peptidomimetics have greater activity than their less restricted counterparts. One of the newly obtained structures has greater affinity than the reference peptide A7R."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In turn, hematocrit, mean arterial pressure, and renal vascular\nresistance were significantly higher in older animals, whereas renal excretion of NO3-/NO2- and\nvascular endothelial growth factor A and in situ renal tissue NO signal did not differ.

Astrocytes are among the first cells that react to insults against the nervous tissue, the presence of pathogens, misbalance of local tissue homeostasis, and a lack of oxygen and trophic support. Under this background, it remains uncertain if induced astrocyte activation, recognized as astrogliosis, is a friend or foe for progressing neonatal neurodevelopment. Likewise, the state of astrocyte reactivity is considered one of the key factors discriminating between either the initiation of endogenous reparative mechanisms compensating for aberrations in the structures and functions of nervous tissue or the triggering of neurodegeneration. The responses of activated cells are modulated by neighboring neural cells, which exhibit broad immunomodulatory and pro-regenerative properties by secreting a plethora of active compounds (including interleukins and chemokines, neurotrophins, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide synthase and complement components), which are engaged in cell crosstalk in a paracrine manner. As the developing nervous system is extremely sensitive to the influence of signaling molecules, even subtle changes in the composition or concentration of the cellular secretome can have significant effects on the developing neonatal brain. Thus, modulating the activity of other types of cells and their interactions with overreactive astrocytes might be a promising strategy for controlling neonatal astrogliosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that metabolic alkalosis may improve heat loss during intensive exercise in men. Fifteen male subjects aged 22–24 years were submitted to incremental exercise on two randomized occasions one week apart. During the bicarbonate trial exercise was preceded by ingestion of NaHCO3 at a dose 250 mg/kg whilst during the placebo trial lactose was administered. Exercise load was increased every 3 min by 30 W until volitional exhaustion. Ambient temperature was kept at 23–24°C and humidity 50–60%. Tympanic and skin temperatures were recorded and the rate of sweating was assayed by humidity measurement of nitrogen flowing through a capsule attached to the mid posterior chest. Total sweat loss was determined by the changes in body mass. Venous blood samples were taken before exercise and at the end of each workload for determination of acid-base parameters. The subjects attained similar maximal workload in the two tests (260±6 W) with heart rate 185±6 beats/min. Blood concentration of hydrogen ions was lower (p < 0.001) in the bicarbonate than in the placebo trial throughout the whole exercise period. There were no significant differences between these tests in tympanic and mean skin temperatures, sweating rate and total sweat loss. The present data showed that in men attenuation of metabolic acidosis by bicarbonate ingestion did not influence thermoregulation during incremental exercise performed until volitional exhaustion, possibly due to too short duration of exertional uncompensated metabolic acidosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The present study examines its effects on the growth of Salvia viridis hairy roots, and the accumulation of bioactive compounds, and correlates it with the expression of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. To our knowledge, this study represents the first exploration of elicitation in S. viridis culture and the first comprehensive analysis of MJA’s influence on such a wide array of genes within the polyphenol metabolic pathway in the Salvia genus. Plants were treated with 50 and 100 µM MJA, and samples were collected at intervals of one, three, five, and seven days post-elicitation. HPLC analysis revealed that MJA stimulated the accumulation of all tested compounds, with a 30% increase (38.65 mg/g dry weight) in total polyphenol content (TPC) on day five. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of the phenylpropanoid pathway genes—TAT (tyrosine aminotransferase), HPPR (4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate reductase), PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), C4H (cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase), 4CL (4-coumarate-CoA ligase), and RAS (rosmarinic acid synthase)—following MJA treatment. For the majority of the genes, this increase was observed after the first day of treatment. Importantly, our present results confirm strong correlations of the analyzed gene expression with polyphenol biosynthesis. These findings support the notion that hairy roots provide a promising biotechnological framework for augmenting polyphenol production. Additionally, the combination of elicitor treatment and transgenic technology emerges as a viable strategy to enhance the biosynthesis of these valuable metabolites."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Most strokes are ischemic in nature, meaning they are caused by the disruption of cerebral blood flow resulting from obstructed blood vessels. Reperfusion therapies such as thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator and endovascular mechanical thrombectomy are very effective and are becoming game changers for eligible patients. Despite these advances, the achieved effects are insufficient from the perspective of the entire population of stroke patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to expand eligibility for reperfusion therapies and implement adjuvant therapeutic measures. Animal stroke models are at the forefront of these efforts, helping to untangle complex pathophysiology and providing valuable preclinical data to guide further clinical trials. Various stroke models are available, including direct blocking of cerebral arteries or using other means to recapitulate stroke pathophysiology. International advisory boards recommend initial in vivo experiments be performed in smaller animals, such as rodents. However, second testing would be more desirable in larger animals such as cats, pigs, dogs, and non-human primates. Due to larger cerebral volume, gyrencephalization, and higher white/gray matter ratio, large animals are crucial in translational stroke research. Animal stroke models differ in the time and complexity of the stroke induction procedure, the reproducibility rate, the level of similarity to the human condition, and the possibilities for analysis, imaging, and follow-up studies. The choice of the most appropriate stroke model may translate to better bench-to-bedside translation of preclinical stroke research; ideally, this choice should be based solely on scientific merit."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

As a result, combined immunotherapy is being developed as well as immunotherapy with bifunctional checkpoint inhibitory T cell engagers and natural killer cells. Current trials cover tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), vaccination with IKKb-matured dendritic cells, or autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous tumor RNA. Another potential approach to treat UM could be based on T cell receptor engineering rather than antibody modification. Immune-mobilizing monoclonal T cell receptors (TCR) against cancer, called ImmTAC TM molecules, represent such an approach. Moreover, nanomedicine, especially miRNA approaches, are promising for future trials.

We have recently shown that dominant forces driving the self-assembly of insulin fibrils are likely to arise from intermolecular interactions involving the N-terminal segment of the A-chain (ACC1–13). Here, we study how proline substitutions within the pilot GIVEQ sequence of this fragment affect its propensity to aggregate in both neutral and acidic environments. In a reasonable agreement with in silico prediction based on the Cordax algorithm, proline substitutions at positions 3, 4, and 5 turn out to be very effective in preventing aggregation according to thioflavin T-fluorescence-based kinetic assay, infrared spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Since the valine and glutamate side chains within this segment are strongly involved in the interactions with the insulin receptor, we have focused on the possible implications of the Q → P substitution for insulin’s stability and interactions with the receptor. To this end, comparative molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the Q5P mutant and wild-type insulin were carried out for both free and receptor-bound (site 1) monomers. The results point to a mild destabilization of the mutant vis à vis the wild-type monomer, as well as partial preservation of key contacts in the complex between Q5P insulin and the receptor.

We aimed to compare the course of unloading-induced cardiac atrophy in intact (without gonadectomy) male and female rats, and in animals after gonadectomy, to obtain insight into the influence of sex hormones on this process. Heterotopic heart transplantation (HTx) was used as a model for heart unloading. Cardiac atrophy was assessed as the weight ratio of heterotopically transplanted heart weight (HW) to the native HW on days 7 and 14 after HTx in intact male and female rats. In separate experimental groups, gonadectomy was performed in male and female recipient animals 28 days before HTx and the course of cardiac atrophy was again evaluated on days 7 and 14 after HTx. In intact male rats, HTx resulted in significantly greater decreases in whole HW when compared to intact female rats. The dynamics of the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) atrophy after HTx was quite similar to that of whole hearts. Gonadectomy did not have any significant effect on the decreases in whole HW, LV, and RV weights, with similar results in male and female rats. Our results show that the development of unloading-induced cardiac atrophy is substantially reduced in female rats when compared to male rats. Since gonadectomy did not alter the course of cardiac atrophy after HTx, similarly in both male and female rats, we conclude that sex-linked differences in the development of unloading-induced cardiac atrophy are not caused by the activity of sex hormones."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The management of chondrosarcoma remains challenging due to its diverse clinical course and prognosis, which can range from benign to highly aggressive with a huge risk of metastasis. Emerging research has demonstrated the importance of microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation in the pathogenesis of chondrosarcoma. MiRNAs are small, noncoding RNA molecules that play an essential role in gene expression regulation by targeting specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for degradation or translational repression. This article provides an extensive review of current miRNA research in chondrosarcoma, focusing on diagnostic strategies, cell cycle regulation, drug resistance, biomarkers of progression, and stem cell phenotype. We will examine recent studies identifying differentially expressed miRNAs in chondrosarcoma compared to normal cartilage tissue, exploring their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Furthermore, we will discuss the role of miRNAs in regulating cell cycle progression and their potential as therapeutic targets to overcome drug resistance. We will also investigate the prospective utility of miRNAs as biomarkers of progression and their role in modulating the stem cell phenotype of chondrosarcoma cells.

Despite advances in technology and therapeutic options, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders persist as significant challenges in treatment and cure. Recently, there has been a remarkable surge of interest in extracellular vesicles (EVs) as pivotal mediators of intercellular communication. As carriers of molecular cargo, EVs demonstrate the ability to traverse the blood–brain barrier, enabling bidirectional communication. As a result, they have garnered attention as potential biomarkers and therapeutic agents, whether in their natural form or after being engineered for use in the CNS. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to EVs, encompassing various aspects such as their diverse isolation methods, characterization, handling, storage, and different routes for EV administration. Additionally, it underscores the recent advances in their potential applications in neurodegenerative disorder therapeutics. By exploring their unique capabilities, this study sheds light on the promising future of EVs in clinical research. It considers the inherent challenges and limitations of these emerging applications while incorporating the most recent updates in the field."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The structure was subject to the Hirshfeld surface-analysis and CE-B3LYP interaction-energies calculations. The title compound crystallises in the monoclinic P21/c space group with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. The propanoic acid side chain of the studied molecule has a bent conformation. The key supramolecular motif in the crystal structure is a centrosymmetric O–H∙∙∙O hydrogen-bonded dimer (R22(8) in the graph set notation). According to CE-B3LYP, the molecules involved in this motif exhibit the strongest pairwise interaction total energy (Etot = −67.9 kJ/mol). On the other hand, there are seven other interacting molecular pairs with significant Etot values in the range of −17 to −28 kJ/mol. In these, the energy is dominated by the dispersive contribution. A survey of the Cambridge Structural Database revealed that in other 3-phenylpropanoic acid structures, the middle dihedral angle of the propanoic acid side chain is always in the trans conformation. This contrasts the current structure where this dihedral angle is in the gauche conformation. According to the Density Functional Theory calculations in the gas phase (at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pvDZ level), the presence of the two CF3 groups (strong electron-withdrawing character) increases the population of the gauche conformers by a substituent electronic effect, and this may be a minor factor contributing to the appearance of this conformation observed in the solid state."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Despite extensive research on body weight and cardiovascular risk, the mechanistic relationship between weight loss and coronary plaque modification has not been adequately addressed. This study aimed to determine the association between body composition dynamics and low-attenuation coronary plaque (LAP) burden. Methods: Eighty-nine participants (40% women, 60 ± 7.7 years) of the Dietary Intervention to Stop Coronary Atherosclerosis in Computed Tomography (DISCO-CT) study with non-obstructive atherosclerosis with nonobstructive atherosclerosis confirmed in computed tomography angiography (CCTA), a randomized (1:1), prospective, single-center study were included into the analysis. Patients were randomly assigned to either experimental arm (intensive diet and lifestyle intervention atop optimal medical therapy, n = 45) or control arm (optimal medical therapy alone, n = 44) over 66.8 ± 13.7 weeks. Changes (∆) in body mass (BM) and body composition parameters, including total body fat (TBF), skeletal muscle mass (SMM), and fat-to-muscle ratio (FMR), measured with bioimpedance analyzer were compared with CCTA-measured ∆LAP. Coronary plaque analysis was performed using the 2 × 192 dual-energy scanner (Somatom Force, Siemens, Germany), while quantitative coronary plaque measurements were performed using a semi-automated plaque analysis software system (QAngioCT v3.1.3.13, Medis Medical Imaging Systems, Leiden, The Netherlands). Results: Significant intergroup differences were found for ∆BM (−3.6 ± 4.9 kg in the experimental vs. −1.4 ± 2.9 kg in the control group, p = 0.015), ∆TBF (−3.4 ± 4.8% in the experimental vs. 1.1 ± 5.5% in the control arm, p < 0.001), ∆SMM (1.9 ± 2.8% in the experimental vs. −0.7 ± 3.2% in the control arm, p < 0.001), and FMR [−12.9 (−21.2; −4.3)% in the experimental vs. 3.1 (−5.3; 10.7)% in the control arm, p < 0.001]. ∆LAP did not differ significantly between the study arms; however, in the whole study population, ∆LAP was positively correlated with ∆BM, ∆TBF, and ∆FMR (r = 0.45, p < 0.001; r = 0.300, p = 0.004; r = 0.233, p = 0.028, respectively), and negatively with ∆SMM (r = −0.285, p = 0.007). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed the association of ∆LAP with ∆BM, ∆TBF, and ∆FMR. Conclusions: The study intervention resulted in BM reduction characterized by fat loss, skeletal muscle gain, and increased FMR. This weight loss pattern may lead to a reduction in high-risk coronary plaque. Compared to a simple weight control, tracking body composition changes over time can provide valuable information on adverse coronary plaque modification."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedd","uid":"bnZkjlIS-zU9N_A3Sr6fZKw","uuid":"10bec212-96e2-4fda-a6e1-15cc727d814b","name":"Narodowy Instytut Kardiologii Stefana Kardynała Wyszyńskiego – Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afec7","5e7093bb878c28a0473afec8","660c00ea40970773c9b0bf34","660c00ea40970773c9b0bf33","6110ef519543c757bc08282d","5e7093bb878c28a0473afeca","5e7093bd878c28a0473afed7","5e7093bd878c28a0473afedd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedd","parentUuid":"10bec212-96e2-4fda-a6e1-15cc727d814b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedd","rootUuid":"10bec212-96e2-4fda-a6e1-15cc727d814b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","uid":"bc81RPyqL4Br7M4bOIzt-xA","uuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","name":"Akademia Ekonomiczno-Humanistyczna w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933a878c28a0473a54b3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","parentUuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","rootUuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The incidence of ASD is more prevalent in males compared to females, but the underlying mechanism, as well as molecular indications for identifying sex-specific differences in ASD symptoms remain unknown. Thus, impacting the development of personalized strategy towards pharmacotherapy of ASD. The current study employs an integrated bioinformatic approach to investigate the genes and pathways uniquely associated with sex specific differences in autistic individuals. Based on microarray dataset (GSE6575) extracted from the gene expression omnibus, the dysregulated genes between the autistic and the neurotypical individuals for both sexes were identified. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to ascertain biological activities linked to the dysregulated genes. Protein–protein interaction network analysis was carried out to identify hub genes. The identified hub genes were examined to determine their functions and involvement in the associated pathways using Enrichr. Additionally, hub genes were validated from autism-associated databases and the potential small molecules targeting the hub genes were identified. The present study utilized whole blood transcriptomic gene expression analysis data and identified 2211 and 958 differentially expressed unique genes in males and females respectively. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that male hub genes were functionally associated with RNA polymerase II mediated transcriptional regulation whereas female hub genes were involved in intracellular signal transduction and cell migration. The top male hub genes exhibited functional enrichment in tyrosine kinase signalling pathway. The pathway enrichment analysis of male hub genes indicates the enrichment of papillomavirus infection. Female hub genes were enriched in androgen receptor signalling pathway and functionally enriched in focal adhesion specific excision repair. Identified drug like candidates targeting these genes may serve as a potential sex specific therapeutics. Wortmannin for males, 5-Fluorouracil for females had the highest scores. Targeted and sex-specific pharmacotherapies may be created for the management of ASD. The current investigation identifies sex-specific molecular signatures derived from whole blood which may serve as a potential peripheral sex-specific biomarkers for ASD. The study also uncovers the possible pharmacological interventions against the selected genes/pathway, providing support in development of therapeutic strategies to mitigate ASD. However, experimental proofs on biological systems are warranted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Due to recent intensive genomic research, the taxonomy of yeast is becoming more organized based on the identification of monophyletic taxa. This includes genera important to humans, such as Kazachstania. Until now, Kazachstania humilis (previously Candida humilis) was regarded as a sourdough-specific yeast. In addition, any antibacterial activity has not been associated with this species.\nResults\nPreviously, we isolated a yeast strain that impaired bio-hydrogen production in a dark fermentation bioreactor and inhibited the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Here, using next generation sequencing technologies, we sequenced the genome of this strain named K. humilis MAW1. This is the first genome of a K. humilis isolate not originating from a fermented food. We used novel phylogenetic approach employing the 18 S-ITS-D1-D2 region to show the placement of the K. humilis MAW1 among other members of the Kazachstania genus. This strain was examined by global phenotypic profiling, including carbon sources utilized and the influence of stress conditions on growth. Using the well-recognized bacterial model Escherichia coli AB1157, we show that K. humilis MAW1 cultivated in an acidic medium inhibits bacterial growth by the disturbance of cell division, manifested by filament formation. To gain a greater understanding of the inhibitory effect of K. humilis MAW1, we selected 23 yeast proteins with recognized toxic activity against bacteria and used them for Blast searches of the K. humilis MAW1 genome assembly. The resulting panel of genes present in the K. humilis MAW1 genome included those encoding the 1,3-β-glucan glycosidase and the 1,3-β-glucan synthesis inhibitor that might disturb the bacterial cell envelope structures.\nConclusions\nWe characterized a non-sourdough-derived strain of K. humilis, including its genome sequence and physiological aspects. The MAW1, together with other K. humilis strains, shows the new organization of the mating-type locus.

Recent evidence suggests that tau protein is a putative target for the treatment of dementia, and the tau aggregation inhibitor, hydromethylthionine mesylate (HMTM), has emerged as a potential disease-modifying treatment. However, its efficacy was diminished in patients already receiving approved acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In this study, we ask whether this negative interaction can also be mimicked in experimental tau models of AD and whether the underlying mechanism can be understood. From a previous age profiling study, 6-month-old line 1 (L1) tau transgenic mice were characterized by a severe reduction in several cholinergic markers. We therefore assessed whether long-term pre-exposure with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine alone and in conjunction with the tau aggregation inhibitor HMTM can reverse cholinergic deficits in L1. Rivastigmine and HMTM, and combinations of the two compounds were administered orally for 11 weeks to both L1 and wild-type mice. The brains were sectioned with a focus on the basal forebrain, motor cortex and hippocampus. Immunohistochemical staining and quantification of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine kinase A (TrkA)-positive neurons and relative optical intensity (ROI) for vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) reactivity confirmed reversal of the diminished cholinergic phenotype of interneurons (nucleus accumbens, striatum) and projection neurons (medial septum, nucleus basalis magnocellularis) by HMTM, to a greater extent than by rivastigmine alone in L1 mice. Combined administration did not yield additivity but, in most proxies, led to antagonistic effects in which rivastigmine decreased the benefits shown with HMTM alone. Local markers (VAChT and AChE) in target structures of the basal forebrain, motor cortex and hippocampal CA3 seemed to be normalized by HMTM, but not by rivastigmine or the combination of both drugs. HMTM, which was developed as a tau aggregation inhibitor, strongly decreased the tau load in L1 mice, however, not in combination with rivastigmine. Taken together, these data confirm a cholinergic phenotype in L1 tau transgenic mice that resembles the deficits observed in AD patients. This phenotype is reversible by HMTM, but at the same time appears to be subject to a homeostatic regulation induced by chronic pre-treatment with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which interferes with the efficacy of HMTM. The strongest phenotypic reversal coincided with a normalization of the tau load in the cortex and hippocampus of L1, suggesting that tau accumulation underpins the loss of cholinergic markers in the basal forebrain and its projection targets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

This is caused by skin and subcutaneous tissue stiffness due to fibrosis. Edema fluid accumulates deep in the subcutaneous tissue. Evacuating this fluid requires a high external compression force to overcome the resistance of fibrous tissue. We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the compression method, with high pressure lasting for 3 days. Methods and Results: Twenty-one patients with lower limb lymphedema, stage III, of the postinflammatory type were included. Patients with acute inflammatory symptoms, venous thrombosis, profuse varicose veins, diabetes, and cardiac insufficiency with edema were excluded. A 10-cm-wide rubber bandage was applied to the foot and calf. The interface pressure measured using PicoPress ranged from 58 to 120 mmHg. Skin and deep tissue tonometry, skin water concentration, leg circumference, and drop of interface pressure were measured. Ultrasound examination was done before and after each compression session. The calf circumference decreased by 15.9 ± 5.4%, deep tissue stiffness by 58.9 ± 18.9%, skin stiffness by 69.6 ± 13.5%, and skin water concentration by 43.8 ± 11.5%. Interface pressure dropped to 66.3 mmHg (28-110 mmHg); ultrasonography images showed less fluid in the tissue. Conclusions: High-pressure 30-minute leg compression can remove excess edema fluid within 3 days and enable adjustment of nonstretch compression stockings. This method is more effective in advanced lymphedema at the beginning of therapy than the standard 30-50-mmHg bandaging as it provides an immediate effect."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

These properties, especially the wide FOV, make LDHM a promising tool for the population-wise characterization of biological cell cultures with single cell precision. Cell cultures grow in a controlled environment, and the slightest change in environmental conditions can have a significant impact. The same principles apply to imaging. Any alteration in the imaging process can disrupt natural growth and potentially lead to false conclusions during comparison to the control culture. A crucial challenge is to maintain the same environmental conditions. To address this, we propose a novel setup for simultaneous imaging on three parallel in-line LDHM systems, with cameras mounted on one rail (movable to realize multi-height hologram recording for iterative reconstruction), all sample holders mounted on the second rail, and all sources of light mounted on the third rail. Based on the collected holograms and their efficient reconstruction, it is possible to calculate migration parameters such as the average speed of a single cell or a predefined group of cells (e.g., big cells or slow cells) and statistics regarding cell number, size and speed over time."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

To date, the clinical application of hiPSCs has been limited due to safety issues. The present study aims to standardize the safety procedure of the derivation of GMP-compliant induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from human fibroblasts. The hiPSC lines were generated using the nonintegrative Sendai virus method to incorporate Yamanaka reprogramming factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC) into cells. A constant temperature was maintained during the cell culture, including all stages of the culture after transduction with Sendai virus. Pluripotency was proved in six independently generated hiPSC lines from adult female (47 years old) and male (57 years old) donors’ derived fibroblasts via alkaline phosphatase live (ALP) staining, qPCR, and immunocytochemistry. The hiPSC lines showed a gradual decrease in the presence of the virus with each subsequent passage, and this reduction was specific to the hiPSC line. The frequency and probability of chromosomal aberrations in hiPSCs were dependent on both the iPSC clone identity and sex of the donor. In summary, the generation of hiPSC for clinical applications requires safety standards application (biosafety protocol, quality control of hiPSC lines, viral and genetic integrity screening) from the first stages of the clonal selection of hiPSC from the same donor."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is the most widely used BFR in the world to improve the fire safety of laminates in electrical and electronic equipment. Aroclor 1254, one of the PCBs, is widely distributed in the environment due to its extensive use in industrial applications around the world. Both groups of substances are potent toxicants. There is also increasing evidence that they have neurotoxic effects. In this study we tested the pro-inflammatory effects of Aroclor 1254 and TBBPA based on markers of microglial reactivity and levels of pro-inflammatory factors in the brain of immature rats. Aroclor 1254 or TBBPA were administered to the rats by oral gavage for two weeks at a dose of 10 mg/kg b.w. Both light and electron microscopy studies revealed features indicative of microglia activation in brains of exposed rats. Morphological changes were associated with overexpression of pro-inflammatory enzymes such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Analysis of cytokine/chemokine array revealed significant secretion of inflammatory mediators following exposure to both TBBPA and Aroclor 1254, which was stronger in the cerebellum than in the forebrain of exposed immature rats. The results indicate a pro-inflammatory profile of microglia activation as one of the neurotoxic mechanisms of both examined toxicants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Increasing evidence indicates that neuroinflammation plays an important role in ALS’s pathogenesis and disease progression. Neuroinflammatory responses, primarily driven by activated microglia and astrocytes, and followed by infiltrating peripheral immune cells, contribute to exacerbate/accelerate MN death. In particular, the role of the microglia in ALS remains unclear, partly due to the lack of experimental models that can fully recapitulate the complexity of ALS’s pathology. In this study, we developed and characterized a microglial cell line, SIM-A9-expressing human mutant protein Cu+/Zn+ superoxide dismutase_1 (SIM-A9hSOD1(G93A)), as a suitable model in vitro mimicking the microglia activity in ALS. The expression of hSOD1(G93A) in SIM-A9 cells induced a change in their metabolic activity, causing polarization into a pro-inflammatory phenotype and enhancing reactive oxygen species production, which is known to activate cell death processes and apoptosis. Afterward, we used our microglial model as an experimental set-up to investigate the therapeutic action of extracellular vesicles isolated from adipose mesenchymal stem cells (ASC-EVs). ASC-EVs represent a promising therapeutic treatment for ALS due to their neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties. Here, we demonstrated that treatment with ASC-EVs is able to modulate activated ALS microglia, reducing their metabolic activity and polarizing their phenotype toward an anti-inflammatory one through a mechanism of reduction of reactive oxygen species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This process, which alters the synchronization of the entire expressed genome, is distorted in neurodevelopmental diseases such as schizophrenia. The coordinated gene activity networks formed by altering sets of genes comprise recurring coordination modules, governed by the entropy-controlling action of nuclear FGFR1, known to be associated with DNA topology. These modules can be modeled as energy-transferring circuits, revealing that genome homeostasis is maintained by reducing oscillations (noise) in gene activity while allowing gene activity changes to be transmitted across networks; this occurs more readily in neuronal committed cells than in neural progenitors. These findings advance a model of an “entangled” global genome acting as a flexible, coordinated homeostatic system that responds to developmental signals, is governed by nuclear FGFR1, and is reprogrammed in disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Interference of cholinesterase inhibition with HMTM was observed also in a tau transgenic mouse model, where rivastigmine reduced the pharmacological activity of HMTM at multiple brain levels including hippocampal acetylcholine release, synaptosomal glutamate release and mitochondrial activity. Here, we examined the effect of HMTM, given alone or in combination with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, rivastigmine, at the level of expression of selected pre-synaptic proteins (syntaxin-1; SNAP-25, VAMP-2, synaptophysin-1, synapsin-1, α-synuclein) in brain tissue harvested from tau-transgenic Line 1 (L1) and wild-type mice using immunohistochemistry. L1 mice overexpress the tau-core unit that induces tau aggregation and results in an AD-like phenotype. Synaptic proteins were lower in hippocampus and cortex but greater in basal forebrain regions in L1 compared to wild-type mice. HMTM partially normalised the expression pattern of several of these proteins in basal forebrain. This effect was diminished when HMTM was administered in combination with rivastigmine, where mean protein expression seemed supressed. This was further confirmed by group-based correlation network analyses where important levels of co-expression correlations in basal forebrain regions were lost in L1 mice and partially re-established when HMTM was given alone but not in combination with rivastigmine.

Flow cytometry tests with hemoglobin F, glycophorin A, and hemoglobin F and carbonic anhydrase simultaneous staining were used to detect fetal red blood cells and maternal F cells. \nResults: In all cases, the volume of feto-maternal transfusion was estimated to be low. The highest rate of fetal red blood cells in the maternal circulation was observed in the blood of women with dichorionic twin gestations both before and after delivery. An increase in fetal red blood cells was observed after cesarean section in singletons and twins. The median rate of maternal F cells was 2.23% in singleton, 2.1% in monochorionic and 3.95% in dichorionic pregnancy.\nConclusions: Feto-maternal transfusion during pregnancy may be related to the multiplicity and chorionicity of pregnancy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70933f878c28a0473a593e","5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c18"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

There is urgent need for a better understanding of how smoking influences antidiabetic treatment efficacy. The review underscores the role of cigarette smoke, particularly polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), in modulating the metabolic pathways of antidiabetic drugs, primarily through the induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), thus impacting drug pharmacokinetics and therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the review addresses the relatively uncharted territory of how smoking cessation influences diabetes treatment, noting that cessation can lead to significant changes in drug metabolism, necessitating dosage adjustments. Special attention is given to the interaction between smoking cessation aids and antidiabetic medications, a critical area for patient safety and effective diabetes management. This scoping review aims to provide healthcare professionals with the knowledge to better support diabetic patients who smoke or are attempting to quit, ensuring tailored and effective treatment strategies.

More than 20 years after the link between IGHMBP2 and SMARD1 was revealed, and 10 years after the discovery of the association between IGHMBP2 and CMT2S, the pathogenic mechanism of these diseases is still not well defined. The discovery that IGHMBP2 functions as an RNA/DNA helicase was an important step, but it did not reveal the pathogenic mechanism. Helicases are enzymes that use ATP hydrolysis to catalyse the separation of nucleic acid strands. They are involved in numerous cellular processes, including DNA repair and transcription; RNA splicing, transport, editing and degradation; ribosome biogenesis; translation; telomere maintenance; and homologous recombination. IGHMBP2 appears to be a multifunctional factor involved in several cellular processes that regulate gene expression. It is difficult to determine which processes, when dysregulated, lead to pathology. Here, we summarise our current knowledge of the clinical presentation of IGHMBP2-related diseases. We also overview the available models, including yeast, mice and cells, which are used to study the function of IGHMBP2 and the pathogenesis of the related diseases. Further, we discuss the structure of the IGHMBP2 protein and its postulated roles in cellular functioning. Finally, we present potential anomalies that may result in the neurodegeneration observed in IGHMBP2-related disease and highlight the most prominent ones."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afe74"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Here, we show that mice lacking IL - 33 or its receptor ST2 (IL - 1RL1) were more resistant to Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection than wild - type animals and that single - nucleotide polymorphisms in IL33 and IL1RL1 were associated with pneumococcal pneumonia in humans. The effect of IL - 33 on S. pneumoniae infection was mediated by negative regulation of IL - 22 production in innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) but independent of ILC2s as well as IL - 4 and IL - 13 signaling. Moreover, IL - 33's influence on IL - 22 - dependent antibacterial defense was dependent on housing conditions of the mice and mediated by IL - 33's modulatory effect on the gut microbiota. Collectively, we provide insight into the bidirectional crosstalk between the innate immune system and the microbiota. We conclude that both genetic and environmental factors influence the gut microbiota, thereby impacting the efficacy of antibacterial immune defense and susceptibility to pneumonia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

therapy development represents a critical challenge in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis(ALS) research. Despite more than 20 years of basic and clinical research, no definitive safety andefficacy results of cell-based therapies for ALS have been published.Areas covered: This review summarizes advances using stem cells (SCs) in pre-clinical studies to promoteclinical translation and in clinical trials to treat ALS. New technologies have been developed and newexperimental in vitro and animal models are now available to facilitate pre-clinical research in this field andto determine the most promising approaches to pursue in patients. New clinical trial designs aimed atdeveloping personalized SC-based treatment with biological endpoints are being defined.Expert opinion: Knowledge of the basic biology of ALS and on the use of SCs to study and potentiallytreat ALS continues to grow. However, a consensus has yet to emerge on how best to translate theseresults into therapeutic applications. The selection and follow-up of patients should be based onclinical, biological, and molecular criteria. Planning of SC-based clinical trials should be coordinatedwith patient profiling genetically and molecularly to achieve personalized treatment. Much work withinbasic and clinical research is still needed to successfully transition SC therapy in ALS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Due to the pathogenetic complexity, there are no effective therapies available. In this context the use of mesenchymal stem cells and their vesicular counterpart is an emerging therapeutic strategy to counteract neurodegeneration. The extracellular vesicles derived from adipose stem cells (ASC-EVs) recapitulate and ameliorate the neuroprotective effect of stem cells and, thanks to their small dimensions, makes their use suitable to develop novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases as ALS. Here we investigate a therapeutic regimen of ASC-EVs injection in SOD1(G93A) mice, the most widely used murine model of ALS. Repeated intranasal administrations of high doses of ASC-EVs were able to ameliorate motor performance of injected SOD1(G93A) mice at the early stage of the disease and produce a significant improvement at the end-stage in the lumbar MNs rescue. Moreover, ASC-EVs preserve the structure of neuromuscular junction without counteracting the muscle atrophy. The results indicate that the intranasal ASC-EVs administration acts in central nervous system sites rather than at peripheral level in SOD1(G93A) mice. These considerations allow us to identify future applications of ASC-EVs that involve different targets simultaneously to maximize the clinical and neuropathological outcomes in ALS in vivo models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Persons with diabetes face a number of barriers and challenges to quitting such as multiple lifestyle restrictions; tailored interventions are required for smoking cessation.Objective: To identify research on behavioral interventions for smoking cessation in diabetes.Methods: Studies had to be randomized controlled trials, quasiexperimental or systematic reviews. The behavioral interventions included were: the 5As, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, Motivational Interviewing, Contingency Management, Health Coaching and Counselling, as compared to standard care. The outcomes were self-reported and/or biochemically verified smoking cessation. CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE Complete, the Cochrane databases of systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials, PsychInfo and PubMed Central were searched until July, 2023. Keywords used included diabetes, smoking cessation and each of the behavioral interventions included.Results: 1615 papers were identified. Three studies on the 5As/brief advice, 4 on Motivational Intervention and 1 on counseling were retained. The results on the 5As and Motivational Interviewing were conflicting.

It is a neurodegenerative disease in which symptoms such as a decline in memory, thinking, learning, and organizing skills develop gradually over many years and eventually become more severe. To date, there is no effective treatment for the cause of Alzheimer’s disease, and the existing pharmacological options primarily help manage symptoms. Treatment is mainly based on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, which exhibit numerous adverse cardiovascular and gastrointestinal effects due to excessive stimulation of peripheral cholinergic activity involving muscarinic receptors. Therefore, in addition to the obvious drugs that act on the cause of the disease, new drugs based on AChE inhibition that show the fewest side effects are needed. One potential drug could be a new compound under study, tetrahydroacridine derivative (CHDA), which showed significant potential to inhibit the AChE enzyme in previous in vitro studies.

Traditional treatments face significant challenges due to high rates of drug resistance and lack of targeted therapies. Recent advances in microRNA (miRNA) research have opened new avenues for understanding and treating osteosarcoma. This review explores the many critical functions of miRNAs in osteosarcoma, particularly their potential for clinical use. The review highlights two key areas where miRNAs could be beneficial. Firstly, miRNAs can act as biomarkers for diagnosing osteosarcoma and predicting patient prognosis. Secondly, specific miRNAs can regulate cellular processes like proliferation, cell death, migration, and even resistance to chemotherapy drugs in osteosarcoma. This ability to target multiple pathways within cancer cells makes miRNA-based therapies highly promising. Additionally, though the interaction between miRNAs and circular RNAs (circRNAs) falls outside the scope of the paper, it has also been discussed briefly. While miRNA-based therapies offer exciting possibilities for targeting multiple pathways in osteosarcoma, challenges remain. Efficient delivery, potential off-target effects, tumor complexity, and rigorous testing are hurdles to overcome before these therapies can reach patients. Despite these challenges, continued research and collaboration among scientists, clinicians, and regulatory bodies hold the promise of overcoming them. This collaborative effort can pave the way for the development of safe and effective miRNA-based treatments for osteosarcoma."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Genetic factors are recognized as contributing to susceptibility to different types of soft tissue injuries, making this broad condition a complicated multifactorial entity. Understanding genetic predisposition seems to offer the potential for personalized injury prevention and improved recovery strategies. The candidate gene analysis approach used so far, has often yielded inconclusive results. This manuscript reviews the most commonly studied genetic variants in genes involved in the musculoskeletal system’s structure and recovery processes (ACTN3, ACE, CKM, MLCK, AMPD1, IGF2, IL6, TNFα, CCL2, COL1A1, COL5A1, MMP3, and TNC). Referring to the literature, it was highlighted that single-gene analyses provide limited insight. On the other hand, novel genetic testing methods identify numerous variants of uncertain physiological relevance. Distinguishing between functionally important variants, modifying variants, and the thousands of irrelevant variants requires advanced bioinformatics methods and basic multiomics research to identify the key biological pathways contributing to injury susceptibility. Tools like the Total Genotype Score (TGS) and Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) offer a more holistic view by assessing the combined effect of multiple variants. However, these methods, while useful in research, lack clinical applicability. In conclusion, it is too early to determine the clinical implications of genetic variability as a tool for improving well-established training and injury prevention methods, as the predictive power of genetic testing for injury predisposition is currently low."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

It plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular structures and organelle functions, particularly in supporting synaptic plasticity and regulating neurotransmitter turnover. However, for reasons not yet fully understood, α-syn can lose its physiological role and begin to aggregate. This altered α-syn disrupts dopaminergic transmission and causes both presynaptic and postsynaptic dysfunction, ultimately leading to cell death. A group of neurodegenerative diseases known as α-synucleinopathies is characterized by the intracellular accumulation of α-syn deposits in specific neuronal and glial cells within certain brain regions. In addition to Parkinson’s disease (PD), these conditions include dementia with Lewy bodies (DLBs), multiple system atrophy (MSA), pure autonomic failure (PAF), and REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Given that these disorders are associated with α-syn-related neuroinflammation—and considering that SARS-CoV-2 infection has been shown to affect the nervous system, with COVID-19 patients experiencing neurological symptoms—it has been proposed that COVID-19 may contribute to neurodegeneration in PD and other α-synucleinopathies by promoting α-syn misfolding and aggregation. In this review, we focus on whether SARS-CoV-2 could act as an environmental trigger that facilitates the onset or progression of α-synucleinopathies. Specifically, we present new evidence on the potential role of SARS-CoV-2 in modulating α-syn function and discuss the causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of parkinsonism-like symptoms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This study aimed to assess the cost of medications prior to and after bariatric surgery in the Polish nationwide registry.Methods The study included 2,390 adults. The analysis was conducted separately for a 12-month pre-operative period, and a 12-month postoperative period. The total costs of medication and cost per anatomical therapeutic chemical group were assessed and the mean cost per patient in the preoperative and postoperative periods was compared.Results The study showed a significant increase in the overall medication costs and mean costs of medications per patient in the year after bariatric surgery. This increase was related mainly to low-molecular-weight heparins used in the 1st month after surgery. Alternatively, costs of medication used in the cardiovascular system diseases and anti-infectives decreased significantly. The total costs of hypoglycemic agents were reduced by 46%, antihypertensive medications by 29%, and lipid-lowering drugs by 38.Conclusions In general, medication costs are higher in the first year after surgery. The increase results from the perioperative use of low-molecular-weight heparins, whereas a significant cost reduction of glucose-, lipid-lowering, antihypertensive, and anti-infective medications was observed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","uid":"bXACR4AS_DViRybrT_ocXzA","uuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","name":"Państwowy Instytut Medyczny Ministerstwa Spraw Wewnętrznych i Administracji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a04739679c","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46be","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1996"],"parentId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","parentUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","rootId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","rootUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In addition to neurological deficits, a key role in the onset and subsequent progression of AD Alzheimer’s disease-specific changes is attributed to vascular factors. Retinal microvasculature and cerebral small vessels share similar anatomical features and physiological characteristics, and damage to the retinal vascular bed can be observed at any stage of AD Alzheimer’s disease. Retinal microvasculature can be visualized and assessed non-invasively using the technique of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Aim of study: Evaluation of macular retinal microvasculature in the superficial capillary plexus based on OCT-A optical coherence tomography angiography images in patients diagnosed with the mild stage of Alzheimer’s dementia. Material and methods: The study involved a total of 21 patients diagnosed with mild Alzheimer’s dementia confirmed by neuropsychological tests and neuroimaging studies. optical coherence tomography angiography OCT-A was used to determine vessel density in the superficial retinal capillary plexus (SRCP), i.e. generate a density map within five-field ETDRS circles with diameters of 3 mm and 6 mm. Results: Alterations in the macular retinal capillary network were noted in all eyes studied. In the majority of eyes, there was a marked reduction in vessel density reflected in the quantitative metrics in the density map around the FAZ in at least one of the scans obtained for a given eye (3 mm x 3 mm and/ or 6 mm x 6 mm) and in the macroscopic evaluation of the superficial and deep capillary plexuses, capillary thinning, and irregular area/mexpansion of the FAZ. Conclusions: Optical coherence tomography angiography OCT-A has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for screening or monitoring the response to therapies in patients with Alzheimer’s disease AD. However, further research is necessary to standardize study methodologies and determine whether impaired retinal microvasculature in patients with Alzheimer-type MCI or preclinical Alzheimer’s disease AD correlates with the advancement of cognitive decline and loss of neurons and cerebral blood vessels in individual Alzheimer’s disease AD patients and, hence, has clinical utility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, this seemingly simple treatment method is fraught with many difficulties and frequent dissatisfaction among patients.\n\nIn fact, differences in response to levothyroxine probably depend on a complex interaction between individual, environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors that are still not sufficiently understood. Immunological disturbances, underlying Hashimoto’s disease, the most common cause of hypothyroidism, probably play a significant role in these relationships. Indeed, a growing number of studiesindicate that autoimmunity through activation of low-grade inflammation can lead to impaired absorption, transport, metabolism, and action of thyroid hormones. This review provides an up-to-date overview of the causes responsible for both the difficulty in achieving target thyrotropin levels and persistence of nonspecific symptoms despite adequate hormone replacement from an immunoendocrine perspective. Understanding these mechanisms points to a new direction in the approach to hypothyroidism, indicating the need for newpersonalized treatment strategies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","uid":"bXACR4AS_DViRybrT_ocXzA","uuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","name":"Państwowy Instytut Medyczny Ministerstwa Spraw Wewnętrznych i Administracji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a04739679c","6746dbbcfdbe832bc288280a"],"parentId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","parentUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","rootId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","rootUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Since stroke in humans is typically associated with comorbidities and long-term hypertension is the most common comorbidity leading to stroke, this study aimed to assess the neuroprotective potential of the Y2R agonist NPY13–36 in the rats with essential hypertension (SHR) subjected to 90 min middle cerebral artery suture occlusion with subsequent reperfusion (MCAOR). The cerebrocortical microflow in the ischemic focus and penumbra was continuously monitored with a Laser-Doppler flowmeter. NPY13–36 (10 μg/6 μl physiological saline solution) was administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) during ischemia or early reperfusion. The infarct area (triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining), behavioral tests (gait, mobility, and sensorimotor functions), and the response of the cerebrocortical microcirculation in the penumbra to hypercapnia and to the inhibition of the synthesis of nitric oxide were studied. Our results demonstrate that administration of NPY13-36 reduces the size of the infarct, improves motor functions, and restores microcirculatory response to the blockade of nitric oxide synthase when administered during reperfusion. The novelty of this study is a finding of the vasoprotective effect of NPY13-36 in brain ischemia/reperfusion. Moreover, this study provides evidence of the beneficial effects of NPY13-36 in animals with essential hypertension and indicates that Y2R ligands may be promising candidates for treating the ischemic brain in the case of this disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We applied an RNA-protein interactome capture method called protein cross-linked RNA extraction (XRNAX) to shed light on the RNA-bound proteome in dysmyelination. We found sets of canonical RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulating alternative splicing and engaged in the cytoplasmic granules to be perturbed at the level of their RNA interactome. We validated these observations for PCBP1 and MBNL1. We show that the number of PCBP1 bodies is markedly increased in the mossy cells of the hippocampus and that the pattern of MBNL1-regulated alternatively spliced exons differs between the myelin-deficient and the wild-type brain, which is likely associated with Mbnl1 splicing perturbation and circular RNA generation from this locus. In the broader perspective, our results demonstrate that, with the application of the RNA-protein interactome approach, we can uncover alterations in RBP functioning in the disease context that are not always directly visible from their mRNA or protein levels."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Staphylococcus aureus, , the most harmful species among them produces heat-resistant endotoxins, which cause food intoxications. Staphylococci may form biofilms on food-processing surfaces and become more resistant to routinely used antimicrobials. The bacteriolytic enzymes Auresine and AuresinePlus, both derived from S. aureus LytM autolysin engineered catalytic domain, were tested for their specificity and activity against various staphylococcal species and other bacteria. Both enzymes exhibited lytic activity against all tested staphylococcal species except S. pasteuri. . The specificity of staphylococcal strains to these enzymes depended on the composition of their peptidoglycan cross-bridges. The bacteriolytic effect of the enzymes depended on the growth phase, initial cell number of target bacteria and the enzyme concentration applied. Bacterial elimination and bactericidal effects of both Auresine and AuresinePlus against S. aureus biofilms were confirmed by live/dead staining, with AuresinePlus showing a more pronounced effect. Additionally, Auresine and AuresinePlus presented increased effectiveness in eliminating staphylococcal cells adhered to surfaces, when combined with a detergent or the enzymes- amylase and cellulase. Importantly, cells recovered from biofilms after enzyme treatment did not display decreased susceptibility to applied enzymes, indicating the sustained efficacy of Auresine and AuresinePlus. In conclusion, Auresine and AuresinePlus demonstrate promising bactericidal activity against various staphylococcal species, highlighting their potential as antibacterial agents."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

If left untreated, it can cause serious complications and significantly shortens the life time. DM is one of the leading causes of end-stage renal disease (uremia) worldwide.

In this paper, we describe the optimization and synthesis of the internally quenched fluorescent substrate disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10). Using combinatorial chemistry methods with iterative deconvolution, the substrate specificity of the enzyme in non-primed and primed positions was determined. We used the ABZ-Lys-Ile-Ile-Asn-Leu-Lys-Arg-Tyr(3-NO2)–NH2 peptide to study ADAM10 activity in urine samples collected from patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, compared to urine samples from healthy volunteers. The proteolytically active enzyme was present in diabetes samples, while in the case of healthy people we did not observe any activity.

In this study, we investigated a rhodium(III) bipyridylsulfonamide complex (2) and its ligand (L) for their effects on breast cancer (SKBr3) and noncancerous mammary cells (HB2). Both compounds significantly reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial function in SKBr3 cells while sparing HB2 cells. Compound 2 also increased glycolysis in both lines, suggesting a metabolic shift. Mitochondrial size and shape were altered, particularly in SKBr3 cells. Additionally, both compounds reduced cancer cell migration by disrupting actin cytoskeleton organization and the Rac1/VASP signaling pathway. These findings suggest that the rhodium(III) bipyridylsulfonamide complex selectively impairs mitochondrial dynamics and cell migration in cancer cells while sparing healthy cells, providing insight into its mechanism of action and toward its use as targeted anticancer therapy. This study lays the groundwork for future in vivo studies and further optimization of these metal-based therapeutics for clinical applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

success in the treatment of B-cell malignancies. Targeting the B-lineage marker CD19 has brought great advances to the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell lymphomas. However, relapse remains an issue in many cases. Such relapse can result from downregulation or loss of CD19 from the malignant cell population or expression of alternate isoforms. Consequently, there remains a need to target alternative B-cell antigens and diversify the spectrum of epitopes targeted within the same antigen. CD22 has been identified as a substitute target in cases of CD19-negative relapse. One anti-CD22 antibody—clone m971—targets a membrane-proximal epitope of CD22 and has been widely validated and used in the clinic. Here, we have compared m971-CAR with a novel CAR derived from IS7, an antibody that targets a central epitope on CD22. The IS7-CAR has superior avidity and is active and specific against CD22-positive targets, including B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient-derived xenograft samples.

Hyperglycemia significantly inhibits cGMP-dependent pathway activity in the kidney, leading to glomerular damage and proteinuria. The enhancement of activity of this pathway that is associated with an elevation of cGMP levels may be achieved by inhibition of the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A) using selective inhibitors, such as tadalafil. Hyperglycemia decreased the insulin responsiveness of podocytes and impaired podocyte function. These effects were associated with lower protein amounts and activity of the protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and a decrease in the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). We found that PDE5A protein levels increased in hyperglycemia, and PDE5A downregulation improved the insulin responsiveness of podocytes with reestablished SIRT1 expression and activity. PDE5A inhibitors potentiate nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling, and NO modulates the activity and expression of SIRT1. Therefore, we investigated the effects of tadalafil on SIRT1 and AMPK in the context of improving the insulin sensitivity in podocytes and podocyte function in hyperglycemia. Our study revealed that tadalafil restored SIRT1 expression and activity and activated AMPK by increasing its phosphorylation. Tadalafil also restored stimulating effect of insulin on glucose transport in podocytes with high glucose-induced insulin resistance. Additionally, tadalafil improved the function of podocytes that were exposed to high glucose concentrations. Our results display novel mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of glomerulopathies in diabetes, which may contribute to the development of more effective treatment strategies for diabetic nephropathy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a0473931b5","5e709478878c28a0473bddbb"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Previously, we proposed the transplantation of canine glial-restricted progenitors (cGRPs) into the double-mutant immunodeficient, demyelinated neonatal shiverer mice (shiverer/Rag2−/−). The results of our previous study revealed the myelination of axons within the corpus callosum of transplanted animals; however, the extent of myelination and lifespan prolongation depended on the transplantation site (anterior vs. posterior). The goal of our present study was to optimize the therapeutic effect of cGRP transplantation by using a multisite injection protocol to achieve a broader dispersal of donor cells in the host and obtain better therapeutic results. Experimental analysis of cGRP graft recipients revealed a marked elevation in myelin basic protein (MBP) expression and prominent axonal myelination across the brains of shiverer mice. Interestingly, the proportion of galactosyl ceramidase (GalC) positive cells was similar between the brains of cGRP recipients and control mice, implying a natural propensity of exogenous cGRPs to generate mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes. Moreover, multisite injection of cGRPs improved mice survival as compared to non-transplanted animals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Despite extensive research efforts, efficient therapy against the consequences of hypoxia-ischemia occurring in the perinatal period of life is still lacking. The use of hyperbaric oxygen, improving such vital consequences of birth asphyxia as lowered partial oxygen pressure in tissue, apoptosis of neuronal cells, and impaired angiogenesis, is a promising approach. This review focused on the selected aspects of mainly experimental hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The therapeutic window for the treatment of perinatal asphyxia is very narrow, but administering hyperbaric oxygen within those days improves outcomes. Several miRNAs (e.g., mir-107) mediate the therapeutic effect of hyperbaric oxygen by modulating the Wnt pathway, inhibiting apoptosis, increasing angiogenesis, or inducing neural stem cells. Combining hyperbaric oxygen therapy with drugs, such as memantine or ephedrine, produced promising results. A separate aspect is the use of preconditioning with hyperbaric oxygen. Overall, preliminary clinical trials with hyperbaric oxygen therapy used in perinatal asphyxia give auspicious results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

It became clear that both diseases are closely related, since overweight/obesity are associated with an increased risk of asthma development, and more than half of the subjects with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma are obese. Currently, there are no specific guidelines for the treatment of this group of patients. The mechanisms involved in the asthma–obesity phenotype include low-grade chronic inflammation and changes in pulmonary physiology. However, genetic predispositions, gender differences, comorbid conditions, and gut microbiota also seem to be important. Regulatory peptides affect many processes related to the functioning of the respiratory tract and adipose tissue. Adipokines such as leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and the less studied omentin, chemerin, and visfatin, as well as the gastrointestinal hormones ghrelin, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1, and neuropeptides, including substance P or neuropeptide Y, can play a significant role in asthma with obesity.

Perturbations of miR-128-3p, which is enriched in the brain, contribute to a plethora of neurodegenerative disorders, brain injuries, and malignancies, as this miRNA is a crucial regulator of gene expression in the brain, playing an essential role in the maintenance and function of cells stemming from neuronal lineage. However, the differential expression of miR-128-3p in pathologies underscores the importance of the balance between its high and low levels. Significantly, numerous reports pointed to miR-128-3p as one of the most depleted in glioblastoma, implying it is a critical player in the disease’s pathogenesis and thus may serve as a therapeutic agent for this most aggressive form of brain tumor. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the diverse roles of miR-128-3p. We focus on its involvement in the neurogenesis and pathophysiology of malignant and neurodegenerative diseases. We also highlight the promising potential of miR-128-3p as an antitumor agent for the future therapy of human cancers, including glioblastoma, and as the linchpin of brain development and function, potentially leading to the development of new therapies for neurological conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In addition to dementia, which is the loss of cognitive function, including thinking, remembering, and reasoning, and behavioral abilities, AD patients also experience respiratory disturbances. The most common respiratory problems observed in AD patients are pneumonia, shortness of breath, respiratory muscle weakness, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The latter is considered an outcome of Alzheimer’s disease and is suggested to be a causative factor. While this narrative review addresses the bidirectional relationship between obstructive sleep apnea and Alzheimer’s disease and reports on existing studies describing the most common respiratory disorders found in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, its main purpose is to review all currently available studies using animal models of Alzheimer’s disease to study respiratory impairments. These studies on animal models of AD are few in number but are crucial for establishing mechanisms, causation, implementing potential therapies for respiratory disorders, and ultimately applying these findings to clinical practice. This review summarizes what is already known in the context of research on respiratory disorders in animal models, while pointing out directions for future research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Several types of USV have been previously described, e.g., appetitive 50-kHz USV and aversive short 22-kHz USV. It is not fully understood which aspects of the USV repertoire play important functions during rat ultrasonic exchange. Here, we investigated features of USV emitted by rats trained in operant conditioning, is a form of associative learning between behavior and its consequences, to reinforce the production/emission of 50-kHz USV. Twenty percent of the trained rats learned to vocalize to receive a reward according to an arbitrarily set criterion, i.e., reaching the maximum number of proper responses by the end of each of the last three USV-training sessions, as well as according to a set of measurements independent from the criterion (e.g., shortening of training sessions). Over the training days, these rats also exhibited: an increasing percentage of rewarded 50-kHz calls, lengthening and amplitude-increasing of 50-kHz calls, and decreasing number of short 22-kHz calls. As a result, the potentially learning rats, when compared to non-learning rats, displayed shorter training sessions and different USV structure, i.e. higher call rates, more rewarded 50-kHz calls, longer and louder 50-kHz calls and fewer short 22-kHz calls. Finally, we reviewed the current literature knowledge regarding different lengths of 50-kHz calls in different behavioral contexts, the potential function of short 22-kHz calls as well as speculate that USV may not easily become an operant response due to their primary biological role, i.e., communication of emotional state between conspecifics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Numerous data indicate that the accumulation of AGEs in the extracellular matrix plays a key role in the development of obesity-related adipose tissue dysfunction. Through binding of their membrane receptor (RAGE), AGEs affect numerous intracellular pathways and impair adipocyte differentiation, metabolism, and secretory activity. Therefore, inhibiting the production and accumulation of AGEs, as well as interfering with the metabolic pathways they activate, may be a promising therapeutic strategy for restoring normal adipose tissue function and, thus, combating obesity-related comorbidities. This narrative review summarizes data on the involvement of the RAGE pathway in adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity and the development of its metabolic complications. The paper begins with a brief review of AGE synthesis and the RAGE signaling pathway. The effect of the RAGE pathway on adipose tissue development and activity is then presented. Next, data from animal and human studies on the involvement of the RAGE pathway in obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are summarized. Finally, therapeutic perspectives based on interference with the RAGE pathway are discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The temperature profiles of the degree of association, distributions of dipeptide cluster size, and structures of clusters were examined. It has been found that the dipeptides composed of strongly nonpolar (aromatic or aliphatic) residues associate nearly completely at all temperatures to form tight clusters, while those composed of charged or polar residues exhibited no or residual association. The dipeptides composed of nonpolar and small polar residues and those composed of less hydrophobic residues formed single clusters, gradually dissolving with increasing temperature, while those composed of phenylalanine or tryptophan and polar or charged residues formed multiple irregular clusters with room to accommodate water inside, suggesting the formation of liquid droplets or gels. The logarithms of the average degree of association and the free energy of aggregation per monomer were found to correlate with the dipeptide hydrophobicity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac14e","6777d754fdbe831a38c2f761","5e70924b878c28a0473931ed"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Protein kinase G type Iα (PKGIα) and adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase (AMPK) affect the contractile apparatus of podocytes and influence the permeability of the GFB. Therefore, we studied the interplay between PKGIα and AMPK in cultured rat podocytes. The glomerular permeability to albumin and transmembrane FITC-albumin flux decreased in the presence of AMPK activators and increased in the presence of PKG activators. The knockdown of PKGIα or AMPK with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) revealed a mutual interaction between PKGIα and AMPK and influenced podocyte permeability to albumin. Moreover, PKGIα siRNA activated the AMPK-dependent signaling pathway. AMPKα2 siRNA increased basal levels of phosphorylated myosin phosphate target subunit 1 and decreased the phosphorylation of myosin light chain 2. Podocytes that were treated with AMPK or PKG activators were characterized by the different organization of actin filaments within the cell. Our findings suggest that mutual interactions between PKGIα and AMPKα2 regulate the contractile apparatus and permeability of the podocyte monolayer to albumin. Understanding this newly identified molecular mechanism in podocytes provides further insights into the pathogenesis of glomerular disease and novel therapeutic targets for glomerulopathies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709299878c28a047398c2d","5e70949d878c28a0473c06fa"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This\nstudy aimed to determine the expression of genes encoding superoxide dismutases (SOD1, SOD2), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) and sirtuins (SIRTs). Moreover, transcription of genes related to mitochondrial electron transport complexes (ETC) and biogenesis in the brain cortex of 4-, 6- and 12-month-old transgenic AD Tg mice was analyzed. We observed\nsignificant decreases in mRNA of Sod2, Parp1 and Sirt1 in the 3-month-old AD Tg mice and upregulation of Parp1 in the\n6-month-old AD Tg mice by qPCR analysis. Then, mt-CytB and mt-Co1 (complex III and IV) mRNA levels were increased in\n12- and 6-month-old AD brains, respectively. These changes were linked to lower cytochrome c oxidase activity in 3- and\nsignificantly in 6-month-old AD Tg mice. Moreover, transcription of several genes involved in mitochondria biogenesis, such\nas Nfe2L2 and Tfam, was upregulated respectively in the 3- and 6-month-old AD Tg mice. Expression of genes encoding\nPGC1 and NRF2 was significantly downregulated in 12-month-old AD Tg mice. In summary, our data identified significant\nchanges in gene expression of Sod2, Parp1 and Sirt1 at an early age (3-6-month-old AD mice) then Ppargc1, Nfe2L2 and\nSirt1 at a later age. Recognizing these alterations may be important in better understanding the complexity of pathology\nin AD. Moreover, our results could be helpful in consideration of appropriate target(s) in neuroprotection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Although striatum is highly enriched with Arg2, precise localization and function of striatal Arg2 have never been studied. Here, we confirm that Arg2 is the only arginase isoenzyme in the striatum, and, using genetic model of total Arg2 loss, we show that Arg2 in this region is fully responsible for arginase catalytic activity, and its loss doesn't induce compensatory activation of Arg1. We exhibit that Arg2 is present in medium spiny neurons (MSNs), striatum-specific projecting neurons, where it localizes in soma and neuronal processes, and is absent in astrocytes or microglia. Finally, analysis of NMR spectroscopy-measured metabolic profiles of striata of Arg2-null mice enabled to recognize two metabolites (NADH and malonic acid) to be significantly altered compared to control animals. Multivariate comparison of the data using orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis, allowed for discrimination between control and Arg2-null mice and identified metabolites that contributed the most to this between-group dissimilarity. Our study reveals for the first time the localization of Arg2 in MSNs and demonstrates significant role of this enzyme in regulating striatal metabolism. These findings may be especially interesting in the context of Huntington's disease (HD), a disorder that specifically affects MSNs and in which, with the use of mouse models, the onset of pathological phenotypes was recently shown to be preceded by progressive impairment of striatal Arg2, a phenomenon of an unknown significance for disease pathogenesis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The presence of these aggregates is often associated with various diseases. The molecular mechanisms governing the aggregation process are yet to be fully understood. The self-assembly of amyloid protofilaments occurs over extended time frames, making the simulation of such events problematic. In this work, we describe a pipeline for multiscale modeling protofilament structures. In the first stage, the self-assembly of short fibrillar oligomers occurs during coarse-grained docking simulations of multiple copies of aggregating peptides. Subsequently, symmetry criteria are used to select the highest-ranked oligomer structures. Selected models are then reconstructed to an all-atom representation and used for the assembly of longer protofilaments. Models are optimized using molecular dynamics. Final structures are selected using various scoring protocols. We evaluated this modeling procedure through the test prediction of insulin amyloid protofilaments whose experimental structures have been published recently. The resulting insulin protofilament models closely resemble the experimental structures. This work provides a proof of concept for the proposed modeling procedure aiming to predict amyloid protofilament structures that exhibit in-register and parallel arrangement of β-sheets based solely on the amino acid sequence of aggregating peptides."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The study aimed to evaluate the effects of VR-based training in an elderly population.\nMaterials and methods: The study included 36 women over the age of 60, who were randomly divided into two groups subjected to balance-strength and balance-cognitive training. The research applied both conventional clinical tests, such as (a) the Timed Up and Go test, (b) the five-times sit-to-stand test, and (c) the posturographic exam with the Romberg test with eyes open and closed. Training in both groups was conducted for 10 sessions and embraced exercises on a bicycle ergometer and exercises using non-immersive VR created by the ActivLife platform. Machine learning methods with a k-nearest neighbors classifier, which are very effective and popular, were proposed to statistically evaluate the differences in training effects in the two groups.\nResults and conclusion: The study showed that training using VR brought beneficial improvement in clinical tests and changes in the pattern of posturographic trajectories were observed. An important finding of the research was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls in the study population.

Kinins, released in vessel walls, exacerbate inflammation by modulating the production and release of pro-inflammatory factors via two types of G protein-related receptors—B1 and B2 receptors. B1 R is overexpressed during the inflammation that accompanies numerous neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), in which loss of BBB integrity is an early pathomechanism of the disease. In this work, we apply pharmacological inhibition of the kinin B1 receptor with DALBK to investigate its effect on blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability during the course of EAE, an animal model of MS. Functional, ultrastructural and molecular analyses were performed. The expression of selected BBB-associated proteins such as occludin and claudin-5 was assessed, as well as the astrocytic marker GFAP. We show that administration of a specific antagonist attenuates neurological symptoms in EAE rats and recovers the downregulation of TJ proteins and BBB leakage observed during the course of the disease, as well as significantly reducing the disease-specific activation of astroglia. The results show that B1 R-mediated signaling is involved in inducing molecular changes at the level of cerebral microvessels, leading to increased permeability of the BBB following neuroinflammation in EAE."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The study’s objective was to verify whether obesity frequency still increases in Polish Caucasian seniors and to verify the “obesity paradox”. Five thousand and fifty-seven community-dwelling individuals aged ≥ 65 years completed a detailed medical questionnaire, underwent measurements of the body mass index (BMI) and the waist circumference (WC), and an evaluation of physical and cognitive performances. Over a decade, general obesity increased by 2.1%, mostly due to a 3.9% increase in men. Abdominal obesity increased by 1.0%, mainly due to males, in whom it increased by 3.9%. Obesity increased the risk of several aging-related diseases, but this effect was less pronounced in the oldest-old. Obesity did not adversely affect the physical and cognitive functioning or mortality. Through a multivariable analysis, the BMI and WC remained the independent predictors of the Katz Activities of Daily Living score (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively) and Mini-Mental State Examination score (both p < 0.001). The Kaplan–Meier survival curves revealed that overweight and obesity classes 1 and 2 were associated with the lowest mortality. Through a multivariable analysis, overweight, class 1 obesity, and abdominal obesity remained the independent predictors of a decreased mortality (all p < 0.001). In conclusion, we found that overweight and obesity are not detrimental in seniors, including the oldest-old. We suggest that the anthropometric values defining obesity should be modified for age-advanced people."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Therefore, any deregulation of purine-dependent signaling may lead to synaptic dysfunction and the development of autism-like behaviors.\nMethod\nHere, we used a well-established autism spectrum disorders (ASD) model of a single prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA). Wistar female rats received an i.p. injection of VPA (450 mg/kg body weight) at gestational day 12.5. To study the involvement of purinergic signaling in the alterations of the key synaptic proteins and the development of ASD-like behaviors in VPA offspring at 52. post-natal day, we performed a single i.p. injection of the non-selective P2-purinoceptor antagonists PPADS and isoPPADS (12.5 mg/kg body weight) 24 h before behavioral tests.\nResults\nThe results showed an increased level of ATP and its metabolites, ADP, and AMP in the cerebrospinal fluid of VPA offspring indicating significant dysregulation in extracellular nucleotides- signaling, that may result in synaptic aberrations. Treatment with isoPPADS significantly prevented alterations of the selected synaptic proteins evoked by prenatal VPA exposure along with prevention of the overactivation of mTOR kinase, while both purinergic antagonists reversed autism-like behavior. This suggests that apart from the activation of the mTOR signaling cascade, purinergic deregulation may influence molecular pathways other than synaptic protein imbalance.\nConclusions\nDisturbances in the ATP turnover and overstimulation of purinergic receptors are responsible for synaptic proteins' dyshomeostasis and the appearance of ASD-like behaviors. mTOR kinase might be partially responsible for the development of autistic symptoms evoked by hyperpurinergia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Traditionally, glia was disregarded as just the structural support across the brain and spinal cord, in striking contrast to neurons, always considered critical players in CNS functioning. In modern times this outdated dogma is continuously repelled by new evidence unravelling the importance of glia in neuronal maintenance and function. Therefore, glia replacement has been considered a potentially powerful therapeutic strategy. Glial progenitors are at the center of this hope, as they are the source of new glial cells. Indeed, sophisticated experimental therapies and exciting clinical trials shed light on the utility of exogenous glia in disease treatment. Therefore, this review article will elaborate on glial-restricted progenitor cells (GRPs), their origin and characteristics, available sources, and adaptation to current therapeutic approaches aimed at various CNS diseases, with particular attention paid to myelin-related disorders with a focus on recent progress and emerging concepts. The landscape of GRP clinical applications is also comprehensively presented, and future perspectives on promising, GRP-based therapeutic strategies for brain and spinal cord diseases are described in detail."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Combustion-free nicotine alternatives like e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products are increasingly being used as substitutes for conventional cigarettes, contributing to the decline in smoking prevalence. However, there is limited information about the long-term health impact of those products in patients with diabetes. This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate whether switching from conventional cigarettes to combustion-free nicotine alternatives will lead to a measurable improvement in cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic parameters over a period of 2 years in smokers with type 2 diabetes. The multicenter study will be conducted in seven sites across four countries. A total of 576 smokers with type 2 diabetes will be randomly assigned (1:2 ratio) to either standard of care with brief cessation advice (Control Arm) or combustion-free nicotine alternatives use (Intervention Arm). The primary end point is the change in the proportion of patients with metabolic syndrome between baseline and the 2-year follow-up. Additionally, the study will analyze the absolute change in the sum of the individual factors of metabolic syndrome at each study time point. Patient recruitment has started in September 2021 and enrollment is expected to be completed by December 2023. Results will be reported in 2026. This study may provide valuable insights into cardiovascular and metabolic health benefits or risks associated with using combustion-free nicotine alternatives for individuals with type 2 diabetes who are seeking alternatives to tobacco cigarette smoking. The study protocol, informed consent forms, and relevant documents were approved by seven ethical review boards. Study results will be disseminated through articles published in high-quality, peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The kidneys play a significant role in regulating blood glucose levels. However, when exposed to chronic hyperglycemia, the kidneys' ability to handle glucose metabolism may be impaired, leading to an accumulation of glycogen. Earlier studies have shown that there can be a significant increase in glucose storage in the form of glycogen in the kidneys in diabetes.\nPodocytes play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of filtration barrier. In diabetes, exposure to elevated glucose levels can lead to significant metabolic and structural changes in podocytes, contributing to kidney damage and the development of diabetic kidney disease. The accumulation of glycogen in podocytes is not a well-established phenomenon. However, a recent study has demonstrated the presence of glycogen granules in podocytes.\nThis review delves into the intricate connections between hyperglycemia and glycogen metabolism within the context of the kidney, with special emphasis on podocytes.

The emergence and rapid spread of new resistance mechanisms, coupled with the absence of effective treatments in recent decades, have led to thousands of deaths annually from infections caused by drug-resistant microorganisms. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the development of new compounds capable of combating antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A promising class of molecules exhibiting potent bactericidal effects is peptidoglycan hydrolases. Previously, we cloned and characterized the biochemical properties of the M23 catalytic domain of the EnpA (EnpACD) protein from Enterococcus faecalis. Unlike other enzymes within the M23 family, EnpACD demonstrates broad specificity. However, its activity is constrained under low ionic strength conditions. In this study, we present the engineering of three chimeric enzymes comprising EnpACD fused with three distinct SH3b cell wall-binding domains. These chimeras exhibit enhanced tolerance to environmental conditions and sustained activity in bovine and human serum. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that the addition of SH3b domains influences the activity of the chimeric enzymes, thereby expanding their potential applications in combating antimicrobial resistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","uid":"bdmrms-mkJ7vPbeBs1t2ugw","uuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","name":"Międzynarodowy Instytut Biologii Molekularnej i Komórkowej w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397a09","5e7093e8878c28a0473b3180","5e709459878c28a0473bb1c3"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","parentUuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","rootUuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The focus on IL-6 in this review arises from its pleiotropic nature and unclear effect on obesity risk. The review included studies published from 1998 to 2023, sourced from Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration tool, and funnel plots were used for publication bias. Results were synthesized into pooled odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs). Thirty studies comprising approximately 29,998 participants were included. The selection criteria required that the articles include participants who were overweight or obese, and this condition needed to be linked to IL polymorphisms. In a meta-analysis, in the dominant model, the pooled OR was 1.26 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.47), indicating those with the GC/CC genotype for IL-6 rs1800795 are 1.26 times more likely to be overweight/obese than GG genotype carriers. For the recessive model, the OR was 1.25 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.51). The overdominant model showed no significant association (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.25). Interleukin gene variation, particularly the IL-6 rs1800795 variant, is modestly associated with obesity risk. This suggests that other factors, such as the environment, also play a role in obesity. Thus, individuals with this particular IL-6 variant may have a slightly higher likelihood of being overweight or obese compared to those without it, but this is just one of many factors influencing obesity risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

Lysosomes are acidic organelles that are implicated in regulation of the insulin signaling pathway. Cathepsin D (CTPD) and lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) are major lysosomal proteins that reflect the functional state of lysosomes. However, the effect of insulin on lysosome activity and role of lysosomes in the regulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake in podocytes are unknown. Our studies showed that the short-term incubation of podocytes with insulin decreased LAMP1 and CTPD mRNA levels. Insulin and bafilomycin A1 reduced both the amounts of LAMP1 and CTPD proteins and activity of CTPD, which were associated with a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of lysosomes that were labeled with LysoTracker. Bafilomycin A1 inhibited insulin-dependent endocytosis of the insulin receptor and increased the amounts of the insulin receptor and glucose transporter 4 on the cell surface of podocytes. Bafilomycin A1 also inhibited insulin-dependent glucose uptake despite an increase in the amount of glucose transporter 4 in the plasma membrane of podocytes. These results suggest that lysosomes are signaling hubs that may be involved in the coupling of insulin signaling with the regulation of glucose uptake in podocytes. The dysregulation of this mechanism can lead to the dysfunction of podocytes and development of insulin resistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Podocyte KCa1.1 subunits interact directly with TRPC6 channels and BK channels become active in response to Ca2+ influx through TRPC6. Here, we confirmed that Ca2+ influx through TRPC channels is reduced following the blockade of BK channels by paxilline. The overall abundance of KCa1.1 subunits, as well as that of β4 and γ3 subunits, were increased in glomeruli isolated from Sprague Dawley rats during chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis. Exposing cultured mouse podocytes for 24 h to recombinant TNFα, a circulating factor implicated in pediatric nephrotic syndromes, did not affect the total abundance of KCa1.1, but did evoke significant increases in both β4 and γ3. However, TNFα evoked a marked increase in the surface abundance of KCa1.1 subunits, similar to that of its previously reported effects on TRPC6 channels. The effect of TNFα on the surface expression of KCa1.1 was eliminated following siRNA knockdown of the β4 subunits, suggesting a role for this subunit in KCa1.1 trafficking to the cell surface. By contrast, treating podocytes with suPAR did not affect the total or surface expression of KCa1.1. The coordinated activation of KCa1.1 channels may promote Ca2+ influx through TRPC channels during normal and abnormal podocyte function by maintaining a membrane potential that allows for the efficient permeation of divalent cations through TRPC pores."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Recent studies share the common observation that the formation of protein oligomers and subsequent pathological filaments is an essential step for the disease. Synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the aggregation of the α-synucleinprotein in neurons and/or in oligodendrocytes (glial cytoplasmic inclusions), neuronal loss, and astrogliosis. A similar mechanism of protein Tau-dependent neurodegeneration is a major feature of tauopathies, represented by Alzheimer’s disease (AD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Pick’s disease (PD). The specific inhibition of the protein misfolding and their interneuronal spreading represents a promising therapeutic strategy against both disease pathology and progression. The most recent research focuses on finding potential applications targeting the pathological forms of proteins responsible for neurodegeneration. This review highlights the mechanisms relevant to protein-dependent neurodegeneration based on the most common disorders and describes current therapeutic approaches targeting protein misfolding and aggregation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Considering the between-sex functional differences, e.g., in the NO status, we present similar studies performed in female rats. We examined if the theophylline effects (non-selective adenosine antagonist) in NG and DM females with or without active NO synthases differed from the earlier findings. In anaesthetised female Sprague Dawley rats, both NG and DM, untreated or after NO synthesis blockade with L-NAME, theophylline effects, on blood pressure, renal hemodynamics and excretion, and renal tissue NO were investigated. Renal artery blood flow (Transonic probe), cortical, outer-, and inner-medullary flows (laser-Doppler technique), and renal tissue NO signal (selective electrode) were measured. In contrast to males, in female NG and DM rats, theophylline induced renal vasodilation. In NO-deficient females, theophylline induced comparable renal vasodilatation, confirming the vasoconstrictor influence of the renal adenosine. In NG and DM females with intact NO synthesis, adenosine inhibition diminished kidney tissue NO, contrasting with an increase reported in males. Lowered baseline renal excretion in DM females suggested stimulation of renal tubular reabsorption due to the prevalence of antinatriuretic over natriuretic tubular action of adenosine receptors. An opposite inter-receptor balance pattern emerged previously from male studies. The study exposed between-sex functional differences in the interrelation of adenosine and NO in rats with normoglycaemia and streptozotocin diabetes. The findings also suggest that in diabetes mellitus, the abundance of individual receptor types can distinctly differ between females and males."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

These properties are deeply affected in the course of many neurodegenerative diseases, including tauopathies, often before the onset of the disease. In this respect, the transfer of essential amino acids such as glutamate and glutamine between neurons and astrocytes in the glutamate–glutamine cycle (GGC) is one example. In this review, we focus on the GGC and the disruption of this cycle in tau-dependent neurodegeneration. A profound understanding of the complex functions of the GGC and, in the broader context, searching for dysfunctions in communication pathways between astrocytes and neurons via GGC in health and disease, is of critical significance for the development of novel mechanism-based therapies for neurodegenerative disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Following either intravenous or oral application citicoline (CDP-choline of exogenous origin) undergoes quick decomposition to cytidine and choline, and for this reason it is frequently considered a prodrug. However, upon\nacute intravenous application in mice citicoline is, on a molar basis, 20 times less toxic than choline. To find out whether\ncytidine may attenuate toxicity of choline, in the present experiments we compared maximum tolerated doses of single\nintravenous injections of choline and equimolar mixture of choline and cytidine. We assumed that, if after oral intake\na substantial part of citicoline is catabolised already in the intestine and its catabolites enter blood separately, intravenously\napplied equimolar mixture of cytidine and choline will be markedly less toxic than an equivalent molar dose of choline.\nHowever, the maximum tolerated single doses determined in our experiment for choline and equimolar mixture of choline\nand cytidine were similar. These data suggest that citicoline taken orally is not significantly decomposed in the intestinal\nlumen, but absorbed to blood as the intact molecule."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Ablation of large tumors requires treating them with a sequence of single HIFU beams, with a specific time interval in-between. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological effects induced in a malignant solid tumor of the rat mammary gland, implanted in adult Wistar rats, during HIFU treatment according to a new ablation plan which allowed researchers to significantly shorten the duration of the procedure. We used a custom, automated, ultrasound imaging-guided HIFU ablation device. Tumors with a 1 mm thickness margin of healthy tissue were subjected to HIFU. Three days later, the animals were sacrificed, and the HIFU-treated tissues were harvested. The biological effects were studied, employing morphological, histological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural techniques. Massive cell death, hemorrhages, tissue loss, influx of immune cells, and induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the HIFU-treated tumors. No damage to healthy tissues was observed in the area surrounding the safety margin. These results confirmed the efficacy of the proposed shortened duration of the HIFU ablation procedure and its potential for the treatment of solid tumors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","uid":"bL0dXXB9qN74NNNOmYDF46Q","uuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","name":"Instytut Podstawowych Problemów Techniki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61415aa99543c7051ff01c73"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","parentUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","rootUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","uid":"bdmrms-mkJ7vPbeBs1t2ugw","uuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","name":"Międzynarodowy Instytut Biologii Molekularnej i Komórkowej w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397981"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","parentUuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","rootUuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent activator of the innate immune system, was suggested to influence or\neven trigger the neuropathological alterations in AD. LPS-induced neuroinflammation involves changes in transcription of\nseveral genes, thus controlling these molecular processes may be a potentially efficient strategy to attenuate the progression of AD. Since genome-wide association studies showed that the majority of AD-related genetic risk factors (AD-GRF) are\nconnected to the immune system, our aim was to identify AD-GRF affected in the hippocampus by LPS-induced systemic\ninflammatory response (SIR). Moreover, we analysed the role of bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins, the\nreaders of the acetylation code, in controlling the transcription of selected AD-GRF in the brain during neuroinflammation.\nIn our study, we used a mouse model of LPS-induced SIR and mouse microglial BV2 cells. JQ1 was used as an inhibitor of\nBET proteins. The level of mRNA was analysed using microarrays and qPCR.\nOur data demonstrated that among the established AD-GRF, only the expression of Cd33 was significantly upregulated\nin the hippocampus during SIR. In parallel, we observed an increase in the expression of Brd4, a  BET family member.\nJQ1 prevented an LPS-evoked increase in Cd33 expression in the hippocampus of mice. Moreover, JQ1 reduced Cd33 expression in BV2 microglial cells stimulated with blood serum from LPS-treated mice.\nOur study suggests that LPS-evoked SIR may increase Cd33 gene expression in the brain, and inhibition of BET proteins\nthrough suppression of Cd33 expression could be a promising strategy in prevention or in slowing down the progression of\nneuroinflammation and may potentially affect the pathomechanism of AD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We previously reported that pretreatment with a nonconvulsive dose of glutamine (Gln) synthetase inhibitor methionine sulfoximine (MSO) mitigates the intensity of initial pilocarpine (Pilo)-induced seizures in juvenile rats. We hypothesized that MSO exerts its protective effect by preventing the seizure-initiating and seizure-propagating increase of cell volume. Taurine (Tau) is an osmosensitive amino acid, whose release reflects increased cell volume. Therefore, we tested whether the poststimulus rise of amplitude of Pilo-induced electrographic seizures and their attenuation by MSO are correlated with the release of Tau from seizure-affected hippocampus. Methods: Lithium-pretreated animals were administered MSO (75 mg/kg ip) 2.5 h before the induction of convulsions by Pilo (40 mg/kg ip). Electroencephalographic (EEG) power was analyzed during 60 min post-Pilo, at 5-min intervals. Extracellular accumulation of Tau (eTau) served as a marker of cell swelling. eTau, extracellular Gln (eGln), and extracellular glutamate (eGlu) were assayed in the microdialysates of the ventral hippocampal CA1 region collected at 15-min intervals during the whole 3.5-h observation period. Results: The first EEG signal became apparent at ~10 min post-Pilo. The EEG amplitude across most frequency bands peaked at ~40 min post-Pilo, and showed strong (r ~.72–.96) temporal correlation with eTau, but no correlation with eGln or eGlu. MSO pretreatment delayed the first EEG signal in Pilo-treated rats by ~10 min, and depressed the EEG amplitude across most frequency bands, to values that remained strongly correlated with eTau (r >.92) and moderately correlated (r ~ −.59) with eGln, but not with eGlu. Significance: Strong correlation between attenuation of Pilo-induced seizures and Tau release indicates that the beneficial effect of MSO is due to the prevention of cell volume increase concurrent with the onset of seizures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930d878c28a0473a1fab"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In adult cats with bilateral lesions of the central retina, we explored the possibility that motion perception training can limit the associated degradation of the visual system. We evaluated how visual training affects behavioral performance and white matter structure. Recently, we proposed (Kozak et al. in Transl Vis Sci Technol 10:9, 2021) a new motion-acuity test for low vision patients, enabling full visual field functional assessment through simultaneous perception of shape and motion. Here, we integrated this test as the last step of a 10-week motion-perception training.\nResults\nCats were divided into three groups: retinal-lesioned only and two trained groups, retinal-lesioned trained and control trained. The behavioral data revealed that trained cats with retinal lesions were superior in motion tasks, even when the difficulty relied only on acuity. 7 T-MRI scanning was done before and after lesioning at 5 different timepoints, followed by Fixel-Based and Fractional Anisotropy Analysis. In cats with retinal lesions, training resulted in a more localized and reduced percentage decrease in Fixel-Based Analysis metrics in the dLGN, caudate nucleus and hippocampus compared to untrained cats. In motion-sensitive area V5/PMLS, the significant decreases in fiber density were equally strong in retinal-lesioned untrained and trained cats, up to 40% in both groups. The only cortical area with Fractional Anisotropy values not affected by central retinal loss was area V5/PMLS. In other visual ROIs, the Fractional Anisotropy values increased over time in the untrained retinal lesioned group, whereas they decreased in the retinal lesioned trained group and remained at a similar level as in trained controls.\nConclusions\nOverall, our MRI results showed a stabilizing effect of motion training applied soon after central retinal loss induction on white matter structure. We propose that introducing early motion-acuity training for low vision patients, aimed at the intact and active retinal peripheries, may facilitate brain plasticity processes toward better vision."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709404878c28a0473b4fa2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Diffuse damage tothe white matter is the most frequently detected pathology in this condition.We hypothesized that oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiationdisturbed by mild neonatal asphyxia may affect the viability, maturation, andphysiological functioning of oligodendrocytes. To address this issue, we stud-ied the effect of temporal HI in the in vivo model in P7 rats with magnetic res-onance imaging (MRI), microscopy techniques and biochemical analyses.Moreover, we recreated the injury in vitro performing the procedure ofoxygen–glucose deprivation on rat neonatal OPCs to determine its effect oncell viability, proliferation, and differentiation. In the in vivo model, MRIevaluation revealed changes in the volume of different brain regions, as well aschanges in the directional diffusivity of water in brain tissue that may suggestpathological changes to myelinated neuronal fibers. Hypomyelination wasobserved in the cortex, striatum, and CA3 region of the hippocampus. Severechanges to myelin ultrastructure were observed, including delamination ofmyelin sheets. Interestingly, shortly after the injury, an increase in oligoden-drocyte proliferation was observed, followed by an overproduction of myelinproteins 4 weeks after HI. Results verified with the in vitro model indicate,that in the first days after damage, OPCs do not show reduced viability, inten-sively proliferate, and overexpress myelin proteins and oligodendrocyte-specific transcription factors. In conclusion, despite the increase in oligoden-drocyte proliferation and myelin protein expression after HI, the productionof functional myelin sheaths in brain tissue is impaired. Presented study pro-vides a detailed description of oligodendrocyte pathophysiology developed inan effect of HI injury, resulting in an altered CNS myelination. The describedmodels may serve as useful tools for searching and testing effective of effectivemyelination-supporting therapies for HI injuries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709404878c28a0473b4fa2","5e709445878c28a0473b9715"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The lighting conditions affected not only culture growth and proliferation potential, but also the accumulation of polyphenols and the expression of the genes involved in their biosynthesis (PAL, TAT, RAS). The highest proliferation rates (6.21 for S. atropatana and 4.26 for S. bulleyana) were achieved under white LEDs. In contrast, the highest biomass production was observed under white and mixed red/blue light (both species), although a similar effect was revealed for the blue light treatment for S. bulleyana. The dominant polyphenol in both species was rosmarinic acid: its level was highest in S. atropatana shoots exposed to red light (20.86 mg/g dry weight, DW) and S. bulleyana under white light (19.72 mg/g DW). The effects of the light treatments on gene expression varied between plant species and the analyzed gene; for example, mixed light stimulated RAS expression in S. bulleyana shoots and inhibited it in S. atropatana shoots. Principal component analysis found that gene expression did not always translate directly into rosmarinic acid production. In summary, our findings indicate that optimized lighting conditions have a significant effect on the production of polyphenolic compounds in sage shoot cultures. However, further research is needed to find the relationship between light treatment and plant biosynthetic pathway."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

pathologies, including glaucoma. Rod cells rely on store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) to safeguard against the prolonged lowering of intracellular calcium ion concentrations. Zebrafish that lacked the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor Stim2 (stim2 knockout [KO]) exhibited impaired vision and lower light perception-related gene expression. We sought to understand mechanisms that are responsible for vision impairment in stim2 KO zebrafish. The single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing of neuronal cells from brains of 5 days postfertilization larvae distinguished 27 cell clusters, 10 of which exhibited distinct gene expression patterns, including amacrine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic retinal interneurons and GABAergic optic tectum cells. Five clusters exhibited significant changes in cell proportions between stim2 KO and controls, including GABAergic diencephalon and optic tectum cells. Transmission electron microscopy of stim2 KO zebrafish revealed decreases in width of the inner plexiform layer, ganglion cells, and their dendrites numbers (a hallmark of glaucoma). GABAergic neuron densities in the inner nuclear layer, including amacrine cells, as well as photoreceptors significantly decreased in stim2 KO zebrafish. Our study suggests a novel role for Stim2 in the regulation of neuronal insulin expression and GABAergic-dependent vision causing glaucoma-like retinal pathology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","uid":"bdmrms-mkJ7vPbeBs1t2ugw","uuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","name":"Międzynarodowy Instytut Biologii Molekularnej i Komórkowej w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffd4e9d085dcb6be6b60a75","5e70928b878c28a047397962","602f72569543c7410626f4bf","5e70928f878c28a047397edf","5e709433878c28a0473b807b","5e70928b878c28a047397981","60c33d049543c72336544206"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","parentUuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","rootUuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Previous studies consistently found increases in brain lactate (Lac) concentrations following graded exercise up to 85% of the predicted maximal heart rate. However, the reported effects on brain concentrations of glutamine and glutamate were not consistent. This study aimed to determine the effect of acute intense graded maximal exercise on 1H-MRS signals related to concentrations of Glu, glutamate+glutamine (Glx), and Lac. Young adult males were randomly divided into two groups and subjected to 1H-MRS when resting (NE) or shortly after cessation of the intense graded exercise intended to pass the anaerobic threshold (E). 1H-MRS spectra were acquired from the large voxel encompassing the occipito-parietal cortex only once. Estimates of Glu, Glx, and Lac concentrations were calculated in institutional units by normalizing to a spectroscopic signal originating from creatine-containing compounds (Cr). Concentrations of Glu, Glx, and Lac were respectively 11%, 12.6%, and 48.5% higher in E than in NE (p < 0.001). The increased brain Lac signal in the exercising group indicated that in our experiment, vigorous exercise resulted in passing the anaerobic threshold and lactate apparently entered the brain.

It has been discovered that plastic microparticles (MPs) and nanoparticles (NPs), formed under the influence of physical forces, can pose a significant health risk. Increasing evidence indicates that NPs can have various toxic effects, including oxidative stress and cell death. However, the mechanisms underlying their toxicity are still under investigation. In this study, we examined whether polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs) are internalized in primary astrocytes. We tracked their intracellular fate and search for potential interference with the intercellular communication pathway mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs). Primary astrocyte cultures were exposed to fluorescent PS-NPs at concentrations of 0.5, 1, 25 and 50 µg/mL for 24, 48 and 72 hours. Based on electron microscopic analysis and confocal imaging, we determined that PS-NPs are internalized in astrocytes and accumulate in the cytoplasm in a concentration-dependent manner, localizing to endosomal-lysosomal system. Astrocytes exposed to PS-NPs form EVs containing encapsulated PS-NPs, which are released into the culture medium after 72 h of exposure and can be transferred via this route to other cells. As shown by proteomic analysis, PS-NPs affects the composition of the protein cargo of released EVs by decreasing the representation of proteins such as CD47, CSTB and CNDP2. Intercellular transport of PS-NPs in primary astrocytes is mediated by EVs system. EV-mediated release of PS-NPs may alleviate their toxicity in a single astrocyte but may also contribute to the spread of their toxic effect to neighbouring astrocytes. Exposure to PS-NPs interferes with the mechanism of protein sorting, thereby potentially influencing the EV-mediated cell-cell communication pathway."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In the current study, we asked whether Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) which express stage-specific embryonic antigen-4 (SSEA-4) can be considered as a pluripotent-like stem cell population.\nMethods: SSEA-4 expression in different culture conditions was compared and the efficiency of two cell separation methods were assessed: Magnetic Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). After isolation, SSEA-4+ cells were analyzed for the following parameters: the maintenance of the SSEA-4 antigen expression after cell sorting, stem cell-related gene expression, proliferation potential, clonogenicity, secretome profiling, and the ability to form spheres under 3D culture conditions.\nResults: FACS allowed for the enrichment of SSEA-4+ cell content in the population that lasted for six passages after sorting. Despite the elevated expression of stemness-related genes, SSEA-4+ cells neither differed in their proliferation and clonogenicity potential from initial and negative populations nor exhibited pluripotent differentiation repertoire. SSEA-4+ cells were observed to form smaller spheroids and exhibited increased survival under 3D conditions.\nConclusion: Despite the transient expression of stemness-related genes, our findings could not fully confirm the undifferentiated pluripotent-like nature of the SSEA-4+ WJ-MSC population cultured in vitro."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We determined the action mediated\nby endothelin type B and by dopamine D3 receptors (ETB-R, D3-R) in anaesthetized spontaneously hypertensive (SHR)\nand in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. In rats of both hypertension models infused during 60\nmin into the interstitium of in situ kidney were either ETB-R antagonist, BQ788 (0.67 mg kg–1 BW h–1\n) or D3-R antagonist,\nGR103691 (0.2 mg kg–1 BW h–1\n). Arterial pressure (MAP), renal artery blood flow (RBF, transonic probe) and renal\nmedullary blood flow (MBF, laser-Doppler) were measured along with sodium, water and total solute excretion (UNaV, V,\nUosmV). Experiments with ETB-R blockade confirmed their tonic vasodilator action in the whole kidney (RBF) and medulla\n(MBF) in both hypertension models. In SHR only, the first evidence was provided that ETB-R specifically increases\ntranstubular backflux of non-electrolyte solutes. In DOCA-salt rats ETB-R blockade caused an early decrease in water and\nsalt transport whereas an increase was often reported from many previous studies. The most striking effect of D3-R\nblockade in SHR was a selective increase in MBF, which strongly suggested tonic vasoconstrictor action of these receptors\nin the renal medulla; this speaks against prevailing opinion that D3 receptors are virtually inactive in SHR. In our model\nvariant of DOCA-salt rats of D3-R blockade clearly caused a rapid major increase in MAP in parallel with depression of\nrenal haemodynamics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Due to the risk of environmental hazards, the mechanisms of AgNPs\ntoxicity should be thoroughly investigated to deepen our understanding of the potential negative impact on human health.\nAs oxidative stress (OS) is known to be one of the major mechanisms of AgNP-induced toxicity, in the present study, we\nhave evaluated OS-related changes in cytotoxicity parameters in AgNP-treated cerebellar granule cells (CGCs), as well as\nthe effectiveness of antioxidant defence systems, such as glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutases (SOD1 and SOD2)\nand catalase. The results indicate that exposure of CGCs to AgNPs decreases cell viability and mitochondrial potential\nand increases intracellular calcium concentration and free radical production. The level of intracellular GSH significantly\ndecreases in cells after short-term exposure, but overexpression of SOD1 is observed. In contrast, after long-term exposure,\ncatalase activity is substantially reduced. Supplying extracellular GSH prior to AgNPs significantly improved cell survival\nand reversed most of the changes in the investigated parameters. This suggests that GSH may be considered as a protective agent suitable for counteracting the negative effects of exposure to AgNPs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

By CRISPR‒Cas9-mediated downregulation we evaluated the downstream proteomics and transcriptomics programs of MYC, mutant KRAS, and mutant TP53 in a panel of cell lines with either one or three of these oncogenes activated, in cancers of the lung, colon and pancreas. Using RNAi screening of the commonly activated molecular programs, we found a signature of three proteins - RUVBL1, HSPA9, and XPO1, which could be efficiently targeted by novel drug combinations in the studied cancer types. Interestingly, the signature was controlled by the oncoproteins in a redundant or competitive manner rather than by cooperation. Each oncoprotein individually upregulated the target genes, while upon oncogene co-expression each target was controlled preferably by a dominant oncoprotein which reduced the influence of the others. This interplay was mediated by redundant routes of target gene activation - as in the case of mutant KRAS signaling to c-Jun/GLI2 transcription factors bypassing c-Myc activation, and by competition - as in the case of mutant p53 and c-Myc competing for binding to target promoters. The global transcriptomics data from the cell lines and patient samples indicate that the redundancy and competition of oncogenic programs are broad phenomena, that may constitute even a majority of the genes dependent on oncoproteins, as shown for mutant p53 in colon and lung cancer cell lines. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that redundant oncogene programs harbor targets for efficient anticancer drug combinations, bypassing the limitations for direct oncoprotein inhibition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947e878c28a0473be570"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Top RNA-seq genes with differential expression between the age groups included three selenoproteins (GPX1, SELENOW, SELENOH) and three heat shock proteins (HSPA6, HSPA1A, HSPA1B), with the highest expression in LCLs from young women, indicating that young women are better protected from oxidative stress. The expression of two additional genes, BID encoding BH3-interacting domain death agonist and CD99 encoding CD99 antigen, showed unique age dependence, with similar expression levels in young and centenarian women while exhibiting higher and lower expression levels, respectively, in LCLs from women aged 60-80 years compared with the two other age groups. This age-related differential expression of BID and CD99 suggests elevated inflammation susceptibility in middle-aged women compared with either young or centenarian women.

They are G-protein coupled receptors that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and reduce neurotransmitter release, mainly located presynaptically and acting as autoreceptors. This review aims to examine the differential expression and function of group III mGluRs across various brain regions such as the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, with a special focus on the neonatal stage of development. Glutamate excitotoxicity plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of brain ischemia in neonates. While ionotropic glutamate receptors are traditional targets for neuroprotection, their direct inhibition often leads to severe side effects due to their critical roles in normal neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Group III mGluRs provide a more nuanced and potentially safer approach by modulating rather than blocking glutamatergic transmission. Their downstream signaling cascade results in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels, neuronal hyperpolarization, and reduced neurotransmitter release, effectively decreasing excitotoxic signaling without completely suppressing essential glutamatergic functions. Importantly, the neuroprotective effects of group III mGluRs extend beyond direct modulation of glutamate release influencing glial cell function, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, all of which contribute to secondary injury cascades in brain ischemia. This comprehensive analysis of group III mGluRs multifaceted neuroprotective potential provides valuable insights for developing novel therapeutic strategies to combat excitotoxicity in neonatal ischemic brain injury."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

RDN was performed one week after creation of ACF or sham-operation. Animals were prepared for evaluation of autoregulatory capacity of renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and of the pressure-natriuresis characteristics after stepwise changes in renal arterial pressure (RAP) induced by aortic clamping. Their basal values of blood pressure and renal function were significantly lower than with innervated sham-operated TGR (p < 0.05 in all cases): mean arterial pressure (MAP) (115 ± 2 vs. 160 ± 3 mmHg), RBF (6.91 ± 0.33 vs. 10.87 ± 0.38 ml.min–1.g–1), urine flow (UF) (11.3 ± 1.79 vs. 43.17 ± 3.24 µl.min–1.g–1) and absolute sodium excretion (UNaV) (1.08 ± 0.27 vs, 6.38 ± 0.76 µmol.min–1.g–1). After denervation ACF TGR showed improved autoregulation of RBF: at lowest RAP level (80 mmHg) the value was higher than in innervated ACF TGR (6.92 ± 0.26 vs. 4.54 ± 0.22 ml.min–1.g–1, p < 0.05). Also, the pressure-natriuresis relationship was markedly improved after RDN: at the RAP of 80 mmHg UF equaled 4.31 ± 0.99 vs. 0.26 ± 0.09 µl.min–1.g–1 recorded in innervated ACF TGR, UNaV was 0.31 ± 0.05 vs. 0.04 ± 0.01 µmol min–1.g–1 (p < 0.05 in all cases). In conclusion, in our model of hypertensive rat with ACF-induced HF, RDN improved autoregulatory capacity of RBF and the pressure-natriuresis relationship when measured at the stage of HF decompensation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

These complications mainly include the maldigestion and malabsorption of nutrients resulting from the immaturity of the small intestine. The current study investigated whether pre-digestion of fat in infant formula would affect the developmental remodeling of the structure of the small intestine mucous membrane. Three groups of premature piglets (corresponding to 30–32 week of human gestation) were used in the study: the first group, not subjected to any treatment and euthanized within 2 hours after caesarian delivery, was used as the control group (PT group), the second group, was fed an infant formula—IF (SPT group), and the third group was fed a lipase pre-hydrolyzed infant formula—hIF (PPT group). Feeding preterm piglets with an infant formula for 14 days stimulated intestinal maturation (in SPT and PPT groups). However, pre-digestion of the infant formula with lipase significantly increased proliferative activity and intensity of apoptosis in the small intestine epithelium, resulting in more rapid enterocyte turnover. The data obtained not only confirm that starting enteral feeding directly after birth stimulates developmental and structural changes in the small intestine, but also highlighted the importance of lipid digestion for enterocyte turnover and speeding up of intestinal maturation in preterm piglets. The latest is of high importance for the proper gut development of preterm children."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea4","uid":"bdue8IYFHJjfPMqPlXSYxbA","uuid":"30312732-6777-4ca9-84e6-ad3f07bc18c2","name":"Instytut Fizjologii i Żywienia Zwierząt im.

This study examined the effects of pooling donor-derived macrophages on their phenotype and function, focusing on murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs). Murine BMDMs were generated using L929-conditioned media and compared across single and pooled donors (two-to-five mice). Similarly, hMDMs cultured with M-CSF from individual donors were compared to pooled cultures. Pooling macrophages did not alter core phenotypic markers (CD11b, F4/80, CD64) or functional outputs such as cytokine secretion and nitric oxide production. In hMDMs, pooling reduced variability and led to slightly elevated or more-uniform marker expression. These findings demonstrate that pooling macrophages minimizes inter-individual variability without compromising cellular stability or function, enhancing reproducibility in immunological research while maintaining the option of single-donor studies for personalized analyses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This sharp separation of chronic neuropathies into two groups has serious clinical implications. As a consequence, the patients harboring CMT mutations are practically excluded from pharmacological anti-inflammatory treatments. In this review, we present that neuropathological studies of peripheral nerves taken from some patients representing familial aggregation of CMTs revealed the presence of inflammation within the nerves. This shows that neurodegeneration resulting from germline mutations and the inflammatory process are not mutually exclusive. We also point to reports demonstrating that, at the clinical level, a positive response to anti-inflammatory therapy was observed in some patients diagnosed with CMTs, confirming the role of the inflammatory component in CMT. We narrowed a group of more than 100 genes whose mutations were found in CMT-affected patients to the seven most common (MPZ, PMP22, GJB1, SEPT9, LITAF, FIG4, and GDAP1) as being linked to the coexistence of hereditary and inflammatory neuropathy. We listed studies of mouse models supporting the idea of the presence of an inflammatory process in some CMTs and studies demonstrating at the cellular level the presence of an inflammatory response. In the following, we discuss the possible molecular basis of some neuropathies involving neurodegenerative and inflammatory processes at both the clinical and morphological levels. Finally, we discuss the prospect of a therapeutic approach using immunomodulation in some patients affected by CMTs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afe74"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Its adduct to adenine 1,N6-α-hydroxypropanoadenine (HPA) is a mutagenic lesion effectively repaired by the AlkB dioxygenase. Here, we provide in vivo, in vitro, and in silico evidence that it is also the substrate for the AlkA glycosylase. We studied the role of AlkA and AlkB in E. coli cells under conditions of induced adaptive response. Both alkA and alkB defective strains were not more sensitive to exogenous ACR than the wild type was. To simulate endogenously arising adducts, we used acrolein-modified plasmids, allowing monitoring of all kinds of substitutions originating from the acrolein modification of adenine. Both the AlkA and AlkB proteins were engaged in alleviating HPA-induced mutagenesis. Moreover, HPA was effectively repaired by AlkA and AlkB in vivo, even without induction of adaptive response. These findings suggest that the main contribution to acrolein mutagenicity comes from its endogenous sources, whereas AlkA and AlkB can play an additional role in controlling the level of DNA adducts of endogenous origin. Acrolein does not induce the adaptive response. HPA contains an asymmetric carbon atom in the hydroxypropano ring and exists as two stereoisomers. AlkA excises both of them in vitro.

This review is the first to specifically provide evidence-based analysis about the influence of quitting smoking on diabetes-related complications in people with type 2 diabetes.\nMethod\nThe present review was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews. All human clinical studies assessing the effects of stopping smoking cessation on diabetes-related complications were included. PubMed and Embase were screened until January 2024. References of primary studies and principal peer-reviewed scientific journals in the field were manually screened.\nResults\nWe identified a total of 1023 studies. Only 26 met the criteria for eligibility. In general quitting smoking is associated with decreased risks of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Regarding microvascular complications, the strongest evidence for the beneficial effects of smoking cessation is observed in diabetic nephropathy. However, the relationship between smoking cessation and retinopathy, neuropathy, diabetic foot complications and diabetic-related erectile dysfunction, is poorly investigated.\nConclusion\nQuitting smoking offers significant advantages in managing diabetes-related complications, significantly lowering the risks of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and diabetic nephropathy. This underscores the importance of cessation. Providing evidence-based information on the benefits of stopping smoking for people with type 2 diabetes who smoke, can bolster smoking cessation efforts in the context of diabetes management."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Abo cause mitochondrial dysfunctions leading to an imbalance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins and finally to neuronal apoptosis. Further, Abo trigger overactivation of microglia followed by enhanced release of proinflammatory cytokines, which exacerbates neurotoxicity of Abo. The above-mentioned alterations are accompanied by disturbed metabolism of prosurvival bioactive sphingolipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), and S1P-dependent signalling via specific receptors (S1PR1-5). In the present study, we investigated for the first time the influence of selective – ponesimod (S1PR1), CYM5541 (S1PR3), CYM50308 (S1PR4), A971432 (S1PR4), siponimod (S1PR1,5) – and nonselective – phosphorylated fingolimod/pFTY720 (S1PR1,3-5) – S1P receptor modulators on cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and expression of genes encoding S1P receptors, pro- and antiapoptotic proteins and proinflammatory cytokines in hippocampal neuronal (HT22) and in microglial (BV2) cell lines treated with 1 µM Abo for 24 hours. A significant reduction in the MMP, cell viability and mRNA levels of Bcl2 and Il18 together with increased Il6 expression was observed in HT22 cells after Abo administration. CYM50308 and A971432 restored the Bcl2 mRNA level to control values (those of Abo-untreated cells) and pFTY720 markedly reduced the Il6 expression. In BV2 cells, Abo induced a significant decrease in the MMP, cell viability and expression of S1pr1, Bad, Bcl2, Tnf and Il18, which was not counteracted by any of the modulators used. In turn, mRNA levels of Il1b, Il6, were markedly increased in microglia after Abo treatment and the administration of studied compounds tended to exacerbate the proinflammatory effect of Abo. In conclusion, the toxic effect of Abo is more pronounced in microglia. S1P receptor modulators may to some extent mitigate proapoptotic and proinflammatory effects of Abo in HT22 cells. In contrast, the same compounds tend to enhance Abo-induced inflammatory changes in BV2 cells."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Fully developed TLE in this model is associated with hippocampal degeneration, hallmarked by reactive\nastrogliosis, and causally related to the concomitant loss of GS-containing astrocytes. By contrast, short-term pre-exposure\nof rats to relatively low MSO doses that only moderately inhibited GS, attenuated and delayed the initial seizures in the\nlithium-pilocarpine model of TLE and in other seizure-associated contexts: in the pentylenetetrazole kindling model in rat,\nand in spontaneously fring or electrically stimulated brain slices.

Exploring po-docyte energy metabolism, especially under diabetic conditions, may offer insights into the pathogenesis of diabetic kidneydisease. Lipid accumulation is recognized as a cause of podocyte cytoskeleton remodeling and insulin resistance. Thus, the roleof the metabolic sensor G‐protein‐coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) was examined in the molecular pathway of lipid accumulationin podocytes under hyperglycemic conditions. It was discovered that hyperglycemia downregulated the cyclic adenosinemonophosphate/protein kinase A signaling pathway, which downregulated the expression of adipose triglyceride lipase(ATGL). Perilipin 1 was also downregulated; simultaneously, lipid droplet accumulation was enhanced. Glycerol and free fattyacid concentrations were also reduced, providing evidence of lipolysis inhibition. Interestingly, the expression of GPR81decreased under hyperglycemia conditions despite the evidence of its activation, indicating strict lipolysis regulation. Moreimportantly, cell functions were altered, reflected by an increase in albumin permeability and rearrangement of the actincytoskeleton. The effect of ATGL activity inhibition on lipolysis, actin cytoskeleton arrangement, and permeability of thepodocyte monolayer was investigated. The results were similar to GPR81 downregulation. Altogether, the present data indicatethat GPR81 is likely a crucial part of the lipid sensing system, and its alterations during hyperglycemia might contribute toglomerular filtration barrier deterioration in diabetic kidney disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The only approach currently available in clinical practice for severe cases of HI is therapeutic hypothermia, initiated shortly after birth and supported by medications to regulate blood pressure, control epileptic seizures, and dialysis to support kidney function. However, these treatments are not effective enough to significantly improve infant survival or prevent brain damage. The need to create a new effective therapy has focused attention on metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), which control signaling pathways involved in HI-induced neurodegeneration. The complexity of mGluR actions, considering their localization and developmental changes, and the functions of each subtype in HI-evoked brain damage, combined with difficulties in the availability of safe and effective modulators, raises the question whether modulation of mGluRs with subtype-selective ligands can become a new treatment in neonatal HI. Addressing this question, this review presents the available information concerning the role of each of the eight receptor subtypes of the three mGluR groups (group I, II, and III). Data obtained from experiments performed on in vitro and in vivo neonatal HI models show the neuroprotective potential of group I mGluR antagonists, as well as group II and III agonists. The information collected in this work indicates that the neuroprotective effects of manipulating mGluR in experimental HI models, despite the need to create more safe and selective ligands for particular receptors, provide a chance to create new therapies for the sensitive brains of infants at risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

High glucose (HG) concentrations are associated with the induction of oxidative stress in podocytes, leading to disruption of the glomerular filtration barrier. Our recent study revealed a significant decrease in the membrane-bound fraction of Klotho in podocytes that were cultured under HG conditions. Given that disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is responsible for the shedding of Klotho from the cell membrane, the present study investigated the impact of HG on the interplay between ADAM17 and Klotho in human podocytes. We demonstrated that ADAM17 protein levels significantly increased in urine, renal tissue, and glomeruli from diabetic rats, with a concomitant increase in glomerular albumin permeability. High glucose increased ADAM17 extracellular activity, NADPH oxidase activity, and albumin permeability in podocytes. These effects were reversed after treatment with ADAM17 inhibitor, in cells with downregulated ADAM17 expression, or after the addition of Klotho. Additionally, elevations of extracellular ADAM17 activity were observed in podocytes with the downregulation of Klotho expression.

We have therefore examined other, not analysed so far, types of central nervous system (CNS) tumours, pineoblastoma and germinoma, to assess a potential involvement of BCOR in these tumours. Levels of BCOR RNA expression were investigated by NanoString nCounter system analysis in a series of altogether 66 high grade paediatric tumours, including four pineoblastoma cases. Immunohistological detection of BCOR was performed in eight pineoblastoma, five germinoma and four atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumours (ATRTs), all located in the pineal region. We detected BCOR expression in all pineoblastomas, at the RNA and protein levels, but not in germinomas and ATRTs.

The aim of this study was to assess the attainment of the main treatment goals for secondary cardiovascular prevention in coronary patients with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) in Poland.\nMaterial and methods:\nThe study group included 1026 patients (65.5 ±9 y.o.; males: 72%) included at least 6 months after the index hospitalisation for myocardial infarction, unstable angina, elective percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass surgery. The target and treatment goals were defined according to the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on cardiovascular prevention.\nResults:\nPatients with DM (n = 332; 32%) were slightly older compared to non-diabetic (n = 694) individuals (67.2 ±7 vs. 64.6 ±9 years old; p < 0.0001). The DM goal was achieved in 196 patients (60%). The rate of primary (LDL: 51% vs. 35%; p < 0.0001) and secondary (non-HDL: 56% vs. 48%; p < 0.02) goal attainment was higher in DM(+) compared to DM(–) patients. The rate of target blood pressure was lower in DM(+) than in normoglycemic patients (52% vs. 61% at < 140/90 mm Hg, p < 0.01. As expected, goal achievement of normal weight (9.5% vs. 19%; p < 0.0001) and waist circumference (7% vs. 15%; p < 0.001) was lower in diabetic patients and the rate of regular physical activity was similar (DM+ 12% vs. DM– 14%; p = ns). Finally, there was no difference in active smokers (DM+ 23% vs. DM– 22%; p = ns).\nConclusions:\nGreat majority of Polish patients in secondary prevention do not achieve treatment goals. Although lipid goals attainment is better in DM and the rate of smokers is similar, the management of all risk factors needs to be improved."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","uid":"bm3qIJZlNw1U92UVKrOsP_w","uuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Białymstoku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67ab2798fdbe8362a5726471","5e709375878c28a0473aa250","5e7093dc878c28a0473b21b6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","parentUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","rootUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Among the different subtypes of liver cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most commonly diagnosed liver cancer. Besides advances in diagnosis and promising results of pre-clinical studies, HCC remains a highly lethal disease. In many cases, HCC is an effect of chronic liver inflammation, which leads to the formation of a complex tumor microenvironment (TME) composed of immune and stromal cells. The TME of HCC patients is a challenge for therapies, as it is involved in metastasis and the development of resistance. However, given that the TME is an intricate system of immune and stromal cells interacting with cancer cells, new immune-based therapies are being developed to target the TME of HCC. Therefore, understanding the complexity of the TME in HCC will provide new possibilities to design novel and more effective immunotherapeutics and combinatorial therapies to overcome resistance to treatment. In this review, we describe the role of inflammation during the development and progression of HCC by focusing on TME.

challenging and therapeutic strategies require continuous development. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages play a pivotal role in tumor dynamics. Here, we present a Macrophage-Drug Conjugate (MDC) platform technology that enables loading macrophages with ferritin-drug complexes. We first show that macrophages actively take up human heavy chain ferritin (HFt) in vitro via macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1). We further manifest that drug-loaded macrophages transfer ferritin to adjacent cancer cells through a process termed ‘TRAnsfer of Iron-binding protein’ (TRAIN). The TRAIN process requires direct cell-to-cell contact and an immune synapse-like structure. At last, MDCs with various anti-cancer drugs are formulated with their safety and anti-tumor efficacy validated in multiple syngeneic mice and orthotopic human tumor models via different routes of administration. Importantly, MDCs can be prepared in advance and used as thawed products, supporting their clinical applicability. This MDC approach thus represents a promising advancement in the therapeutic landscape for solid tumors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

(2) Methods: The study was framed by a quantitative method and was conducted using the PAPI (pen and paper interview) technique among 895 Polish elite athletes representing 34 sports. (3) Results: Three-quarters (76.3%) of the athletes were vaccinated against COVID-19; statistically participants were more likely to be women, and athletes who participated in the Olympic Games. Four in ten (39.2%) were in favor of vaccination. Athletes were mainly concerned that COVID-19 would exclude them from training/competition (19.3%) and could have a long-term impact on their health (17.2%). Athletes who were vaccinated reported much higher confidence in the composition of the vaccine and the doctors who recommended vaccination than unvaccinated athletes. Athletes who competed at the Olympic level were more likely than others to disbelieve that vaccines were produced too quickly and were not well tested. National-level athletes showed the highest degree of distrust in the government regarding COVID-19 vaccination, with one in six respondents distrusting doctors with respect to COVID-19 vaccination. Four in ten respondents said they were in favor of vaccination. (4) Conclusions: Athletes’ attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination were significantly influenced by their environment—especially coaches and relatives. The power of social norms with respect to the decision to vaccinate against COVID-19 was very strong. Therefore, it is essential to build awareness about preventive policies among athletes and their social environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

rate, and it ranks third in the world after lung and colon cancer. Identified factors that increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer include chronic pancreatitis, radiation therapy to the pancreatic area due to another cancer, diabetes mellitus, obesity, smoking, and age. The objective of this study was to present the current state of knowledge on the quality of life of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, factors that determine QoL, and ways of coping with the disease. The low curability and low survival rates of pancreatic cancer significantly affect the quality of life of patients, often in the form of significant deterioration, especially in terms of mental changes, cognitive functions, and coping with the disease. Cognitive decline with comorbid depression is also typical for patients with this type of cancer. Research has shown that the health-related quality of life of patients with pancreatic cancer is low, so further research is needed to improve the situation in this area."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

This review article delves into the mechanisms of peptide presentation by MHC molecules, particularly emphasizing the roles of ncRNA-derived peptides and extracellular vesicles (EVs) in shaping the immunopeptidome landscape. We explore established and emerging insights into MHC molecule interactions with peptides, including the dynamics of peptide loading, transport, and the influence of cellular and genetic variations. The article highlights novel research on non-coding RNA (ncRNA)-derived peptides, which challenge conventional views of antigen processing and presentation and the role of EVs in transporting these peptides, thereby modulating immune responses at remote body sites. This novel research not only challenges conventional views but also opens up new avenues for understanding immune responses. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these mechanisms in developing therapeutic strategies, particularly for cancer immunotherapy. By conducting a comprehensive analysis of current literature and advanced methodologies in immunopeptidomics, this review aims to deepen the understanding of the complex interplay between MHC peptide presentation and the immune system, offering new perspectives on potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Additionally, the interactions between ncRNA-derived peptides and EVs provide a mechanism for the enhanced surface presentation of these peptides and highlight a novel pathway for their systemic distribution, potentially altering immune surveillance and therapeutic landscapes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The study involved 72 women randomly divided into two equal groups: the force plate training group, which underwent virtual balance training with visual motor feedback, and the gym training group, which received conventional balance training only. The functional balance assessment was performed before and after the rehabilitation by computerized posturography in a relaxed upright position with open and closed eyes, with visual motor feedback. In the FPT group in the feedback measurement, the mean radius of sways was 30% smaller after rehabilitation (p < 0.00002); the feedback coordination coefficient was more than 10% bigger after rehabilitation (p < 0.001) and reached 92%, which is excellent for elderly people. Total stagnation and stumbling reported by patients decreased after rehabilitation compared to the first examination. Both tested forms of training can contribute to reducing the risk of falls. However, a more significant improvement was obtained in the force plate training group perhaps because the physical effort on a force plate trains the precise movements needed to reposition the centre of gravity without generating excessive inertia forces responsible for loss of balance and falls. Perhaps the most desirable method of intervention is to train a person’s ability to perform slow but definite body movements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Moreover, our studies demonstrated that GW7647 had no effect on genes that regulate mitochondria fission and fusion of ADTg mice as correlated to mice without the transgene.

We investigated effects of Ang1-7 supplementation on blood pressure, renal circulation and intrarenal reactivity (IVR) to vasoactive agents in normoglycaemic (NG) and streptozotocin-diabetic rats (DM). In Sprague Dawley DM and NG rats, three weeks after streptozotocin (60 mg/kg i.p.) or solvent injection, Ang1-7 was administered (400 ng/min) over the next two weeks using subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps. During five weeks blood pressure (BP), 24 hours' water intake and diuresis were determined weekly. In anaesthetized rats, BP, renal total and cortical (CBF), outer-(OMBF) and inner medullary (IMBF) perfusion and urine excretion were determined. To check IVR, a short-time infusion of acetylcholine or norepinephrine was randomly given to the renal artery. Unexpectedly, BP did not differ between NG and DM, and this was not modified by Ang-1-7 supplementation. Baseline IMBF was higher in NG vs DM, and Ang1-7 treatment did not change it in NG but decreased it in DM. In the latter, Ang1-7 increased cortical IVR to vasoconstrictor and vasodilator stimuli. IMBF decrease after high acetylcholine dose seen in untreated NG was reverted to an increase in Ang1-7 treated rats. Irrespective of the glycaemia level, Ang1-7 did not modify BP. However, it impaired medullary circulation in DM, whereas in NG it rendered the medullary vasculature more sensitive to vasodilators. Possibly, the medullary hypoperfusion in DM was mediated by Ang1-7 activation of angiotensin AT-1 receptors which are upregulated by hyperglycaemia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Goat meat has a specific taste, and its quality can be influenced by the diet of the goats themselves. The aim of the study was to analyse the effect of supplementation with a mixture of dried Curcuma longa (turmeric) and Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) extracts on meat quality traits and the expression of genes associated with fatty acid metabolism in young castrated Polish White Improved bucks. These genes included diacylglycerol-o-acyltransferase (DGAT1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase alpha (ACACA) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor (SREBF1). The use of extracts had no apparent effect on the quality of buck meat. The bucks supplemented with an extract mixture were heavier after 124 days of rearing than controls, primarily due to greater daily weight gain. They had higher cold carcass weights and improved slaughter performance. No differences in the expression of lipid metabolism genes were recorded, indicating that supplementation did not negatively affect metabolic processes.\r\nDuring meat maturation, both groups exhibited similar changes in lightness and pH. However, the colorimetric analysis revealed lower a* and b* values, indicating paler meat – desirable for consumers. It can be suggested that the supplementation with a mixture of dried C. longa and R. officinalis extracts did not negatively impact the culinary quality of the meat.

Recently, CD71+ erythroid cells (CECs) have been identified as key immunomodulators in neonates and cancer patients, but their role in MM progression remains unclear. Using a murine MM model, closely resembling human disease, we observed that MM progression is associated with anaemia and an increase in immature CECs, which are characterized by elevated arginase 2 (ARG2) expression. These MM-associated CECs suppress T-cell proliferation, contributing to impaired immune responses. Notably, ARG2 deficiency in mice led to slower MM progression and improved survival. Furthermore, MM-bearing mice exhibited higher susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infections, mirroring the increased infection risk in MM patients. Our findings suggest that ARG2-expressing CECs play a critical role in MM-associated immune suppression and infection susceptibility, pointing out ARG2 as a potential therapeutic target to enhance immune function and reduce infection risks in MM patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medycznego Kształcenia Podyplomowego","affiliatedPersonIDs":["674060e5fdbe834c0b16ccae","67493538ece3984d1d487362","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1c07","5e7093c5878c28a0473b0810"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","uid":"bdmrms-mkJ7vPbeBs1t2ugw","uuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","name":"Międzynarodowy Instytut Biologii Molekularnej i Komórkowej w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935c878c28a0473a80f4"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","parentUuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e2","rootUuid":"e16daa5b-e06b-4c65-8f73-a281aafeddfd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","uid":"bnG-e53W_Hi4NXdss6g991Q","uuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","name":"Instytut Hematologii i Transfuzjologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afc4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","parentUuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","rootUuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

AD leads to progressive alterations in the redox state, ion homeostasis, lipids, and protein metabolism. Significant alterations in molecular processes and the functioning of several signaling pathways result in the degeneration and death of synapses and neuronal cells, leading to the most severe dementia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α) is among the processes affected by AD; it regulates the transcription of genes related to the metabolism of cholesterol, fatty acids, other lipids and neurotransmission, mitochondria biogenesis, and function. PPAR-α is involved in the cholesterol transport to mitochondria, the substrate for neurosteroid biosynthesis. PPAR-α-coding enzymes, such as sulfotransferases, which are responsible for neurosteroid sulfation. The relation between PPAR-α and cholesterol/neurosteroids may have a significant impact on the course and progression of neurodegeneration/neuroprotection processes. Unfortunately, despite many years of intensive studies, the pathogenesis of AD is unknown and therapy for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases is symptomatic, presenting a significant goal and challenge today. This review presents recent achievements in therapeutic approaches for AD, which are targeting PPAR-α and its relation to cholesterol and neurosteroids in AD and neuropsychiatric disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, few interventions exist to delay or prevent the onset of dementia. Air quality data are becoming increasingly available, and the science underlying the associated health effects is also evolving rapidly. Recent interest in this area has led to the publication of population-based cohort studies, but these studies have used different approaches to identify cases of dementia. The purpose of this article is to review recent evidence describing the association between exposure to air pollution and dementia with special emphasis on fine particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less. We also summarize here the proposed detailed mechanisms by which air pollutants reach the brain and activate the innate immune response. In addition, the article also provides a short overview of existing limitations in the treatment of dementia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 have achieved significant clinical success, recent studies highlight the critical role of N-glycosylation in regulating their expression, stability, and function. Alterations in N-glycosylation might affect the efficacy of ICIs by modulating the interactions between immune checkpoints and antibodies used in therapy. This review focuses on the glycosylation of PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, examining how N-glycans influence immune responses and contribute to immune evasion by tumors. It explores innovative strategies to modulate glycosylation in tumor and immune cells, including the use of N-glycosylation inhibitors and novel genetic manipulation techniques. Understanding the interplay between N-glycosylation and immune checkpoint functions is essential for optimizing immunotherapy outcomes and overcoming therapeutic resistance in cancer patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of amantadine in preventing the progression of COVID-19 and its neurological sequelae.\nMethods\nUnvaccinated patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 5 days were enrolled. Subjects were randomized (50:50) to amantadine (AMD; 100 mg twice daily) or placebo (PLB) for 14 days. The Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement of the World Health Organization (OSCI-WHO) was the primary measure. Secondary endpoints included assessment for fatigue; depression, disorders of smell and taste, and sleepiness on Days 1 and 15.\nResults\nWe enrolled 99 patients (49 AMD and 50 PLB). Disease progression (OSCI-WHO = 4) was observed in 6% (AMD) and 8% (PLB) patients (p > 0.05) with further deterioration (OSCI-WHO〉4) in 0% (AMD) and 8% (PLB) patients (p > 0.05). Complete recovery on Day 15 was 60% higher in the AMD compared with the PLB group (p = 0.025). There was improvement in taste (AMD: p = 0.003; PLB: p = 0.0001) and smell (AMD: p = 0.005; PLB: p = 0.0004) but not in fatigue in both groups. Improvement was observed in the AMD (p = 0.010) but not in the PLB group (p = 0.058) when assessing depression as well as sleepiness (AMD: p = 0.0002; PLB: p = 0.341). There was one death in the PLB group (2.0%) and none in the AMD group (p > 0.05) until Day 210. Overall, the drug was well tolerated.\nConclusion\nThe central effects of amantadine on the nervous system with reduction of sleepiness and depression might have had a supportive effect on faster recovery in early COVID-19 patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a0473997d9","5e7092c8878c28a04739c8b0","5e7092ca878c28a04739cad5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

CAR effector cells induce self-amplifying cytotoxic effects against target cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based therapies have transformed cancer treatment. Recently, combining these approaches into a strategy of PD-L1-targeted CAR has been proposed to target PD-L1high tumors. Our study provides new information on the efficacy of such an approach against PD-L1low targets.\nMethods New atezolizumab-based PD-L1-targeted CAR was generated and introduced into T, NK, or NK-92 cells. Breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines or non-malignant cells (HEK293T, HMEC, MCF-10A, or BM-MSC) were used as targets to assess the reactivity or cytotoxic activity of the PD-L1–CAR-bearing immune effector cells. Stimulation with IFNγ or with supernatants from activated CAR T cells were used to induce upregulation of PD-L1 molecule expression on the target cells. HER2–CAR T cells were used for combination with PD-L1–CAR T cells against MCF-7 cells.\nResults PD-L1–CAR effector cells responded vigorously with degranulation and cytokine production to PD-L1high MDA-MB-231 cells, but not to PD-L1low MCF-7 cells. However, in long-term killing assays, both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were eliminated by the PD-L1–CAR cells, although with a delay in the case of PD-L1low MCF-7 cells. Notably, the coculture of MCF-7 cells with activated PD-L1–CAR cells led to bystander induction of PD-L1 expression on MCF-7 cells and to the unique self-amplifying effect of the PD-L1–CAR cells. Accordingly, PD-L1–CAR T cells were active not only against MDA-MD-231 and MCF-7-PD-L1 but also against MCF-7-pLVX cells in tumor xenograft models. Importantly, we have also observed potent cytotoxic effects of PD-L1–CAR cells against non-malignant MCF-10A, HMEC, and BM-MSC cells, but not against HEK293T cells that initially did not express PD-L1 and were unresponsive to the stimulation . Finally, we have observed that HER-2–CAR T cells stimulate PD-L1 expression on MCF-7 cells and therefore accelerate the functionality of PD-L1–CAR T cells when used in combination.\nConclusions In summary, our studies show that CAR-effector cells trigger the expression of PD-L1 on target cells, which in case of PD-L1–CAR results in the unique self-amplification phenomenon. This self-amplifying effect could be responsible for the enhanced cytotoxicity of PD-L1–CAR T cells against both malignant and non-malignant cells and implies extensive caution in introducing PD-L1–CAR strategy into clinical studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We previously demonstrated that STIM silencing increases Ca2+ influx through NMDAR and STIM–NMDAR2 complexes are present in neurons. However, the interplay between NMDAR subunits (GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B) and STIM1/STIM2 with regard to intracellular trafficking remains unknown. Here, we found that the activation of NMDAR endocytosis led to an increase in STIM2–GluN2A and STIM2–GluN2B interactions in primary cortical neurons. STIM1 appeared to migrate from synaptic to extrasynaptic sites. STIM2 silencing inhibited post-activation NMDAR translocation from the plasma membrane and synaptic spines and increased NMDAR currents.

The first key factor is innate anti-PD-1 resistance signature (IPRES), an expression of a group of genes associated with tumor plasticity and immune evasion. IPRES promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), increasing melanoma cells’ invasiveness and survival. Overexpressed AXL, TWIST2, and WNT5a induce phenotypic changes. The upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines frequently coincides with EMT-related changes, further promoting a resistant and aggressive tumor phenotype. Inflamed tumor microenvironment may also drive the expression of resistance. The complexity of immune resistance development suggests that combination therapies are necessary to overcome it. Furthermore, targeting epigenetic regulation and exploring novel approaches such as miR-146a modulation may provide new strategies to counter resistance in melanoma."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

wound healing particularly in diabetics creates a significant healthcare burden. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of keratin-butyrate fibers (FKDP +0.1%NaBu) in a full-thickness skin wound model in 30 diabetic rats. Physicochemical examination showed that the obtained dressing possesses a heterogeneous structure and butyrate was slowly released into the wound. Moreover, the obtained dressing is nontoxic and supports cell growth. In vivo results showed that keratin-butyrate dressing accelerated wound healing on days 4 and 7 post-injury (p < .05). Histopathological and immunofluorescence examination revealed that applied dressing stimulated macrophage infiltration, which favors tissue remodeling and regeneration. The dressing was naturally incorporated into regenerating tissue. The highest mRNA expression level of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) was observed during the first 2 weeks in the control wounds compared to FKDP +0.1%NaBu treated wounds, in which IL-1β was significantly decreased. In FKDP +0.1%NaBu dressed wounds, mRNA expression of IL-10 and VEGF increased significantly (p < .05) from day 14. Keratin-butyrate treated wounds enhanced mRNA expression of keratin 16 and 17 and zonula occludens protein-1 and junctional adhesion molecules (p < .05) on days 14, 21, and 28 post-injuries. Our study showed that keratin butyrate dressing is safe and can efficiently accelerate skin wound healing in diabetic rats."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

neurodevelopmental disorder of complex genetic architecture and is characterized by multiple motor tics and at least one vocal tic persisting for more than 1 year.\nMethods\nWe performed a genome-wide meta-analysis integrating a novel TS cohort with previously published data, resulting in a sample size of 6133 individuals with TS and 13,565 ancestry-matched control participants.\nResults\nWe identified a genome-wide significant locus on chromosome 5q15. Integration of expression quantitative trait locus, Hi-C (high-throughput chromosome conformation capture), and genome-wide association study data implicated the NR2F1 gene and associated long noncoding RNAs within the 5q15 locus.

Role of Glia in Wilson’s Disease: Clinical, Neuroimaging, Neuropathological and Molecular Perspectives","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Wilson’s disease (WD) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by pathogenic variants of the ATP7B gene, which are responsible for impaired copper transport in the cell, inhibition of copper binding to apoceruloplasmin, and biliary excretion. This leads to the accumulation of copper in the tissues. Copper accumulation in the CNS leads to the neurological and psychiatric symptoms of WD. Abnormalities of copper metabolism in WD are associated with impaired iron metabolism. Both of these elements are redox active and may contribute to neuropathology. It has long been assumed that among parenchymal cells, astrocytes have the greatest impact on copper and iron homeostasis in the brain. Capillary endothelial cells are separated from the neuropil by astrocyte terminal legs, putting astrocytes in an ideal position to regulate the transport of iron and copper to other brain cells and protect them if metals breach the blood–brain barrier. Astrocytes are responsible for, among other things, maintaining extracellular ion homeostasis, modulating synaptic transmission and plasticity, obtaining metabolites, and protecting the brain against oxidative stress and toxins. However, excess copper and/or iron causes an increase in the number of astrocytes and their morphological changes observed in neuropathological studies, as well as a loss of the copper/iron storage function leading to macromolecule peroxidation and neuronal loss through apoptosis, autophagy, or cuproptosis/ferroptosis. The molecular mechanisms explaining the possible role of glia in copper- and iron-induced neurodegeneration in WD are largely understood from studies of neuropathology in Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. Understanding the mechanisms of glial involvement in neuroprotection/neurotoxicity is important for explaining the pathomechanisms of neuronal death in WD and, in the future, perhaps for developing more effective diagnostic/treatment methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Both subacute inflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms appear to play significant roles in the pathogenesis. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) inclusions are a common co-pathology in several neurodegenerative disorders with diverse pathogenesis. In the present study, we examined brains of 16 autopsied SSPE patients for the presence of TDP-43 pathology and possible associations with tau pathology. Immunohistochemical staining identified TDP-43 inclusions in 31% of SSPE cases. TDP-43 pathology was widely distributed in the brains, most severely in the atrophied cerebral cortex (temporal and parietal), and most frequently as tangle- and thread-like neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. It was associated with longer disease duration (>4 years) and tau pathology (all TDP-43-positive cases had tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles). This study demonstrates for the first time an association between TDP-43 pathology and SSPE. The co-occurrence of TDP-43 and tau aggregates and correlation with the disease duration suggest that both pathological proteins are involved in the neurodegenerative process induced by viral inflammation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Natural-derived dressings have gained much attention due to their promising properties. We hypothesized that keratin-biphalin fiber-dressing accelerates skin wound healing in a mouse model of diabetes. Keratin fibers were obtained from mouse fur and soaked in a biphalin solution. Studies on NIH/3T3 cells showed that keratin-biphalin fibers increase cell viability. In vivo studies were made on C57BL/6J mice with iatrogenically induced diabetes. Two full-thickness wounds were created on the back of the mice, one untreated and the other treated with an experimental dressing. Western blot analysis, histopathological and immunohistochemical staining were performed. Biphalin was slowly released from keratin fibers. The obtained keratin-biphalin fibers were biocompatible and supported cell growth. Western blot analysis showed that cells treated with our dressing had an increasing expression level of mTOR, and p-AKT 72 h post-treatment compared to 24 h and 48 h. Animal studies showed that the keratin-biphalin dressing accelerated wound healing on days 5 and 15. Treated wounds showed faster reepithelization and developed thicker epidermis. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies confirmed that keratin-biphalin fibers stimulate macrophage infiltration, which promotes tissue remodeling and regeneration.

and antimicrobial evaluation of a series of ciprofloxacin (CP) conjugates coupled with nitrogen-containing heterocycles. In vitro screening of these new hybrid compounds (1–13) against a panel of planktonic bacterial strains highlighted thiazolyl homologs 6 and 7 as the most promising candidates for further investigation. These derivatives demonstrated potent growth-inhibitory activity against various standard and clinical isolates, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 µg/ml, which are higher or comparable to the reference fluoroquinolone. Both compounds effectively inhibited biofilm formation by selected staphylococci across all tested concentrations (1–8 x MIC), displaying greater efficacy at higher doses compared to CP alone. Notably, conjugate 7 also significantly eradicated existing biofilms formed by S. aureus of various origin. Molecular docking studies revealed that conjugate 7 engages in a broader range of interactions with DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase IV than CP, suggesting stronger binding affinity and enhanced flexibility. This may contribute to its potential in overcoming bacterial resistance mechanisms. The above findings indicate compound 7 as a promising candidate for clinical development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The synthesis is free of toxic substances and does not require special temperature or lighting conditions. Moreover, it is fast, easy, and inexpensive. Depending on the concentration of silver ions and nanoparticle seeds, four different colloids were obtained, representing the evolution of nanoparticle growth along different paths from the first common stage. One of the synthesized colloids consists mainly of triangular nanoplates, while the other consists of polyhedral NPs. The analysis of the synthesis process together with the observation of TEM images and UV–vis extinction spectra enabled the proposal of the mechanism of interaction of mellitic acid molecules as the capping agent. The ability of mellitic acid molecules to form a hydrogen bond network, together with a ratio of silver ions to the mellitic acid concentration, turned out to be crucial for determining the shape of the NPs. All obtained colloids strongly enhance the Raman spectra of analyte molecules, thus proving their applicability as efficient new SERS substrates. For the one that enhanced the spectra the most, the detection limit was set at 10–9 M. Using it as a SERS substrate enables the identification of a trace amount of a designer drug, i.e., 4-chloromethcathinone (4-CMC, clephedrone). For the first time, SERS spectra of this substance, illegal in many countries, are presented."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66b363b0fdbe8324211c7c3e","66b363b0fdbe8324211c7c3d","5e7093d5878c28a0473b18f7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

resilience is the ability of neuronal networks to maintain their function despite the stress exposure. Using a mouse model we investigate stress resilience phenomenon. To assess the resilient and anhedonic behavioral phenotypes developed after the induction of chronic unpredictable stress, we quantitatively characterized the structural and functional plasticity of excitatory synapses in the hippocampus using a combination of proteomic, electrophysiological, and imaging methods. Our results indicate that stress resilience is an active and multifactorial process manifested by structural, functional, and molecular changes in synapses. We reveal that chronic stress influences palmitoylation of synaptic proteins, whose profiles differ between resilient and anhedonic animals. The changes in palmitoylation are predominantly related with the glutamate receptor signaling thus affects synaptic transmission and associated structures of dendritic spines.

One of the solutions is seen in the use of dedifferentiated fat cells (DFATs) that are characterized by a greater homogeneity. Moreover, these cells seem to possess a higher expression of transcriptional factors necessary to maintain pluripotency (stemness-related transcriptional factors) as well as a greater ability to differentiate in vitro into 3 embryonic germ layers, and a high proliferative potential in comparison to adipose stem/stromal cells. However, the neurogenic and neuroprotective potential of DFATs is still insufficiently understood; hence, our research goal was to contribute to our current knowledge of the subject. To recreate the brain’s physiological (biomimetic) conditions, the cells were cultured at 5% oxygen concentration. The neural differentiation capacity of DFATs was assessed in the presence of the N21 supplement containing the factors that are typically found in the natural environment of the neural cell niche or in the presence of cerebrospinal fluid and under various spatial conditions (microprinting). The neuroprotective properties of DFATs were assessed using the coculture method with the ischemically damaged nerve tissue."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

potential use in this type of pain. Hybrids consist of two types of pharmacophores that are connected by different types of linkers. The first pharmacophore is an opioid agonist, and the second pharmacophore is an antagonist of the pronociceptive system, i.e., an antagonist of the melanocortin-4 receptor. The results of tests in acute and neuropathic pain models of the obtained compounds have shown that the type of linker used to connect pharmacophores had an effect on antinociceptive activity. Peptidomimetics containing longer flexible linkers were very effective at low doses in the neuropathic pain model. To elucidate the effect of linker lengths, two hybrids showing very high activity and two hybrids with lower activity were further tested for affinity for opioid (mu, delta) and melanocortin-4 receptors. Their complexes with the target receptors were also studied by molecular modelling. Our results do not show a simple relationship between linker length and affinity for particular receptor types but suggest that activity in neuropathic pain is related to a proper balance of receptor affinity rather than maximum binding to any or all of the target receptors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473968fb","61dd6f322467f047f3af8de9","61dd6f322467f047f3af8de5","61dd6f322467f047f3af8de8","61dd6f322467f047f3af8deb","5e70941c878c28a0473b6626"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

physician’s lifestyle information is essential in chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) patients. We assessed potential characteristics associated with a patient’s recollection of physician information and lifestyle changes. This study recruited and interviewed patients (aged ≤ 80 years) 6–18 months after hospitalization due to acute coronary syndrome or elective myocardial revascularization. A physician’s information on risk factors was recognized if patients recollected the assessment of their diet, weight management, blood pressure control, cholesterol level, diabetes, and other lifestyle factors by the doctor. Of a total of 946 chronic coronary syndrome patients, 52.9% (501) of them declared the recollection of providing information on more than 80% of the risk factors. A good recollection of risk factor information was associated with the following: a patient’s age (OR per year: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95 to 0.99), obesity (OR: 4.41; 95% CI: 3.09–6.30), diabetes (OR: 4.16; 95% CI: 2.96–5.84), diuretic therapy (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.03–1.91), calcium channel blockers (OR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.04–2.09), and ACEI/sartan (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.45–0.94) at hospitalization discharge. In terms of goal attainment, better adherence to antihypertensive drugs (OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.07–3.03) was observed in the patients with a good compared to a poor recollection of risk factor information. The recollection of physician risk factor information was significantly associated with more comorbidities.

The double-layer nanostructure consists of precisely tailored thin films, i.e., titanium (TiO2) and hafnium oxides (HfO2) deposited on single-mode fiber end-face by magnetron sputtering. It has been shown numerically and experimentally that the approach besides well spectrally defined interference pattern distinguishes refractive index (RI) changes taking place in a volume and on the sensor surface. These are of interest when label-free biosensing applications are considered. The case of myeloperoxidase (MPO) detection—a protein, which concentration rises during inflammation—is reported as an example of application. The response of the sensor to MPO in a concentration range of 1 × 10−11–5 × 10−6 g/mL was tested. An increase in the MPO concentration was followed by a redshift of the interference pattern and a decrease in reflected power.

Studies in animal models of PD have shown that vigorous exercise has neuroprotective effects, and emerging evidence suggests that it may be a disease-modifying treatment in humans. However, many people with PD may not be able to participate in vigorous exercise because of multiple medical conditions that severely limit their physical activity. In this study, we have shown that chronic MPTP treatment in sedentary mice resulted in loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNpc, decreased levels of neurotrophins, BDNF and GDNF, and increased levels of inflammatory markers and pro-inflammatory changes in immunocompetent cells. Moderate exercise, initiated both before and after chronic MPTP treatment, significantly attenuated the loss of dopaminergic neurons and increased BDNF and GDNF levels even above those in sedentary control mice. No signs of inflammation were observed in MPTP-treated mice, either when training began before or after MPTP treatment. Training induced beneficial changes in the dopaminergic system, increased levels of neurotrophins and suppression of inflammation were similar for both steady moderate (present data) and intense training (our previously published data). This suggests that there is a kind of saturation when the percentage of rescued dopaminergic neurons reaches the highest possible value, and therefore further increases in exercise intensity do not enhance neuroprotection. In conclusion, our present results compared with the previous data show that increasing exercise intensity beyond the level used in this study does not increase the neuroprotective effect of aerobic training in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

For this purpose, three novel aprepitant homologues were synthesized to broaden the previously obtained derivative portfolio, functionalized with the DOTA chelator and labeled with 68Ga and 177Lu. The newly evaluated radioconjugates showed the intended significant increase in lipophilicity compared to the previous ones, while maintaining stability in the human serum. Then, in a receptor binding study to the human NK1 receptor, we compared the two series of 177Lu-radioconjugates of aprepitant with each other and with the reference Substance P derivative currently used in glioblastoma therapy, clearly indicating the high affinity and better binding capacity of the novel radioconjugates. The in vitro experimental results included in the presented study, supported by labeling optimization, radioconjugate characterization and docking modeling of new aprepitant-derived radioagents, confirm our assumptions about the usefulness of aprepitant as a NK1R targeting vector and point out the perspectives for the forthcoming first in vivo trials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid that regulates cell death/survival and the inflammatory response via its specific receptors (S1PRs). Since the role of S1P and S1PRs in obesity is rather obscure, we examined the effect of fingolimod (an S1PR modulator) on the expression profile of genes encoding S1PRs, sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), proteins engaged in amyloid-beta (Aβ) generation (ADAM10, BACE1, PSEN2), GSK3β, proapoptotic Bax, and proinflammatory cytokines in the cortex and hippocampus of obese/prediabetic mouse brains. In addition, we observed behavioral changes. Our results revealed significantly elevated mRNA levels of Bace1, Psen2, Gsk3b, Sphk1, Bax, and proinflammatory cytokines, which were accompanied by downregulation of S1pr1 and sirtuin 1 in obese mice. Moreover, locomotor activity, spatially guided exploratory behavior, and object recognition were impaired. Simultaneously, fingolimod reversed alterations in the expressions of the cytokines, Bace1, Psen2, and Gsk3b that occurred in the brain, elevated S1pr3 mRNA levels, restored normal cognition-related behavior patterns, and exerted anxiolytic effects. The improvement in episodic and recognition memory observed in this animal model of obesity may suggest a beneficial effect of fingolimod on central nervous system function."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The aim of this work was to determine the contribution of the -10 and -35 regions of the promoter, as well as the role of non-specific interactions, in the binding of RNA polymerase and the formation of an active initiation complex capable of transcription. Therefore, fragments of promoter DNA, derived from the strong promoter A1 of the phage T7, containing completely and partially altered elements -35 and -10, and devoid of an upstream region, were constructed using genetic engineering methods. Functional analyses of modified promoter fragments were carried out, checking their ability to form binary complexes with Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) and the efficiency of converting binary complexes into triple complexes characteristic of the productive phase of transcription. The obtained results suggest that, in relation to the A1 promoter of the T7 phage, the most important role of the -35 region is carrying the open complex through the next phases of transcription initiation. The weakening of specific impacts within the region -35 is a reason for the defect associated with the transformation of the open complex, formed by a DNA fragment containing the completely altered -35 region, into elongation and the impairment of RNA synthesis. This leads to breaking contacts with the RNA polymerase holoenzyme, and destabilization and disintegration of the complex in the initial phase of productive transcription. This confirms the hypothesis of the so-called stressed intermediate state associated with the stage of transition from the open complex to the elongation complex. The experiments carried out in this work confirm also that the process of promoter localization and recognition, as well as the formation of binary complexes, is sequential in nature, and that the region located upstream of the -35 hexamer, and the hexamer itself, plays here an additive role."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Lung pericytes can respond to infection and act as immune and proangiogenic cells; moreover, these cells can differentiate into myofibroblasts in non-resolving ARDS and contribute to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we aimed to characterize the role of lung cells which present characteristic of pericytes, such as peri-endothelial location and expression of panel of specific markers. To study their role in ARDS we used a murine model of lipopolysaccharide induced (LPS) resolving ARDS. We confirmed the development of ARDS after LPS instillation which was resolved 14 days after onset. Using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry we observed early expansion of NG2+PDGFRβ+ pericytes in murine lungs with loss of CD31+ PDGFRβ+ endothelial cells. These changes were accompanied by specific changes in lung structure and loss of vascular integrity. On day 14 after ARDS onset the composition of pericytes and endothelial cells returned to baseline values. LPS-induced ARDS activated NOTCH signaling in lung pericytes, the inhibition of which during LPS stimulation reduced the expression of its downstream target genes, pericyte markers and angiogenic factors. Together, lung pericytes in response to inflammatory injury activate NOTCH signaling that supports their maintenance and in turn can contribute to recovery of the microvascular endothelium."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["663b1d524097070c4cde630f","5e7094cb878c28a0473c3d74","5e709359878c28a0473a7ce5","5e709356878c28a0473a79db","602f895f9543c7410626f5b8"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["663b1d524097070c4cde6311","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1c07","5e7093c5878c28a0473b0810"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Its etiology is complex and elusive, although an important role of genetic factors has been established. The aim of the present study was to identify the genomic basis of Tourette syndrome in a group of families with affected members in 2 or 3 generations.\nMethods: Whole-genome sequencing was performed followed by co-segregation and bioinformatic analyses. Identified variants were used to select candidate genes, which were then subjected to gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis.\nResults: The study group included 17 families comprising 80 patients with Tourette syndrome and 44 healthy family members. Co-segregation analysis and subsequent prioritization of variants pinpointed 37 rare and possibly pathogenic variants shared among affected individuals within a single family. Three such variants, in the ALDH2, DLD and ALDH1B1 genes, could influence oxidoreductase activity in the brain. Two variants, in SLC17A8 and BSN genes, were involved in sensory processing of sound by inner hair cells of the cochlea. Enrichment analysis of genes whose rare variants were present in all patients from at least 2 families identified significant gene sets implicated in cell–cell adhesion, cell junction assembly and organization, processing of sound, synapse assembly, and synaptic signalling processes.\nLimitations: We did not examine intergenic variants, but they still could influence clinical phenotype.\nConclusion: Our results provide a further argument for a role of adhesion molecules and synaptic transmission in neuropsychiatric diseases. Moreover, an involvement of processes related to oxidative stress response and sound-sensing in the pathology of Tourette syndrome seems likely."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Therapies affecting the microglia phenotype may be beneficial in treating inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases. In our experiments, we used the animal multiple sclerosis model, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Rats were treated during the pre- or symptomatic phase of the disease with cyclophosphamide, followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and with/without post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. Our study aimed to analyze the microglia phenotype in animals subjected to this treatment. The number of M1 cells in the spinal cord, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels in the brain were similar in all experimental groups. The differences were observed in M2 cells number and arginase 1 (Arg1) levels, which were decreased in EAE animals, and increased after treatment in the symptomatic phase of EAE, and in the pre-symptomatic phase, but only with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide. Analysis of gene expression in the brain showed decreased iNOS expression in EAE animals treated in the symptomatic phase of EAE and no differences in Arg1 expression. Results indicate that treatment applied to experimental animals influences the microglia phenotype, promoting differentiation towards M2 cells."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants and haplogroups have been linked to the successful practice of various sports, but despite numerous studies, understanding of the correlation is far from being comprehensive. In this study, the mtDNA sequence and copy number were determined for 99 outstanding Polish male athletes performing in power (n = 52) or endurance sports (n = 47) and 100 controls. The distribution of haplogroups, single nucleotide variant association, heteroplasmy, and mtDNA copy number were analyzed in the blood and saliva. We found no correlation between any haplogroup, single nucleotide variant, especially rare or non-synonymous ones, and athletic performance. Interestingly, heteroplasmy was less frequent in the study group, especially in endurance athletes. We observed a lower mtDNA copy number in both power and endurance athletes compared to controls. This could result from an inactivity of compensatory mechanisms activated by disadvantageous variants present in the general population and indicates a favorable genetic makeup of the athletes. The results emphasize a need for a more comprehensive analysis of the involvement of the mitochondrial genome in physical performance, combining nucleotide and copy number analysis in the context of nuclear gene variants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Participants filled out paper-and-pencil or online versions of psychometric questionnaires to assess coping strategies, depression, and body image anxiety.\nResults\nIn general, we observed higher depression intensity and a higher level of body image anxiety among females with thyroid diseases than among the healthy control group. Latent profile analysis revealed adaptive vs. maladaptive coping profiles from both study samples. Depression symptoms were significantly higher if coping was maladaptive in both the clinical and control groups. Still, there were no significant differences in body image anxiety between participants with adaptive and maladaptive coping profiles. Covid-19-related distress did not moderate the link between coping profiles, depression, and body image anxiety in either group.\nConclusion\nGreater focus should be placed on the role of body image in females struggling with thyroid diseases.

risk score-based phenome-wide association study identifies novel associations for Tourette syndrome","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by vocal and motor tics lasting more than a year. It is highly polygenic in nature with both rare and common previously associated variants. Epidemiological studies have shown TS to be correlated with other phenotypes, but large-scale phenome wide analyses in biobank level data have not been performed to date. In this study, we used the summary statistics from the latest meta-analysis of TS to calculate the polygenic risk score (PRS) of individuals in the UK Biobank data and applied a Phenome Wide Association Study (PheWAS) approach to determine the association of disease risk with a wide range of phenotypes. A total of 57 traits were found to be significantly associated with TS polygenic risk, including multiple psychosocial factors and mental health conditions such as anxiety disorder and depression. Additional associations were observed with complex non-psychiatric disorders such as Type 2 diabetes, heart palpitations, and respiratory conditions. Cross-disorder comparisons of phenotypic associations with genetic risk for other childhood-onset disorders (e.g.: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD], and obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]) indicated an overlap in associations between TS and these disorders. ADHD and ASD had a similar direction of effect with TS while OCD had an opposite direction of effect for all traits except mental health factors. Sex-specific PheWAS analysis identified differences in the associations with TS genetic risk between males and females. Type 2 diabetes and heart palpitations were significantly associated with TS risk in males but not in females, whereas diseases of the respiratory system were associated with TS risk in females but not in males. This analysis provides further evidence of shared genetic and phenotypic architecture of different complex disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

use of amantadine in the prevention of progression and treatment of COVID-19 symptoms in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (COV-PREVENT): Study rationale and design","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"ackground\nCOVID-19, a disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic in most cases. Some patients, usually burdened with risk factors develop acute respiratory failure and other organ dysfunction. In such cases, the mortality rate is very high despite the use of intensive therapy. Amantadine has complex activity including antiviral, antiinflammatory and dopaminergic effects. This clinical trial will assess the efficacy and safety of amantadine in the prevention of COVID-19 progression toward acute respiratory failure and neurological complications.\nMethods and results\nThe trial will enroll 200 patients who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and have one or more risk factors for worsening the disease. These patients will be included as hospitalized or ambulatory subjects for early treatment of illness. The recruitment will take place in 8 centers covering different regions of Poland. For 14 days they will be given either 200 mg of amantadine a day or placebo. Our hypothesis is a considerable reduction in the number of patients with progression toward respiratory insufficiency or neurological complications thanks to the treatment of amantadine.\nConclusions\nDemonstrating the efficacy and safety of amantadine treatment in improving the clinical condition of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is of great importance in combating the effects of the pandemic. It has potential to influence on the severity and course of neurological complications, which are very common and persist long after the infection as long-COVID syndrome."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The diagnosis of ASD in children is based on the recognition of typical\nbehavioral symptoms, while no reliable biomarkers are available. Rats in whom ASD-like symptoms are due to maternal\nadministration of the teratogenic drugs valproate or thalidomide on critical day 11 of pregnancy are widely used models in\nautism research. The present studies, aimed at detecting changes in the levels of hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolites,\nwere carried out on 1-month-old rats belonging to the abovementioned two ASD models and on a control group. Analysis of\nboth hydrophilic and hydrophobic metabolite levels gives a broader view of possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis\nof autism. Hippocampal proton magnetic resonance (MRS) spectroscopy and ex vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nanalysis of serum and urine samples were used. The results were analyzed using advanced statistical tests. Both the results\nof our present MRS studies of the hippocampus and of the NMR studies of body fuids in both ASD models, particularly\nfrom the THAL model, appeared to be consistent with previously published NMR results of hippocampal homogenates and\ndata from the literature on autistic children. We detected symptoms of disturbances in neurotransmitter metabolism, energy\ndefcit, and oxidative stress, as well as intestinal malfunction, which shed light on the pathogenesis of ASD and could be\nused for diagnostic purposes. These results confrm the usefulness of the noninvasive techniques used in ASD studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The aim of this report is to analyze metabolic disorders in the degeneration process by comparing control discs with degenerated discs. In our research on the nucleus pulposus (NP), we used NMR spectroscopy of extracts of hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds of the tissue. Methods: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy allows the study of biochemistry and cellular metabolism in vitro. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds were extracted from the NP of the intervertebral disc. In the NMR spectra, metabolites were identified and quantitatively analyzed. The results of our research indicate disturbances in the biosynthesis and metabolism of cholesterol, the biosynthesis and degradation of various fatty acid groups, ketone bodies, or lysine, and the metabolism of glycerophospholipids, purines, glycine, inositol, galactose, alanine, glutamate, and pyruvate in the biosynthesis of valine and isoleucine, leucine. All these disorders indicate pathomechanisms related to oxidative stress, energy, neurotransmission disturbances, and disturbances in the structure and functioning of cell membranes, inflammation, or chronic pain generators. Conclusions: NMR spectroscopy allows the identification of metabolites differentiating surgical from nonsurgical discs. These data may provide guidance in in vivo MRS studies in assessing the severity of lesions of the disc."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The study aimed to analyze the effects of stimulation of the serotonergic system with 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A agonists in a model of PD induced by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). To model PD, bilateral injection of 6-OHDA into both striata was performed in male Wistar rats. Respiratory disturbances in response to 7% hypercapnia (CO2 in O2) in the plethysmographic chamber before and after stimulation of the serotonergic system and the incidence of apnea were studied in awake rats 5 weeks after 6-OHDA or vehicle injection. Administration of 6-OHDA reduced the concentration of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NA) in the striatum and the level of 5-HT in the brainstem of treated rats, which have been associated with decreased basal ventilation, impaired respiratory response to 7% CO2 and increased incidence of apnea compared to Sham-operated rats. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the 5-HT1AR agonist 8-OH-DPAT and 5-HT2AR agonist NBOH-2C-CN increased breathing during normocapnia and hypercapnia in both groups of rats. However, it restored reactivity to hypercapnia in 6-OHDA group to the level present in Sham rats. Another 5-HT2AR agonist TCB-2 was only effective in increasing normocapnic ventilation in 6-OHDA rats. Both the serotonergic agonists 8-OH-DPAT and NBOH-2C-CN had stronger stimulatory effects on respiration in PD rats, compensating for deficits in basal ventilation and hypercapnic respiration. We conclude that serotonergic stimulation may have a positive effect on respiratory impairments that occur in PD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Here, we describe construction of the cell line knockouts missing Hsp90α or Hsp90β protein. Using these cells, we found that HSV-1 and, another enterovirus, Coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5) replicate in both Hsp90α and Hsp90β knockout cells with equal efficiency.

Alterations in this neurotransmission are associated with mood disorders. Therefore, using immunohistochemistry and quantitative methods this study was designed to evaluate potential alterations in the expression of serotoninergic markers in the amygdala and raphe nuclei of mice with oestrogen receptor β (ERβ) knock out which exhibit increased anxiety as evidenced by reduced locomotion and increased thigmotaxis. These alterations could either contribute to heightened anxiety or serve as a compensatory strategy for reducing it. The results show that in ERβ knock-out mice, 5-HT1B expression is significantly increased in the amygdala, while 5-HTT expression is significantly decreased in both the amygdala and raphe nuclei. Furthermore, ERβ deficiency does not affect TPH2. In conclusion, serotonin signalling is altered in the amygdala and raphe nuclei of ERβ knock-out females. It seems that an increase in 5-HTT levels has been associated with reduced anxiety, whereas a decrease in 5-HT1B receptors may encourage fear. However, further studies are required to determine the exact role of ERβ in anxiety-related behaviour."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fc24","602e4d479543c7410626f083"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The expression of genes encoding the glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GR), cortisol metabolizing enzymes (HSD11B1, HSD11B2, H6PDH), and adipokines, as well as selected microRNAs, was measured by real-time PCR in adipose tissue from 75 patients with obesity, 19 patients following metabolic surgery, and 25 normal-weight subjects. Cortisol levels were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in 30 pairs of tissues. The mRNA levels of all genes studied were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of patients with obesity and normalized by weight loss. In the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), GR and HSD11B2 were affected by this phenomenon. Negative correlations were observed between the mRNA levels of the investigated genes and selected miRNAs (hsa-miR-142-3p, hsa-miR-561, and hsa-miR-579). However, the observed changes did not translate into differences in tissue cortisol concentrations, although levels of this hormone in the SAT of patients with obesity correlated negatively with mRNA levels for adiponectin. In conclusion, although the expression of genes related to cortisol action and metabolism in adipose tissue is altered in obesity and miRNAs may be involved in this process, these changes do not affect tissue cortisol concentrations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a4878c28a0473ae4c6","5e709444878c28a0473b9419","5e70932e878c28a0473a473d","5e7093dd878c28a0473b2238","5e7092d8878c28a04739df45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) is enhanced by high iron levels, a step that precedes the induction of the iron-regulatory hormone hepcidin. While several reports suggested a cell-autonomous induction of Bmp6 by iron-triggered signals, likely via sensing of oxidative stress by the transcription factor NRF2, other studies proposed the dominant role of a paracrine yet unidentified signal released by iron-loaded hepatocytes. To further explore the mechanisms of Bmp6 transcriptional regulation, we used female mice aged 10–11 months, which are characterized by hepatocytic but not LSEC iron accumulation, and no evidence of systemic iron overload. We found that LSECs of aged mice exhibit increased Bmp6 mRNA levels as compared to young controls, but do not show a transcriptional signature characteristic of activated NFR2-mediated signaling in FACS-sorted LSECs. We further observed that primary murine LSECs derived from both wild-type and NRF2 knock-out mice induce Bmp6 expression in response to iron exposure. By analyzing transcriptomic data of FACS-sorted LSECs from aged versus young mice, as well as early after iron citrate injections, we identified ETS1 as a candidate transcription factor involved in Bmp6 transcriptional regulation. By performing siRNA-mediated knockdown, small-molecule treatments, and chromatin immunoprecipitation in primary LSECs, we show that Bmp6 transcription is regulated by iron via ETS1 and p38/JNK MAP kinase-mediated signaling, at least in part independently of NRF2.

Our goal here is to find the relationship between a number of cancerogenic mutations and the probability of cancer induction over the lifetime of cancer patients. We believe that the Avrami–Dobrzyński biophysical model can be used to describe this mechanism. Therefore, clinical data from breast and ovarian cancer patients were used to validate this model of cancer induction, which is based on a purely physical concept of the phase-transition process with an analogy to the neoplastic transformation. The obtained values of model parameters established using clinical data confirm the hypothesis that the carcinogenic process strongly follows fractal dynamics. We found that the model’s theoretical prediction and population clinical data slightly differed for patients with the age below 30 years old, and that might point to the existence of an ancillary protection mechanism against cancer development. Additionally, we reveal that the existing clinical data predict breast or ovarian cancers onset two years earlier for patients with BRCA1/2 mutations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7ed2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Previous studies showed that the concentrations of selected chemokines are locally elevated in samples collected from the lumen of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Our objective was to determine whether the observed differences in analyte concentrations were influenced by the origin of the blood samples (i.e. cerebral versus peripheral), thus providing insight into the localised nature of these alterations and their significance in IA pathogenesis. Material and methods. This prospective study included 24 patients with IA who underwent endovascular embolisation. Concentrations of selected analytes were analysed in blood samples from the IA lumen, feeding artery, and aorta. The analytes included MPO, Lipocalin-2/NGAL, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and serum amyloid A. Results. Higher median plasma concentrations of MPO, lipocalin-2/NGAL, sVCAM-1, and SAA were found in samples obtained from the IA lumen and the feeding artery compared to the aorta. The concentration of sICAM-1 was significantly higher in the IA compared to the aorta, but did not differ between the proximal artery and the aorta. No significant differences in any analyte concentration were observed between the IA and the proximal artery. Conclusions. These findings suggest that the IA and the proximal vessel share similarities in the local immunological environment, which is different from that observed in the aorta. Further studies are needed to fully understand and elucidate these observations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We hypothesized that the serum metabolic profile could be helpful in the differentiation of both diseases in an early stage.\nMethods\nWe included controls, patients with MS diagnosed according to the McDonald criteria of 2010, and patients with NMOSD diagnosed according to the criteria from 2015. Blood samples were collected on clots from all participants after overnight overfasting. We obtained metabolic profiles using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1Hsingle bondNMR) of serum hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds. Serum metal levels were measured using isotope-specific detection mass spectrometry (ICP–MS). For statistical analyzes, we used ANOVA tests and multivariate analysis (MVA) – orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA).\nResults\nWe analyzed metabolite levels in patient groups compared to controls. We observed significantly different levels of ten metabolite signals in patients with MS vs controls and eighteen metabolite signals in patients with NMSOD vs controls. We observed significantly different levels of five signals in patients with MS vs NMOSD. In the MVA analysis of patient groups, we indicated compounds that most differentiated the groups. All of these compounds are involved in cycles connected to the inflammation process and/or oxidative stress. The results of metallomics studies confirmed metal participation in these processes.\nDiscussion\nIt is possible to distinguish patients with MS and NMOSD from controls using ANOVA and MVA tests.

function within the erythrocyte. Extracellular Hb has prooxidative and proinflammatory properties and is therefore sequestered by haptoglobin and bound by the CD163 receptor on macrophages. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel process of Hb uptake by macrophages independ-ent of haptoglobin and CD163. Unexpectedly, macrophages do not degrade the entire Hb, but instead transfer it to neighboring cells. We have shown that the phenomenon of Hb transfer from macrophages to other cells is mainly mediated by extracellular vesicles. In contrast to the canonical Hb degradation pathway by macrophages, Hb transfer has not been reported before. In addition, we have used the process of Hb transfer in anticancer therapy, where mac-rophages are loaded with a Hb-anticancer drug conjugate and act as cellular drug carriers. Both mouse and human macrophages loaded with Hb-monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) effectively killed cancer cells when co-cultured in vitro."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e34559543c7410626ee75"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

By placing the electrode in the mid-pretarsal area of the upper eyelid, one can easily perform a fast examination and achieve repeatable results. We believe that this technique may increase the feasibility of eyelid sEMG in clinical practice. Methods: 126 sEMG examinations of the upper eyelid were performed by using the above-described method. Thirty-nine controls and 29 ptotic patients were enrolled. The controls underwent one measurement while the ptotic patients were employed for four sessions: Before anterior approach levator aponeurosis advancement (LAA), 2 weeks, 3 months, and more than 6 months after surgery. The relaxation and maximal contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscle (OOM) using root mean square (RMS) values were measured. Results: The results showed a statistically significant decrease in RMS values of the maximal contraction of the OOM 2 weeks after surgery (p < 0.05) and 3 months after surgery (p = 0.03). Six months postoperatively, there were no statistically significant differences in OOM activity compared to preoperative values (p = 0.2). Conclusions: Eyelid sEMG may be a useful diagnostic tool in post-operative OOM recovery monitoring. sEMG parameters of the maximal contraction of the OOM normalize within 6 months after anterior approach LAA. Electrode placement in the mid-pretarsal area of the upper eyelid offers several advantages and therefore may enhance the feasibility of sEMG in clinical practice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In an in silico experiment, lipophilicity was established for obtained compounds. All compounds were screened for antimicrobial activity using standard and clinical strains. As for Gram-positive hospital microorganisms, all tested derivatives were active. Measured MICs were in the range 1–16 µg/mL, confirming high antimicrobial potency. Derivative 12 demonstrated activity against all standard Gram-positive Staphylococci, within the range of 0.8–1.6 µg/mL and was confirmed as the leading structure with MICs 1 µg/mL for S. pasteuri KR 4358 and S. aureus T 5591 (clinical strains). All compounds were screened for their in vitro cytotoxic properties via the MTT method. Three of the examined compounds (3, 11 and 16) showed good activity against cancer cells, and in parallel were found not to be cytotoxic toward normal cells. Doxorubicin SI ranged 0.14–1.11 while the mentioned three ranged 1.9–3.4. Selected Ciprofloxacin derivatives were docked into the crystal structure of topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) in complex with DNA (PDB ID: 5BTC). In summary, leading structures were established (3, 11, 12 and 16). We have observed poor results in preformed studies for disubstituted derivatives, suggesting that 3-oxo-4-carboxylic acid core is the active DNA-gyrase binding site, and when structural changes were made in this fragment, there was an observed decrease in antibacterial potency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Conjugates 1 and 2 were 1.25–10-fold more potent than CP toward all Staphylococci (minimal inhibitory concentration 0.05–0.4 μg/mL). Most of the chloro- (3–7), bromo- (8–11), and CF3-alkanoyl (14–16) derivatives expressed higher or comparable activity to CP against selected Gram-positive strains. A few CP analogues (5, 10, and 11) were also more effective toward the chosen clinical Gram-negative rods. Conjugates 5, 10, and 11 considerably influenced the phases of the bacterial growth cycle over 18 h. Additionally, compounds 2, 4–7, 9–12, and 21 exerted stronger tuberculostatic action against three Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates than the first-line antitubercular drugs. Amides 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, and 11 targeted gyrase and topoisomerase IV at 2.7–10.0 μg/mL, which suggests a mechanism of antibacterial action related to CP. These findings were confirmed by molecular docking studies. In addition, compounds 3 and 15 showed high antiproliferative activities against prostate PC3 cells (IC50 2.02–4.8 μM), up to 6.5–2.75 stronger than cisplatin. They almost completely reduced the growth and proliferation rates in these cells, without a cytotoxic action against normal HaCaT cell lines. Furthermore, derivatives 3 and 21 induced apoptosis/necrosis in PC3 cells, probably by increasing the intracellular ROS amount, as well as they diminished the IL-6 level in tumor cells."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Here, a new axially chiral thiolated naphthalene diimide derivatives (HS-BIN-NDI) for the rapid, simple, and sensitive detection of ATN enantiomers is presented. The Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) experiments show that interactions between a chiral selector and a chiral analyte occur only when their configurations are opposite. The extensive computational simulations support this finding. The association coefficient determined by SPR is high (105-106 M−1 s−1) and indicates that the interactions are electrostatic. The analytical utility of atropisomeric HS-BIN-NDIs is proven, and the voltammetric sensors designed to determine ATN enantiomers are constructed. The developed sensors are characterized by a wide analytical operating range from 5.0·10−3 to 1.0 µm, nanomolar detection limit, high selectivity, and a long lifetime. Several additives like urea, creatinine, glucose, human albumin, and hemoglobin do not affect ATN sensing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65a7b3a84097071e0b892f87","5e709359878c28a0473a7cf1","5e7093ab878c28a0473aebec","5e709359878c28a0473a7c0d"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Elevated serum concentrations of DCA are observed in cardiovascular disease (CVD). We hypothesized that DCA might influence hemodynamic parameters in rats. Methods: The concentration of DCA in systemic blood was measured with liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated in anesthetized, male, 3–4-month-old Sprague–Dawley rats administered intravenously (IV) or intracerebroventricularly (ICV) with investigated compounds. Mesenteric artery (MA) reactivity was tested ex vivo. Results: The baseline plasma concentration of DCA was 0.24 ± 0.03 mg/L. The oral antibiotic treatment produced a large decrease in the concentration. Administered IV, the compound increased BP and HR in a dose-dependent manner. DCA also increased heart contractility and cardiac output. None of the tested compounds—prazosin (an alpha-blocker), propranolol (beta-adrenolytic), atropine (muscarinic receptor antagonist), glibenclamide (K-ATP inhibitor) or DY 268 (FXR antagonist), glycyrrhetinic acid (11HSD2 inhibitor)—significantly diminished the DCA-induced pressor effect. ICV infusion did not exert significant HR or BP changes. DCA relaxed MAs. Systemic vascular resistance did not change significantly.

All derivatives were evaluated against a panel of standard and clinical bacterial strains, as well as towards mycobacteria. The highest activity towards standard isolates was observed for the acetic acid derivative 14m, followed by conjugates of unsaturated crotonic (1m) and sorbic (2m) acids. The activity of conjugates tested against an expanded panel of clinical coagulase-negative staphylococci showed that the compound (14m) was recognized as a leading structure with an MIC of 0.5 μg/mL denoted for all quinolone-susceptible isolates. In the group of CP derivatives, sorbic (2) and geranic (3) acid amides exhibited the highest bactericidal potential against clinical strains. The M. tuberculosis Spec. 210 strain was the most sensitive to sorbic (2m) conjugate and to conjugates with medium- and long-chain polyunsaturated acids. To establish the mechanism of antibacterial action, selected CP and MXF conjugates were examined in both topoisomerase IV decatenation assay and the DNA gyrase supercoiling assay, followed by suitable molecular docking studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The aim of the study was to examine trends in fracture incidence and to find possible reasons for changes. Materials and methods: A complete dataset of Polish population aged above 50 from the National Heath Fund—which is a single, state-owned payer for the health service procedures in Poland—covering the years between 2010 and 2015 was analyzed along with climate dataset. Results: The analysis indicated that there was a substantial and statistically significant decrease in the incidence of forearm and hip fractures (p = 0.007 and 0.007, respectively). On the other side, there was a statistically significant increase in incidence of humerus and lumbar fractures (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, respectively). The observed changes (especially decrease in forearm and hip fracture incidence) happened mostly in the cold season and were correlated to mean-temperature changes during the assessed time period. Conclusion: In the analysis based on the dataset obtained from fracture-related database collected in Poland in the years 2010–2015 in the population of patients over 50 years of age, we observed that the changes of fracture incidence during the observation period are associated with and may be dependent on the season (warmer versus colder) and on mean temperature increase during the observation period."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Tissue expression of the AGER gene (AGER) is regulated by epigenetic mediators, including a long non-coding RNA AGER-1 (lncAGER-1). This study aimed to investigate whether human obesity and T2DM are associated with an altered expression of AGER and lncAGER-1 in adipose tissue and, if so, whether these changes affect the local inflammatory milieu. The expression of genes encoding AGER, selected adipokines, and lncAGER-1 was assessed using real-time PCR in visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue. VAT and SAT samples were obtained from 62 obese (BMI > 40 kg/m2; N = 24 diabetic) and 20 normal weight (BMI = 20–24.9 kg/m2) women, while a further 15 SAT samples were obtained from patients who were 18 to 24 months post-bariatric surgery. Tissue concentrations of adipokines were measured at the protein level using an ELISA-based method. Obesity was associated with increased AGER mRNA levels in SAT compared to normal weight status (p = 0.04) and surgical weight loss led to their significant decrease compared to pre-surgery levels (p = 0.01). Stratification by diabetic status revealed that AGER mRNA levels in VAT were higher in diabetic compared to non-diabetic women (p = 0.018). Elevated AGER mRNA levels in VAT of obese diabetic patients correlated with lncAGER-1 (p = 0.04, rs = 0.487) and with interleukin 1β (p = 0.008, rs = 0.525) and resistin (p = 0.004, rs = 0.6) mRNA concentrations. In conclusion, obesity in women is associated with increased expression of AGER in SAT, while T2DM is associated with increased AGER mRNA levels and pro-inflammatory adipokines in VAT."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, as first line therapies lead to resistance/relapse (r/r) in about half of treated patients, there is an unmet clinical need to identify novel therapeutic strategies tailored for these patients. In particular, immunotherapy constitutes an attractive option largely explored in preclinical and clinical studies.

Immediately after completing the measures, all athletes were interviewed by qualified psychologists who evaluated their mental health and provided recommendations.Results A total of 1121 elite athletes (545 female, 576 male) aged 18-53 (M=24.39, SD=5.09) were evaluated 2-8 months before the 2024 Paris Olympic Games; 72.4% scored above the triage threshold and 51% were positively screened in SMHAT-1's section 2. Based on the subsequent mental health evaluation, only 9.5% showed signs of persistent mental health concerns and required referral to a mental health specialist. In 24.2%, their distress levels/symptoms were assessed as occasional and normal in relation to demands, and they underwent a psychoeducational intervention or were advised to consult a sports psychologist. Female athletes scored significantly higher in most questionnaires.Conclusion SMHAT-1 proved a useful addition to the routine medical check-ups for elite athletes. Extending SMHAT-1 with a brief clinical intake interview substantially elevated the efficacy of the mental health evaluation, with an additional benefit of raising mental health literacy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","uid":"buMvwQ-25qWLPNyFWfucS4g","uuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","name":"Instytut Sportu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6023b26c9543c7744e88f33b","5e709386878c28a0473abf3f","602e470a9543c7410626f009"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","parentUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e5","rootUuid":"9859f400-1d6f-40d9-895a-80c6744ec14d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The breakthrough of monoclonal antibodies directed against CD20, notably exemplified by rituximab, revolutionized the prognosis of B-cell malignancies. Rituximab, approved across various hematological malignancies, marked a paradigm shift in cancer treatment. In the current landscape, immunotherapies targeting CD20 continue to evolve rapidly. Beyond traditional mAbs, advancements include antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), and chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) T cells. ADCs combine the precision of antibodies with the cytotoxic potential of drugs, presenting a promising avenue for enhanced therapeutic efficacy. BsAbs, particularly CD20xCD3 constructs, redirect cytotoxic T cells to eliminate cancer cells, thereby enhancing both precision and potency in their therapeutic action. CAR-T cells stand as a promising strategy for combatting hematological malignancies, representing one of the truly personalized therapeutic interventions. Many new therapies are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. This review serves as a comprehensive summary of CD20-targeted therapies, highlighting the progress and challenges that persist. Despite significant advancements, adverse events associated with these therapies and the development of resistance remain critical issues. Understanding and mitigating these challenges is paramount for the continued success of CD20-targeted immunotherapies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The aim of this study was to identify structural variants that could be associated with familial GTS. The study group comprised 17 multiplex families with 80 patients. Structural variants were identified from whole-genome sequencing data and followed by co-segregation and bioinformatic analyses. The localization of these variants was used to select candidate genes and create gene sets, which were subsequently processed in gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis. Seventy putative pathogenic variants shared among affected individuals within one family but not present in the control group were identified. Only four private or rare deletions were exonic in LDLRAD4, B2M, USH2A, and ZNF765 genes. Notably, the USH2A gene is involved in cochlear development and sensory perception of sound, a process that was associated previously with familial GTS. In addition, two rare variants and three not present in the control group were co-segregating with the disease in two families, and uncommon insertions in GOLM1 and DISC1 were co-segregating in three families each. Enrichment analysis showed that identified structural variants affected synaptic vesicle endocytosis, cell leading-edge organization, and signaling for neurite outgrowth. The results further support the involvement of the regulation of neurotransmission, neuronal migration, and sound-sensing in GTS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

However, to apply this novel treatment in solid cancers, one must identify suitable molecular targets in the\ntumors of choice. CEACAM family proteins are involved in the progression of a range of malignancies, including pancreatic\nand breast cancers, and pose attractive targets for anticancer therapies. In this work, we used a new CEACAM-targeted 2A3\nsingle-domain antibody-based chimeric antigen receptor T-cells to evaluate their antitumor properties in vitro and in animal\nmodels. Originally, 2A3 antibody was reported to target CEACAM6 molecule; however, our in vitro co-incubation experiments showed activation and high cytotoxicity of 2A3-CAR T-cells against CEACAM5 and/or CEACAM6 high human\ncell lines, suggesting cross-reactivity of this antibody. Moreover, 2A3-CAR T-cells tested in vivo in the BxPC-3 xenograft\nmodel demonstrated high efcacy against pancreatic cancer xenografts in both early and late intervention treatment regimens.\nOur results for the frst time show an enhanced targeting toward CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 molecules by the new 2A3\nsdAb-based CAR T-cells.

B-cell malignancies. However, the treatment fails in 50% of patients, often due to CD19 antigen loss. Alternative immunotherapies targeting other antigens are being tested but show limited efficacy, especially in cases of lineage switching or loss of B-cell phenotype, highlighting the need for novel targets. Herein, we identified leukocyte-immunoglobulin-like-receptor-B1 (LILRB1, CD85j) as a novel target for CAR-T cells through cell surface proteomics on patient-derived samples of high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). LILRB1, an immune inhibitory receptor, is normally expressed only on monocytes and B-cells. We observed stable LILRB1 expression in B-ALL and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), even after CD20/CD19-based immunotherapies. LILRB1 CAR-T cells showed antigen-specific antitumor activity in vitro against B-ALL/B-NHL cells, including those resistant to CD19 CAR-T-cells, and in vivo in B-ALL xenografts. Additionally, we identified LILRB1 in monocytic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and demonstrated LILRB1 CAR-T cell cytotoxicity against AML cell lines in vitro and in vivo. These findings establish LILRB1 as a novel target for cancer immunotherapy and show evidence for the preclinical efficacy of LILRB1 CAR-T cells against haematological malignancies, including cases resistant to previous lines of immunotherapy, thus holding promise for further clinical development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","uid":"bnG-e53W_Hi4NXdss6g991Q","uuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","name":"Instytut Hematologii i Transfuzjologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b0066"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","parentUuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","rootUuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

diversity in molecular and functional abnormalities in the mdx dystrophic brain","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Loss of full-length dystrophins is both necessary and sufficient to initiate DMD. These isoforms are expressed in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex (Dp427c), and cerebellar Purkinje cells (Dp427p). However, our understanding of the consequences of their absence, which is crucial for developing targeted interventions, remains inadequate. We combined RNA sequencing with genome-scale metabolic modelling (GSMM), immunodetection, and mitochondrial assays to investigate dystrophic alterations in the brains of the mdx mouse model of DMD. The cerebra and cerebella were analysed separately to discern the roles of Dp427c and Dp427p, respectively. Investigating these regions at 10 days (10d) and 10 weeks (10w) followed the evolution of abnormalities from development to early adulthood. These time points also encompass periods before onset and during muscle inflammation, enabling assessment of the potential damage caused by inflammatory mediators crossing the dystrophic blood–brain barrier. For the first time, we demonstrated that transcriptomic and functional dystrophic alterations are unique to the cerebra and cerebella and vary substantially between 10d and 10w. The common anomalies involved altered numbers of retained introns and spliced exons across mdx transcripts, corresponding with alterations in the mRNA processing pathways. Abnormalities in the cerebra were significantly more pronounced in younger mice. The top enriched pathways included those related to metabolism, mRNA processing, and neuronal development. GSMM indicated dysregulation of glucose metabolism, which corresponded with GLUT1 protein downregulation. The cerebellar dystrophic transcriptome, while significantly altered, showed an opposite trajectory to that of the cerebra, with few changes identified at 10 days. These late defects are specific and indicate an impact on the functional maturation of the cerebella that occurs postnatally. Although no classical neuroinflammation markers or microglial activation were detected at 10 weeks, specific differences indicate that inflammation impacts DMD brains. Importantly, some dystrophic alterations occur late and may therefore be amenable to therapeutic intervention, offering potential avenues for mitigating DMD-related neuropsychiatric defects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Forty-one NMR signals from raw CSF samples and 20 signals from lipid extracts were analyzed using univariate and multivariate statistical methods. ANOVA revealed significant differences in all analyzed signals. No single biochemical marker was found to predict brain death. The CSF metabolic profiles of patients who died differed significantly from those of patients in the control group. There were many statistically significantly different compounds, including amino acids, ketone bodies, lactate, pyruvate, citrate, guanidinoacetate, choline, and glycerophosphocholine. Analysis of lipids revealed significant differences in cholesterol, estriol, and phosphoethanolamine. Discriminant analysis allows the analysis of metabolic profiles instead of single biomarkers of cerebrospinal fluid compounds.

Hairy roots were induced using two R. rhizogenes strains, A4 and ATCC 15834; transformation was confirmed by PCR analysis targeting the rol and aux genes. The A4 strain exhibited higher transformation efficiency (41.3%) than ATCC 15834 (30.2%). Eight transgenic root clones (C1–C8) were established and confirmed as transformed. The clones exhibited significant variation in biomass accumulation and phenolic acid production. RA production was most strongly correlated with PAL, RAS, and CYP98A14 expression. Hierarchical clustering clustered the clones into three groups based on growth, metabolite content, and gene expression. Lines C1 and C2 exhibiting the highest RA, total polyphenol content, and the highest productivity were selected for further experiments. McCown Woody Plant (WP) and Schenk and Hildebrandt (SH) media demonstrated the greatest biomass accumulation, with growth indexes exceeding 13. Conversely, Gamborg (B5) medium enhanced RA content, achieving 38.3 and 40.8 mg/g dry weight (DW) for clones C1 and C2, respectively, representing a fourfold increase compared to the least favorable Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. These findings establish P. atriplicifolia hairy roots as efficient systems for RA biosynthesis and can provide a basis for metabolic engineering and scale-up production of phenolic acids in medicinal plants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Material and methods: The aim of the study is to assess the frequency and risk factors of OST among 232 patients with IBD compared to a group of 199 patients without IBD. The participants underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, laboratory tests, and completed a questionnaire about their physical activity. Results: It was found that 7.3% of IBD patients suffered from OST. Male gender, ulcerative colitis, extensive inflammation in the intestine, exacerbation of disease, rare physical activity, other forms of physical activity, past fractures, lower levels of osteocalcin, and higher levels of C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen were risk factors for OST. As many as 70.6% of OST patients were rarely physically active. Conclusions: OST is a common problem in IBD patients. OST risk factors differ significantly between the general population and those with IBD. Modifiable factors can be influenced by patients and by physicians. The key to OST prophylaxis may be regular physical activity, which should be recommended in clinical remission. It may also prove valuable to use markers of bone turnover in diagnostics, which may enable decisions regarding therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","uid":"bXACR4AS_DViRybrT_ocXzA","uuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","name":"Państwowy Instytut Medyczny Ministerstwa Spraw Wewnętrznych i Administracji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a04739679c","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1996","5ebee14b752340254fc4376a","642c0b864097077d1448c86c","647802aa40e3ff6728fe5bd5","642c0b864097077d1448c86a","642c0b864097077d1448c86b","5e70928c878c28a047397be6","647e9a2b40e3ff42bff60094"],"parentId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","parentUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","rootId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","rootUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Recent research has proposed a novel conceptualization of AD as \"type 3 diabetes\", highlighting the critical roles of insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism in the pathogenesis of the disease. This article examines the implications of this association, exploring potential new avenues for treatment and preventive strategies for AD. Key evidence linking diabetes to AD emphasizes critical metabolic processes that contribute to neurodegeneration, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and alterations in insulin signaling pathways. By framing AD within this metabolic context, we can enhance our understanding of its etiology, which in turn may influence early diagnosis, treatment plans, and preventive measures. Understanding AD as a manifestation of diabetes opens up the possibility of employing novel therapeutic strategies that incorporate lifestyle modifications and the use of antidiabetic medications to mitigate cognitive decline. This integrated approach has the potential to improve patient outcomes and deepen our comprehension of the intricate relationship between neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The study of this compound was prompted by the idea that effective processes of recognition and binding of FPV to the nucleic acid are affected predominantly by the propensity to form intra- and intermolecular interactions. Three nuclear quadrupole resonance experimental techniques, namely 1H-14N cross-relaxation, multiple frequency sweeps, and two-frequency irradiation, followed by solid-state computational modelling (density functional theory supplemented by the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, 3D Hirshfeld Surfaces, and reduced density gradient) approaches were applied. The complete NQR spectrum consisting of nine lines indicating the presence of three chemically inequivalent nitrogen sites in the FPV molecule was detected, and the assignment of lines to particular sites was performed. The description of the nearest vicinity of all three nitrogen atoms was used to characterize the nature of the intermolecular interactions from the perspective of the local single atoms and to draw some conclusions on the nature of the interactions required for effective recognition and binding. The propensity to form the electrostatic N−H···O, N−H···N, and C−H···O intermolecular hydrogen bonds competitive with two intramolecular hydrogen bonds, strong O−H···O and very weak N−H···N, closing the 5-member ring and stiffening the structure, as well as π···π and F···F dispersive interactions, were analysed in detail. The hypothesis regarding the similarity of the interaction pattern in the solid and the RNA template was verified. It was discovered that the -NH2 group in the crystal participates in intermolecular hydrogen bonds N–H···N and N–H···O, in the precatalytic state only in N–H···O, while in the active state in N–H···N and N–H···O hydrogen bonds, which is of importance to link FVP to the RNA template. Our study elucidates the binding modes of FVP (in crystal, precatalytic, and active forms) in detail and should guide the design of more potent analogues targeting SARS-CoV-2.

Measuring trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) is a standard method that enables the evaluation of barrier integrity. The capability of a novel measuring system (MS) that combines innovative components, customized electrodes, and user-friendly software tailored to provide accurate and adjustable measurements of endothelial barrier integrity. We demonstrated MS usage in TEER measurement of rat brain microvascular endothelial cell line (RBE-4), primary rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (PBMEC), rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC), and human intestinal epithelial cell line (HIEC-6). The MS was successfully applied to measure the TEER of cultured cell monolayers, finding that i) the device records stable values; ii) cells treated with ammonium chloride had lower TEER values compared to untreated cells, which was verified with permeability measurements with fluorescein dye and confocal microscopy. In conclusion, we invented a low-cost MS capable of accurate TEER measures in relevant biological ranges. The MS instrument facilitates long-time, real-time monitoring of the cellular barriers, giving vital insights into cell barrier stability, permeability, and the effects of pharmacological substances. The customized measurement duration and electrode configuration meet a broad range of experimental designs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac733","602f7d2b9543c7410626f532"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

and might be particularly important in neurons since they dramatically change their transcriptome in response to external stimuli. We show that stimulation of neurons causes condensation of large chromatin domains. This phenomenon can be observed in vitro in cultured rat hippocampal neurons as well as in vivo in the amygdala and hippocampal neurons. Activity-induced chromatin condensation is an active, rapid, energy-dependent, and reversible process. It involves calcium-dependent pathways but is independent of active transcription. It is accompanied by the redistribution of posttranslational histone modifications and rearrangements in the spatial organization of chromosome territories. Moreover, it leads to the reorganization of nuclear speckles and active domains located in their proximity. Finally, we find that the histone deacetylase HDAC1 is the key regulator of this process.

Following this strategy, we synthetized a library of 3-methylidene-1-tosyl-2,3-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridin-4(1H)-ones, combining a 1,8-naphthyridin-4-one motif with an exo-methylidene bond conjugated with a carbonyl group, pharmacophoric units that are present in many natural, biologically active compounds with anticancer potential. We reasoned that such bifunctional conjugates may have enhanced cytotoxic activity. The title compounds were synthesized in a four step reaction sequence. β-Ketophosphonate, obtained from methyl N-tosylnicotinate and diethyl methylphosphonate, was reacted with various aldehydes giving 3-diethoxyphosphoryl-2,3-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridin-4(1H)-ones as keto-enol tautomers. Later, these compounds were transformed into 3-methylidene-1-tosyl-2,3-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridin-4(1H)-ones applying the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons methodology. Then, the cytotoxicity of the new compounds was assessed on two cancer cell lines, promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and breast cancer adenocarcinoma MCF-7, and for comparison, on human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC. The most active and selective analog, 2-ethyl-3-methylidene-1-tosyl-2,3-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one 4a was chosen for more detailed studies on HL-60 cell line, to determine molecular mechanisms of its anticancer activity. It was shown that 4a strongly inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis which could be attributed to its ability to cause DNA damage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Organization’s statistics, 7 of the 10 main causes of death in 2019 were noncommunicable diseases. Health indicators are measures used to evaluate public health system effectiveness and functioning. Monitoring mortality rates from leading causes, life expectancy and other health indicators is essential to address their causes and adapt health systems to react adequately. The aim of this study is to present the dependencies of selected health care indicators and health outcomes. Methods: Based on the literature review conducted, selected health indicators, along with healthcare system data, were analyzed using Pearson’s r correlation. The analyses included data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) presented in statistics and the Health at a Glance 2021 report and data collected as part of the preparation of the Financing Global Health 2020 report by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Results: Health system resources are linked to health outcomes. The number of medical consultations, the number of nurses per patient or the level of financing of services under general health insurance are related to life expectancy and deaths due to causes that could have been avoided or treated. Conclusions: Life expectancy is positively correlated with access to general health insurance and public expenditure on healthcare. There is a need for all countries to provide their citizens with broad access to healthcare services."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

which a person with an illness accepts its presence and treats it as an integral part of their life. With regard to alcoholism, acceptance of illness is one of the important elements of the healing process. (2) Methods: The study group consisted of 104 residents in an addiction treatment ward. Questionnaires SOC-29, AIS and PSS-10 were used to check levels of coherence, stress and acceptance of illness. The analysis was based on regression analysis. Patient age was analysed as a moderator of correlations between perceived indicators. Moderation analysis was based on the simple moderation model. (3) Results: The level of perceived stress correlated negatively with all areas of the sense of coherence and with acceptance of illness. All areas of the sense of coherence correlated with acceptance of illness positively. (4) Conclusions: The acceptance of illness by the patient is a factor that can be motivating for further treatment, through a positive approach to illness and strengthening the sense of control in experiencing it. The combination of strengthening behavioural, cognitive and motivational resources can be used in the treatment of people experiencing the challenges of addiction to alcohol."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). While tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective in up to 95% of CML patients, 50% of Ph+ B-ALL cases do not respond to treatment or relapse. This calls for new therapeutic approaches for Ph+ B-ALL. Previous studies have shown that inhibitors of the thioredoxin (TXN) system exert antileukemic activity against B-ALL cells, particularly in combination with other drugs. Here, we present that peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX1), one of the enzymes of the TXN system, is upregulated in Ph+ lymphoid as compared to Ph+ myeloid cells. PRDX1 knockout negatively affects the viability of Ph+ B-ALL cells and sensitizes them to TKIs. Analysis of global gene expression changes in imatinib-treated, PRDX1-deficient cells revealed that the nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair is a novel vulnerability of Ph+ B-ALL cells. Accordingly, PRDX1-deficient Ph+ B-ALL cells were susceptible to NHEJ inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrated the potent efficacy of a novel combination of TKIs, TXN inhibitors, and NHEJ inhibitors against Ph+ B-ALL cell lines and primary cells, which can be further investigated as a potential therapeutic approach for the treatment of Ph+ B-ALL."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","uid":"bnG-e53W_Hi4NXdss6g991Q","uuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","name":"Instytut Hematologii i Transfuzjologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940c878c28a0473b5690"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","parentUuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","rootUuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Moreover, to facilitate such diagnostic analyses and enable future application of gene therapy and genome editing for IRD patients, a Polish genomic reference database (POLGENOM) was created based on whole-genome sequences of healthy Polish Caucasian nonagenarians and centenarians. The newly constructed database served as a control, providing a comparison for variant frequencies in the Polish population. The diagnostic yield for the selected group of IRD patients reached 64.9%. The study uncovered the most common pathogenic variants in ABCA4 and USH2A in the European population, along with several novel causative variants. A significant frequency of the ABCA4 complex haplotype p.(Leu541Pro; Ala1038Val) was observed, as well as that of the p.Gly1961Glu variant. The first VCAN causative variant NM_004385.5:c.4004-2A>G in Poland was found and described. Moreover, one of the first patients with the RPE65 causative variants was identified, and, in consequence, could receive the dedicated gene therapy. The availability of the reference POLGENOM database enabled comprehensive variant characterisation during the NGS data analysis, confirming the utility of a population-specific genomic database for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. Study findings suggest the significance of genetic testing in elder patients with unclear aetiology of eye diseases.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to compare the influence of three oncological treatment methods of intervention on the echocardiographic (ECHO) parameters of left ventricular function. Materials and Methods: One hundred and fifty-five women with breast cancer were divided into three groups depending on the type of therapy used: group I (AC)—anthracyclines; group II (AC + TZ)—anthracyclines + trastuzumab; and group III (RTls+)—anthracyclines with or without trastuzumab + left-sided radiotherapy. Prospective ECHO examinations were performed at baseline and every 3 months, up to 12 months from the start of the therapy. Patients with a history of chemotherapy or who were diagnosed with heart disease were not included in the study. Results: Out of 155 patients, 3 died due to cancer as the primary cause, and 12 withdrew their consent for further observation. Baseline systolic and diastolic ECHO parameters did not differ between the analyzed groups. Cardiotoxicity, according to the LVEF criteria, occurred during follow-up in 20 patients (14.3%), irrespective of the treatment method used. Diastolic echocardiographic parameters did not change significantly after 12 months in each group, except for the left atrial volume index (LAVi), which was significantly higher in the AC + TZ compared to the values in the RTls+ group. Conclusions: All three oncologic therapeutic modalities in women with breast cancer showed no significant differences in relation to the incidence of echocardiographic cardiotoxicity criterion; however, transient systolic decrease in LVEF was most frequently observed in the AC + TZ therapeutic regimen. Left-sided radiotherapy was not associated with excess left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction during a 12-month follow-up period. The predictors of negative changes in diastolic parameters included age and combined anthracycline and trastuzumab therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","uid":"byQikIwqf13QiA2ApyMoNIQ","uuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","name":"Śląski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70931a878c28a0473a2eeb","681bdaa2fdbe8359b3415e20"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","parentUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","rootUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The aim of the study was to attempt to answer the question whether gender and the number of comorbidities, as well as the application of tertiary prevention principles, play a role in the severity of anxiety and depression in the studied group of patients with coronary artery disease. Material: The study involved 765 patients from 11 Polish cardiology centers. The presented material is part of the multicenter POLASPIRE II study. Methods: All patients completed The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire, and a medical interview was conducted with them. Conclusions: Although the intensity of anxiety and depression in the studied group of patients was low, gender differentiated them, which, however, did not influence undertaking tertiary prevention activities. In the study group of patients, the number of comorbidities and cardiac incidents/procedures after the event qualifying for the study, as well as preventive actions undertaken, were not associated with the severity of anxiety and depression. In the studied group of patients with coronary heart disease, there was still a large group of people who did not take preventive measures. Therefore, there is a need for systematic education regarding the benefits of implementing them to prevent the progression of the disease and premature death."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","uid":"byQikIwqf13QiA2ApyMoNIQ","uuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","name":"Śląski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70931a878c28a0473a2ee9","5e70931a878c28a0473a2eea","5e709420878c28a0473b6ac0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","parentUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","rootUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Prevention, identification, and treatment of frailty are important challenges in gerontology and public health. The study aimed to estimate the prevalence of the frailty phenotype (FP) among the oldest-old Polish Caucasians and investigate the relationship between the FP and mortality. Baseline data were collected from 289 long-lived individuals, including 87 centenarians and 202 subjects aged 94–99. Mortality was obtained from population registers over the following 5 years. Sixty percent of subjects were classified as frail, 33% as prefrail, and 7% as robust. Frailty was more common in women than men and among centenarians than nonagenarians. During the 5-year observation period, 92.6% of the frail women and all frail men died, while mortality rates were lower among prefrail, 78.8% and 66.7%, and robust individuals, 60% and 54.5%, respectively. In the survival analysis, frailty was the strongest negative risk factor: HR = 0.328 (95% CI: 0.200–0.539). The inability to perform handgrip strength measurement was an additional predictor of short survival. In conclusion, the FP is prevalent in nonagenarians and centenarians and correlates with lower survivability. Future studies should address differences between unavoidable age-associated frailty and reversible disability in long-lived individuals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","uid":"byQikIwqf13QiA2ApyMoNIQ","uuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","name":"Śląski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70931a878c28a0473a2e05"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","parentUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","rootUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We developed a novel wound dressing based on fur keratin derived powder (FKDP) enriched with trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and evaluated its efficacy in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, a 0.1 % (m/v) FKDP+TMAO suspension increased keratinocyte viability by up to 44.9 % ± 8.6 % (p < 0.05) and enhanced PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation as indicated by a 2.6-fold increase in p-RPS6 expression (p < 0.05), which is a surrogate marker of PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation. Real-time PCR studies showed up-regulation of KRT17 in cells treated with FKDP+TMAO suspension (p < 0.05). In vivo, full-thickness wounds in diabetic rats (n = 30) treated with FKDP+TMAO showed significantly faster healing rate on days 4 (40.1 % ± 14.4 % vs. 29.1 % ± 16.9 %, p < 0.01), 7 (64.5 % ± 17.2 % vs. 56.9 % ± 21.2 %, p < 0.01) and 14 (95.9 % ± 5.0 % vs. 90.6 % ± 11.0 %, p < 0.05). All treated wounds healed by day 21, while untreated wounds still remained partially unhealed (98.7 % ± 1.9 %, p < 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that treated wounds were characterized by an earlier infiltration of pro-healing M2 macrophages, whereas at the same time point in control wounds pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages predominated (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that FKDP+TMAO is a safe and effective wound dressing that accelerates healing through immunoregulation and activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e2878c28a0473b2975"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Plasma lactate levels are elevated in diabetes, and chronic extracellular lactic acidosis is recognized as a negative prognostic marker for the disease. The development of diabetic kidney disease is closely associated with podocyte injury, which forms a crucial layer of the glomerular filtration barrier. Given that high extracellular glucose concentrations also induce lactate production and excretion in podocytes, we hypothesize that an appropriate LDH expression pattern is crucial for maintaining proper podocyte metabolism and function. Our research shows that hyperglycemia significantly decreases lactate dehydrogenase activity in podocytes. Specifically, reduced LDHA expression under hyperglycemic conditions contributes to metabolic disturbances in these cells. Lower LDH activity results in decreased glycolytic activity, altered expression of monocarboxylate transporters, reduced insulin-dependent glucose uptake, and a decrease in the number of podocyte foot processes. These findings underscore the essential role of LDHA in the metabolic adaptation of podocytes to elevated glucose levels typical of diabetes. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying podocyte injury, our study provides new insights into potential therapeutic targets for preventing or mitigating diabetic kidney disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

serotonergic signaling. Using a combination of behavioral, biochemical, and imaging methods, we analyze 5-HT7R/MMP-9 signaling and dendritic spine plasticity in the hippocampus in mice treated with the selective 5-HT7R agonist (LP-211) and in a model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depressive-like behavior. We show that acute 5-HT7R activation induces depressive-like behavior in mice in an MMP-9-dependent manner and that post mortem brain samples from human individuals with depression reveal increased MMP-9 enzymatic activity in the hippocampus. Both pharmacological activation of 5-HT7R and modulation of its downstream effectors as a result of CUS lead to dendritic spine elongation and decreased spine density in this region. Overall, the 5-HT7R/MMP-9 pathway is specifically activated in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus during chronic stress and is crucial for inducing depressive-like behavior."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Homozygous GRN mutations are exceedingly rare and cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis 11, a lysosomal storage disease with onset in young adulthood, or an FTD syndrome with late-onset manifestations. In this review, we highlight the broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes associated with PGRN deficiency, including primary progressive aphasia and behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia. We explore these phenotypes alongside relevant rodent and in vitro human models, ranging from the induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitors, neurons, microglia, and astrocytes to genetically engineered heterotypic organoids containing both neurons and astrocytes. We summarize advantages and limitations of these models in recapitulating the main FTLD-GRN hallmarks, highlighting the role of non-cell-autonomous mechanisms in the formation of TDP-43 pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Data obtained from patients’ brain tissues and biofluids, in parallel with single-cell transcriptomics, demonstrate the complexity of interactions among the highly heterogeneous cellular clusters present in the brain, including neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendroglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes. Emerging evidence has revealed that PGRN deficiency is associated with cell cluster-specific, often conserved, genetic and molecular phenotypes in the central nervous system. In this review, we focus on how these distinct cellular populations and their dysfunctional crosstalk contribute to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in FTD-GRN. Specifically, we characterize the phenotypes of lipid droplet-accumulating microglia and alterations of myelin lipid content resulting from lysosomal dysfunction caused by PGRN deficiency. Additionally, we consider how the deregulation of glia-neuron communication affects the exchange of organelles such as mitochondria, and the removal of excess toxic products such as protein aggregates, in PGRN-related neurodegeneration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We investigated the association between blood pressure, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and white blood cell (WBC) count in a cohort of 3571 older adults aged 65 and above, and 587 middle-aged participants (55–59 years old). In women aged 65 and above, the relationship between inflammatory markers and blood pressure was consistent, with hs-CRP and WBC emerging as predictors of high blood pressure. For hs-CRP, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.5 (95% CI, 1.07 to 2.10, P = 0.02), and for WBC, the adjusted OR was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.94, P = 0.04), comparing the highest to the lowest quartiles. In men, only the WBC count was significantly associated with an increased OR for high BP (adjusted OR 1.49, 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.02, P = 0.01) across quartiles. Across the entire study population, in a fully adjusted model, all inflammatory markers were modestly associated with blood pressure levels, while the effect of being over 65 years was the most significant predictor of high blood pressure (OR 1.84, 95% CI, 1.50 to 2.25, P < 0.001). The link between key inflammation markers and blood pressure in older adults varies by sex and biomarker type and may differ from the relationship observed in younger individuals.

of acute lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by the presence of the BCR::ABL1 fusion gene. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) combined with chemotherapy are established as the first-line treatment. Additionally, rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is administered to adult BCP-ALL patients with ≥20% CD20+ blasts. In this study, we observed a marked prevalence of CD20 expression in patients diagnosed with Ph+ BCP-ALL, indicating a potential widespread clinical application of rituximab in combination with TKI. Consequently, we examined the influence of TKI on the antitumor effectiveness of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies by evaluating levels of CD20 on the cell surface and conducting in vitro functional assays. All tested TKI were found to uniformly downregulate CD20 on leukemic cells, diminishing the efficacy of rituximab-mediated complement- dependent cytotoxicity. Interestingly, these TKI displayed varied effects on natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antibody- dependent cytotoxicity and macrophage phagocytic function. While asciminib demonstrated no inhibition of effector cell functions, dasatinib notably suppressed the anti-CD20-monoclonal antibody-mediated NK cell cytotoxicity and macrophage phagocytosis of BCP-ALL cells. Dasatinib and ponatinib also decreased NK cell degranulation in vitro. Importantly, oral administration of dasatinib, but not asciminib, compromised NK cell activity in patients’ blood, as determined by an ex vivo degranulation assay. Our results indicate that asciminib might be preferred over other TKI for combination therapy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","uid":"byQikIwqf13QiA2ApyMoNIQ","uuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","name":"Śląski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70948d878c28a0473bf667","5ebee458752340254fc444e2","5e709319878c28a0473a2d2e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","parentUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","rootUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The predominant glycolysis activity is a primary driver of cell proliferation and maintenance of the high-energetic state. Here, we examined the functions of two crucial auxiliary pathways: the phosphate-pentose pathway (PPP) and fructose-2,6-biphosphate pathway (FBP) to evaluate their impact on the therapeutic potential of Adipose-Derived Stem/Stromal cells (ASCs) during prolonged culture in various oxygen conditions: 5 % O2 - physiological normoxia or 21 % O2 - atmospheric oxygen. Our findings demonstrate that ASCs cultured in 5 % O2 increased the rate of proliferation, migration, and expression of stemness factors, which is prominent during the initial and middle passages. Additionally, ASCs cultured in a 5 % O2 exhibited heightened protection mechanisms against free radicals, increased LDH gene expression, and elevated extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). By estimating the HIF-1α level, we concluded that 5 % oxygen conditions were insufficient to induce a profound hypoxic state in ASCs. However, at the protein level, both the PPP and FBP pathways appeared to be more active in young (2-passage) cells, regardless of oxygen conditions, and their activity diminished over time. Additionally, the chemical suppression of G6PDH by Polydatin and inhibition of PFKFB3 by PFK-158 in ASCs (passage-2) revealed dose- and time-dependent effect on decreasing migratory capabilities of cells.

In this study, a novel M23 peptidase from Streptococcus thermophilus NCTC10353, designated StM23, was discovered and characterized. It exhibited antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes and other Gram-positive bacteria with meso-DAP-type peptidoglycan, including Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. To enhance StM23’s efficacy and specificity, a chimeric enzyme, StM23_CWT, was engineered by fusing its catalytic domain with a cell wall-targeting domain (CWT) from SpM23B, a peptidoglycan hydrolase found in Staphylococcus pettenkoferi. The engineered chimera demonstrated expanded specificity, showing activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Its ability to disrupt L. monocytogenes cells was visualized by electron microscopy. The enzyme effectively disrupted biofilm structures and decontaminated surfaces like glass, stainless steel, and silicone, showcasing its industrial potential. Safety evaluations using zebrafish, moth larvae, and human cell models confirmed its non-toxic profile, supporting its broad applicability. Based on these findings, StM23_CWT is a novel and potent antimicrobial agent with significant potential to reduce the risk of listeriosis and control persistent pathogens."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Among them, bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins play a crucial role by recognizing acetylated histones and acting as transcriptional co-regulators to modulate gene expression. This study investigates the potential of inhibiting BET proteins in preventing microglia-mediated neuronal damage in vitro. Murine BV2 microglial cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or amyloid-β (Aβ) to induce an inflammatory response, and the subsequent effects on murine HT22 neuronal cells were examined. Among the BET proteins tested, only Brd4 was significantly upregulated in BV2 cells upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. JQ1, a potent pan-inhibitor of BET proteins, suppressed LPS-induced upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels, including Il1b, Il6, and Tnf, in BV2 microglia. Pre-treatment with JQ1 attenuated the cytotoxicity of LPS-activated BV2 cells toward neurons. Additionally, conditioned media from Aβ fibril-stimulated BV2 cells induced neuronal cell death, which was partially prevented by pre-treatment with JQ1. Co-culture assays further demonstrated the beneficial effect of BET inhibition.

Post-mortem studies of sudden death in the young report a highly variable prevalence of active myocarditis, even up to 42% of cases [6, 7]. Moreover, myocarditis was confirmed in 9–16% of adults with unexplained non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy in endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) [8, 9]. Importantly, more than 300,000 patients die each year worldwide from dilated cardiomyopathy caused by myocarditis, while 5-year mortality in the course of dilated cardiomyopathy is 20–50% [10, 11].

In the course of our works on fentanyls we turned our attention to the possibility that these compounds might bind to the σ1 receptor—one of the most interesting molecular targets for modern pharmacology. Twelve commercially available fentanyls were investigated for σ1R affinity. While the parent compound exhibits a micromolar affinity for the receptor, such modest structural changes as deleting one methylene unit from N-substituent or introduction of fluorine in the anilide ring yield submicromolar affinities. Since the σ1R antagonists have been known to potentiate opioid analgesia and to be active against neuropathic pain, we speculated that dual σ1R/μOR ligands based on fentanyl scaffold could be analgesic agents with interesting and beneficial properties. These speculations have been recently confirmed in contribution by other workers who synthesized high affinity σ1R antagonists/μOR agonists with potent analgesic activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Vitamin D has an immunomodulatory effect. We aimed to assess the possible correlation between the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and serum vitamin D concentration.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 505 successive patients admitted to a COVID-19-dedicated hospital were included in the retrospective analysis. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR throat swab test results were determined for each patient. The course of COVID-19 was assessed on the basis of the serum Vitamin Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), which includes respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and state of consciousness), as well as number of days spent in the intensive care unit (ICU) and need for oxygen therapy.\n\nRESULTS: There was no difference in 25-OHD concentration between COVID-19-confirmed and negative results of the PCR tests. No correlation was found between serum 25-OHD in the COVID(+) group and the need for and time spend in the ICU, as well as the MEWS score. Multivariate analyses showed a positive correlation between need for oxygen therapy and lower 25-OHD concentration, as well as older age (P<0.001) and similar positive correlation between need for ventilation therapy with lower 25-OHD concentration, as well as older age (P=0.005).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and the incidence of COVID-19, but low vitamin D serum level in COVID-19 patients might worsen the course of the disease and increase the need for oxygen supplementation or ventilation therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medycznego Kształcenia Podyplomowego","affiliatedPersonIDs":["635111d9409707413d313eb5","5e7093e2878c28a0473b28c7","5e70933b878c28a0473a564a","5e7094ab878c28a0473c1553","5e7094f9878c28a0473c82be"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

imbalance between reactive species generation and the dysfunctional capacity of antioxidant defenses, is one of the characteristic features of cancer. Here, we quantified hydrogen peroxide in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide concentrations are elevated in tumor interstitial fluid isolated from murine breast cancers in vivo, when compared with blood or normal subcutaneous fluid. Therefore, we investigated the effects of increased hydrogen peroxide concentration on immune cell functions. NK cells were more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide than T cells or B cells, and by comparing T, B, and NK cells' sensitivities to redox stress and their antioxidant capacities, we identified peroxiredoxin-1 (PRDX1) as a lacking element of NK cells' antioxidative defense. We observed that priming with IL15 protected NK cells' functions in the presence of high hydrogen peroxide and simultaneously upregulated PRDX1 expression. However, the effect of IL15 on PRDX1 expression was transient and strictly dependent on the presence of the cytokine. Therefore, we genetically modified NK cells to stably overexpress PRDX1, which led to increased survival and NK cell activity in redox stress conditions. Finally, we generated PD-L1–CAR NK cells overexpressing PRDX1 that displayed potent antitumor activity against breast cancer cells under oxidative stress. These results demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide, at concentrations detected in the TME, suppresses NK cell function and that genetic modification strategies can improve CAR NK cells' resistance and potency against solid tumors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This pilot study aimed to answer the question of whether markers of thyroid autoimmunity are associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) in young, asymptomatic T1DM women.\nMaterial and methods: The study population consisted of 102 women, including 72 with T1DM and 30 healthy controls. All patients had thyroid hormones within the normal range. According to the antiperoxidase antibodies (aTPO) titre, the T1DM women were divided into an aTPO-positive (T1DM aTPO+) (n = 41) and an aTPO-negative (T1DM aTPO–) (n = 31) group. In all patients, aTPO, thyroglobulin antibody (aTG) titres, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT3), free triiodothyronine (FT4), lipid parameters, glycated haemoglobin, thyroid ultrasonography, and cIMT assessment were evaluated. The association of cIMT with different risk factors related to thyroid autoimmunity was determined.\nResults: Carotid intima-media thickness was significantly greater in T1DM aTPO+ females (0.66 ± 0.10 mm) than in T1DM aTPO– (0.59 ± 0.11 mm) and healthy controls (0.58 ± 0.10 mm) (p = 0.007, p = 0.001, respectively). In all women cIMT was significantly, positively correlated with aTPO (p = 0.005, r = 0.273), Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) duration (p = 0.00015, r = 0.367), levothyroxine dose per week (p = 0.006, r = 0.269), and ultrasound features of HT (p = 0.004, r = 0.281) and inversely with fT3 concentration (p = 0.014, r = –0.243) and FT3/FT4 ratio (p = 0.042, r = –0.201). A logistic regression analysis showed that HT duration (OR: 1.102, 95% CI: 1.008–1.206, p = 0.032) and a positive history family of HT (OR: 3.909, 95%CI: 1.014–15.071, p = 0.045) were risk factors for increased cIMT. However, multivariate regression analysis showed that the studied parameters related to thyroid autoimmunity are not independent risk factors for increased cIMT.\nConclusions: We expanded the data on cIMT in young women with T1DM and showed that thyroid autoimmunity, and in particular the duration of exposure to anti-thyroid antibodies, despite adequate levothyroxine substitution, is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in young women with T1DM. However, thyroid-related parameters are not independent risk factors for increased cIMT in euthyroid women."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The review aims to show how the glial cells, astrocytes, contribute to the central regulation of appetite and energy metabolism. The hypothalamus is the brain center responsible for nutrients and nutritional hormone sensing, signal processing, and execution of metabolic and behavioral responses, directed at sustaining energy homeostasis. The astrocytes are endowed with receptors, transporters and enzymatic machinery responsible for glucose, lactate, fatty acids, ketone bodies, as well as leptin or ghrelin transport and metabolism, and that render them supporters and partners for neurons in governing the brain and body energy intake and expenditure. However, the role of astrocytes associated with brain energy metabolism reaches far beyond simple fuel contingent—they contribute to cognitive performance. The cognitive decline which often accompanies high fat- and/or high-calorie diets and correlates with neuroinflammation and astrogliosis, is a major concern. The last two decades of research enabled us to acknowledge the astroglia in obesity-associated dysfunctions and to investigate astrocytes as contributors to the pathology, as well as targets for therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Heart failure was induced by creating an aorto-caval fistula (ACF). Selective ETA receptor blockade was achieved by atrasentan. For comparison, other rat groups received trandolapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi). Animals first underwent ACF creation and 2 weeks later the treatment with atrasentan or trandolapril, alone or combined, was applied; the follow-up period was 20 weeks.\n\nResults: \nEighteen days after creating ACF, untreated TGR began to die, and none was alive by day 79. Both atrasentan and trandolapril treatment improved the survival rate, ultimately to 56% (18 of 31 animals) and 69% (22 of 32 animals), respectively. Combined ACEi and ETA receptor blockade improved the final survival rate to 52% (17 of 33 animals). The effects of the three treatment regimens on the survival rate did not significantly differ. All three treatment regimens suppressed the development of cardiac hypertrophy and lung congestion, decreased left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic volume and LV end-diastolic pressure, and improved LV systolic contractility in ACF TGR as compared with their untreated counterparts.\n\nConclusion: \nThe treatment with ETA receptor antagonist delays the onset of decompensation of volume-overload heart failure and improves the survival rate in hypertensive TGR with ACF-induced heart failure. However, the addition of ETA receptor blockade did not enhance the beneficial effects beyond those obtained with standard treatment with ACEi alone."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

A Working Group of experts from the Multidisciplinary Osteoporosis Forum and from the National Institute of Geriatrics, Rheumatology, and Rehabilitation in Warsaw performed a thorough comprehensive review of current relevant publications in the field (including all age groups of people and management of secondary osteoporosis), and they evaluated epidemiological data on osteoporosis in Poland and the existing standards of care and costs. A voting panel of all co-authors assessed and discussed the quality of evidence to formulate 29 specific recommendations and voted independently the strength of each recommendation.\nThis updated practice guidance highlights a new algorithm of the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for individuals at high and very high fracture risk and presents a spectrum of general management and the use of medication including anabolic therapy. Furthermore, the paper discusses the strategy of primary and secondary fracture prevention, detection of fragility fractures in the population, and points to vital elements for improving management of osteoporosis in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","uid":"bm3qIJZlNw1U92UVKrOsP_w","uuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Białymstoku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709262878c28a047394bd9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","parentUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","rootUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

PD subjects performed six repetitions of deep-, semi-squat, and calves at vibration frequency of 30 Hz. Each 30 s exercise was followed by 30 s rest. The young volunteers performed two sessions of above-mentioned exercises with and without vibration.

Definitions of risk factors and treatment goals were based on the 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on cardiovascular prevention.\nResults: The prevalence of modifiable risk factors in both sexes was high, and their control inadequate. Women were older (P <⁠0.001) and had a higher accumulation of multiple cardiovascular risk factors than men (P = 0.036). They more frequently had central obesity (P <⁠0.001) and reduced values of glomerular filtration rate (P <⁠0.001). Women more often experienced anxiety (P <⁠0.001), reported lower levels of education (P <⁠0.001) and lower income (P = 0.001), and those in the youngest age group were more likely to be exposed to second-hand smoking (P = 0.01). A large fraction of the study patients, men and women alike, did not meet the recommended therapeutic goals. For both sexes, participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs was associated with more frequent attainment of the recommended level of physical activity (P = 0.046) and smoking cessation (P = 0.01).\nConclusions: The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with CHD is high, especially in women. Therapeutic goals are met infrequently in both sexes. This situation calls for widening the access to educational programs and paying greater attention to their proper implementation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","uid":"byQikIwqf13QiA2ApyMoNIQ","uuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","name":"Śląski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70931a878c28a0473a2ee9","656d262040970749a85ef6b9","5e70931b878c28a0473a2f1f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","parentUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de50","rootUuid":"cd474cbb-d4ba-4475-b0d0-580f5f2e17ef","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Although reactive hypoglycemia (RH) can be classified as one of these disorders, its role as a potential atherosclerosis risk factor remains unclear. The aim of the study was to assess whether patients with RH have a higher risk of atherosclerosis.\nPatients and Methods: We recruited 178 patients (N=178) with suspected RH who were hospitalized after 2014 and underwent a prolonged 5-hour oral glucose tolerance test. The study cohort was divided into 2 groups depending on the results of the oral glucose tolerance test: Group 1 – subjects without RH (n=44), Group 2 –subjects with RH (n=134).\nResults: The analyzed groups differed significantly in terms of the following risk factors for atherosclerosis: high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (54.3± 18.8 mg/dL vs 63± 18.5 mg/dL, p=0.003) and atherogenic indices (Castelli I: 3.7± 1.2 vs 3.1± 1.3, p=0.004; Castelli II: 2.1± 0.9 vs 1.7± 0.9, p=0.007; the atherogenic index of plasma: 0.34± 0.33 vs 0.18± 0.3, p=0.006; and the atherogenic coefficient: 2.7± 1.2 vs 2.1± 1.3, p=0.004). Univariate logistic regression showed that RH should not be considered to be a predictor of an increased atherogenic index of plasma (odds ratio [OR]=0.3 [95% confidence interval [CI] [0.16– 0.7], p=0.002). Multivariate logistic regression revealed triglyceride levels (OR 1.14 [1.07– 1.2], p=0.001) and body weight (OR 1.07 [1.03– 1.12], p=0.002) to be independent risk factors for atherosclerosis.\nConclusion: Atherosclerosis risk factors are no more prevalent in patients with RH.

Autoimmune factors are suspected to play a role in cardiovascular complications, especially in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The aim of this pilot study was to explore whether antithyroid peroxidase antibody (aTPO) as a marker of increased immune activity is related to cardiac dysfunction in young, asymptomatic women with T1DM.\nMaterial and methods: Eighty-eight euthyroid women (59 with T1DM and 29 healthy controls) underwent physical examination, laboratory tests, thyroid ultrasound, and two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. According to the antiperoxidase antibodies (aTPO) titre, the T1DM women were divided into an aTPO positive (T1DM aTPO+) (n = 34) and an aTPO negative (T1DM aTPO–) (n = 25) group. The relationship between thyroid autoimmunity parameters and echocardiographic parameters was evaluated.\nResults: Global longitudinal strain (GLS) was slightly reduced in the T1DM aTPO+ group compared to T1DM aTPO– and significantly compared to controls (p = 0.051 and p = 0.015, respectively). Although, the lower values of longitudinal strain of left ventricular were found in the majority of segments in the T1DM aTPO+ group in comparison to T1DM aTPO– and controls, significant differences were only found in the two-chamber view (specifically in the anterior segments) between the T1DM aTPO+ and T1DM aTPO– groups (p = 0.030) and in the four-chamber view (specifically in the anterolateral segments) between the T1DM aTPO+ group and controls (p = 0.021). Echocardiographic parameters of diastolic and systolic function of both ventricles were significantly correlated with parameters of thyroidautoimmunity. A logistic regression analysis showed that Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) duration [odds ratio (OR): 0.997, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.995–0.999, p = 0.008), the dose of levothyroxine (OR: 0.814, 95% CI: 0.689–0.960, p = 0.013), and reduced echogenicity on thyroid ultrasound (OR: 0.309, 95% CI: 0.120–0.793, p = 0.013) had a significant influence on reduced GLS.\nConclusions: Our results suggest that coexistence of aTPO with T1DM was associated with poorer myocardial function, particularly in the anterior and anterolateral segments, which may be related to an autoimmune factor. The impaired function of these segments is probably the first sign of myocardial systolic dysfunction in women with T1DM, which needs to be confirmed in further studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, not much is known about the elements of the actin fold involved in ionic-strength-dependent filament stabilization. In this work, F-actin was destabilized by Cu2+ binding to Cys374, and the effects of solvent conditions on the dynamic properties of F-actin were correlated with the involvement of Segment 227-235 in filament stabilization. The results of our work show that the presence of Mg2+ at the high-affinity cation binding site of Cu-modified actin polymerized with MgCl2 strongly enhances the rate of filament subunit exchange and promotes the filament instability. In the presence of 0.1 M KCl, the filament subunit exchange was 2–3-fold lower than that in the MgCl2-polymerized F-actin. This effect correlates with the reduced accessibility of the D-loop and Segment 227-235 on opposite filament strands, consistent with an ionic-strength- dependent conformational change that modulates involvement of Segment 227-235 in stabilization of the intermonomer interface. KCl may restrict the mobility of the \n-helix encompassing part of Segment 227-235 and/or be bound to Asp236 at the boundary of Segment 227-235. These results provide experimental evidence for the involvement of Segment 227-235 in salt-induced stabilization of contacts within the actin filament. This stabilizzation is observed at ionic conditions close to the physiological and weakens by a modification of the C-terminus, which may be of physiological importance because a hydrophobic cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 where the C-terminus is situated is a target for numerous G- and F-actin-binding proteins controlling actin dynamics in the cell."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Used in medicine as a drug since the 1980-s, citicoline was recently pronounced a food ingredient. When ingested, citicoline breaks down to cytidine and choline, which become incorporated into their respective normal metabolic pathways. Choline is a precursor of acetylcholine and phospholipids; these is a neurotransmitter pivotal for learning and memory and important constituents of neuronal membranes and myelin sheaths, respectively. Cytidine in humans is readily converted to uridine, which exerts a positive effect on synaptic function and supports the formation of synaptic membranes. Choline deficiency has been found to be correlated with memory dysfunction. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies showed that citicoline intake improves brain uptake of choline in older persons, suggestive of that it shall help in reversing early age-related cognitive changes. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials of cognitively normal middle-aged and elderly persons, positive effects of citicoline on memory efficacy were found. Similar effects of citicoline on memory indices were also found in patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment and some other neurological diseases. Altogether, the aforementioned data provide complex and unambiguous evidence supporting the claim that oral citicoline intake positively influences memory function in humans who encounter age-related memory impairment also in the absence of any detectable neurological or psychiatric disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The power spectrum slope, −α in 1/fα , has been postulated to be related to the dynamic balance between excitation (E) and inhibition (I). Our study found that human cerebral organoids grown from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from Schizophrenia patients (SCZ) showed structural changes associated with altered elasticity compared to that of the normal cerebral organoids. Furthermore, mitochondrial drugs modulated the elasticity in SCZ that was found related to the changes in the spectral exponent. Therefore, we developed an electro-mechanical model that related the microtubular-actin tensegrity structure to the elasticity and the 1/fα noise. Model-based analysis showed that a decrease in the number and length of the constitutive elements in the tensegrity structure decreased its elasticity and made the spectral exponent more negative while thermal white noise will make α=0 .. Based on the microtubularactin model and the cross-talk in structural (elasticity) and functional (electrophysiology) response, aberrant mitochondrial dynamics in SCZ are postulated to be related to the deficits in mitochondrial-cytoskeletal interactions for long-range transport of mitochondria to support synaptic activity for E/I balance.

However, the original iNIRS technique uses single-mode fibers for light collection, which reduces the detected light throughput. The reduced light throughput is compensated by the relatively long measurement or integration times (∼1 sec), which preclude monitoring of rapid blood flow changes that could be linked to neural activation. Here, we propose parallel interferometric near-infrared spectroscopy (πNIRS) to overcome this limitation. In πNIRS we use multi-mode fibers for light collection and a high-speed, two-dimensional camera for light detection. Each camera pixel acts effectively as a single iNIRS channel. So, the processed signals from each pixel are spatially averaged to reduce the overall integration time. Moreover, interferometric detection provides us with the unique capability of accessing complex information (amplitude and phase) about the light remitted from the sample, which with more than 8000 parallel channels, enabled us to sense the cerebral blood flow with only a 10 msec integration time (∼100x faster than conventional iNIRS). In this report, we have described the theoretical foundations and possible ways to implement πNIRS. Then, we developed a prototype continuous wave (CW) πNIRS system and validated it in liquid phantoms. We used our CW πNIRS to monitor the pulsatile blood flow in a human forearm in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that CW πNIRS could monitor activation of the prefrontal cortex by recording the change in blood flow in the forehead of the subject while he was reading an unknown text."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebee4f2752340254fc447c1","5e7092c3878c28a04739c372"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

To mitigate this detrimental feature, researchers tend to use a broader spectrum and lower intensity of illumination, which can decrease the quality of holographic imaging due to lower resolution and higher noise. We study the lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) ability to operate in the low photon budget (LPB) regime to enable imaging of unimpaired live cells with minimized sample interaction. Low-cost off-the-shelf components are used, promoting the usability of such a straightforward approach. We show that recording data in the LPB regime (down to 7 µW of illumination power) does not limit the contrast or resolution of the hologram phase and amplitude reconstruction compared to regular illumination. The LPB generates hardware camera shot noise, however, to be effectively minimized via numerical denoising. The ability to obtain high-quality, high-resolution\r\noptical complex field reconstruction was confirmed using the USAF 1951 amplitude sample, phase resolution test target, and finally, live glial restricted progenitor cells (as a challenging strongly absorbing and scattering biomedical sample). The proposed approach based on severely limiting the photon budget in lensless holographic microscopy method can open new avenues in high-throughout (optimal resolution, large field-of-view, and high signal-to-noise-ratio singlehologram reconstruction) cell culture imaging with minimized sample interaction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942e878c28a0473b7b7c","5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b45","616a392975234017e0545979","6348c9aa7523402e34121e31","602cd62c9543c7410626e424"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

It made everyone realize how important it is to secure blood supplies to health-care units in the event of an armed conflict. This paper presents the principles of functioning of the Military Blood Donation Service and the Military Center for Blood Donation and Hemotherapy in Poland.\nMethods: The study used data collected in the “Military Blood Bank” information processing system and data from annual reports (2010– 2021) sent to the Minister of Health of the Republic of Poland. The reports concerned, among others: demographic data on donors, reasons of permanent disqualifications, numbers of complete and incomplete donations, etc.\nResults: Since 2005, the number of donors registered in military blood donation centers ranged between 15 and 35 thousand/year. The most dramatic declines in donors were observed in 2010 and 2020. Successful donations accounted for more than 98% of all donations/year (except 2015), and their number varied between 20 and 32 thousand/year. Among the blood donors, men always predominated and the dominant age group (except for 2010) was 25– 44 years. The reasons for permanent disqualification have varied over time: their proportions decreased for viral hepatitis and cardiovascular disease, and increased for respiratory and endocrine/metabolic diseases. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020/2021, these proportions have sometimes been reversed.\nDiscussion: The Military Blood Donation Service has been functioning in Poland for several decades. It is specialized in supplying blood and blood products to the Armed Forces. Unfortunately, it was not possible to refer to the functioning of similar institutions in other countries. Therefore, when evaluating the functioning of Polish military blood donation, we had to rely on numerical values (eg, number of donors/year, donor profile, etc.), which prove a very good organization of blood donation centers. However, it should be noted that, as in other countries, a more active promotion of blood donation in the media is advisable in order to encourage as many young people as possible to donate blood."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Early stages of DN are associated with hyperinsulinemia and progressive insulin resistance in insulin-sensitive cells, including podocytes. The diabetic environment induces pathological changes, especially in podocyte bioenergetics, which is tightly linked with mitochondrial dynamics. The regulatory role of insulin in mitochondrial morphology in podocytes has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the main goal of the present study was to investigate effects of insulin on the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in human podocytes. Biochemical analyses were performed to assess oxidative phosphorylation efficiency by measuring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and glycolysis by measuring the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). mRNA and protein expression were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The intracellular mitochondrial network was visualized by MitoTracker staining. All calculations were conducted using CellProfiler software. Short-term insulin exposure exerted inhibitory effects on various parameters of oxidative respiration and adenosine triphosphate production, and glycolysis flux was elevated. After a longer time of treating cells with insulin, an increase in mitochondrial size was observed, accompanied by a reduction of expression of the mitochondrial fission markers DRP1 and FIS1 and an increase in mitophagy.

The clinical burden of bleeding-related hospitalizations is mainly driven by relatively rare but severe and life-threatening ICH and less morbid gastrointestinal bleeding and genitourinary bleeding. ICH related to treatment with oral anticoagulants resulted in the highest in-hospital mortality rates of 29% in nontraumatic and 12% in traumatic cases [2].

The Role of the cGAS–STING Signalling Pathway","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The prevalence of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related disorders continues to grow worldwide. Increasing evidence links intracellular inclusions of misfolded alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates, so-called Lewy bodies (LB) and Lewy neuritis, to the progressive pathology of PD and other synucleinopathies. Our previous findings established that α-syn oligomers induce S-nitrosylation and deregulation of the E3-ubiquitin ligase Parkin, leading to mitochondrial disturbances in neuronal cells. The accumulation of damaged mitochondria as a consequence, together with the release of mitochondrial-derived damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs) could activate the innate immune response and induce neuroinflammation (“mito-inflammation”), eventually accelerating neurodegeneration. However, the molecular pathways that transmit pro-inflammatory signals from damaged mitochondria are not well understood. One of the proposed pathways could be the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) – stimulator of interferon genes (STING) (cGAS–STING) pathway, which plays a pivotal role in modulating the innate immune response. It has recently been suggested that cGAS–STING deregulation may contribute to the development of various pathological conditions. Especially, its excessive engagement may lead to neuroinflammation and appear to be essential for the development of neurodegenerative brain diseases, including PD. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying cGAS–STING pathway activation in PD and other synucleinopathies are not fully understood. This review focuses on linking mitochondrial dysfunction to neuroinflammation in these disorders, particularly emphasizing the role of the cGAS–STING signaling. We propose the cGAS–STING pathway as a critical driver of inflammation in α-syn-dependent neurodegeneration and hypothesize that cGAS–STING–driven “mito-inflammation” may be one of the key mechanisms promoting the neurodegeneration in PD. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of α-syn–induced cGAS–STING–associated “mito-inflammation” in PD and related synucleinopathies may contribute to the identification of new targets for the treatment of these disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

It has been proposed to define such a phenomenon as the reward deficit syndrome (RDS). Dopaminergic projections of the reward system receive glutaminergic projections from cortex. Research indicates that a reduction in the stimulating glutamatergic transmission on the dopaminergic system could represent an alternative phenotype of RDS. Potential source of this type of abnormality is glutamate reuptake which depends on excitatory amino acid transport proteins (EAAT) function. The most important of them is EAAT2, polymorphisms of which have been linked to several mental disorders.\nMethods:\nWe analyzed the genetic and psychometric data of 125 young adults (n = 125) for the effect of the rs4354668 polymorphism of the SLC1A2 gene for EAAT2 on the risky or harmful drug use (RHDU). After exploratory analysis we used logistic regression models to assess the probability of RHDU in individual groups.\nResults:\nIn the final model T/T variant of rs4354668 was significantly associated with a lower probability of RHDU occurrence compared to G/G variant (OR: 0.021; 95% CI: 0.001 - 0.275; p = 0.009). Other significant predictors of RHDU were smoking status and risky or harmful drinking of alcohol.\nConclusions:\nThe results obtained may indicate a possible relationship of the risk of harmful drug use with variants of the rs4354668 polymorphism of the SLC1A2 gene for EAAT2. Subjects with the T/T variant of this polymorphism appear to be less at risk of developing drug use disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, the quality of DIHM reconstructions is compromised by twin-image noise, posing a significant challenge. Conventional methods for mitigating this noise involve complex hardware setups or time-consuming algorithms with often limited effectiveness. In this work, we propose UTIRnet, a deep learning solution for fast, robust, and universally applicable twin-image suppression, trained exclusively on numerically generated datasets. The availability of open-source UTIRnet codes facilitates its implementation in various DIHM systems without the need for extensive experimental training data. Notably, our network ensures the consistency of reconstruction results with input holograms, imparting a physics-based foundation and enhancing reliability compared to conventional deep learning approaches.

This contribution introduces a multiplexed lensless digital holographic microscopy system (MLS), enabling synchronous, label-free, quantitative observation of multiple live cell cultures with single-cell precision. The innovation of this setup lies in its ability to robustly compare the behaviour, i.e., migratory pathways, of cells cultured or contained in different ways (with varied stimuli applied), making it a valuable tool for dynamic biomedical diagnostics on a cellular level. The system's design allows for potential expansion to accommodate as many samples as needed, thus broadening its application scope in future quantitative diagnostics on global multi-culture cellular behaviours via their localized single-cell spatiotemporal optical signatures.

applied as a first-line therapy for lymphoma leads to a relapse in approximately 40% of the patients. Therefore, novel approaches to treat aggressive lymphomas are being intensively investigated. Several RTX-resistant (RR) cell lines have been established as surrogate models to study resistance to R-CHOP. Our study reveals that RR cells are characterized by a major downregulation of CD37, a molecule currently explored as a target for immunotherapy. Using CD20 knockout (KO) cell lines, we demonstrate that CD20 and CD37 form a complex, and hypothesize that the presence of CD20 stabilizes CD37 in the cell membrane. Consequently, we observe a diminished cytotoxicity of anti-CD37 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in complement-dependent cytotoxicity in both RR and CD20 KO cells that can be partially restored upon lysosome inhibition. On the other hand, the internalization rate of anti-CD37 mAb in CD20 KO cells is increased when compared to controls, suggesting unhampered efficacy of antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). Importantly, even a major downregulation in CD37 levels does not hamper the efficacy of CD37-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. In summary, we present here a novel mechanism of CD37 regulation with further implications for the use of anti-CD37 immunotherapies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The title of a neuropsychologist is obtained through a four-year specialist training in clinical psychology, culminating in a state examination. Neuropsychological diagnosis is functional in nature, and describes the type of cognitive dysfunctions present, their degree of severity, and possible aetiology. Neuropsychological examination is conducted when cognitive deficits are elusive in the screening, or the results of other tests have not clarified the diagnostic hypotheses. In addition to assessing the patient’s cognitive state, neuropsychological diagnosis allows for predicting the further course of dysfunction, setting directions for rehabilitation, and estimating the possibility of returning to professional or school duties. In addition, psychoeducational interventions provide guidance for the family and caregivers on how to deal with the patient. Neuropsychological assessment also describes the interaction between socio-emotional and environmental factors that determine appropriate treatment or subsequent care. This is possible due to an extensive diagnostic process, which, in addition to clinical-experimental methods (clinical trials) and standardised measurement techniques (depending on the patient’s needs and condition), also includes the analysis of available documentation, a clinical interview, and the formulation and communication of feedback.

Pathogenesis of HE is linked to damage triggered by blood-derived toxins, with ammonia being the main causative factor. Neuroglial cells, especially astrocytes and microglia, respond to HE-associated systemic and central signals and undergo complex and variable changes in their metabolism, morphology, and function, which include ion and water dyshomeostasis in conjunction with neurotransmission imbalance and neuroinflammation. HE-induced alterations of astrocytes are defined as astrocytopathy, with aberrant astrocytes resulting in either gain or loss of functions. In the chronic HE, the presence of Alzheimer type II cells is a histologic hallmark, with asthenic astrocytes emerging as a newcomer. In acute HE, rapid swelling of astrocytes is a primary cause of cerebral edema and mortality. This chapter reviews the dominant role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of HE resulting from acute and chronic liver failure, mainly in experimental models. The focus is on the loss of homeostatic function bearing upon the functioning of the glymphatic system, aberrant neurotransmission as a consequence of astrocyte-neuron miscommunication, and the concordant neuroinflammatory response of astrocytes and microglia. The chapter concludes with a delineation of concepts for future research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In some cases, cells can be produced individually, one batch at a time, for personalized therapy. Therefore, it is very important to optimize both culture conditions and medium composition under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards. MSCs properties have been exploited as potential cell therapies in regenerative medicine. The main mechanism of their protective and regenerative effect is based on their secretory activity. Simultaneously, their secretome is highly variable and sensitive to any change in environmental conditions. Depending on the type of damage and the target application, it is desirable to enhance the secretion of therapeutic factors. Changes in the modulation of environmental conditions can affect survival, migration ability, and both proliferative and clonogenic potentials.\nMaterials and Methods: This study cultured Wharton’s jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs) in media with varying concentrations of human platelet lysate (hPL). Two groups were created: one with low hPL concentration and another with a high hPL concentration. The effects of these different hPL concentrations were analyzed by assessing mesenchymal phenotype retention, secretory activity, clonogenic potential, proliferation, and migration capabilities. Additionally, the secretion levels of key therapeutic factors, such as Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), and Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL-2), were measured.\nResults: WJ-MSCs maintained their mesenchymal phenotype regardless of hPL concentration. However, a higher concentration of hPL promoted cell clonogenic potential, proliferation, migration, and increased secretion of therapeutic factors.\nConclusion: Adjusting the hPL concentration in the culture medium modulates the response of WJ MSCs and enhances their therapeutic potential. Higher hPL concentration promotes increased secretory activity and improves the regenerative capacity of WJ-MSCs, suggesting a promising strategy to optimize MSC-based therapies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The first is long ‘22-kHz’ vocalizations (>300 ms, <32-kHz) with constant frequency, signaling aversive states, and the second is short ‘50-kHz’ calls (<150 ms, >32 kHz), often frequency-modulated, in appetitive situations. Here, we describe aversive vocalizations emitted at a higher pitch by male Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) in an intensified aversive state – prolonged fear conditioning. These calls, which we named ‘44-kHz’ vocalizations, are long (>150 ms), generally at a constant frequency (usually within 35–50-kHz range) and have an overall spectrographic image similar to 22-kHz calls. Some 44-kHz vocalizations are comprised of both 22-kHz-like and 44-kHz-like elements. Furthermore, two separate clustering methods confirmed that these 44-kHz calls can be separated from other vocalizations. We observed 44-kHz calls to be associated with freezing behavior during fear conditioning training, during which they constituted up to 19.4% of all calls and most of them appeared next to each other forming uniform groups of vocalizations (bouts). We also show that some of rats’ responses to the playback of 44-kHz calls were more akin to that of aversive calls, for example, heart rate changes, whereas other responses were at an intermediate level between aversive and appetitive calls. Our results suggest that rats have a wider vocal repertoire than previously believed, and current definitions of major call types may require reevaluation.

Viral myocarditis may completely resolve leaving no traceable sign or cause ongoing inflammation with subsequent development of hypokinetic dilated/non-dilated cardiomyopathy. The exact epidemiology of viral myocarditis remains unknown due to its sometimes asymptomatic course, but according to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019, the prevalence of myocarditis in young adults is estimated to range between 6.1 per 100,000 in men and 4.4 per 100,000 in women, with the most common viral etiology. According to the literature viral genome can be found in considerable percentage (up to 67,4%) of endomyocardial biopsy specimens obtained from patients with idiopathic left ventricular dysfunction- suggesting viral etiology of the cardiomyopathy. In this review we would like to enlighten most common types of arrhythmias and conduction disorders as well as their prevalence in patients with viral heart disease. Moreover, our paper depicts probable pathological mechanisms in which viruses induce arrhythmias and cardiac conduction system disease in both, acute viral infection and chronic viral disease. We would also like to highlight unresolved problem of sudden death protection in the course of acute myocarditis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","uid":"bXACR4AS_DViRybrT_ocXzA","uuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","name":"Państwowy Instytut Medyczny Ministerstwa Spraw Wewnętrznych i Administracji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef34"],"parentId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","parentUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","rootId":"642e199340e3ff13873d0211","rootUuid":"5a3fe743-4816-4673-b295-62be7114a55a","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Tryptamine is generated through the decarboxylation of tryptophan by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) in the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS), endocrine system, and gut bacteria. Organ-specific metabolism of tryptamine, which is mediated by different MAO isoforms, causes this trace amine to have different pharmacokinetics between the brain and periphery. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by MAO can influence miRNA-CYP enzyme regulatory network and affect mitochondrial function. Tryptamine regulates AHR function by acting as an endogenous ligand for AHR, initiating AHR activation and inhibiting the expression of the CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 genes. The dysregulation of AHR signalling, triggered by endogenous tryptamine binding, can disrupt the regulation of prolactin levels. Depending on the tryptamine concentration and context, tryptamine can be beneficial or harmful. By acting as an agonist of inhibitory serotonin receptors and trace-amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and an antagonist of excitatory serotonin receptors, it can engage in diverse physiological interactions with serotonin. Increased tryptamine production is observed under hypoxic conditions and is associated with hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) activation, leading to AHR activation. Dysregulation of the association between tryptamine levels, AHR signalling pathway activation, and MAO activity are observed in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Evidence suggests that changes in TET expression may impact cell function and the phenotype of aging. Proliferation, apoptosis, markers of autophagy and double-strand DNA break repair, and the expression of Fibulin 5 were assessed by flow cytometry in TET1 and TET2-overexpressing fibroblasts isolated from sun-unexposed skin of young (23–35 years) and age-advanced (75–94 years) individuals. In cells derived from young individuals, TET1 overexpression resulted in the inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis by 37% (p = 0.03) and 24% (p = 0.05), respectively, while the overexpression of TET2 caused a decrease in proliferation by 46% (p = 0.01). Notably, in cells obtained from age-advanced individuals, TETs exhibited different effects. Specifically, TET1 inhibited proliferation and expression of autophagy marker Beclin 1 by 45% (p = 0.05) and 28% (p = 0.048), respectively, while increasing the level of γH2AX, a marker of double-strand DNA breaks necessary for initiating the repair process, by 19% (p = 0.04). TET2 inhibited proliferation by 64% (p = 0.053) and increased the level of γH2AX and Fibulin 5 by 46% (p = 0.007) and 29% (p = 0.04), respectively. These patterns of TET1 and TET2 effects suggest their involvement in regulating various fibroblast functions and that some of their biological actions depend on the donor’s age."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The aim of the study was to characterize correlates of polypharmacy in the PolSenior project. The PolSenior project, was a comprehensive survey in a large and longitudinal representative sample of thePolish older population. The project was conducted by the International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Warsaw between 2008 and 2011. All medications consumed during the week preceding the survey were evaluated for each participant (n = 4793, including 2314 females (48.3%)). Thereafter, the percentage of those with polypharmacy (at least 5 medications) and excessive polypharmacy (at least 10 medications) was calculated, and their correlates were determined. The average number of medications used by participants was 5.1 ± 3.6, and was higher in females than in males (5.5 ± 3.5 vs. 4.8 ± 3.5; p < 0.001). Polypharmacy characterized 2650 participants (55.3%) and excessive polypharmacy—532 of them (11.1%). The independent correlates associated withpolypharmacy were: age over 70 years, female sex, higher than primary education, living in an urban area, comorbidities, any hospitalization during past five years, and visiting general practicioners at least yearly. As for correlates with excessive polypharmacy, they were: age 80–84 years, female sex, living in an urban area, diagnosis of at least four chronic diseases, and at least two hospitalizations in the last five years. This study serves as a starting place to understand patient characteristics associated with polypharmacy, excessive polypharmacy, and identify targeted interventions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

of reorganized versus unaltered cardiology departments during the COVID-19 era: a subanalysis of the COV-HF-SIRIO 6 study.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, numerous cardiology departments were reorganized to provide care for COVID-19 patients. We aimed to compare the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality in reorganized vs. unaltered cardiology departments. Methods: The present research is a subanalysis of a multicenter retrospective COV-HF-SIRIO 6 study that includes all patients (n = 101,433) hospitalized in 24 cardiology departments in Poland between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020, with a focus on patients with acute heart failure (AHF). Results: Reduction of all-cause hospitalizations was 50.6% vs. 21.3% for reorganized vs. unaltered cardiology departments in 2020 vs. 2019, respectively (p < 0.0001). Considering AHF alone respective reductions by 46.5% and 15.2% were registered (p < 0.0001). A higher percentage of patients was brought in by ambulance to reorganized vs. unaltered cardiology departments (51.7% vs. 34.6%; p < 0.0001) alongside with a lower rate of self-referrals (45.7% vs. 58.4%; p < 0.0001). The rate of all-cause in-hospital mortality in AHF patients was higher in reorganized than unaltered cardiology departments (10.9% vs. 6.4%; p < 0.0001). After the exclusion of patients with concomitant COVID-19, the mortality rates did not differ significantly (6.9% vs. 6.4%; p = 0.55). Conclusions: A greater reduction in hospital admissions in 2020 vs. 2019, higher rates of patients brought by ambulance together with lower rates of self-referrals and higher all-cause in-hospital mortality for AHF due to COVID-19 related deaths were observed in cardiology departments reorganized to provide care for COVID-19 patients vs. unaltered ones."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

study.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is surging across Poland, leading to many direct deaths and underestimated collateral damage. We aimed to compare the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality in larger vs. smaller cardiology departments (i.e., with ≥2000 vs. <2000 hospitalizations per year in 2019). Methods: We performed a subanalysis of the COV-HF-SIRIO 6 multicenter retrospective study including all patients hospitalized in 24 cardiology departments in Poland between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020, focusing on patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and COVID-19. Results: Total number of hospitalizations was reduced by 29.2% in larger cardiology departments and by 27.3% in smaller cardiology departments in 2020 vs. 2019. While hospitalizations for AHF were reduced by 21.8% and 25.1%, respectively. The length of hospital stay due to AHF in 2020 was 9.6 days in larger cardiology departments and 6.6 days in smaller departments (p <0.001). In-hospital mortality for AHF during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly higher in larger vs. smaller cardiology departments (10.7% vs. 3.2%; p <0.001). In-hospital mortality for concomitant AHF and COVID-19 was extremely high in larger and smaller cardiology departments accounting for 31.3% vs. 31.6%, respectively. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic longer hospitalizations and higher in-hospital mortality for AHF were observed in larger vs. smaller cardiology departments. Reduced hospital admissions and extremely high in-hospital mortality for concomitant AHF and COVID-19 were noted regardless of department size."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

COVID-19 account for up to 15% of all cases. The study aims to check if any gene variants related to cardiovascular (CVD) and pulmonary diseases (PD) are correlated with a severe outcome of COVID-19 in a Polish cohort of COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this study, a subset of 747 samples from unrelated individuals collected across Poland in 2020 and 2021 was used and whole-genome sequencing was performed. Results: The GWAS analysis of SNPs and short indels located in genes related to CVD identified one variant significant in COVID-19 severe outcome in the HADHA gene, while for the PD gene panel, we found two significant variants in the DRC1 gene. In this study, both potentially protective and risk variants were identified, of which variants in the HADHA gene deserve the most attention. Conclusions: This is the first study reporting the association between the HADHA and DRC1 genetic variants and COVID-19 severe outcome based on the cohort WGS analysis. Although all the identified variants are localised in introns, they may be correlated and therefore inherited along with other risk variants, potentially causative to severe outcome of COVID-19 but not discovered yet."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

clinical course and impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the rate of diagnosis and therapy in the complete Polish population of patients (pts) with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH-1134) and CTEPH (570 pts) treated within the National Health Fund program and reported in the national BNP-PL database. Updated records of 1704 BNP-PL pts collected between March and December 2020 were analyzed with regard to incidence, clinical course and mortality associated with COVID-19. Clinical characteristics of the infected pts and COVID-19 decedents were analyzed. The rates of new diagnoses and treatment intensification in this period were studied and collated to the proper intervals of the previous year. The incidence of COVID-19 was 3.8% (n = 65) (PAH, 4.1%; CTEPH, 3.2%). COVID-19-related mortality was 28% (18/65 pts). Those who died were substantially older and had a more advanced functional WHO class and more cardiovascular comorbidities (comorbidity score, 4.0 ± 2.1 vs. 2.7 ± 1.8; p = 0.01). During the pandemic, annualized new diagnoses of PH diminished by 25–30% as compared to 2019. A relevant increase in total mortality was also observed among the PH pts (9.7% vs. 5.9% pre-pandemic, p = 0.006), whereas escalation of specific PAH/CTEPH therapies occurred less frequently (14.7% vs. 21.6% pre-pandemic). The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the diagnosis and treatment of PH by decreasing the number of new diagnoses, escalating therapy and enhancing overall mortality. Pulmonary hypertension is a risk factor for worsened course of COVID-19 and elevated mortality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the landscape of medical care delivery worldwide. We aimed to assess the influence of COVID-19 pandemic on hospital admissions and in-hospital mortality rate in patients with acute heart failure (AHF) in a retrospective, multicentre study.\nMethods and results\nFrom 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2020, a total of 101 433 patients were hospitalized in 24 Cardiology Departments in Poland. The number of patients admitted due to AHF decreased by 23.4% from 9853 in 2019 to 7546 in 2020 (P < 0.001). We noted a significant reduction of self-referrals in the times of COVID-19 pandemic accounting 27.8% (P < 0.001), with increased number of AHF patients brought by an ambulance by 15.9% (P < 0.001). The length of hospital stay was overall similar (7.7 ± 2.8 vs. 8.2 ± 3.7 days; P = not significant). The in-hospital all-cause mortality in AHF patients was 444 (5.2%) in 2019 vs. 406 (6.5%) in 2020 (P < 0.001). A total number of AHF patients with concomitant COVID-19 was 239 (3.2% of AHF patients hospitalized in 2020). The rate of in-hospital deaths in AHF patients with COVID-19 was extremely high accounting 31.4%, reaching up to 44.1% in the peak of the pandemic in November 2020.\nConclusions\nOur study indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic led to (i) reduced hospital admissions for AHF; (ii) decreased number of self-referred AHF patients and increased number of AHF patients brought by an ambulance; and (iii) increased in-hospital mortality for AHF with very high mortality rate for concomitant AHF and COVID-19."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

high. One of the underlying reasons is that recommended guidelines for the management of HF are still too rarely followed in daily practice. Disease exacerbation requiring inpatient treatment is always a factor that worsens the prognosis, and thus signals disease progression. This is also a key moment when therapy should be modified for HF exacerbation, or initiated in the case of newly diagnosed disease. Inpatient treatment and the peri‑discharge period is the time when the aetiology and mechanism of HF decompensation should be established. Therapy should be individualised based on aetiology, HF phenotype, and comorbidities; it should take into account the possibilities of modern treatment. According to the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), patients with HF should receive multidisciplinary management. Cooperation between the various members of the multidisciplinary team taking care of patients with HF improves the efficiency and quality of treatment. This document expands and details the information on the peri‑discharge management of HF contained in the 2021 ESC guidelines and the 2022 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) guidelines."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, data regarding the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the prognosis of patients with IPAH remain scarce. The aim of our study was to determine that impact using data from a national multicentre prospective pulmonary hypertension registry.\nMethods\nWe analysed data of adult patients with IPAH from the Database of Pulmonary Hypertension in the Polish population (BNP‑PL) between March 1, 2018 and August 31, 2020. Upon admission, clinical, echocardiographic, and haemodynamic data were collected at 21 Polish IPAH reference centres. The all-cause mortality was assessed during a 30-month follow-up period. To adjust for differences in age, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidities between patients with and without DM, a 2-group propensity score matching was performed using a 1:1 pairing algorithm.\nResults\nA total of 532 patients with IPAH were included in the study and 25.6% were diagnosed with DM. Further matched analysis was performed in 136 patients with DM and 136 without DM. DM was associated with older age, higher BMI, more advanced exertional dyspnea, increased levels of N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide, larger right atrial area, increased mean right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and all-cause mortality compared with no DM.\nConclusions\nPatients with IPAH and DM present with more advanced pulmonary vascular disease and worse survival than counterparts without DM independently of age, BMI, and cardiovascular comorbidities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

SNHG6 is expressed mainly in the cell cytoplasm, where it acts as a regulator of numerous processes: modulation of crucial protein hubs; sponging miRNAs and upregulating the expression of their target mRNAs; and interacting with various cellular pathways including TGF-β/Smad and Wnt/β-catenin. SNHG6 is an oncogene, substantially overexpressed in CRC tissues and cancerous cell lines as compared to healthy samples. Its overexpression is associated with higher grade, lymphovascular invasion and tumor size.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the role of SNHG6 in the colorectal tumorigenesis, invasion and metastasis, we summarized its role in CRC and conclude that it could serve as a potential biomarker in CRC diagnosis and prognosis assessment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We demonstrated that Ang II-treated db/db mice exhibited significantly increased fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and local edema compared with untreated db/db mice; however, the cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was similar to that in Ang II-treated control mice. The decreased density of the LyVs and their wall shape alterations, with disorganized anchoring filaments, widened junctional gaps, decreased numbers of cytoplasmic vesicles indicative of a leaky phenotype, and increased basement membrane (BM) thickness, were observed in Ang II-treated db/db mice compared with Ang II-treated controls. Our findings revealed a structural basis for intensive LyV remodeling in association with cardiac remodeling in obesity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923a878c28a0473920f3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

treatment in the last decade. Both natural killer (NK) cells and T cells are key components of host immunity against malignant cells that are being extensively investigated in the field of cancer immunotherapy. While approaches have been developed to improve the antitumor activity of NK and T cells, the tumor microenvironment remains an obstacle to effective NK and T cell-based therapies. Here, we demonstrated that cancer-conditioned medium suppresses the antitumor activity of NK cells. Ammonia, a by-product of cancer cell metabolism, accumulated in cancer-conditioned medium and in the tumor microenvironment, and impaired the cytotoxicity of NK cells as well as the efficacy of antibody-based and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK and CAR-T cell-based therapies in vitro. Ammonia induced NK and T cell dysfunction by decreasing the amount of mature perforin in secretory lysosomes, which was dependent on its lysosomotropic features and ability to increase pH in acidic compartments. These findings demonstrate that, in addition to its previously described role in promoting tumor growth as a source of nitrogen for tumor biomass, ammonia promotes tumor immune escape by inhibiting both NK and CAR-T cell cytotoxicity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

as well as by screening donors.3, 4 Here, we present a case of a 9-year-old girl diagnosed with congenital cerebellar hypoplasia and familial encephalopathy of unknown etiology. For this reason, her sample was subjected to whole exome sequencing (WES). A similar course of the disease was observed in her elder brother. During the orthopedic surgery, the patient was transfused with one unit of O RhD RBCs. Antibody screening before transfusion was negative. The patient required the second orthopedic surgery due to dislocation of both hip joints. Pre-transfusion antibody screening was positive with all panel RBCs, except the patient's own."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 1 (NFE2L1) has emerged as a key regulator of proteostasis, integrating proteasome function, autophagy, and ferroptosis to counteract oxidative stress and protein misfolding. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of NFE2L1 in maintaining neuronal homeostasis, focusing on its mechanisms for mitigating proteotoxic stress and supporting cellular health, offering protection against neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we discuss the pathological implications of NFE2L1 dysfunction and explore its potential as a therapeutic target. By highlighting gaps in the current understanding and presenting future research directions, this review aims to elucidate NFE2L1’s role in advancing treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients with Mixed-Lineage Leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements (MLLr BCP-ALL) is still extremely poor. Inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 with venetoclax emerged as a promising strategy for this subtype of BCP-ALL, however, lack of sufficient responses in preclinical models and the possibility of developing resistance exclude using venetoclax as monotherapy. Herein, we aimed to uncover potential mechanisms responsible for limited venetoclax activity in MLLr BCP-ALL and to identify drugs that could be used in combination therapy. Using RNA-seq, we observed that long-term exposure to venetoclax in vivo in a patient-derived xenograft model leads to downregulation of several tumor protein 53 (TP53)-related genes. Interestingly, auranofin, a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, sensitized MLLr BCP-ALL to venetoclax in various in vitro and in vivo models, independently of the p53 pathway functionality. Synergistic activity of these drugs resulted from auranofin-mediated upregulation of NOXA pro-apoptotic protein and potent induction of apoptotic cell death. More specifically, we observed that auranofin orchestrates upregulation of the NOXA-encoding gene Phorbol-12-Myristate-13-Acetate-Induced Protein 1 (PMAIP1) associated with chromatin remodeling and increased transcriptional accessibility. Altogether, these results present an efficacious drug combination that could be considered for the treatment of MLLr BCP-ALL patients, including those with TP53 mutations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In the pathophysiology of acute brain injury, secondary injury with hyperactivation of glia plays a crucial role. Activated glial cells induce prolonged inflammation that impacts the recovery and further cognitive functions of patients. In our study, we have examined the neuroprotective impact of exogenous neuropeptides—Cerebrolysin on astrocytes under different conditions. In a model that simulates central nervous system damage associated with brain injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage, the U87MG human brain cancer (glioblastoma astrocytoma like) cells were treated with Cerebrolysin and exposed to conditions of continuous and cyclic hypoxia and red blood cell lysate overload. The activity and expression of cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2 and on cytokines (IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10) and chemokines (CCL5/RANTES, CXCL9/MIG, CCL2/MCP-1, and CXCL10/IP-10) concentration were assessed. Cerebrolysin lowers IL-1β and IL-6 and increases IL-10 under all conditions. Cerebrolysin may exhibit a neuroimmunotrophic function, reducing inflammation under conditions that replicate traumatic brain injury and hemorrhagic insults to the central nervous system. By modulating both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, Cerebrolysin can help create a more balanced immune response conducive to tissue repair and reduced secondary damage. Its ability to lower harmful mediators like IL-1β and IL-6 while enhancing protective factors such as IL-10 suggests a promising therapeutic strategy in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Alongside other mechanisms such as neurotrophic factor enhancement and glial cell regulation, this cytokine modulation underscores the therapeutic potential of Cerebrolysin in a variety of central nervous system disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f903","uid":"bDRV4MaxR-ZX3JsID2JoVuw","uuid":"6d62a94f-547c-43bd-8416-8fbcb223b250","name":"Instytut Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a7878c28a047399fb3","5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b68"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

One of the key pathogenic factors in hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury is the inflammatory reaction including complement system activation. Over-activated complement stimulates cells to release inflammatory molecules and is involved in the post-ischemic degradation of synaptic connections. On the other hand, complement is also involved in regenerative processes. The histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)-sodium butyrate (SB)-provides reduction of inflammation by decreasing the expression of the proinflammatory factors. The main purpose of this study was to examine the effect of SB treatment on complement activation and synapse elimination after HI. Neonatal HI was induced in Wistar rats pups by unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery followed by 60-min hypoxia (7.6% O2). SB (300 mg/kg) was administered on a 5-day regimen. Our study has shown decreased levels of synapsin I, synaptophysin, and PSD-95 in the hypoxic-ischemic hemisphere, indicating synaptic loss after neonatal HI. Transmission electron microscopy revealed injury of the synaptic structures in the brain after HI. SB treatment increased the level of the synaptic proteins, improved tissue ultrastructure, and reduced degradation of the synapses. Neonatal HI induced mRNA expression of the complement C1q, C3, C5, and C9, and their receptors C3aR and C5aR. The effect of SB was different depending on the time after induction of hypoxic-ischemic damage. Our study demonstrated that neuroprotective effect of SB may be related to the modulation of complement activity after HI brain injury."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

For the sixteen derivatives, we established minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) using isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that were resistant or susceptible to other antibiotics. For the most potent compound 1‐cyclopropyl‐6‐fluoro‐7‐{4‐[6‐((1R,2S,5R)‐2‐isopropyl‐5‐methylcyclohexyloxy)‐6‐oxohexyl]piperazin‐1‐yl}‐4‐oxo‐1,4‐dihydroquinoline‐3‐carboxylic acid (6), we determined fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) values to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects with other reference drugs. In addition, chromatographic studies of all the derivatives demonstrated a significant three to four-fold increase in lipophilicity and affinity to phospholipids compared to Ciprofloxacin. Finally, we conducted structure-based studies of the investigated compounds using molecular docking and taking into account protein target mutations associated with fluoroquinolone resistance. In summary, our findings indicate that the investigated compounds possess tuberculostatic properties, with some showing similar or even better activity against resistant strains compared to reference drugs. Increased lipophilicity and affinity to phospholipids of the new derivatives can offer several advantages for new drug candidates, beyond just improved cell membrane penetration. However, further studies are needed to fully understand their safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

is linked to over 200 diseases and injuries. It is also classified as a risk factor for several types of neoplasms as well as infectious diseases (i.e., HIV and tuberculosis). In 2019, among people aged 25 to 49, alcohol use was the leading risk factor for attributable burden of disease. There are many factors that affect alcohol drinking patterns such as social and economic status, social norms, cultural customs, availability of alcohol, etc. Stress also plays a significant role in the process of developing alcohol addiction. The aim of our study was to examine health patterns and stress levels among patients undergoing alcohol addiction treatment. The study sample consisted of 104 patients who were treated in a hospital ward due to alcohol dependence. Three standardized questionnaire tools were used to measure the sense of coherence and the level of stress among those patients. The main results suggest that the level of perceived stress correlated negatively with all dimensions of sense of coherence and all indicators of health behaviors, however, age was positively correlated with positive mental attitude, proper eating habits, and health behaviors. In conclusion, it is worth noting that developing patterns for positive health behaviors will make it possible to avoid alcohol dependence or reinforce the treatment results if alcohol dependence syndrome occurs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Here we propose an oligogenic risk score of TDs using whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from a group of Polish GTS patients, their families, and control samples (n = 278). In this study, we first reviewed the literature to obtain a preliminary list of 84 GTS/TD candidate genes. From this list, 10 final risk score genes were selected based on single-gene burden tests (SKAT p < 0.05) between unrelated GTS cases (n = 37) and synthetic control samples based on a database of local allele frequencies. These 10 genes were CHADL, DRD2, MAOA, PCDH10, HTR2A, SLITRK5, SORCS3, KCNQ5, CDH9, and CHD8. Variants in and in the vicinity (± 20 kbp) of the ten risk genes (n = 7654) with a median minor allele frequency in the non-Finnish European population of 0.02 were integrated into an additive classifier. This risk score was then applied to healthy and GTS-affected individuals from 23 families and 100 unrelated healthy samples from the Polish population (AUC-ROC = 0.62, p = 0.02). Application of the algorithm to a group of patients with other tic disorders revealed a continuous increase of the oligogenic score with healthy individuals with the lowest mean, then patients with other tic disorders, then GTS patients, and finally with severe GTS cases with the highest oligogenic score. We have further compared our WGS results with the summary statistics of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study (PGC GWAS) of TDs and found no signal overlap except for the CHADL gene locus. Polygenic risk scores from common variants of GTS GWAS show no difference between patient and control groups, except for the comparison between patients with non-GTS TDs and patients with severe GTS.

However, the complexity of blood components makes the selective measurement of analytes highly challenging, as these media contain various cells, proteins, saccharides, and lipids that interact with sensor surfaces in different ways. This review highlights the challenges and advances in biosensing within blood-derived media, with a focus on overcoming nonspecific interactions that interfere with selective measurements. We specifically address protein detection, as proteins are key indicators of disease presence, progression, and treatment response. First, we discuss blood’s composition and its interaction with sensor surfaces. Established protein detection methods like ELISA, western blot, and mass spectrometry are reviewed alongside strategies for enhancing selectivity and reducing nonspecific binding. We also explore label-free biosensors, which enable miniaturized, real-time monitoring but are vulnerable to interference. Finally, we discussed future directions, emphasizing improved real-time diagnostics in clinical settings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This study aimed to investigate how hyperammonemia affects brain endothelial cells senescence and selected within in silico analysis micro RNA-183-5p in this process.\nResults: Reduction in cerebrovascular density in hyperammonemia-induced rats, similar to that seen in 12-month-old rats, using von Willebrand factor staining, was observed. MicroRNA (miRNA) profile analysis of the brain cortex and plasma identified miRNA-183-5p contributing to endothelial senescence. In vitro studies of ammonia-treated rat brain endothelial cell line 4 showed senescent features, including increased β-galactosidase activity, higher mRNA levels and fluorescence intensity of p16 and p21, and altered senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Additionally, the transfection of miRNA-183-5p mimic induced similar senescent characteristics in endothelial cells, whereas miRNA-183-5p mimic inhibition reversed some effects.\nInnovation: This study is the first to link hyperammonemia-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction with miRNA-183-5p, highlighting its role in promoting endothelial senescence. The findings suggest that miRNA-183-5p could be a target for therapeutic interventions, preventing ammonia-induced brain endothelial dysfunction.\nConclusion: Hyperammonemia promotes brain endothelial cells senescence through miRNA-183-5p, reducing cerebrovascular density. This may contribute to cerebral dysfunction seen in hyperammonemia-associated neurological disorders. Targeting miRNA-183-5p could offer a novel therapeutic strategy to mitigate endothelial dysfunction and preserve brain health in hyperammonemia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.
