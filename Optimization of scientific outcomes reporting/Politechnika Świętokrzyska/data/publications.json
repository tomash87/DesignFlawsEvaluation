We develop a receding horizon-based approach to contingency planning for the UAV fleet's mission. We considered the delivery of goods to spatially dispersed customers, over an assumed time horizon. In order to take into account forecasted weather changes that affect the energy consumption of UAVs and limit their range, we propose a set of reaction rules that can be encountered during delivery in a highly dynamic and unpredictable environment. These rules are used in the course of designing the contingency plans related to the need to implement an emergency return of the UAV to the base or handling of ad hoc ordered deliveries. Due to the nonlinearity of the environment's characteristics, both constraint programming and genetic algorithm paradigms have been implemented. Because of the NP-difficult nature of the considered planning problem, conditions have been developed that allow for the acceleration of calculations. The multiple computer experiments carried out allow for comparison representatives of the approximate and exact methods so as to judge which approach is faster for which size of the selected instance of the UAV mission planning problem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika

decision support model for handling customer orders in business chain","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the elements of the modern trade and services market is a business chain solution (chain store/retail chain). An example of a business chain is, e.g., a restaurant chain, where each restaurant in the chain has the same decor, organization, menu, and delivery method. Although such solutions have been known for decades, the rapid development of IT technology, the widespread access to the Internet as well as the development of mobile technologies have changed and modernized their formula. Many customers place orders remotely with the option of delivery to their door. This method of ordering and fulfilling orders is becoming more and more popular and ever more common in the recent period due to the pandemic and the resulting restrictions and limitations on the functioning of trade and services. The following key questions arise in relation to customer order processing for chain business managers: How to allocate individual customer orders to selected branches so that the cost of their processing (production and delivery) is the lowest?, How to deliver on time?, etc. To answer these questions, a decision support model has been developed, which combines routing, allocation and planning problems for restaurant/store chains. Two ways to implement the model have been proposed. The first one uses the methods of mathematical modeling and programming, and the other, which is a proprietary approach that integrates the mechanisms of evolution (specialized representations, repair mechanisms, genetic operators, etc.), uses constraint logic programming and dedicated heuristics. In addition, procedures for constraint handling and presolving have been developed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709253878c28a047393bc4","5e709253878c28a047393bd7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b2878c28a04739aeb9"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"482","pagesFromTo":"298-309","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709253878c28a047393bc4","5e709253878c28a047393bd7","5e7092b2878c28a04739aeb9","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae571"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fd0","mniswId":"14934","title":"Neurocomputing","issn":"0925-2312","documentHash":"9f09302b-6f9b-49d1-8578-a8f3aa5e2ea6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"623979e22467f009d3fe9844","year":"2022","volume":"482","documentHash":"300f876a-8dc2-40da-9821-cc26cdbf6b21"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Decision support","Business chain","Dedicated genetic algorithm","Constraint logic programming","Mathematical programming","Hybrid approach","Constraint handling procedure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059985543"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709435878c28a0473b8334","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wojnowska-Heciak","uuid":"50D005442FDB7FF43D62F585B7D83E0592B4D3C635D0EFF5F02609DB1EBF254ED9A8DA1DE8439CE02EACADD5258B56A3C26316B6127FA0C00693093EA397E50A","orcidId":"0000-0002-7043-9559","documentHash":"0eb28772-af6f-473f-ac13-3ccd34d699bd"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b5617","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kłak","uuid":"5A1D1B3AD1D463073E6671D3661B6F0BBCED969ABD4BD7ADEDCE12E3CA92552152E27AB188DF36695A3242198C9C6118D7BCAED576E0DA676EE75D0B59F8BACB","documentHash":"a8531238-7131-4948-b2e5-51413bcbc323"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b5609","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Heciak","uuid":"8EC97B5CDD0D780B801112DECA5888672687E9F96C6D9753E3A1CC60C9FC47FA9327D3FA30A02D3634984C701FF2BDB32D2177378F4349514A74C86165F31560","orcidId":"0000-0003-1489-882X","documentHash":"ed9fcdc0-e1ac-46cb-a6ee-8dff00a9b5d2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"648dee4c4097077564281d71","doi":"10.3390/ijerph19063183","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/6/3183","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Concrete Paving Slabs for Comfort of Movement of Mobility-Impaired Pedestrians—A Survey","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"People with locomotion difficulties encounter many barriers in a pedestrian environment. Pavement quality has been shown to substantially affect pedestrian satisfaction in general, and its optimal design may contribute to reducing the stigma put on people with impairments. Our research involved a survey assessing perception and attitudes towards pavement quality and characteristics for pedestrian comfort. The classic correlation of the variables based on contingency tables was used to analyse data and to test whether respondents’ perceptions depended on certain profile features. The completion of the statistical inference was the use of advanced algorithms of the correspondence analysis method. The relationships between the variables were assessed optionally using the chi2 test. The study results revealed desirable parameters and features of paving surfaces. People who use manual wheelchairs and declare limb loss prefer medium- and large-format concrete pavers with smooth finishing and no bevelling. People with skeletal abnormalities or peripheral neuropathy prefer concrete slabs and surfaces made of small- or medium-sized panels arranged in a regular pattern, made of smooth non-slip concrete with narrow joints. Further laboratory tests are necessary to investigate whether increased water permeability of pavements constructed on eco-friendly base layers can curb damage to the pavement surface and provide long-term durability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709435878c28a0473b8334","5e70940b878c28a0473b5609","5e70940c878c28a0473b5617"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1-17","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709435878c28a0473b8334","5e70940b878c28a0473b5609","5e70940c878c28a0473b5617"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["concrete paver","mobility-impaired people","pavement characteristics","pedestrian comfort"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059985766"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Ziubiński","uuid":"C02A2740D627BC1D18FEA40A7095B108D426736554B9E8C358A5B9EC008A40E7204A29447B05285123D2B0C865C55AF5CB07A339C6E143591B42252174826D42","orcidId":"0000-0003-4955-2095","documentHash":"124fa2bd-f37f-493b-9a39-baefd9beca51"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ae9","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jurecki","uuid":"CB52D03B369410C57F329E005514F4A94BC43959428B45315AC01EAE524292C0E06AC42CA965513AF7EE8DDCC787BC188E3E11F91A41A39071BE402C5224FA1E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0105-1283","documentHash":"b97d0db1-5e79-43e4-9539-e3ae10777384"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a047394345","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Stańczyk","uuid":"3CFCC3E235ED6BA1016B5C6178A71D36593B1DD124742F3C48A17CF5856AA724FB947C40CB2AC37548F69FDE60BB1DD0694BD22E56EFEFCBC714EEA8774DD9AE","documentHash":"899acfd8-aa70-40f7-9627-ba5aabe45eca"}],"objectId":"635793634097072c1f9ebbfc","doi":"10.3390/en15197073","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/19/7073","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Analysis of the Structure of Driver Maneuvers in Different Road Conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The safety of road users is one of the priority issues taken into account in both the operation and design of vehicles. The presented work is part of a study that aims to develop a method for parametric assessment of driver behavior. The driving style of a driver depends on their skills and psychophysical characteristics, the type and performance of the vehicle used by the driver, and the type of road. This method involves the continuous measurement of the longitudinal and lateral acceleration values of a vehicle body. The paper analyzes how the type of road influences the structure of the maneuvers undertaken by the driver. The paper formulates criteria for distinguishing basic maneuvers (acceleration, braking, and turning). The structure of maneuvers was analyzed for two parameters: the extreme value of acceleration occurring during the execution of a given maneuver and the frequency of maneuvers during the passage of a given route. The analysis presented in this paper confirms that the type of road has a significant influence on the structure of the maneuvers undertaken by the driver."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925a878c28a047394345","5e709261878c28a047394ae9"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b5878c28a047385c19","uid":"bzPZmmp8S2zN3FIBGmhP2-A","uuid":"2f4b58f0-ff22-4767-bf70-4a4950ffa081","name":"Instytut Pojazdów i Transportu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709261878c28a047394ae9","5e70925a878c28a047394345","5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["safety; driving exploitation condition; driving behavior; maneuvers; acceleration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059986111"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c308ce9543c72336543a89","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gruszczyński","uuid":"18DF8C78097F5D53A4897626420C60473A8A9950B8752142AFFD6C172F996DE535745507E3921AE23C82FD3002DB82B72099FF1D2F21F1723913F65A0EDC8F38","documentHash":"22bccc7d-cce8-4441-977b-5d5727d0c873"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ae9","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jurecki","uuid":"CB52D03B369410C57F329E005514F4A94BC43959428B45315AC01EAE524292C0E06AC42CA965513AF7EE8DDCC787BC188E3E11F91A41A39071BE402C5224FA1E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0105-1283","documentHash":"b97d0db1-5e79-43e4-9539-e3ae10777384"}],"objectId":"6758200ffdbe835dc1661e79","doi":"10.1515/eng-2022-0413","publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/eng-2022-0413/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Testing the way of driving a vehicle in real road conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Safety is one of the most important issues in all areas of human life.

The objectives of the research are to determine: (a) average temperatures on the duct surfaces; (b) air temperature distribution along the length of the duct; (c) local and average integral temperature values along the length of the duct; (d) local and average integral heat flow densities on the duct surfaces; (e) local and average integral heat exchange coefficients and Nusselt numbers on the duct surfaces; and (f) pressure distribution along the length and total pressure drop in the duct. The research method is based on conducting a mathematical numerical experiment in a stationary three-dimensional Cartesian formulation and physical modeling of processes on a prototype.

The proposed issue is appropriately under the protection of intellectual property for solving as described in patent no.B1 230665 PL in the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland. In the solution presented herein, de-icing is achieved mainly by electrodynamic force excitation and secondarily as a result of heating. Because ice is removed primarily through vibrations, it avoids a large consumption of electricity associated with the high specific heat of water. More importantly, operation is nearly simultaneously applied to the total distance of the trolley power grid between two substations. For this reason, it requires less electricity consumption and less time to apply than in heating, mechanical, or chemical methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709437878c28a0473b83d9","5e709253878c28a047393bee","5e709253878c28a047393bf1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"6832","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709253878c28a047393bf1","5e709253878c28a047393bee","5e709437878c28a0473b83d9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6322be824097073402f7af98","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"18","documentHash":"6e0792a6-4346-49b7-ab6f-88ebaf50fe6c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["trolley wire de-icing","mechanical resonance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059995599"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55e3","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Starzomska","uuid":"80304F7FB8A07620094DED299EB81F66D8E989B2598836DA6F357335195BD9C586034D0A67D711F6CBB541A47F4371CC9E3E862390A74EAE95CF6656C522DDA5","documentHash":"c4a14a17-240b-44eb-931c-51fc9284526e"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cc4","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zender-Świercz","uuid":"92E5C3F2220E3380EE4CDDE6FE0D4A7D89B9D698352E81CF04A908F7C8D986ACB2B205C408F98E64562CACF6FBBE1A611C5ABC9C48D4787E69A907720CF80A58","orcidId":"0000-0002-5684-8276","documentHash":"46e19657-dccc-4f14-ac21-589d0cf3da33"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d1a5","name":"Beata","lastName":"Galiszewska","uuid":"B120E131708D424282F4544CDF62BEBB03A213813A3F30DEA7F6BBC59025331A323B60CE3A13A06C8D088F640784BD15D2DA347E5EFB5759B26236A06B916CFB","documentHash":"b5963f21-94b5-4bda-aadb-2d5919266bab"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393f32","name":"Marek","lastName":"Telejko","uuid":"6F547403EC6BCD896CDD4B8D60BF16DD81E14FDF6BC6817C348CFF1DFF58FC6324BCB4F2BC862A09FE1FE1F78D05B117D0973F0FD6C8657AA2A13B935A5579E0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4648-3549","documentHash":"d3429a06-e056-4c90-8399-788bc1bc3b5c"}],"objectId":"67583b1efdbe835dc16973a3","doi":"10.3390/en15197032","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/19/7032/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of Thermal Comfort in Rooms Equipped with a Decentralised Façade Ventilation Unit","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Thermal comfort affects not only the well-being of the occupants of a building but also the effectiveness of their learning and work efficiency. It can be disturbed if the ventilation airflow is increased when improving indoor air quality. When natural ventilation is used in the fall and winter period, the supply air temperature is low, resulting in a lack of thermal comfort. In existing buildings, there is often no place for mechanical ventilation; hence, decentralised façade ventilation units are increasingly used. The article presents an analysis of thermal comfort in rooms with this type of unit equipped with heat recovery exchangers of different efficiencies. Studies have shown that the alternating supply/exhaust airflow and the related unevenness of air streams flowing through the heat accumulator cause an inflow of low-temperature air, resulting in thermal discomfort. The highest value of the PMV index was −1.6, and the lowest was −4.1, which means that 54.8 to 100% of the occupants are dissatisfied with their thermal comfort. This means there is a need to change the construction of inlet/exhaust vents so that the stream of supply air is not directly parallel to the floor. In addition, the use of an air heater should be considered."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d1a5","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cc4","5e709256878c28a047393f32","5e70940b878c28a0473b55e3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"7032","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cc4","5e709256878c28a047393f32","5e7092cd878c28a04739d1a5","5e70940b878c28a0473b55e3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632c56884097076d6d457221","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"19","documentHash":"e1d022ef-6512-483e-9abb-935273649c69"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["thermal comfort","decentralised facade ventilation units  s","torage heat exchangers for heat recovery"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059995665"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aec9d","name":"Michał","lastName":"Bakalarz","uuid":"0A3EF74428B49FCF12AD8751BE3A79B8294892F48B9932F90CA26DC4AD0193763FFAC8C3AE94630B47AE56AC3F4FC647E1471519EF25E0F7E913F79C898F7BD6","documentHash":"94429314-6db0-4d91-9f98-08b1df41ea56"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393ec5","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kossakowski","uuid":"CDC0BC2E6FFE2F8036395153C97DBE0EB1704AE74FABE7030E968A2C1374607A20AC8884A86D1DB82D533CE30EB0C93A0844552C424724AD4076A23F5103A7EF","documentHash":"0c5e00be-a2d1-4c57-9d8f-e245c4a4b044"}],"objectId":"67582da8fdbe835dc167d4f4","doi":"10.3390/fib10020021","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6439/10/2/21/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Ductility and Stiffness of Laminated Veneer Lumber Beams Strengthened with Fibrous Composites","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the results of experimental research on unstrengthened and strengthened laminated veneer beams subjected to 4-point bending.

There was no significant increase in the flexural bending capacity for beams reinforced with UHM CFRP sheets. Similar values of bending ductility indices based on deflection and energy absorption were obtained.

In this process, it is necessary to consider the enterprise as a whole, taking into account the interaction between its key elements, both in the technological and business layer. For this reason, the article proposes the use of enterprise architecture, which facilitates the interaction of these layers in the production optimization process. As a result, a proprietary meta-model of enterprise architecture was presented, which, based on good practices and the assumptions of enterprise architecture, facilitates the construction of detailed optimization models in the area of planning, scheduling, resource allocation, and routing. The production optimization model formulated as a mathematical programming problem is also presented. The model was built taking into account the meta-model. Due to the computational complexity of the optimization model, a method using an artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed to estimate the potential result based on the structure of the model and a given data instance before the start of optimization. The practical application of the presented approach has been shown based on the example of optimization of the production of an exemplary production cell where the cost of storage and the number of unfulfilled orders and maintenance are optimized."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65a749b940e3ff6b129dc64e","5e709253878c28a047393bc4","5e709253878c28a047393bd7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"2015","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a749b940e3ff6b129dc64e","5e709253878c28a047393bd7","5e709253878c28a047393bc4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics","issn":"2079-9292","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"84e7903c-f300-44fa-a9fd-204491284c02"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67582eaefdbe835dc167e31d","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"9","documentHash":"79ab1c4a-7b05-4ebb-86f8-c05b2741efe7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["enterprise architecture","production optimization","meta-model","mathematical programming","ANN"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059996108"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709277878c28a0473962fa","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Brzozowska-Rup","uuid":"A9D8EBF85162C91B1573C323C45CD85C485DE8EF6D183CB182D4D7CB29CCE04C3C9355C65E6E2E7E2EE8FFCF2864050151238704B183F521C197C13BB4EA205E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1231-8027","documentHash":"5dadd35c-2678-45fb-ab0b-44056ade9cec"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394dce","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Nowakowska","uuid":"652CD049D3EBB0635AF33577EDF1B4340C3C0777DD1F85A632879ACF5AA7D7CA33BECFED69AF8B00B93DA38A58922F642A3771C2AEFA325310B2F599F5F53F36","orcidId":"0000-0002-6934-523X","documentHash":"dedebb5d-a108-41ef-9eab-2ebe6abc7b3c"}],"objectId":"67584f64fdbe835dc16ae893","doi":"10.3390/en15134577","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/13/4577/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Bibliometric Studies on Renewable Energy—Poland Compared to Other EU Countries","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The necessity to use renewable energy sources (RES), especially in EU countries, is becoming more and more urgent in the face of environmental degradation.

Viscosity-modifying admixtures (VMAs) are an inherent ingredient of these materials. The correct choice of the amount and type of these admixtures is important from the practical and scientific points of view. In this article, the use of cellulose ether (CE) and starch ether (SE) in cement pastes and mortars is studied. This research focuses on the hydration process and fresh-state properties of mortars because this subject determines the correct choice of the amount and type of admixture used, and the results determine the application and properties of hardened mortars. Polymers were added in the range from 0.056% to 0.22% in relation to the dry ingredients of the mortar. The research showed that cellulose ether had the greatest impact on the consistency, air content, bulk density, and water retention of ordinary dry-mix mortars. On the other hand, starch ether affected the hydration process, delaying the setting and hardening processes much more than cellulose ether. The action of these admixtures rose with the increase in the amount of polymer used in different ways (depending on the type of ether)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55f7","5e70940b878c28a0473b55fe"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"8764","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55f7","5e70940b878c28a0473b55fe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639315f74097073c97873d18","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"24","documentHash":"26e776ff-de84-4cbf-87e8-cdf1e69a13ae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cellulose ether","starch ether","VMA","consistency","cement mortar","water retention","application properties","setting time","hydration process","calorimetric measurements"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059998826"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473b9fcb","name":"Artur","lastName":"Ściana","uuid":"11D4EEC738CE51AD8762DAFCA253AC98F904893D8DC2D374D7BD24DA65EAF5223759A34012A8507847BCA383BA59D165A5F27D622C31AE1CFF51A4271147D43D","documentHash":"6271f64c-0861-47f3-8b5f-e948c452e6fc"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394dbe","name":"Artur","lastName":"Maciąg","uuid":"1E75782036AEFDE87372DD0432D83F03C4427C1E4928F93322F62E983FEF6BF946A5714AB1123B4AC02679492D552A62D072F5CDF3CBB8B9DE8E7592480A207D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6785-3241","documentHash":"a8ec856c-debb-4cad-914a-e8b20b204baa"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a0473949c5","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grysa","uuid":"08C0683B662675E28696A9F3021269C477578DF7266E9D5E3EDA981ECFF38D7427D171FC6DB045995E27A055291CB8074AA44C048B88231D95D2F955974A7473","orcidId":"0000-0002-4437-6830","documentHash":"68aac1eb-660a-4719-a0a4-3b99b1940aef"}],"objectId":"67584ad6fdbe835dc16a9820","doi":"10.3390/en15228425","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/22/8425/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Comparison of the Efficiency of Cross-Flow Plate Heat Exchangers Made of Varied Materials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper discusses a mathematical model for airflow through a cross‐flow plate heat exchanger.

However, it consumes excessive amounts of natural resources and can negatively impact the environment through its by-products: carbon dioxide (CO2), cement clinker dust (CKD) and cement bypass dust (CBPD). The amount of dust generated in the cement clinker production process depends largely on the technology used. It typically ranges from 0 to 25% by weight of the clinker, and a single cement plant is capable of producing 1000 tons of CBPD per day. Despite practical applications in many areas, such as soil stabilisation, concrete mix production, chemical processing or ceramic and brick production, the dust is still stored in heaps. This poses an environmental challenge, so new ways of managing it are being sought. Due to the significant content of free lime (>30%) in CBPD, this paper uses cement bypass dust as a binder replacement in autoclaved silica–lime products. Indeed, the basic composition of silicate bricks includes 92% sand, 8% lime and water. The investigation shows that it is possible to completely replace the binder with CBPD dust in the autoclaved products. The obtained results showed that all properties of produced bricks were satisfactory. The study concluded that many benefits could be achieved by using cement bypass dust in the production of bricks, including economic bricks for building, reducing the dependency on natural resources, reducing pollution and reducing negative impacts on the environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709414878c28a0473b5dd3","5e709256878c28a047393e64","5e7093ab878c28a0473aec9b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"316","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aec9b","5e709414878c28a0473b5dd3","5e709256878c28a047393e64"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a60d8940970715e70ecb77","year":"2022","volume":"16","number":"1","documentHash":"11a92e97-0d7e-425d-bcef-02fe810a18c7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CBPD","free CaO","autoclaved products","lime binder replacement","sandlime bricks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059999181"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aecac","name":"Karol","lastName":"Skowera","uuid":"2D8BDABB78B31D9F0A304792D93A6EE72DAC1BE397E63A417DC45A13B63D77EB83749120E98AEC34BFDBA904B97FF0DA612693565A399BDFA39860448C2C133F","documentHash":"c183ec5f-7839-498c-b615-8954b9cbb468"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393f12","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Rusin","uuid":"D9E4FC2B91DB82568AD48FC2E309B685C6ACFF48020375F1C59D5028F5D1312F568E1F5839F87CB25C9CC13BCC07408CC0FB5E8A52820F365A72CE636678CC94","documentHash":"3f31a11f-2436-450b-8f6b-d861edc7033b"}],"objectId":"67585300fdbe835dc16b1142","doi":"10.3390/ma15010308","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/1/308/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Differential Analysis of Volumetric Strain Method Characterization in the Context of Phase Change of Water in Carbonate Rocks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Modernized technological processes or increasing demands on building materials force the scientific community to analyze in more detail the suitability of individual raw materials and deposits.

Despite the extensive literature in the field of research on capillary-porous materials, scientists still face many challenges because not everything is known. Carbonate rocks are the most common (one-tenth of Earth’s crust) sedimentary rocks. Analysis of the test results obtained with the use of the modernized differentia analysis of volumetric strain (DAVS) methodology allows for a better adjustment of rock deposits to the products that can be produced from them.

Through the experiments, the usefulness of the nested structure in energy demand prediction is demonstrated, by calculating three popular metrics: Mean Square Error, Mean Absolute Error and the correlation coefficient. A comparative analysis is performed, applying classic multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks, long short-term memory networks and fuzzy cognitive maps. The results confirmed that the proposed approach outperforms the classic methods in terms of prediction accuracy. Moreover, the advantage of the proposed approach is the ability to present complex time series in the form of a clear nested structure presenting the main concepts influencing energy consumption on the first level. The second level allows for more detailed problem analysis and lower forecast errors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940c878c28a0473b56e7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"7542","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6759443afdbe83757db02011","5e70940c878c28a0473b56e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"634cff75409707021a624442","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"20","documentHash":"5107fdbe-83f1-4945-93b3-f043ce872762"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nested structure;","energy use forecasting;","fuzzy cognitive maps;","artificial neural networks;","long short-term memory networks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005298"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6759449cfdbe83757db024f7","name":"Serhiy","lastName":"Forduy","documentHash":"43e7f2cf-8eb7-4c40-b4e3-a484bec2be04"},{"objectId":"6759449cfdbe83757db024f6","name":"Roman","lastName":"Radchenko","documentHash":"aad46498-0004-4818-9c7c-d60dfd2f52ee"},{"objectId":"6759449cfdbe83757db024f5","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Mikielewicz","documentHash":"35196001-96ae-496d-8f09-7d9015584972"},{"objectId":"6759449cfdbe83757db024f4","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Radchenko","documentHash":"145b9c26-cb9c-486d-bb0d-6f8a13b63270"},{"objectId":"6759449cfdbe83757db024f3","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Radchenko","documentHash":"9705aa0a-5e92-423e-9660-07582a56f92c"},{"objectId":"602dfdc19543c7410626e9d0","name":"Anatoliy","lastName":"Pavlenko","uuid":"A61C8C004FA37D6FF13BD3EC262A2FED8AF1F349EACA2FCA1DDDAEDBC394D0B22A55E66BB9A5BD1D0361853FE89DBFE254603C009955917825EE9BEDBD177239","documentHash":"0052f635-7d44-4d8d-ae4e-7e2bd443517a"}],"objectId":"6759449cfdbe83757db024f2","doi":"10.3390/en15031163","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/1163/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Energy Saving in Trigeneration Plant for Food Industries","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The trigeneration plants for combined cooling, heating, and electricity supply, or integrated energy systems (IES), are mostly based on gas reciprocating engines. The fuel efficiency of gas reciprocating engines depends essentially on air intake temperatures. The transformation of the heat removed from the combustion engines into refrigeration is generally conducted by absorption lithium-bromide chillers (ACh). The peculiarity of refrigeration generation in food technologies is the use of chilled water of about 12 °C instead of 7 °C as the most typical for ACh. This leads to a considerable cooling potential not realized by ACh that could be used for cooling the engine intake air. A refrigerant ejector chiller (ECh) is the simplest in design, cheap, and can be applied as the low-temperature stage of a two-stage absorption-ejector chiller (AECh) to provide engine intake air cooling and increase engine fuel efficiency as result.

The diagnostic procedure requires trained and specialized therapists. The paper presents the estimation of the GMFM measure for patients with cerebral palsy based on the results of the Zebris FDM-T treadmill. For this purpose, the regression analysis was used. Estimations based on the Generalized Linear Regression were assessed using different error metrics. The results obtained showed that the GMFM score can be estimated with acceptable accuracy.

The experiments were conducted using a BP93L EDM machine. The Box–Behnken design was employed to study the effects of three factors, i.e., spark current, pulse-on time, and pulse-off time, each at three levels, on the surface quality. A specially designed system was employed to increase the effectiveness of the machining process by imparting an additional rotary motion to the tool and an additional rotary motion to the workpiece. The aim was to efficiently remove the eroded metal particles and create a surface with smaller craters. The workpiece surface roughness was measured with a Talysurf CCI lite non-contact profiler. During this precision machining process, the arithmetical mean height (Sa) was less than 1 µm. The surface quality was examined also using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy (OM). The experimental data were analyzed by means of Statistica to determine and graphically represent the relationships between the input and output parameters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aecef","5e70943b878c28a0473b8837"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"7277","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aecef","5e70943b878c28a0473b8837"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6347eb00409707021ae3b69b","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"20","documentHash":"890f5e36-5b50-46d2-abc6-661a228551fb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electrical discharge machining (EDM);","alnico;","surface finish;","roughness;","surface quality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005729"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b62f2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Gil-Mastalerczyk","uuid":"78EF92457826D629AB5752F38B54276820BF1150AB03A4A75987ADD0E71641C518E8983F0C146DB212CB52B3D5C0E0B10AA8B69FFDEC9CC2059001602AA4D6ED","documentHash":"f457a17d-3127-4696-9c6f-d55628ab1f04"}],"objectId":"67595034fdbe83757db0f847","doi":"10.30540/sae-2023-004","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.30540/sae-2023-004","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"“AN ACCESSIBLE CITY” – A LOOK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ‘60+’ GENERATION","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W artykule przedstawiono wyniki eksperymentów warsztatowych ukierunkowanych na realizację koncepcji miasta dostępnego oraz wyłoniono najważniejsze przesłanki umożliwiające lepsze funkcjonowanie seniorów w przestrzeni publicznej miasta, opierając się na rzeczywistych potrzebach starzejącego się społeczeństwa.

Based on these efforts, code provisions and various models have been proposed for predicting intermediate crack (IC) debonding failure. The paper presents a comparison of seven selected models: fib bulletin 14 approach, Teng et al. model, Lu model, Seracino et al. model, Said and Wu model, Elsanadedy et al. model and ACI 440. The accuracy of each model was evaluated based on the test results of 58 flexural specimens with IC debonding failures of externally bonded (EB), carbon FRP plates or sheets found in the existing literature. The experimental database was prepared to include a wide range of parameters affecting the issue under consideration. A comparison of the measured and predicted load capacity values was made to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the considered models. The analysis included the limitation of the load capacity estimated based on IC debonding models as well as concrete crushing and FRP rupture types of failure. The results indicate that the latest models proposed for direct implementation in design guidelines—the Said and Wu model and the Elsanadedy et al. model—offer the best accuracy in predicting the load capacity. In contrast, the fib bulletin 14 approach shows a wide dispersion of predictions and a large proportion of highly overestimated results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709414878c28a0473b5dcf"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"7390","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709414878c28a0473b5dcf","675955cbfdbe83757db1453a","675955cbfdbe83757db1453b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6347eb00409707021ae3b69b","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"20","documentHash":"890f5e36-5b50-46d2-abc6-661a228551fb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["debonding;","FRP;","RC beams;","strengthening;","failure modes;","EBR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060005913"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ad0","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Woś","uuid":"DEEF378CFC4CDD119AA47F80F300DD7D6E5F5F13FDEE99A4D66E318E9FE57BB3372C56BD9E9F92C4016F0FA7413222BF334E4751F82587964AC8D2EEA54FA4E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-3107-366X","documentHash":"859953c7-f6b6-45d0-abbb-f73e75610436"},{"objectId":"5e709242878c28a0473929ff","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Dindorf","uuid":"FBEBD35F7E7B34E0F708F78E0863E3CB919556AC887B1972C3382069136564B4A1366F40461DEBC3134F528B697899F692E3ECF07881EAB780EB1035D6671DD7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2242-3288","documentHash":"97b3f4fc-f3dc-4430-9144-1c7ce6a9881a"}],"objectId":"67594504fdbe83757db02bbf","doi":"10.3390/en15114097","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/11/4097/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Energy Efficiency of Pressure Shock Damper in the Hydraulic Lifting and Leveling Module","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study evaluates the energy efficiency of pressure shock damping in a hydraulic lifting\nand leveling (HLL) module of a mobile robotic bricklaying system (RBS).

A thermal imaging camera was used to measure the temperature distribution of the outer surface of the heated plate. The purpose of the calculations was to determine the heat transfer coefficients at the contact surfaces: the heated plate—FC-72 and FC-72—the copper plate. Two mathematical models have been proposed to describe the heat flow. In the 1D approach, only the heat flow direction perpendicular to the fluid flow direction was assumed. In the 2D model, it was assumed that the temperature of the heated plate and FC-72 and the copper plate meet the appropriate energy equation, supplemented by the boundary conditions system. In this case, the Trefftz functions were used in numerical calculations. In the 1D model, the heat transfer coefficient at the interface between FC-72 and the copper plate was determined by theoretical correlations. The analysis of the results showed that the values and distributions of the heat transfer coefficient determined using both models were similar."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709264878c28a047394daf","5e709270878c28a0473959bb","5e70927a878c28a047396661","5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f06"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1340","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709270878c28a0473959bb","5e709264878c28a047394daf","5e70927a878c28a047396661","5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f06"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620cc2722467f01c21719b52","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"4","documentHash":"7cb5f55f-7e55-4a8e-87b8-b667f7de677f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mini-channel","co-current heat exchanger","heat transfer coefficient","Trefftz functions","flow boiling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060006052"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709414878c28a0473b5dcb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bacharz","uuid":"C63CAFC23FE8826FDC519126C0B2F8AB41B4B53125264B04CAC112EA1F02A8985FFA5242ADC74DBE644019940971B294F51173B9B01B25EDE7C23C4F329F644A","documentHash":"0c32a76a-8190-4d5b-a29b-24459f875b6e"},{"objectId":"5e709414878c28a0473b5dca","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Bacharz","uuid":"BB71134F756B4140220F00A107DE794CBC106955BBCF4D549655D044A0DBBD7B245AD802CB8699CFF60791E4BBD9F5FD114FFD8B8E135823E91AFF839812D1E1","documentHash":"6bfd1f74-f872-4880-9ae1-88fcee5f3f1b"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393fc7","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Trąmpczyński","uuid":"726AE8106B717AF5F516F87CCCF774D2508586F544F40C1201FFBF875E8378C67F2449BF01FCE6563BF3441F1ECEC606D7C81B14876F62B8DDFAFB7C43E7DA6D","documentHash":"b3e6ffec-c7b3-473a-8018-70e9804634d2"}],"objectId":"675965b0fdbe83757db2720d","doi":"10.3390/ma15155389","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/15/5389/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Correlation between Shrinkage and Acoustic Emission Signals in Early Age Concrete","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study analysed the processes of damage formation and development in early age unloaded concrete using the acoustic emission method (IADP).

The structure of S235JR carbon steel used in the experiments was reported to change locally in the jet impact zone due to the high concentration of energy generated during cutting with the abrasive water jet. It is assumed that some of the energy is transferred into the material in the form of heat. This is particularly true for materials of considerable thickness with a high thermal conductivity coefficient when cutting is performed at low speeds or with high abrasive consumption. The literature on the subject suggests that in AWJM there is little or no thermal energy effect on the microstructure of the material cut. The research described here involved the measurement of the cutting temperature with thermocouples placed at four different distances from the edge. The distances were measured using computed tomography inspection. The thermocouples used in the tests were capable of detecting temperatures of up to 100 °C. Locally, temperatures at the edge may reach much higher values. The results of the X-ray diffraction qualitative phase analysis reveal that locally the temperatures may be much higher than the eutectoid temperature.

The literature describes mainly the results obtained in a laboratory- and a pilot-scale reactor. The manuscript presents the results of MSW treatment in a full-scale bio-drying reactor (150 m3). The reactor is operated in one of the Polish installations specializing in mechanical-biological treatment (MBT). During the 14 day period of biodrying in the reactor, the parameters of MSW such as the moisture, temperature, loss on ignition (LOI), and net heating value (NHV) were examined. The temperature of the air in the reactor was also examined. The research also included changes in the above-mentioned parameters of MSW located in three parts of the reactor: the front, middle, and back. The test results showed that the moisture content of the waste decreased from the initial level of 55% to the level of 30%. This was accompanied by an increase in the NHV from 6.3 MJ kg−1 to 9.6 MJ kg−1. At the same time, the LOI decreased from 68% d.m. to 45% d.m. The LOI decrease is not favorable from the point of view of using MSW as refuse-derived fuel (RDF), as was expected in the final usage stage. The results have application value as the plant operator, having at their disposal the controlling of the reactor’s ventilation and the temperature inside the reactor, should select the speed of the moisture removal from MSW at such a level as to minimize the LOI decrease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67596710fdbe83757db28ef9","5e709256878c28a047393faf","5e709257878c28a047394069"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1039","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709256878c28a047393faf","5e709257878c28a047394069","67596710fdbe83757db28ef9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6eab52467f030e8c433a6","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"3","documentHash":"6f6ef340-c61f-44fb-8d93-a045bc59a21f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["municipal solid waste","mechanical-biological treatment","biodrying","moisture controlling","net heating value controlling","RDFSRF"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060009500"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"652608a940e3ff22d34a6b85","name":"Artur","lastName":"Piasecki","uuid":"4A8A2E4C32700D1152848BAE9DCB545B4E653F341CBF8E5B8D2D2DC21BFD6F56D5D3256FEB106478755FB73E78851C6E3CE1B15E740BAFD18F8982A98AA2C880","documentHash":"450ce3da-51a8-40bb-b7d3-6683ce83fede"},{"objectId":"60c2fc349543c72336543401","name":"Norbert","lastName":"Dadas","uuid":"190B05A4DF8775A86576785F4F6602E3DDC4F09CBC4FD8FA4941897AF0D51FACB0B21533999A517C8CD4F75CDAF4E2A7F4E37AF0090649E47A9AA50A3654EC51","documentHash":"0550f053-e4e7-4c3e-9d90-39b76cfc3c4b"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a0473959bb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Piasecka","uuid":"AC05358322D3A8BDA14A929847770F2A8C92675887A26EFD2C262AACE9005CB5D39FBDF7A2EF1E258A0F8F0AAADFCFF231C0B5A5253A7A3F1738F6F0A8E31C53","orcidId":"0000-0003-3696-6213","documentHash":"1b5f8efb-6fa5-4d64-b249-bd97f93bc063"}],"objectId":"675968a0fdbe83757db2b4c8","doi":"10.3390/en16248047","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/24/8047/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"An Experimental Investigation and Numerical Simulation of Photovoltaic Cells with Enhanced Surfaces Using the Simcenter STAR-CCM+ Software","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article proposes a passive cooling system for photovoltaic (PV) panels to achieve a reduction in their temperature. It is known that the cooling of PV panels allows for an increase in the efficiency of photovoltaic conversion. Furthermore, reducing the high temperature of the surfaces of PV panels is also desirable to ensure their long-lasting operation and high efficiency. Photovoltaic panels were modified by adding copper sheets to the bottom side of the panels. Two types of modification of the outer surface of the sheet were investigated experimentally, which differed in surface roughness. One was characterised by the nominal roughness of the copper sheet according to its manufacturer, while the other was enhanced by a system of pins. Numerical simulations, performed using the Simcenter STAR-CCM+ software, version 2020.2.1 Build 15.04.010, helped to describe the geometry of the pins and their role in the resulting reduction in the temperature of the PV panel surface. As a result, modifying a typical PV panel by adding a copper sheet with pins helps to achieve a higher decrease in the temperature of the PV panel. The addition of a copper sheet with a smooth surface to the bare PV panel improved the operating conditions by lowering its surface temperature by approximately 6.5 K but using an enhanced surface with the highest number of pins distributed uniformly on the copper sheet surface resulted in the highest temperature drop up to 12 K. The highest number of pins distributed uniformly on the copper sheet surface resulted in the highest temperature drop in its bottom surface, that is, on average by more than 12 K compared to the surface temperature of the bare PV panel surface. The validation of the numerical calculations was performed on data from the experiments. An analysis of the quality of the numerical mesh was also performed using a method based on the grid convergence index."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc349543c72336543401","5e709270878c28a0473959bb","652608a940e3ff22d34a6b85"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"8047","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709270878c28a0473959bb","652608a940e3ff22d34a6b85","60c2fc349543c72336543401"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6572e3a04097074b377810ee","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"24","documentHash":"e4dae19e-dff1-4c8e-8a36-aec08d527454"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["photovoltaic panel","improving efficiency","enhanced surface","numerical analysis","panel cooling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060009560"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e4a","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Graba","uuid":"00FF581F0A4C6364648D4C6999B69FF43802A434FFB2A20D539E682EAD12CBB51E7D54446E3617406B3425910B38CB64A67AFAF756B68EDA567E5FE2A842C0EE","orcidId":"0000-0001-7520-8330","documentHash":"9ec9d41f-8a1e-434e-ba0b-0d1539129d35"}],"objectId":"67595ecbfdbe83757db1cad0","doi":"10.3390/ma15207361","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/20/7361/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Numerical Evaluation of the Fracture Process of 41Cr4 Steel: Analysis of Cracks Grown in a Plane Strain State Domination Based on Experimental Results","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the evaluation of the fracture process of 41Cr4 steel, based on experimental tests and numerical analysis carried out for growing cracks. Selected results of experimental studies presented in previous publications in 2015–2016 which were used in the construction of FEM models of SEN(B) specimens dominated by a plane strain state, are quoted. Using FEM simulations, the tensile curves and crack growth curves recorded during laboratory tests, several calculations were performed, among which can be distinguished the evaluation of plastic zones in the considered specimens, stress distributions, selected measures of geometric constraints, accumulated plastic strains and selected parameters of fracture mechanics. The numerical calculations presented in this paper allow to estimate the changes of the J-integral for the tested steel, the crack tip opening displacement, the size of the plastic zone and the stress distribution in front of the crack tip. Comprehensive numerical analysis with the use of the actual tensile curve clearly characterizes the behavior of the material under the influence of increasing external loads."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709264878c28a047394e4a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"7361","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709264878c28a047394e4a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6347eb00409707021ae3b69b","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"20","documentHash":"890f5e36-5b50-46d2-abc6-661a228551fb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["41Cr4 steel;","FEM;","J-integral;","CTOD;","crack initiation moment;","stress distribution;","geometric constraints;","plastic zone;","crack growth"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060009653"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ac878c28a0473aecfc","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Pietrala","uuid":"4D78C091B58ED4098106949EAEEB0FF5D266923833C5827A8490EC3C3C36CD6F1907ECF666844CBAD5EB68A252B7C23906821952B52567C79A8F89AA30175CFA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5956-3495","documentHash":"20f89fa7-279c-44f1-bfde-7af886d87469"},{"objectId":"5e709244878c28a047392b29","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Łaski","uuid":"3EAF49F2B362810A23B988734F04B2D355E26645DD31475684DF785D09A1A71C041F9C17EA88D9463CCA8FF26FE28B3A057FBCD045B4BB072B915D54F2A6C250","orcidId":"0000-0002-3338-0981","documentHash":"464a724a-b7ac-4bfb-b9e7-3def10a97dfb"}],"objectId":"6360d3f14097077923471ac2","doi":"10.3390/app122111024","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/21/11024/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Design and Control of a Pneumatic Muscle Servo Drive Containing Its Own Pneumatic Muscles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709244878c28a047392b29","5e7093ac878c28a0473aecfc"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"11024","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ac878c28a0473aecfc","5e709244878c28a047392b29"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff33dad49b31ccec0104f","title":"Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"96f827ef-c2c8-4b76-ab17-c7357fffee4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6360d3f14097077923471ac3","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"21","documentHash":"e4093d97-6008-40ef-beb1-39c22011ff83"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060012753"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6759716ffdbe83757db36515","name":"Manuela","lastName":"Ingaldi","documentHash":"4ddd86b7-ca85-4b0f-8450-7f452c4691fb"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e878","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Czajkowska","uuid":"2E19A8720067684D5B178D3CB6DE097BB1C330AC98A4EF50CD6BD9B9C2938A81EA7D658C5A48F772C20DDB7D635B5B589C5E5033E9646DEB6192933A4B0B4DFB","documentHash":"d4146aed-39ae-441e-8548-629cd34d6fc0"}],"objectId":"6759716ffdbe83757db36513","doi":"10.17512/bozpe.2023.12.24","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.17512/bozpe.2023.12.24","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of the causes of construction accidents as a component of building safety management","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Managing safety in construction aims to ensure that buildings are safe for occupants and meetapplicable safety standards.

The influence of fabrication processes on the size of geometric and material imperfections was considered. Static performance was characterised, as were the failure modes, with particular emphasis on the Vierendeel mechanism and web-post buckling. As the literature review shows, a local loss of web post stability is a frequent failure mode of cellular beam with closely spaced web openings. The main objective of this paper is present a summary of research on web post buckling (WPB) in cellular beams in light of the available analytical computational methods for determining WPB resistance based on the analogy to compression member buckling. This paper addresses the need for a clear assessment of the discrepancies between the assumptions and calculation algorithms used in the presented methods, so far lacking in the literature. This paper includes an explanation of the essence of the WPB phenomenon, a summary of the basic assumptions and algorithms used in the available methods, a description of the differences between them, and a critical comparison of these methods. The presented algorithms were unified and adjusted to the nomenclature of PN-EN 1993-1-1. For 7 cellular beams, the analytical column buckling resistance under the action of vertical shear force was determined according to 5 analytical methods implemented in MS Excel. The results were presented in tabular and graphical forms. Significant discrepancies between the results from the different methods were shown and discussed. The assumptions of the methods vary significantly. The largest differences between the predicted resistances were observed for narrow posts, while for wider posts, the methods showed better agreement. The lack of clear consensus on the correct design procedure does not encourage designers to optimally design such load-bearing members or may lead to construction disasters. This article indicates the points of disagreement concerning the calculation models used and outlines the direction for further work. A step for future work will be to verify the assumptions of numerical models and establish clear guidelines for designers in the field of analytical calculations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fd4e9543c7233654354b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"213-230","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fd4e9543c7233654354b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff284ad49b31ccebf5343","title":"Advances in Science and Technology Research Journal","issn":"2080-4075","eissn":"2299-8624","websiteLink":"http://www.astrj.com/Archive","documentHash":"b7aedc0b-665a-4b62-b5e0-5642e2245053"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6759a34dfdbe83757db7f5d7","year":"2022","volume":"16","number":"1","documentHash":"50866bae-191a-4839-ac48-7ccda0494574"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cellular beams","perforated steel beams","web-post buckling","vertical shear capacity","strut model","analytical methods"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060026847"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f6878c28a0473b40e3","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Zuska","uuid":"70591C9055F663D355B6E4DCA524BAD6C05564668E0E37AC3E8983732BE6FDDE08809A66E6AD53D30CC6ED763BAAA4927341ED8A86DA6DA363CF453C4ECFC4BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-9343-9914","documentHash":"0f257ae8-4ed3-4c1c-adaa-d96d32aa48d5"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ae0","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Kurczyński","uuid":"631FF04938D5E5BDF9388C89FB634F24F10741CB9380CA9B6C74A9AAD04C613488E251D7B0B3A24D5B1C297516298688CA9C18D85191EDC79DD05B76E83E03D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-0337-672X","documentHash":"a5ad6171-f468-420f-85cf-483d9d422e4b"}],"objectId":"67599e7afdbe83757db7aa38","doi":"10.3390/s22249726","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/24/9726/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Analysis of the Impact of Invisible Road Icing on Selected Parameters of a Minibus Vehicle","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The measurement of acceleration during vehicle motion can be used to assess the driving styles and behaviours of drivers, to control vehicle traffic, to detect uncontrolled vehicle behaviour, and to prevent accidents. The measurement of acceleration during vehicle motion on an icy road can be used to warn the driver about changing conditions and the related hazards. This paper presents the results of testing the motion parameters of a Ford Transit adapted for passenger transport in critical traffic conditions. It can contribute to the improvement of road safety. Critical traffic conditions are deemed in the paper as sudden braking, rapid acceleration, and circular vehicle motion at maximum speed maintainable in the given conditions. The vehicle’s acceleration and speed were measured during the tests. The tests were carried out with a TAA linear acceleration sensor and a Correvit S-350 Aqua optoelectronic sensor. The same test runs were conducted on a dry surface, a wet (after rain) surface and a surface covered with a thin, invisible ice layer. The objective of the tests was to determine the impact of invisible road icing, the so-called black ice, on the tested vehicle’s braking, acceleration, and circular motion. It was demonstrated that a virtually invisible ice layer covering the road surface has a substantial impact on the tested vehicle’s motion parameters, thereby affecting traffic safety. It substantially extends the braking and acceleration distances and requires the driver to reduce the vehicle’s speed when performing circular motions. A clear wet surface, representing motion after rain, did not substantially affect the analysed parameters.

In this regard, one of the most important criteria is to maintain Quality of Service (QoS) parameters at an appropriate and sufficiently high level. The QoS level should ensure the delivery of data packets in the shortest time possible while preventing critical parameters relevant to real-time transmission from being exceeded. This article proposes a new methodology for designing real-time IoT systems. The premise of the proposed approach is to adapt selected solutions used in other types of systems working with real-time requirements. Some analogy to embedded systems with a distributed architecture has been noted and used in this regard. The main differences from the concept of built-in systems can primarily be seen in the communication layer. The methodology proposed in this article is based on the authors’ proposed model of real-time system functional specification and its mapping to the IoT architecture. In addition, the developed methodology makes extensive use of selected IoT architecture elements described in this article, as well as selected task scheduling methods and communication protocols. The proposed methodology for designing RTIoT systems is based on dedicated transmission serialization methods and dedicated routing protocols. These methods ensure that the time constraints for the assumed bandwidth of IoT links are met by appropriately prioritizing transmissions and determining communication routes. The presented approach can be used to design a broad class of RTIoT systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc1d9543c72336543376","5e70940c878c28a0473b56e6","5e709252878c28a047393b9a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"4120","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940c878c28a0473b56e6","60c2fc1d9543c72336543376","5e709252878c28a047393b9a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics","issn":"2079-9292","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"84e7903c-f300-44fa-a9fd-204491284c02"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67599fc3fdbe83757db7b50e","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"24","documentHash":"ce02d36c-f286-4a24-abae-2623dac4597d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["real time;","IoT;","tasks scheduling;","communication protocols"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060027427"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6759a6ecfdbe83757db8218d","name":"Roman","lastName":"Babko","documentHash":"67d0bd19-a29b-4abc-9b16-43a6d112c988"},{"objectId":"6759a6ecfdbe83757db8218c","name":"Jozefína","lastName":"Pokrývková","documentHash":"d3b73fbb-acaf-4129-864b-42374f8d7e2b"},{"objectId":"6759a6ecfdbe83757db8218b","name":"Marek","lastName":"Sokáč","documentHash":"3f09ed02-389a-402c-9ec1-498c6579f320"},{"objectId":"6759a6ecfdbe83757db8218a","name":"David","lastName":"Stránský","documentHash":"4e6b62ac-22ac-4a86-b3db-b36a4b81ea6e"},{"objectId":"6759a6ecfdbe83757db82189","name":"Marcin K.","lastName":"Widomski","documentHash":"0884e8fa-4df0-41cd-a327-b31d97aa88e8"},{"objectId":"6759a6ecfdbe83757db82188","name":"Anna","lastName":"Musz-Pomorska","documentHash":"af581657-231e-4437-9963-298901a7b5e9"},{"objectId":"6759a6ecfdbe83757db82187","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Łagód","documentHash":"b525d93f-412b-4a00-b2b7-510f61ff4d92"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b5580","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Szeląg","uuid":"2B177AA882F9613C5D459BF8D95935AB748B31B873E71595707E8619EC08A6BB015A42AF23C2A827711F196BF88931C9E9163BAFD1B3051A6BEB951B8EE91073","documentHash":"9754d901-25e5-4843-a30d-bc67c11b0411"}],"objectId":"6759a6ecfdbe83757db82186","doi":"10.3390/w14131997","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/13/1997/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Development of Rainfall-Runoff Models for Sustainable Stormwater Management in Urbanized Catchments","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Modelling of stormwater networks and the related object (combined sewer overflows, diversion chambers, retention tanks) is a complex task requiring colleting of data with appropriate time and spatial resolution as well as application of adequate models.

This paper presents an overview of simulation tools for sewerage networks modelling, related objects, as well as low-impact development (LID) systems in relation to the hydrodynamic and statistical models. Consecutive stages of data collection, sources of data uncertainty, limitations resulting from the adopted measurement methodology, as well as their influence on the simulation results and possible decision-making using the developed hydrodynamic or statistical model, are discussed. Attention is drawn to the optimization methods enabling reduction in the uncertainty of statistical models. The methods enabling the analysis of model uncertainty, as well as evaluation of its influence on the calculation results pertaining to stormwater hydrographs, retention tank capacity and combined sewers overflows, are also discussed. This is a very important aspect in terms of optimizing construction works in the sewerage network and designing their appropriate dimensions to achieve the assumed hydraulic effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940b878c28a0473b5580"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"1997","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940b878c28a0473b5580","6759a6ecfdbe83757db82187","6759a6ecfdbe83757db82188","6759a6ecfdbe83757db82189","6759a6ecfdbe83757db8218a","6759a6ecfdbe83757db8218b","6759a6ecfdbe83757db8218c","6759a6ecfdbe83757db8218d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water","issn":"2073-4441","eissn":"2073-4441","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"786ef469-6890-4f82-8160-9f545c27c509"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c3e1634097077bbdbcc786","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"13","documentHash":"a7bb127c-990c-4b52-8a8a-d76129d94fbd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rainfall-runoff model setup;","low-impact development (LID);","statistical models;","Storm Water Management Model (SWMM);","conventional measures;","decision support system","urban stormwater systems;","sustainable stormwater management;"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060027470"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66da","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Broniś","uuid":"8596A2385CB149A66319E3BFD58CECBF0D8A0698271D5A964003E183DEEC5468854BA792FADF4DFE4B77382490D20BDD86B6753BD28CBBBE554AE5EE76B23667","documentHash":"0871bfa3-089f-4bef-beee-e446df669223"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397282","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"NOZDRZYKOWSKI","uuid":"A1EBCDD60DF80F7E4BF42F0D714D512D1D7495092AF8B8B466F74A745FA3B90AA864E275266B949A28C1ADB21BC37C0068DC564F19612486BF6EAF57B7C35735","orcidId":"0000-0003-2785-0868","documentHash":"63530bfa-f94e-4127-8fe5-1f36fef2b046"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a0473929b8","name":"Edward","lastName":"Miko","uuid":"DA1E09CB54F0B9EB6A02DD180C5492A35D51405D4E585999B48B5B3E3C826F388ABB982155C651325E64F3A0AAD9C9AA204CBF2E57575DD0DF7D1C5585087854","orcidId":"0000-0003-0339-2225","documentHash":"245aba81-3aa5-4b1a-8244-2ebe6e1c3b76"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"64ae56c54097077279aec3df","doi":"10.3390/ma16010110","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/1/110","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Drilling Strategies to Improve the Geometrical and Dimensional Accuracy of Deep through Holes Made in PA6 Alloy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article shows how different drilling strategies may affect the geometrical and dimensional accuracy of deep through holes. The tests were conducted on a three-axis direct-drive turning center. The holes were drilled in cylindrical PA6 aluminum alloy specimens 30 mm in length and 30 mm in diameter using 6 mm Ø VHM HPC TiAlN-coated twist drill bits. The cutting fluid was supplied to the cutting zone through the spindle. The experiments involved applying three strategies to drill deep through (5D) holes. The first required the workpiece to be fixed and the tool to perform both rotary and reciprocating motions. The second assumed that the workpiece performed the primary (rotary) motion whereas the tool moved in reciprocating motion. In the third strategy, the workpiece and the tool rotated in opposite directions and the tool also performed a reciprocating motion. The straightness, roundness, cylindricity, and diameter errors were the key output parameters in the analysis of the geometrical and dimensional accuracy of holes. The Taguchi orthogonal array design of experiment (DOE) was employed to determine the effects of the input (cutting) parameters (i.e., spindle speed and feed per revolution) and the type of hole making strategy on the hole errors by means of multi-factor statistical analysis ANOVA. The use of the highest spindle speed (n = 4775 rpm), the highest feed per revolution (𝑓𝑛\n = 0.14 mm/rev) and strategy I resulted in the lowest values of the output parameters (STR = 22.7 µm, RON = 8.6 µm, CYL = 28.2 µm, and DE = 9.9 µm).

The study analysed the effects of the cutting speed, the feed rate, the actual number of teeth involved in the process, the minimum thickness of the cut layer (hmin), and the relative displacement in the tool-workpiece system D(ξ) on the surface roughness parameter Ra. To measure relative displacement, an original bench was used with an XL-80 laser interferometer. The analysis of relative displacement and surface roughness allowed these factors to be correlated with each other. The purpose of this article is to determine the stable operating ranges of the CoroMill 490-050Q22-08M milling head with respect to the value of the generated relative displacement w during the face-milling process and to determine its influence on surface roughness. The research methodology presented in this paper and the cutting tests carried out allowed the determination of the optimum operating parameters of the CoroMill 490-050Q22-08M tool during the face milling of aluminium alloy 2017A, which are vc 300 m/m and fz—0.14 mm/tooth. Working with the defined cutting parameters allows all the cutting inserts in the tool body to be involved in shaping the geometrical structure of the surface, while maintaining a low vibration level D(ξ) > 1 µm, a low value of the parameter hmin > 1.5 µm, and the desired value of the parameter Ra > 0.2 µm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709241878c28a047392800"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709270878c28a0473959bf","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40e0","5e7093ab878c28a0473aeceb"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"3626","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709241878c28a047392800","5e7093ab878c28a0473aeceb","653651574097072f84fbbb37","5e709270878c28a0473959bf","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40e0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6284e12540970712d1b6b425","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"10","documentHash":"b0a1ad1b-16fc-47b8-9af3-51a064786eca"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aluminium","face milling","surface roughness","microgeometric surface structure","relative displacement","minimum thickness of cut layer"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060044279"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b7808","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Nocoń","uuid":"8089FAB12999FC205FFF4B41637CBED6463410AEF0CC0638D8E1F0EF52DC6F8F383B2F04731E9C89FD9F8674D5D0475ADC18A20D92CDDC0C8ACB19C6D60ACF9D","documentHash":"77d8b494-87f8-4160-853e-d28a3287c59b"},{"objectId":"5e7093f6878c28a0473b40e0","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Nowakowski","uuid":"BD75F4F03E780FC20546DD02386D98BBBD5EE51BB9F5D5403AFD449391C0D7C3CB048A695AF9C369A4C21E2BC5672ABFD742ACA6D16372B58910410407F4D0F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2425-7295","documentHash":"a73b5840-812d-497d-bbd2-cd42e946e053"},{"objectId":"5e7093f6878c28a0473b40db","name":"Marta","lastName":"Grzyb","uuid":"7ADB470FF008AA01FAEEA1F06D667F09D0111D25F5B474E86D4118C3BD3A89A56F479741DCF933B89CB3D606EEDFA1E0B595BF3A6A9C2A8561FDA9C7211D27BD","documentHash":"c8c87942-c681-4814-9683-662f96a14a16"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aecf2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Szmidt","uuid":"A48A56E3949477FB8ED50E312E663404A0E0E1D32F2C70C6EB706F5770A09F55AB22F8A19313AF1B81523AED9D723C96758BE03FBFE8647EB9F11111BC7C4C70","documentHash":"594149c5-8dd2-4d23-ad8f-eaa065d540a7"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a047392988","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Koruba","uuid":"FEB77E7585C27F8F1384841F6167BCEFE2ED20D7EF0AB53FE03A3601823E848E0E4071A349EA058619546980AB5F0F9F98BE723907BEE9237C8922CDCBF3904E","documentHash":"38bfef6e-dbd7-46ea-a65e-064845fcd3ef"}],"objectId":"67583fb1fdbe835dc169e009","doi":"10.3390/en15010356","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/356/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Control Analysis with Modified LQR Method of Anti-Tank Missile with Vectorization of the Rocket Engine Thrust","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"This article approaches the issue of the optimal control of a hypothetical anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) with an innovative rocket engine thrust vectorization system. This is a highly non-linear dynamic system; therefore, the linearization of such a mathematical model requires numerous simplifications. For this reason, the application of a classic linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) for controlling such a flying object introduces significant errors, and such a model would diverge significantly from the actual object. This research paper proposes a modified linear-quadratic regulator, which analyzes state and control matrices in flight. The state matrix is replaced by a Jacobian determinant. The ATGM autopilot, through the LQR method, determines the signals that control the control surface deflection angles and the thrust vector via calculated Jacobians. This article supplements and develops the topics addressed in the authors’ previous work. Its added value includes the introduction of control in the flight direction channel and the decimation of the integration step, aimed at speeding up the computational processes of the second control loop, which is the LQR based on a linearized model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942b878c28a0473b7808","5e709241878c28a047392988","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40e0","5e7093ab878c28a0473aecf2","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40db"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"356","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942b878c28a0473b7808","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40db","5e7093ab878c28a0473aecf2","5e709241878c28a047392988","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40e0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c2dfca2467f057531dd187","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"35d7af3b-28f3-4dc0-94a1-73c4071fb0ad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anti-tank missile","thrust vectoring control","optimal control","linear-quadratic regulator","control actuation system"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060044395"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67584a4afdbe835dc16a9528","name":"Juraj","lastName":"Šrámek","documentHash":"745815ea-e80f-4180-8c48-346e74496f8a"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f67","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Buczyński","uuid":"3CA1989999C15098D31E3A9BDEA75784DAF2431887D016577BE2E10412C9A3AEC3F049688C765804DECD4212CFD55C6EA9CDE66214E00179C69DC4B91DA40F68","documentHash":"3a72b1b3-eaf1-4db1-b693-81c9a515a0db"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b130d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mazurek","uuid":"D73072A5CEBBB94E4759CF795C7A6E02B94BEA42961A288D78E7B134A4F8052901F1AD4217158756D36913FEC503E0C0CA79720366B108DCC31E848FAC80DF68","documentHash":"3182f2b5-56fb-4df7-9953-8dc9271045bb"}],"objectId":"67584a4afdbe835dc16a9527","doi":"10.3390/ma15248714","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/24/8714/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Composition Optimisation of Selected Waste Polymer-Modified Bitumen","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Waste plastomer disposal is currently a major challenge facing modern economies.

The entire experimental process followed the Plackett–Burman design. Rheological effects of modified bitumen were evaluated using the generalized Maxwell model. Microstructural analysis with epi-fluorescence microscopy showed the ability of plastomer-modified bitumen to obtain a fine-grained structure with a particle size of <10 μm. In addition, creep susceptibility (Jnr) was found to be statistically significantly dependent on the polymer type and particle size, rotational speed, and bitumen type. In turn, the particle dispersion structure in the bitumen matrix significantly depended on the rotational speed, plastomer particle size, and mixing temperature. Ultimately, the process of bitumen 70/100 modification was optimized. It was demonstrated, following the experimental design, that by using fine-grained PP for a temperature of 160 °C, rotational speed of about 6300 rpm and time of 105 min, it is possible to obtain modified bitumen with rheological properties very similar to those of modified bitumen PmB 45/80-55."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b130d","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f67"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"8714","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b130d","67584a4afdbe835dc16a9528","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f67"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639315f74097073c97873d18","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"24","documentHash":"26e776ff-de84-4cbf-87e8-cdf1e69a13ae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["waste plastomer;","composition optimisation;","rheology;","modified bitumen;","Plackett–Burman experimental design"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060044417"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55fe","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Stępień","uuid":"C7D51F6D720363290ED5821C6898D35FEF6CAD1DD1981081E4EF84C5E99AB567C7A55F5187DEEAE837E503197F66F0FED560598206A23BE8BFCB6589B7439C3D","documentHash":"c085da5c-90d7-4eba-b854-813dc03a3a07"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55f7","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Spychał","uuid":"C1A6D834FB53A1C5CB1A4737C8116FF7DB265E74665B270E9E08AF6D71EDB4790E97557400EA7FC01488791EF045BDB6F5731587435C7D39D64184E294CB7FD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-7797-7245","documentHash":"82f8e3ea-ac6b-4001-b5ae-fa850fcfaac8"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aecac","name":"Karol","lastName":"Skowera","uuid":"2D8BDABB78B31D9F0A304792D93A6EE72DAC1BE397E63A417DC45A13B63D77EB83749120E98AEC34BFDBA904B97FF0DA612693565A399BDFA39860448C2C133F","documentHash":"c183ec5f-7839-498c-b615-8954b9cbb468"}],"objectId":"67583a1cfdbe835dc1695f73","doi":"10.3390/ma15217820","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/21/7820/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Comparative Study on Hygric Properties and Compressive Strength of Ceramic Bricks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article analyzes the results of capillary rise, compressive strength and water absorption tests on solid ceramic bricks from existing structures and demolition materials taken from 11 different structures.

In addition, on the basis of the results obtained in the study, compared with the literature data, it can be deduced that ceramic bricks with a water absorption coefficient of less than 50 g/m2s0.5 are characterized by a compressive strength of more than 80 MPa. As the research shows, the properties of bricks even from a single building can differ one from another, which can result in varying durability even within a single building.

The tests showed the presence of pores with a size in the range of 0.1 ÷ 100 μm, and the volume of voids in the material was determined at the level of about 20% for the sample modified with glass sand (GS) and for the reference sample made of traditional silicate brick. In order to complete the research on the internal structure of autoclaved bricks, microstructure studies were performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM).

Two paving grade bitumen were used as a base material – a 35/50 and 50/70 paving grade bitumen binders. The investigation involved subjecting the asphalt binders to short-term ageing using rolling thin-film oven test protocol in temperatures ranging from 123 ◦C to 163 ◦C to simulate the effects of lowered processing temperatures in warm mix asphalt techniques. The testing methods included standard classification tests, basic evaluation of foaming performance, dynamic viscosity testing, evaluation of high temperature stiffness and non-recoverable compliance using a dynamic shear rheometer as well as evaluation of changes in chemical composition of the binders using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The results have shown that waterfoaming of asphalt binders incorporating the liquid warm mix additive led to an additional, significant drop in their dynamic viscosity in the mixing and compaction temperature range, while no significant effects to the performance-related characteristics of the binders were observed. It was found that the small changes in asphalt binder rheology caused by water-foaming were reverted in the course of laboratory short-term ageing. The process of water foaming has induced measurable changes in the chemical structure of the investigated binders associated traditionally with oxidative ageing, however these did not affect the results after the short-term laboratory ageing using the rolling thin-film oven test protocol. Based on the conducted work it was concluded that the simultaneous use of water-foaming and the liquid warm mix additive should not have permanent effects on the performance of the investigated asphalt binders, while enabling enhanced coating and workability of the asphalt mixtures produced in lowered temperatures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709382878c28a0473ab860","5e709297878c28a0473989a3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"341","pagesFromTo":"127756","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709297878c28a0473989a3","5e709382878c28a0473ab860","67585057fdbe835dc16aefd0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777d3","mniswId":"4336","title":"Construction and Building Materials","issn":"0950-0618","eissn":"0950-0618","documentHash":"c45e8eee-1b27-4448-9846-76627aa99baf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"629602024097072fefbab92f","year":"2022","volume":"341","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"3261690e-87bf-46bb-afa9-497726302634"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Foamed bitumen","Liquid WMA additive","Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy","Dynamic shear rheometer","Multiple stress creep recovery","RTFOT"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060044570"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b16af","name":"Damian","lastName":"Frej","uuid":"9B4F05C9B24E5D14A0A10379F44789EBD6B252F050C14C698D50E9A5AD79AF8A508B726C46C73A4865767A734EDEDAA61C313142C45ECE89D65A21106AFF6D86","documentHash":"01b718c7-e24a-4a8a-8b51-a3d680cb1fc0"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aecee","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Grabski","uuid":"2940A5AD2C523DBC2A167A3EC8869EA251972691B66C0A2B7D3F2FA227B9B6C1F32438164AB6317C74890A04CDB7C1B23F9235E33830E41DE63A74734563A6AA","documentHash":"76b40301-782f-4aec-bffb-6051804d6500"},{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f69d","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Szumska","uuid":"586DC273D8FB3B03215D8F89946941421ACEEE38A421B4187F42B9D3CC118063D37FEFACEEA39B0909D99BA9033987A2D08DFC82D0EC3558679381BED697037B","documentHash":"ca2b7d02-7439-41a5-bad2-0c54cfa33de5"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ae9","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jurecki","uuid":"CB52D03B369410C57F329E005514F4A94BC43959428B45315AC01EAE524292C0E06AC42CA965513AF7EE8DDCC787BC188E3E11F91A41A39071BE402C5224FA1E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0105-1283","documentHash":"b97d0db1-5e79-43e4-9539-e3ae10777384"}],"objectId":"67582335fdbe835dc16640c2","doi":"10.3390/s23063125","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/6/3125/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Experimental Study on Longitudinal Acceleration of Urban Buses and Coaches in Different Road Maneuvers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A vehicle’s longitudinal acceleration is a parameter often used for determining vehicle motion dynamics. This parameter can also be used to evaluate driver behavior and passenger comfort analysis. The paper presents the results of longitudinal acceleration tests of city buses and coaches recorded during rapid acceleration and braking maneuvers. The presented test results demonstrate that longitudinal acceleration is significantly affected by road conditions and surface type. In addition, the paper presents the values of longitudinal accelerations of city buses and coaches during their regular operation. These results were obtained on the basis of registration of vehicle traffic parameters in a continuous and long-term manner. The test results showed that the maximum deceleration values recorded during the tests of city buses and coaches in real traffic conditions were much lower than the maximum deceleration values found during sudden braking maneuvers. This proves that the tested drivers in real conditions did not have to use sudden braking. The maximum positive acceleration values recorded in acceleration maneuvers were slightly higher than the acceleration values logged during the rapid acceleration tests on the track."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ef878c28a04739f69d","5e7093ab878c28a0473aecee","5e7093d4878c28a0473b16af","5e709261878c28a047394ae9"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"3125","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d4878c28a0473b16af","5e7093ab878c28a0473aecee","5e709261878c28a047394ae9","5e7092ef878c28a04739f69d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-8220","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"91062cb9-24b0-4df6-9558-eaa12e105cea"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"640b3317409707703599f72f","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"23","number":"6","documentHash":"e07b72b2-b44e-4f70-9605-a698806bece5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["vehicle dynamics and stability","longitudinal acceleration","vehicle testing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060044625"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55e9","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Linek","uuid":"1E4687803CA120A34C77D1F90211AEF11E23B8ADCEC1424615078F8F68FBFDBDD11C7BB07F9025797E4FFB2C361F99219CE7BC1A02D824431A3CE883BA961B04","orcidId":"0000-0003-1583-4377","documentHash":"95c7aecd-97d8-48ed-b4aa-47df2df71759"}],"objectId":"67583ecafdbe835dc169c374","doi":"10.3390/ma15103673","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/10/3673/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Airport Cement Concrete with Ceramic Dust of Increased Thermal Resistance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The impact of aircraft on airport pavements is varied and closely related to their operational durability. The article presents the impact of the annealing process related to the forced impact of airplanes on airport pavements. The composition of cement concrete with ceramic dust, which is characterized by increased thermal resistance, has been proposed. Two research cycles were programmed, differentiated by the annealing scheme and the way in which the temperature influences the annealing time. Samples stored at a temperature of 20 ± 2 °C were subjected to testing. The tests were carried out for two diagrams: A and B. The first—diagram A—included the continuous impact of the flue gas stream on the samples for a period of 350 min with a test step every 25 min. For the second—diagram B—the samples were alternately heated (1 min) and cooled (15 min). The influence of the proposed pavement mix on changes in the internal structure of cement concrete and the increase in its resistance to high temperatures was determined. In the microstructure of the CC-1 concrete matrix, it was found that there were plate-granular portlandite crystals up to 10 µm in size and ettringite crystals with a length of 8 µm. In the CC-2 concrete, the ettringite crystals were less numerous and had a length of up to 5 µm, there were also continuous contact zones between the aggregate grains and the cement matrix (diagrams A). The alternating annealing/cooling (diagram B) resulted in the ettringite crystals in the CC-1 matrix being up to 10 µm long, and in the CC-2 concrete up to 7 µm long. The contact zone between the aggregate grain and the matrix in CC-2 concrete was continuous, and the microcracks in CC-1 concrete were up to 8 nm. Regardless of the heating diagram, in the surface zone, there were larger microcracks in the CC-1 concrete than in the CC-2 concrete. For diagram A they were 14 µm and 4 µm and for diagram B they were 35 µm and 5 µm, respectively. It was found that concrete with ceramic dust is characterized by a lower and more stable temperature increase. In scheme A, the average temperature increase on the heated surface ranged from 46 °C to 79.5 °C for CC-1 concrete, and from 33.3 °C to 61.3 °C for CC-2 concrete. However, in scheme B, the temperature after 350 heating cycles for CC-1 concrete increased to 129.8 °C, and for CC-2 concrete to 116.6 °C. After the cooling period, the temperature of CC-1 and CC-2 concrete was comparable and amounted to 76.4 C and 76.3 °C, respectively. CC-2 concrete heats to lower values, and favorable changes in internal structure translate into higher strength and durability (after 350 heating cycles according to scheme A, the strength of CC-1 concrete was 67.1 MPa and of CC-2 concrete 83.9 MPa, while in scheme B, respectively, 55.4 MPa for CC-1 and 75 MPa for CC-2)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55e9"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"3673","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55e9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6284e12540970712d1b6b425","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"10","documentHash":"b0a1ad1b-16fc-47b8-9af3-51a064786eca"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["airport pavements;","cement concrete pavements;","durability of the concrete surfaces"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060044762"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6758555dfdbe835dc16bb0ad","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Kuźniak","documentHash":"fae7caa8-dc91-438f-845a-9e78857f2e81"},{"objectId":"5e7094e0878c28a0473c5e24","name":"Artur","lastName":"Pawelec","uuid":"6A747D4FA399D814011C540E69C8A08F7ECCCDC02604E8480F0B64A98E4EE552A283FB75E411571F5C69B58AC3BA26514196291E9ACFE6EF50B52855D33595AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2235-6601","documentHash":"43b7e61f-ee95-484e-a09f-b9834e176076"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c59","name":"Artur","lastName":"Bartosik","uuid":"DF753864CEA4E3EC0E676854A99EF574AA6ACD565A1F4C43C06EAD53691E2BB1E7E329FF2CBE7D2A367F2D19EFE77FEB08BE35B00F2AB69A531DF9648AA9DAD5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2201-9135","documentHash":"ee1e98ce-faf3-4899-b401-f73a4a5423ae"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a047394396","name":"Marek","lastName":"Pawełczyk","uuid":"3D41C4A47DEF46D866ABAED53DF7CBF87678BFCB358CEB13C79112B7E0111351E2C1767722160147BCA8AD5C32A6850964441081BD2CF974524C2BB6B80F39B8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8668-6343","documentHash":"797f5681-960c-42cc-b0a2-e76e35675334"}],"objectId":"6758555dfdbe835dc16bb0ac","doi":"10.3390/en15134793","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/13/4793/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Determination of the Electricity Storage Power and Capacity for Cooperation with the Microgrid Implementing the Peak Shaving Strategy in Selected Industrial Enterprises","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The capacity limitations of distribution networks, the increasing demands for electricity installation in terms of electricity quality parameters, and the development of electromobility all increase the need to implement systems in order to stabilize and regulate loads for end users. Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs), that operate in internal microgrids of enterprises, allow smoothing of electrical power consumption profiles by actively reducing peak demand power. By using BESSs to implement a peak shaving strategy to reduce the peak power consumption of a company in an external network, energy efficiency can be improved by reducing contractual capacity. The aim of this study is to determine the conditions for the use of energy storage, in order to implement a peak shaving strategy for which the installation of the enterprise microgrid is economically efficient. The analysis of the operating conditions of the BESS should take into account the size of the energy storage, the characteristics of the demand profile for the demand systems, the charges related to electricity, and the costs of electricity storage. In the study, the size of the energy storage was related to the power and electrical capacity of the BESS that was used to implement the peak shaving strategy. The article presents the results of research on the method for determining an effective capacity and power of BESSs for enterprise microgrid systems. The technical and cost limitations of the actual microgrid system, which affected the decrease in economic efficiency of the peak shaving strategy in the company research, were taken into account.

In the paper, the results of rheological measurements of tested hydromixtures after the application of deflocculant consisting of waste product from the lime production process in the form of mineral particles and commonly known dispersant were presented. Calculations of pressure drop including hydromixtures with volume concentrations in the range of 21.30–50.00%, and density ranging from 1140–1410 kg/m3 in a pipeline of 200 mm diameter are presented. A decrease in friction losses in the flow in the pipeline of hydromixtures with different mass concentrations after the addition of deflocculant was observed. The study revealed that the addition of deflocculant resulted in a reduction of friction in the pipeline, enabling the pumping of hydromixtures with twice higher solids concentrations than originated from industrial installation, with a lower volumetric flow rate. This resulted in a decrease of the power consumption of the motor driving the pump, and obtained significant energy savings in the hydromixture transport process. The maximum energy saving achieved was equal to 58%."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a04739665b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"3869","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927a878c28a04739665b","67585142fdbe835dc16af743"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"628e8bcc40970776244ff94c","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"11","documentHash":"b0a985af-2c64-4798-9de3-8fac95360440"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydrotransport","energy savings","Bingham plastic fluids","deflocculant","pressure drop"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060045039"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67583d3afdbe835dc1699d92","name":"Edoardo","lastName":"Proverbio","documentHash":"69465610-d264-4090-8bf9-fc63a5270519"},{"objectId":"5e709414878c28a0473b5dcd","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Krampikowska","uuid":"B4F1E4237373169BFC2CC13C9221EC12FED6469BC107A3835FF1DB228E9F5F9B40E07A537983FF69A83D6F999FAEC260A702B1A7C1A54693ECDE5A9D127E2EBC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1784-9989","documentHash":"1e2e39a2-272c-4093-9478-a03695534920"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aec98","name":"Anna","lastName":"Adamczak-Bugno","uuid":"372B9EADED410A688DB9C08120834A882ED3590906F8991A75B15558224FA764A3F839B16D2B49F477BCD4192742CE39F80A7AF499DD98BE858B68866921ED8B","documentHash":"781e4dc6-f6eb-4e58-939f-a7b558527fa8"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393f26","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Świt","uuid":"4D48CCEC8A6BE8C2F35B270CD615BE289F175D12AC120292251C7043DA0F4B384F364D1A4A782CF0B1A67A9F5772526D00B62DD42845B9478C78278C3A3E1FA6","orcidId":"0000-0003-0392-5239","documentHash":"0354990e-4f11-42b0-a35f-96f1eca6fff1"}],"objectId":"67583d3afdbe835dc1699d91","doi":"10.3390/ma15165757","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/16/5757/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Analysis of the Significance of Changes in the Number and Energy Parameters of Acoustic Emission Signals on the Assessment of the Strength of Fibre–Cement Boards","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents the results of three-point bending tests carried out for samples cut from full-size fibre–cement boards subjected to typical and exceptional conditions. The tests were carried out with the simultaneous acquisition of acoustic emission signals. It has been noted that some factors significantly deteriorate the strength parameters of the samples as well as cause the occurrence of differences in the number of acoustic emission signals of various classes and their energy parameters. A statistical analysis was carried out in order to repeat the relationship between the strength parameters of the samples and the acoustic emission parameters. Based on the research, it was found that the MOR bending strength for specimens exposed to fire and high temperature is more than 50% lower than for air-dried specimens and specimens exposed to water. The increased number of freeze–thaw cycles also has an impact on the strength of the specimens. Components exposed to more than 10 freeze–thaw cycles had a strength more than 30% smaller than the reference specimens soaked in water and exposed to bath-drying cycles. A similar dependency was indicated by the number of signals of the individual classes, their energy parameters and their frequencies. The number, strength, duration and frequency also decreased along with the increase in the test case number. On this basis, conclusions were drawn concerning the suitability of acoustic emission for the evaluation of the strength of fibre–cement elements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aec98","5e709256878c28a047393f26","5e709414878c28a0473b5dcd"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"5757","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aec98","5e709256878c28a047393f26","5e709414878c28a0473b5dcd","67583d3afdbe835dc1699d92"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ffa0e040970761e7670615","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"16","documentHash":"fe3db8ed-c332-4529-9498-a24aa517c04f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fibre–cement composites;","acoustic emission method;","statistical analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060054567"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67595dfbfdbe83757db1c59d","name":"Roman","lastName":"Radchenko","documentHash":"d8366def-63e4-4d99-8399-507a352dc12d"},{"objectId":"67595dfbfdbe83757db1c59c","name":"Eugeniy","lastName":"Trushliakov","documentHash":"4e64fa00-8bbe-42a4-9b59-76256b7e13f5"},{"objectId":"67595dfbfdbe83757db1c59b","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Radchenko","documentHash":"bcafe77e-e324-40a6-bfec-a154da5b014e"},{"objectId":"67595dfbfdbe83757db1c59a","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Radchenko","documentHash":"8bbff8ff-5a35-4c3f-920a-84d403cfabef"},{"objectId":"602dfdc19543c7410626e9d0","name":"Anatoliy","lastName":"Pavlenko","uuid":"A61C8C004FA37D6FF13BD3EC262A2FED8AF1F349EACA2FCA1DDDAEDBC394D0B22A55E66BB9A5BD1D0361853FE89DBFE254603C009955917825EE9BEDBD177239","documentHash":"0052f635-7d44-4d8d-ae4e-7e2bd443517a"}],"objectId":"67595dfbfdbe83757db1c599","doi":"10.3390/en16052417","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/5/2417/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Advanced Method of Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) System Design to Forecast on Site Operation—Part 3: Optimal Solutions to Minimize Sizes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Outdoor air conditioning systems (ACS) are used as autonomic systems as well as in combined outdoor and indoor ACS of the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) type, with variable speed compressors (VSC) as their advanced version. Methods for determining the optimal value of refrigeration capacity and providing the maximum rate of the summarized annual refrigeration energy generation increment, according to its needs at minimum compressor sizes and rational values, are applied to reveal the reserves for reducing the designed (installed) refrigeration capacity, thus enabling us to practically achieve maximum annual refrigeration energy generation as the primary criterion at the second stage of the general design methodology previously developed by the authors. The principle of sharing the total thermal load on the ACS between the ranges of changeable loads for outdoor air precooling, and a relatively stable load range for further processing air are used as its basis. According to this principle, the changeable thermal load range is chosen as the object for energy saving by recuperating the excessive refrigeration generated at lowered loading in order to compensate for the increased loads, thereby matching actual duties at a reduced designed refrigeration capacity. The method allows us to determine the corresponding level of regulated loads (LRL) of SRC and the load range of compressor operation to minimize

An important aspect of the research proposed in the article is the use of a hybrid method of analysis, which involves complementing the results of strength tests, the results of numerical calculations and the results of strain distributions recorded with a digital image correlation system (DIC System, in this research GOM Suite optical system). The operation of the concrete material under load, depending on the amount of fibres added, is reflected in the recorded acoustic emission (AE) signals. The differences concern the number of signals of individual classes and their distribution over time. The differences exist for both low and high load values, which confirms the possibility of using the acoustic emission method to monitor the condition of the material. It was shown that the numerically determined effective stress levels decreased as the proportion of steel fibres in the concrete increased, while the maximum levels of the first principal stresses increased. During the analyses, a preliminary comparison of the deformation results obtained using the finite element method and the DIC System was also carried out."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aec98","5e7093ab878c28a0473aec83"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"7268","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aec98","5e7093ab878c28a0473aec83","67594a88fdbe83757db0af17","67594a88fdbe83757db0af18"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6347eb00409707021ae3b69b","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"20","documentHash":"890f5e36-5b50-46d2-abc6-661a228551fb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fibre concrete;","steel fibres;","acoustic emission method;","numerical analysis;","DIC System"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060054737"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67594901fdbe83757db065bc","name":"Michal","lastName":"Brázda","documentHash":"504b519f-0a53-49f3-81e5-36494baa5cfb"},{"objectId":"67594901fdbe83757db065bb","name":"Jaromír","lastName":"Dlouhý","documentHash":"89dd3edf-5fc8-4794-8457-f53f6837f5c0"},{"objectId":"67594901fdbe83757db065ba","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Rzepa","documentHash":"b48590b6-f330-4de7-b614-896a6672fbf4"},{"objectId":"67594901fdbe83757db065b9","name":"Martina","lastName":"Koukolíková","documentHash":"91d818ea-49ee-453e-bf0b-bb7d855805cf"},{"objectId":"67594901fdbe83757db065b8","name":"Ján","lastName":"Džugan","documentHash":"4ffd7768-d401-4647-aedc-fae871e414ec"},{"objectId":"67594901fdbe83757db065b7","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Melzer","documentHash":"df6acc23-0aed-4a1f-9cc3-2158e57cf1bf"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aecf0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Bucki","uuid":"F09C9F8707A1E96AAC48C386D205C3C090DE215B6CC004A5523DC64B0BEA32AF5F69EDB1702F46ABF79FA438A4A8CFDFAA4CBF36D6F3F4B823D1DB1597968E7B","documentHash":"5dc72ae1-e16e-4d01-aca1-7f5444e8726e"}],"objectId":"67594901fdbe83757db065b5","doi":"10.1080/17452759.2022.2073793","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17452759.2022.2073793","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Fracture characterisation of vertically build functionally graded 316L stainless steel with Inconel 718 deposited by directed energy deposition process","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Functionally graded materials (FGM) are a very promising group of technical materials.

This paper deals with the fabrication of a graded material based on 316L and IN718 in combination with vertically oriented interfaces between single materials zones. Critical defects were observed in the microstructure as a result of solidification cracking. Mini tensile test results showed that the 316L/IN718 interface and 316L in ZYX (vertical) orientation are the weakest points of the produced material. Fractographic analysis revealed that all specimens in the YZX testing direction exhibit the solidification cracking propagated along the grain boundaries with a detrimental effect on the strength of the 316L/IN718 interface. Results of the current study were confronted with previous results obtained for horizontally deposited combination of materials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aecf0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"821-840","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67594901fdbe83757db065b7","67594901fdbe83757db065b8","67594901fdbe83757db065b9","67594901fdbe83757db065ba","67594901fdbe83757db065bb","67594901fdbe83757db065bc","5e7093ab878c28a0473aecf0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d5cc","mniswId":"20148","title":"Virtual and Physical Prototyping","issn":"1745-2759","eissn":"1745-2767","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fd6e0053-5ecf-455a-82a5-cd4d1cee6e4d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67594901fdbe83757db065b6","year":"2022","volume":"17","number":"4","documentHash":"cfb995a6-9f5e-44b4-ba1a-4c3de1a1f64a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Directed energy deposition","functionally graded composites","multi-material interface","miniaturised test techniques"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060054753"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c17","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Różowicz","uuid":"9B54871DC690BE0DBD5E6B983581A4DD4B2223E3837ACF885B6502CBA9BF36C9FC4F6AC676E6B5FA211AABF845380F086E04ECDBB15DBE119C851943E43F82CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-3614-9654","documentHash":"82fe358a-1b45-4394-9492-535e8d59101e"},{"objectId":"5e709253878c28a047393bd9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Zawadzki","uuid":"22C6BFFFDAA71C3D9F5CF743530B7E587EA5BE6BBC32535355493F70D97ECF17A87DD44EFB620DA8FED023538A2C158400CFBCC4D51C8EF748F3C696187C0B65","documentHash":"b510ac52-5a03-4c5d-8305-b9c130f4b867"},{"objectId":"5e709247878c28a047392f0e","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Różowicz","uuid":"2D9F55AF317C57EC053999A5BFF8668E40B032926F47E13942F48F7EE528D4C688F2ACF72937C851559274639A4EC071ED64C521950D4E594E80624CEC99786F","documentHash":"92100ea3-83d3-4c44-b38b-f866af8c8dc7"},{"objectId":"5e709247878c28a047392ef8","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Włodarczyk","uuid":"BE8A44ED2D6D9C89B58CE943FC146ADA9024DC81F4ACA989C6CB060CCF575C8747D7FB6ACCEDF0AAC5A42BCDF5920E159191911A5D6518E87165290E7D1A1DD3","documentHash":"d2c3a6c0-e5ff-48d3-a56d-9d1018d36a2d"}],"objectId":"67594d27fdbe83757db0de08","doi":"10.3390/en15010337","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/337/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Modeling of Internal Combustion Engine Ignition Systems with a Circuit Containing Fractional-Order Elements","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper discusses the research and analysis of the dynamics of high-voltage generating systems.

Before the printed tool was first used, it was examined to determine its dimensional and geometric accuracy, surface roughness, and surface structure. The measurement data showed that the tool required machining, e.g., grinding, to improve its geometry because the total runout of the shank and the cutting edge radius were too high, amounting to 120 μm and 217 μm, respectively.

The magnetisation characteristics of the rotor steel and the stator at different field strength ranges were considered at the design stage and mathematically described using a model in Matlab. The detailed calculations and the design of the planar model were carried out using FEMM software. The high-quality results obtained from the calculations shown in the paper made it possible to make a real model of the generator. This paper presents views of the stator package, the rotor, the entire generator and selected test results. The parameter of this turbine that distinguishes it from a wide range of manufactured generators is its low, non-standard rotational speed and low breakaway torque, which allows the power plant to start in winds of approximately 2 m/s. Other advantages of this generator is its low weight resulting from the use of a light rotor and light alloys for the generator housing"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c17","5e709247878c28a047392f0e","5e70927e878c28a047396b7c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"3826","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c17","5e70927e878c28a047396b7c","5e709247878c28a047392f0e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"627ce1574097075f6793a660","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"10","documentHash":"0cd845d7-5bef-4b96-9932-45a546ab0729"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cogging torque minimization","rotational speed","steel magnetisation","domestic wind turbine","magnet machines"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060054925"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ac878c28a0473aed05","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Janus-Gałkiewicz","uuid":"BEA9670C9203122904173C7F354649575FB09054CF693DD2F9F0FAF88B792D0F55811CD990CC7C8877D8621B6548F08C48DFBEC37CE4302FFFF6AE57D8E5FFEF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4910-6941","documentHash":"38235725-1906-46d2-bf44-413484369382"},{"objectId":"5e709244878c28a047392af4","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Takosoglu","uuid":"51A756CA8917C3691C2DD1B18517204429BFA356B60057DC179C9DF39C87C5DC8105B14E0FC3D114533D772A831413AF54600E60E74F06BE4558FA422B08FB34","orcidId":"0000-0003-0606-039X","documentHash":"2405f4f7-02b3-4970-96ec-253de89acb67"},{"objectId":"5e709244878c28a047392ad2","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Gałkiewicz","uuid":"70FB7EA02BA5B61708016254EA1C1C0E3860EBB930D966AA3D6B2BE052B1C5460FE5D5CE57A75F4D770C4C6554FD99E261A0C514887BDDD8419C2A911290777E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7659-0946","documentHash":"29d5099b-bcf0-4ea9-ab8e-1447ea629430"}],"objectId":"67583961fdbe835dc16949a3","doi":"10.3390/en15228482","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/22/8482/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Design of a 2-DoF Planar Parallel Manipulator with an Electro-Pneumatic Servo-Drive","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the design of a planar parallel manipulator with a pneumatic drive.\nSuch manipulators are used in production lines for sorting, selecting, packing, and palletizing\nworkpieces.

This article discusses digital twin technology as a support for sustainable development based on the analysis of microgrid structures. Digital twins allow the creation of virtual models of physical systems. This capability facilitated the accurate replication of the microgrid model at Kielce University of Technology using ETAP (Electrical Transient Analyzer Program) software (version 22.5). The operational parameters of the microgrid structure were analyzed for the examined power range of the photovoltaic installation to determine the possibilities of expanding the existing installation. The impact of the photovoltaic installation’s power on the operational parameters of the microgrid structure was visualized, and final conclusions were formulated. Moreover, the integration of digital twin technology into renewable energy systems not only enhances operational efficiency but also plays a pivotal role in advancing sustainability objectives. Through real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance, digital twin technology facilitates the optimization of energy production and distribution, thereby reducing waste and contributing to the overall sustainability of energy systems. This technology enables the simulation of various scenarios, such as fluctuations in energy demand or the integration of new renewable sources, which can inform more sustainable decision-making processes. In the context of microgrids, digital twin technology ensures that energy production is closely aligned with consumption patterns, minimizing energy losses and enhancing grid resilience. Furthermore, digital twin technology supports the sustainable expansion of renewable installations by providing detailed insights into potential environmental impacts and the long-term sustainability of various energy configurations. As the demand for clean energy continues to grow, digital twin technology will be indispensable in achieving a balance between energy needs and environmental stewardship, ensuring that the expansion of renewable energy sources contributes positively to global sustainability objectives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709256878c28a047393ec5","634626a97523402e34117675","5e709466878c28a0473bc262","5e7094e0878c28a0473c5e24"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"9366","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094e0878c28a0473c5e24","5e709466878c28a0473bc262","634626a97523402e34117675","5e709256878c28a047393ec5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff3f8ad49b31ccec0f80e","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","documentHash":"4055bfb8-4fdb-408c-b314-7aa556a417fb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67457ea7fdbe832eab8e9b38","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"21","documentHash":"1376c99b-ee6b-4368-b716-743753f569ea"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["digital twin; microgrid;","sustainable development;","sustainable technology;","energy sustainability;","photovoltaic installation;","operational parameters"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060054996"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fdd19543c7233654375e","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Salwa","uuid":"547D1D3F1422B3CF9FC5E6B2E57455416D0D83C516055F37108FDB260288FC09B74536B5CB0E70F7B3A984E9A132BA4EA1424D348F0A252E96C2594EA703B8F7","documentHash":"80fe07dc-33c0-4cd8-befc-4075ad2e27af"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394aab","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Krzysztofik","uuid":"6D8260F87BC42C7C5F12EED6799F6F1A3206D1C071CCF34F2CEBE32A0FF3E27240D7021CA45FBC280CB3DF15F672905C3E4B5BF1DE034B5B9D9F8A0CA93A7A66","orcidId":"0000-0002-1188-6228","documentHash":"2f35900d-5707-4853-844b-c87c4874c1c6"}],"objectId":"67581d50fdbe835dc165f327","doi":"10.3390/s22041677","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/4/1677/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Application of Filters to Improve Flight Stability of Rotary Unmanned Aerial Objects","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The most common filters used to determine the angular position of quadrotors are the Kalman filter and the complementary filter. The problem of angular position estimation consist is a result of the absence of direct data. The most common sensors on board UAVs are micro electro mechanical system (MEMS) type sensors. The data acquired from the sensors are processed using digital filters. In the literature, the results of research conducted on the effectiveness of Kalman and complementary filters are known. A significant problem in evaluating the performance of the studied filters was the lack of an arbitrarily determined UAV position. The authors of this paper undertook the task of determining the best filter for a real object. The main objective of this research was to improve the stability of the physical quadrotor. For this purpose, we developed a research method using a laboratory station for testing quadrotor drones. Moreover, using the MATLAB environment, they determined the optimal parameters for the real filter applied using the PX4 software, which is new and has not been considered before in the available scientific literature. It should be mentioned that the authors of this work focused on the analysis of filters most commonly used for flight stabilization, without modifying the structure of these filters. By not modifying the filter structure, it is possible to optimize the existing flight controllers. The main contribution of this study lies in finding the most optimal filter, among those available in flight controllers, for angular position estimation. The special emphasis of our work was to develop a procedure for selecting the filter coefficients for a real object. The algorithm was designed so that other researchers could use it, provided they collected arbitrary data for their objects. Selected results of the research are presented in graphical form.

As the surface waviness of the bearing race is of key importance, the present paper aims at evaluating how the individual technological operations of the rolling bearing ring production process affect the formation of their surface waviness. The surface waviness of the bearing race was measured in both directions (two sections), i.e., along the circumference using the Talyrond 365 measurement system and across the circumference of the race using Talysurf PGI. The production of 6308-2z rolling bearings made of AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) 52100 bearing steel was analyzed. The occurrence of the phenomenon of technological heredity in the production of rolling bearings was observed. The research results indicate that the turning operation reduces the surface waviness of the bearing rings obtained after forging, while the heat treatment causes a slight increase in surface waviness. On the other hand, grinding operation significantly reduces the waviness, with this reduction being greater for the outer ring. Furthermore, the research has shown that the waviness of the surface is an inheritance factor caused by individual operations of the rolling bearing rings manufacturing process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709435878c28a0473b8385"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"3959","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709435878c28a0473b8385"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6295b3cc4097072fefb74088","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"11","documentHash":"b066bfae-fcff-47c9-8466-ac1c5e38c744"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rolling bearings;","surface waviness;","technological heredity;","100Cr6;","AISI 52100 steel"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060055096"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f69d","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Szumska","uuid":"586DC273D8FB3B03215D8F89946941421ACEEE38A421B4187F42B9D3CC118063D37FEFACEEA39B0909D99BA9033987A2D08DFC82D0EC3558679381BED697037B","documentHash":"ca2b7d02-7439-41a5-bad2-0c54cfa33de5"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ae9","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jurecki","uuid":"CB52D03B369410C57F329E005514F4A94BC43959428B45315AC01EAE524292C0E06AC42CA965513AF7EE8DDCC787BC188E3E11F91A41A39071BE402C5224FA1E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0105-1283","documentHash":"b97d0db1-5e79-43e4-9539-e3ae10777384"}],"objectId":"67582786fdbe835dc1668938","doi":"10.3390/en15249369","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/24/9369/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Analysis of Energy Recovered during the Braking of an Electric Vehicle in Different Driving Conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The partial recovery of kinetic energy during braking allows the vehicle’s battery to be\nadditionally charged and thus extends the range of an electric vehicle.

Simulation tests revealed that the levels of energy recovered during braking\nin an electric vehicle were the highest in urban conditions. The amount of energy recovered during\nurban driving can account for 20% of the total trip energy. In driving conditions characterized by\ndifferent intensities caused by trips at different times of the day, similar values of recovered energy\nwere recorded. When driving in the afternoon hours, the level of recovered energy per 1 km was\nabout 2% lower than when driving in rush hour conditions.

Because both aluminium and lithium ions increase the stability of reactive silica in the system with alkalis, it is possible to presume that the application of both corrosion inhibitors together will provide a synergistic effect in the ASR limitation. The paper presents the results of studies on the influence of combined application of metakaolin and lithium nitrate on the course of corrosion caused by the reaction of opal aggregate with alkalis. The potential synergistic effect was studied for the recommended amount of lithium nitrate, i.e., the Li/(Na + K) = 0.74 molar ratio and 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% of cement mass replacements with metakaolin. The effectiveness of the applied solution was studied by measurements of mortars expansion in an accelerated test, by microstructure observations, and by determination of the ASR gels composition by means of SEM-EDS. The influence of metakaolin and the chemical admixture on the compressive and flexural strengths of mortars after 28 and 90 days of hardening were also analysed. The results of the studies revealed a synergistic effect for mixtures containing metakaolin at 15% and 20% cement replacement and lithium nitrate admixture in alkali–silica reaction expansion tests. It was found that corrosion processes in mortars with 5 and 10% levels of metakaolin became more severe after adding a lithium admixture to mortars with metakaolin only. The obtained results were confirmed by observations of the mortars’ microstructures. There was no synergistic impact of lithium nitrate and metakaolin on compressive strength characteristics. The compressive strength of mortars containing a combination of metakaolin and lithium nitrate decreased both after 28 and after 90 days, compared to mortars with metakaolin alone."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709414878c28a0473b5dd4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"382","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709414878c28a0473b5dd4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a60d8940970715e70ecb77","year":"2022","volume":"16","number":"1","documentHash":"11a92e97-0d7e-425d-bcef-02fe810a18c7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alkali–silica reaction;","pozzolan;","lithium nitrate;","synergistic effect;","expansion;","microstructure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060057989"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d34","name":"Agata","lastName":"Ludynia","uuid":"CFE7EEF3789F21B5F21CCDDF40ED7CC047ADD521ABC0D0DA029A72ED556988C1415A5121394137E6AB8819AA8893DF461EC22F4271BACA93030C45C5E270E5E6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1876-9825","documentHash":"7fbe6cdc-a591-489e-a56b-3536a2259af7"},{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f759","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kowalik","uuid":"D743AE2ACD895A17DD7B7F5C0730644F44937F52BD76DF5931F920FF007B2BFB77D1FA58DD64555A9AA69C733C49980D4E5567E917F5F848A4370FD5C747CD70","documentHash":"b74a83ca-d12e-46ed-baf3-b792e10b49bc"}],"objectId":"67597057fdbe83757db33e68","doi":"10.3390/w15223992","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/22/3992/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of Heavy Metal Contaminants and Mobility in Sewage sludge-soil Mixtures for Sustainable Agricultural Practices","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential utilization of sewage sludge in agriculture, focusing on the assessment of heavy metal contaminants and their mobility in sewage sludge-soil mixtures.

This study demonstrates that the key to using sludge is to know the form of mobility of the metals present in the sludge and how they behave once they are introduced into the soil."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ef878c28a04739f759","5e709413878c28a0473b5d34"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"3992","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ef878c28a04739f759","5e709413878c28a0473b5d34"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water","issn":"2073-4441","eissn":"2073-4441","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"786ef469-6890-4f82-8160-9f545c27c509"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67597057fdbe83757db33e69","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"22","documentHash":"36c1de75-3af1-414b-87e7-c0d4119738b3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sewage sludge","heavy metals","soil","ecological indicators","mobility","sludge-soil mixture","environmental pollution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060058053"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67596033fdbe83757db1dad0","name":"Marek","lastName":"Matejka","documentHash":"a900bf89-93e6-4007-83ad-9da823c86ada"},{"objectId":"67596033fdbe83757db1dacf","name":"Michal","lastName":"Kuriš","documentHash":"4d308e29-9027-4123-97d2-034006da220b"},{"objectId":"67596033fdbe83757db1dace","name":"Dana","lastName":"Bolibruchová","documentHash":"e54f3453-7962-4462-bfab-d886660c5034"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa70","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Kasińska","uuid":"E484A7A36D2C42E369EBB13D02542BF94372382D490896E320E2407C0D45BE86CAAC36267C2A141F3F61B8BA9FEE7470D17C8DB3D6F8D6B0E0F5AE44B04F1B62","documentHash":"daa4d83c-ec7b-493b-9a15-9e3f5e39766a"}],"objectId":"67596033fdbe83757db1dacd","doi":"10.3390/ma15103709","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/10/3709/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Study of the Influence of Zirconium, Titanium and Strontium on the Properties and Microstructure of AlSi7Mg0.3Cu0.5 Alloy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the paper is to describe and specify the properties and microstructure of Al-Si alloy using Zr, a combination of Zr with elements used in the grafting of Al (Ti) alloys, and modification (Sr).

The experiment focused on the analysis of the synergistic effects of Zr with Ti and Zr with Sr on a AlSi7Mg0.3Cu0.5 alloy. The experimental alloys contained a constant Zr content of 0.15 wt. % and were alloyed with a gradual addition of Ti and Sr in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 wt. % for Ti, and 0.1 to 0.3 wt. % for Sr. The experimental samples were cast by meltable model casting technology. In variants with a constant addition of Zr 0.15 wt. % and a gradual addition of Ti, we observed an increase in the values of mechanical characteristics, with a significant decrease in ductility. When evaluating the structure of experimental alloys, Ti affected it by increasing the number of precipitated Zr phases. Experimental alloys with Zr and Sr addition were characterized by nucleation of Zr phases in angular morphology. It can be concluded that the investigated elements are expected to have a positive (strengthening) effect even at higher operating temperatures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b7878c28a0473afa70"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"3709","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67596033fdbe83757db1dace","67596033fdbe83757db1dacf","67596033fdbe83757db1dad0","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa70"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6284e12540970712d1b6b425","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"10","documentHash":"b0a1ad1b-16fc-47b8-9af3-51a064786eca"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Al-Si-Mg-Cu aluminum alloy;","investment casting;","zirconium;","microstructure;","mechanical properties"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060058146"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aeca8","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wdowiak-Postulak","uuid":"9FCBC253B278805311D3C66173D0FC1DC7821C423653976415E5CDD4F66D3F4D31F19CA5011810C2FE5B277E1659943DC56A83B28AED8E409B4396833EC64D60","documentHash":"2a48ee34-47e1-4f37-b1f1-8b4bf6549b07"}],"objectId":"67596134fdbe83757db1eae3","doi":"10.3390/ma15238303","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/23/8303/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Strengthening of Structural Flexural Glued Laminated Beams of Ashlar with Cords and Carbon Laminates","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Changes in the condition of existing timber structures can be caused by fatigue or biological attack, among other things. Replacing damaged timber is still very expensive, so it seems more advisable to repair or reinforce damaged elements. Therefore, in order to improve the static performance analysis of timber structures, reinforcement applications in timber elements are necessary. In this experimental study, technical-scale glulam beams measuring 82 × 162 × 3650 mm, which were reinforced with carbon strands and carbon laminates, were tested in flexure. A four-point bending test was used to determine the effectiveness of the reinforcement used in the timber beams. Internal strengthening (namely, glued carbon cords placed into cut grooves in the last and penultimate lamella) and an external surface of near-surface mounted (NSM) carbon laminates glued to the bottom surface of the beam were used to reinforce the laminated ashlar beams. As a result of this study, it was found that the bending-based mechanical properties of ash wood beams reinforced with carbon fibre-reinforced polymer composites were better than those of the reference beams. In this work, the beams were analysed in terms of the reinforcement variables used and the results were compared with those for the beams tested without reinforcement. This work proves the good behaviour of carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP—Carbon fibre reinforced polymer) cords when applied to timber beams and carbon laminates. This study illustrated the different reinforcement mechanisms and showed their structural properties. Compared to the reference samples, it was found that reinforcement with carbon strings or carbon laminates increased the load-bearing capacity, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity, and reduced the amount of displacement of the timber materials, which is an excellent alternative to the use of ashlar and, above all, inferior grade materials due to the current shortage of choice grade. Experimental results showed that, with the use of carbon fibre (carbon cords SikaWrap® FX-50 C—Sika Poland Sp. z o.o., Warsaw), the load bearing capacity increased by 35.58%, or with carbon cords SikaWrap® FX-50 C and carbon laminates S&P C-Laminate type HM 50/1.4 - S&P Poland Sp. z o.o., Malbork, by 45.42%, compared to the unreinforced beams."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aeca8"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"8303","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aeca8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637f5dab409707772c21ac4d","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"23","documentHash":"86e801ee-7679-47cf-9824-6e052aac6f91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["glued laminated beams","load-bearing capacity","fibre-reinforced timber","stiffness","ductility","modulus of elasticity","bending test","carbon cords","carbon laminates","knots"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060058153"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ac878c28a0473aed07","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Strząbała","uuid":"20256D975F20E9E8C5359D7FB74627E8C94552613D30038BB3EFF2EA5F0CA655EB1257D05E2707EFA6F5C3306445CB11E2D742420A4F19E7418AAB5571110E94","documentHash":"e1417478-e628-44c3-b9c5-3eba9de2c050"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392de3","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Wciślik","uuid":"C410A7F22F2868CE240DE2C057D89C31F479D39B27898CA43F8C9C4F1983143512F7DEB4B0096225A6463818AEAD78742AB62100F0531DADEE2B7034E1BCBF71","documentHash":"6f2d34b9-990a-4f5e-9e9d-146a768a6516"}],"objectId":"67596a25fdbe83757db2d009","doi":"10.15199/48.2023.01.44","publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/publikacja-141390-2023-1.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analiza numeryczna propagacji harmonicznych w obwodzie jednofazowym AC z obciążeniem nieliniowym","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Podstawowymi zniekształceniami współczesnych systemów elektroenergetycznych są składowe harmoniczne, wywoływane najczęściej przez obciążenie nieliniowe.

The technique, which combines traditional indentation tests with mapping the shape of the imprint, provides more data describing the material parameters. In this paper, such methodology is employed for estimating the selected material parameters described by Ramberg–Osgood’s law, i.e., Young’s modulus, the yield point, and the material hardening exponent. Two combined identification methods were used: the P-A procedure, in which the material parameters are identified on the basis of the coordinates of the indentation curves, and the P-C procedure, which uses the coordinates describing the imprint profile. The inverse problem was solved by neural networks. The results of numerical indentation tests—pairs of coordinates describing the indentation curves and imprint profiles—were used as input data for the networks. In order to reduce the size of the input vector, a simple and effective method of approximating the branches of the curves was proposed. In the results section, we show the performance of the approximation as a data reduction mechanism on a synthetic dataset. The sparse model generated by the presented approach is also shown to efficiently reconstruct the data while minimizing error in the prediction of the mentioned material parameters. Our approach appeared to consistently provide better performance on the testing datasets with considerably easier computation than the principal component analysis compression results available in the literature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940c878c28a0473b5619","5e70940b878c28a0473b55fa"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"4139","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940c878c28a0473b5619","5e70940b878c28a0473b55fa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b057f44097074bddacd5b7","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"12","documentHash":"3677635e-2979-4850-9364-5c25a6b52bc9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["parameter identification of material model","inverse analysis","indentation test","indentation curve","imprint profile","artificial neural networks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060058227"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67596cb5fdbe83757db30063","name":"Oleksandr M.

During nitriding, nitrocarburizing and carburization by ESA (CESA) processes, with an increase in the discharge energy (Wp), the thickness, micro hardness and continuity of the “white layer” coatings, as well as the magnitude of the surface roughness, increase due to saturation of the steel surface with nitrogen and/or carbon, high cooling rates, formation of non-equilibrium structures, formation of special phases, etc. In the course of nitriding, nitrocarburizing and CESA processing of steels C22 and C40, preliminary processing with the use of the ESA method by aluminum increases the thickness, microhardness and continuity of the “white layer”, while the roughness changes insignificantly. Analysis of the phase composition indicates that the presence of the aluminum sublayer leads to the formation of the aluminum-containing phases, resulting in a significant increase in the hardness and, in addition, in an increase in the thickness and quality of the surface layers. The proposed methods can be used to strengthen the surface layers of the critical parts and their elements for compressor and pumping equipment"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394ad3","5e709256878c28a047393e09","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40dc"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"6085","pagesFromTo":"1-14","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67596bb0fdbe83757db2eeea","67596bc2fdbe83757db2ef95","5e709256878c28a047393e09","5e709261878c28a047394ad3","67596c27fdbe83757db2f9aa","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40dc","5e70928e878c28a047397d98","67596cb5fdbe83757db30063"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"630c96334097075e8cd2fd7a","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"17","documentHash":"4dbae414-e20f-43bd-9dbd-9aaae1551f2f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electrospark alloying","coatings","roughness","structure","microhardness","continuity","X-ray diffraction analysis","nitriding","nitrocarburizing","carburization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060058245"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"675854a5fdbe835dc16bab30","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Kuźniak","documentHash":"ca51debd-ea18-4968-954b-0fe3961fb19f"},{"objectId":"5e7094e0878c28a0473c5e24","name":"Artur","lastName":"Pawelec","uuid":"6A747D4FA399D814011C540E69C8A08F7ECCCDC02604E8480F0B64A98E4EE552A283FB75E411571F5C69B58AC3BA26514196291E9ACFE6EF50B52855D33595AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2235-6601","documentHash":"43b7e61f-ee95-484e-a09f-b9834e176076"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c59","name":"Artur","lastName":"Bartosik","uuid":"DF753864CEA4E3EC0E676854A99EF574AA6ACD565A1F4C43C06EAD53691E2BB1E7E329FF2CBE7D2A367F2D19EFE77FEB08BE35B00F2AB69A531DF9648AA9DAD5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2201-9135","documentHash":"ee1e98ce-faf3-4899-b401-f73a4a5423ae"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a047394396","name":"Marek","lastName":"Pawełczyk","uuid":"3D41C4A47DEF46D866ABAED53DF7CBF87678BFCB358CEB13C79112B7E0111351E2C1767722160147BCA8AD5C32A6850964441081BD2CF974524C2BB6B80F39B8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8668-6343","documentHash":"797f5681-960c-42cc-b0a2-e76e35675334"}],"objectId":"675854a5fdbe835dc16bab2f","doi":"10.3390/en15155614","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/15/5614/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Determining the Power and Capacity of Electricity Storage in Cooperation with the Microgrid for the Implementation of the Price Arbitration Strategy of Industrial Enterprises Installation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The growing worldwide costs of energy produced as a result of conventional fuel combus- tion, the limited capacity of the distribution grid, and the growing number of unstable installations based on renewable energy sources increase the need to implement systems of stabilization and regulate loads for end users.

The temperature of the outer heated wall surface was measured using an infrared camera. During the experiments, two-phase flow structures were captured with a quick camera. Local heat transfer coefficients at the contact surface between the working fluid and the heated surface were determined with the use of a one-dimensional calculation method. To present the results, local temperature measurements and heat transfer coefficients, boiling curves and two-phase flow patterns are shown and analyzed. The results concerning two directions of vertical flow along mini-channels are discussed. Several modified heated surfaces and one smooth were tested for comparison.

The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of second-generation biofuels on the course of indicator graphs and heat release characteristics of the Perkins 1104D-44TA compression–ignition engine. For comparative purposes, the same tests were carried out by feeding the engine with first-generation biofuel and diesel fuel. Babassu butyl esters (BBuE) were used as the second-generation biofuel. The second fuel was a first-generation biofuel—rapeseed oil methyl esters (RME). Analysis of the results made it possible to draw conclusions about the effect of using 2nd and 1st generation biofuels on the parameters of the combustion process. When the DF engine was powered, the lowest fuel dose per work cycle was obtained. In the case of RME and BBuE fuels, it depends on the engine load. For low loads, higher consumption is for RME, and for higher loads, fuel consumption for BBuE in-creases most often. This is due to the lower calorific value of the esters. The results of these tests indicate that feeding the engine with BBuE and RME fuel in most loads resulted in higher maximum combustion pressures compared to feeding the engine with DF which may be directly related to the higher cetane number of these fuels compared to DF and the oxygen content of these fuels. Feeding the engine with BBuE and RME esters compared to DF did not result in large differences in the maximum heat release rates HRmax. However, the values of the first and second maximum heat release rates x1max and x2max, in addition to the type of fuel, are strongly influenced by the operating conditions, especially the engine load.

the Efficiency of Integrated Energy Systems by the Redistribution of Heat Based on Monitoring Data","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Integrated energy systems (IES) for combined power, heat and refrigeration supply achieved a wide application due to high flexibility in matching current loading. So as electricity is easily convertible into any other form of energy, gas engines are widely applied as driving engines characterized by high electrical and overall efficiency of about 45% and 90%, respectively. However, the highest thermal efficiency is achieved at full matching heat generated by the engine and heat transformed. This is often impossible in actual practice, especially if the heat is transformed into refrigeration by the most efficient and widespread absorption lithium-bromide chillers (ACh) and the heat not consumed by the ACh is removed from the atmosphere through an emergency radiator. The unused heat might be transformed by an ejector chiller (ECh) as the simplest and cheapest. So as the thermodynamic efficiency of any combustion engine is influenced essentially by the sucked air temperature, the excessive refrigeration produced by the ECh, is used for IES cooling to generate additional electricity and increase the electrical and overall efficiency of the engine. Such a redistribution of heat enables the enhancement of the efficiency of IES with an absorption-ejector chiller (AECh). The modified criteria for the comparative estimation of thermodynamic efficiency of innovative IESs with AEChs without overgenerated heat lost against a typical IES with an ACh and heat lost are proposed. In contrast to well-known electrical and heat efficiency, it considers the magnitude of heat loss and enables us to compare the heat efficiency of any version of transforming heat to refrigeration with an ideal basic version of IES based on a highly efficient ACh, transforming all the heat removed from the engine without heat loss. Some alternative scheme decisions for heat recovery systems have been developed based on monitoring data. They might be easily implemented into a typical IES with ACh."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f3878c28a0473c7cbe"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"8774","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67594399fdbe83757db01703","67594399fdbe83757db01704","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7cbe","67594399fdbe83757db01705","67594399fdbe83757db01706"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636b69e1409707100105d629","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"22","documentHash":"975aa9b7-cecc-45cf-914c-6c88cd24d471"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["integrated energy supply","gas engine","heat transformation","overgenerated heat","refrigeration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060071652"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f6878c28a0473b40d9","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Łabędzki","uuid":"7B36A0D53268407FA9AE180FB39D4BAC6DF5FE73836B49B0CCDE3909BAFE36658E8082D86E67A0B21998E14600155073885E72B06225F0D5F85147F8C98E68F8","orcidId":"0000-0001-7529-2392","documentHash":"74004eed-28ec-4f68-b8d1-89d3731be835"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a0473959bb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Piasecka","uuid":"AC05358322D3A8BDA14A929847770F2A8C92675887A26EFD2C262AACE9005CB5D39FBDF7A2EF1E258A0F8F0AAADFCFF231C0B5A5253A7A3F1738F6F0A8E31C53","orcidId":"0000-0003-3696-6213","documentHash":"1b5f8efb-6fa5-4d64-b249-bd97f93bc063"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394dc2","name":"Beata","lastName":"Maciejewska","uuid":"FFAA2D62B699752F46E06EB708403897FC56130397B2409CB1CE23B0364D976ED03E797AF7EAFEC0C4BFF338FB0DB19660734B56A38DCF8E3993753553F3E855","orcidId":"0000-0002-4692-7560","documentHash":"17e7ad3a-4cc6-4914-aad3-3f67aaeb28b1"}],"objectId":"6759a662fdbe83757db81c3b","doi":"10.3390/app122412982","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/24/12982/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Development of FEM Calculation Methods to Analyse Subcooled Boiling Heat Transfer in Minichannels Based on Experimental Results","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Even though two-phase heat transfer of refrigerants in minichannel heat sinks has been studied extensively, there is still a demand for improvements in overall thermal performance of miniature heat transfer exchangers. Experimental investigation and sophisticated heat transfer calculations with respect to heat transfer devices are still needed. In this work, a time-dependent experimental study of subcooled boiling was carried out for FC-72 flow in a heat sink, comprising of five asymmetrically heated minichannels. The heater surface temperature was continuously monitored by an infrared camera. The boiling heat transfer characteristics were investigated and the effect of the mass flow rate on the heat transfer coefficient was studied. In order to solve the heat transfer problem related to time-dependent flow boiling, two numerical methods, based on the FEM were applied, and based on the Trefftz functions (FEMT) and using the ADINA program. The results achieved with these two calculation methods were explored with an emphasis on the impact of the mass flow rate (range from 5 to 55 kg/h) on the resulting heat transfer coefficient. It was found that, with increasing mass flow, the heat transfer coefficient increased. Good agreement was found between the heat transfer coefficients, determined according to two numerical methods and the simple 1D calculation method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709270878c28a0473959bb","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40d9","5e709264878c28a047394dc2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"12982","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709270878c28a0473959bb","5e709264878c28a047394dc2","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40d9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff33dad49b31ccec0104f","title":"Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"96f827ef-c2c8-4b76-ab17-c7357fffee4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639876ad40970708596bbd21","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"24","documentHash":"2afdb429-15e5-4ea8-9dce-8aee0ab4354a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["heat transfer","flow boiling","minichannel","Trefftz functions","ADINA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060071705"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55f8","name":"Monika","lastName":"Siedlecka","uuid":"EF7958030A66C3D95C9C7FBD5717F2D40C8E06F1A591C094D80470945257784D8E9BF3F7F9F87771593207F8592C5FA60A2ADC1FDF820F28F349B4FFEAE25BF8","documentHash":"a24bb76a-5d9f-445c-a737-492c76e3b609"}],"objectId":"6759a1f5fdbe83757db7e9cc","doi":"10.24425/ace.2022.141871","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/141871/edition/124503/content","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Buckling of bipolarly prestressed closely-spaced built-up member","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study analysed a bisymmetric closely-spaced built-up member, pin-supported at both ends. It was bipolarly pre-stressed with a displacement (BPCSBM), and loaded with an axial compressive force. Maximum internal gap between the chords was assumed in the section, in which during the stability failure in a classic closely-spaced member, the largest lateral displacements between nodes would potentially occur. As regards the BPCSBM chosen for analysis, the issues of the buckling resistance in the presence of compressive axial load were solved using the energy method, in which the functional minimisation was performed in accordance with the Rayleigh-Ritz algorithm. The problem of BPCSBM stability was also solved using FEM. A spatial shell model was developed. The stability analysis was performed. The analysis resulted in obtaining the buckling load and the member buckling modes. A general conclusion was formulated based on the results obtained: bipolar pre-stressing leads to an increase in buckling resistance of closely-spaced members."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55f8"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"23-35","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55f8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c3c","mniswId":"1654","title":"Archives of Civil Engineering","issn":"2300-3103","documentHash":"19efeb0d-6226-4bf0-a002-f8250f720a44"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642137ee4097077035275345","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"68","number":"3","documentHash":"49e1df43-1ff3-462c-8c80-d5000d67600b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["buckling","closely spaced built-up member","built-up member","C-section","bipolar prestressing","prestressing","displacement"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060071712"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c314d79543c72336543c73","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Szczygieł","uuid":"C54FA4EFC3FE9A0C10AF92CC7AC4E2590B50D4C1C6B573EFDA6AD5F2DF52211027BB4CDA07CBF2DDB8DBCD98AF20E5A29B2A92B1FED8EF1804F3C88B7F845A95","documentHash":"e9cea657-a314-400d-b5e0-505df5bc9641"},{"objectId":"60c301279543c7233654397a","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Musiałek","uuid":"12CD848E4D8A57B7E4F2F639C48B4C9939ECD028E4FD2235D2031D8423E3709C1F89153DB88B116121BAE08246741F40C9B6EAA657E971A13653B59EE400EB36","documentHash":"d5736305-2b90-4a73-8098-2b6875e0c431"},{"objectId":"602f72ea9543c7410626f4c8","name":"Wiktor","lastName":"Szot","uuid":"D0AE84B5FB824EE127E0FF3B5E5363D037DE7034922DF433A15993E818467AB3C153D81F1551446E64972BC1077774CFB688246D6B4DB56CAFFC47E39CCD1F9E","documentHash":"95e9f460-380a-4626-89b8-1f012249c5fe"},{"objectId":"602f33a19543c7410626f1e5","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Rudnik","uuid":"3587DD9A35CEE845A01A7E0AFFBB2482C968870660329679DE13AF78959038F058D7DCD2E36AE2626655C89FAF4CA08CD30B3A7A9C542884ABE15B308656E1CF","documentHash":"761a2df4-7a38-485e-87a5-f2ecb43c2bfc"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473b9fe0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kozior","uuid":"CD58A55611F03677C11B03530285CFAEB60A4CFC7A7CE192FB183C87D4DF2CA7F57C9382303690F2E1AD820B8D0B470A88E63EAF9514E5262655B0B6005B3155","orcidId":"0000-0002-8922-4187","documentHash":"84df2ef3-8db1-4918-9ea6-b8578f5d69dd"},{"objectId":"5e709435878c28a0473b8385","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Zmarzły","uuid":"619F2157A3701B31D2274B491D3771986DF898B21F3182EE5E41C159B8D1131D5992E5EF36F1370484F02F8C061FB1F8FA89FC1357019881F1F4CB640A39C801","orcidId":"0000-0003-3717-1500","documentHash":"13b82382-74d0-413f-aaf8-5e53844b08fc"},{"objectId":"5e7093ac878c28a0473aed04","name":"Damian","lastName":"Gogolewski","uuid":"88D9500CBADA4890B1B7010A87348527D1F60381C0DA936A4AA93B7B7098C74493FDF2C53EE1430D1727F5BB676A45EF32CBDC70E341A4F180AE6E8A1E504DD6","documentHash":"81a538c1-3201-4a01-b503-2e5f4f115b6c"},{"objectId":"5e709282878c28a047396fe7","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Bochnia","uuid":"0FF9C963ECD8F58C258E087D45343FAE4F6F09DAAFBB8F95BB0B4CD4A6459CFA95E37427B64B0C8FA8FAC6B0BBC0C9FADA605845CC235BE1B03944CED7282DEF","orcidId":"0000-0001-7540-3822","documentHash":"a0dba1f1-63dd-40cb-bb75-fbe4c525953e"}],"objectId":"67599de8fdbe83757db79d24","doi":"10.3390/polym14030408","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/14/3/408/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Analysis of Metrological Quality and Mechanical Properties of Models Manufactured with Photo-Curing PolyJet Matrix Technology for Medical Applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the metrological quality and mechanical properties of models in the form of hook holders manufactured from MED610 polymer material using PolyJet Matrix (PJM) technology.

Analyzing the results of measurements of the geometrical characteristics of the elements, it can be concluded that the PolyJet Matrix 3D printing technology has demonstrated a high level of precision in manufacturing the prototype parts. The static tensile test of samples, taking into account the printing directions, showed a high anisotropy of mechanical properties.

Among geothermal technologies, heat pump systems with vertical well heat exchangers have been recognized as one of the most energy-efficient solutions for space heating and cooling in residential and commercial buildings. A large number of scientific studies have been devoted to the study of heat transfer in and around the ground heat exchanger. The vast majority of them were performed by numerical simulation of heat transfer processes in the soil massif–heat pump system. To analyze the efficiency of a ground heat exchanger, it is fundamentally important to take into account the main factors that can affect heat transfer processes in the soil and the external environment of vertical ground heat exchangers. In this work, numerical simulation methods were used to describe a mathematical model of heat transfer processes in a porous soil massif and a U-shaped vertical heat exchanger. The purpose of these studies is to determine the influence of the filtration properties of the soil as a porous medium on the performance characteristics of soil heat exchangers. To study these problems, numerical modeling of hydrodynamic processes and heat transfer in a soil massif was performed under the condition that the pores were filled only with liquid. The influence of the filtration properties of the soil as a porous medium on the characteristics of the operation of a soil heat exchanger was studied. The dependence of the energy characteristics of the operation of a soil heat exchanger and a heat pump on a medium with which the pores are filled, as well as on the porosity of the soil and the size of its particles, was determined."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f3878c28a0473c7cbe"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"4843","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67594875fdbe83757db05baa","67594875fdbe83757db05bab","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7cbe","67594875fdbe83757db05bac"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cd64c34097073c6e308524","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"14","documentHash":"1c93ffa1-f51c-4c84-bcbf-6a1a92c3f05c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["porous medium;","soil;","ground heat exchanger;","filtration;","heat pump;","numerical simulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060071884"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"652608a940e3ff22d34a6b85","name":"Artur","lastName":"Piasecki","uuid":"4A8A2E4C32700D1152848BAE9DCB545B4E653F341CBF8E5B8D2D2DC21BFD6F56D5D3256FEB106478755FB73E78851C6E3CE1B15E740BAFD18F8982A98AA2C880","documentHash":"450ce3da-51a8-40bb-b7d3-6683ce83fede"},{"objectId":"60c2fc349543c72336543401","name":"Norbert","lastName":"Dadas","uuid":"190B05A4DF8775A86576785F4F6602E3DDC4F09CBC4FD8FA4941897AF0D51FACB0B21533999A517C8CD4F75CDAF4E2A7F4E37AF0090649E47A9AA50A3654EC51","documentHash":"0550f053-e4e7-4c3e-9d90-39b76cfc3c4b"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a0473959bb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Piasecka","uuid":"AC05358322D3A8BDA14A929847770F2A8C92675887A26EFD2C262AACE9005CB5D39FBDF7A2EF1E258A0F8F0AAADFCFF231C0B5A5253A7A3F1738F6F0A8E31C53","orcidId":"0000-0003-3696-6213","documentHash":"1b5f8efb-6fa5-4d64-b249-bd97f93bc063"}],"objectId":"67593ef8fdbe83757dafb786","doi":"10.3390/en15020536","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/2/536/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Experimental Study and CFD Modeling of Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer Characteristics in a Mini-Channel Heat Sink Using Simcenter STAR-CCM+ Software","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present work describes an experimental study and CFD modeling of fluid flow and\nheat transfer characteristics in a heat sink with several asymmetrical heated mini-channels.

CCT diagrams are constructed on the basis of dilatometry measurements on relatively small testing samples (cylindrical shape with diameter of 4mm and length of 11 mm in this study). The main aim of this work was to demonstrate the possibility of evaluating the tensile test properties using mini-tensile tests from miniature volumes (1.4 × 10−7 m3 for one sample) subsequent to determination of the CCT diagram and to extend a standard CCT diagram with information about strength, ductility and the estimated value of the work-hardening coefficient. Mini-tensile tests (MTT) were recently developed due to the low availability of experimental material and have already been successfully used for local mechanical property characterization of metals. CCT diagrams were constructed for 42CrMo4 steel prepared by the laser-directed energy deposition (L-DED) process, for commercially available 42CrMo4 steel conventionally manufactured (for comparison of traditional processing and AM preparation) and for H13 tool steel deposited by the selective laser melting (SLM) process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aecf0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"3076","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67594955fdbe83757db07201","67594955fdbe83757db07202","67594955fdbe83757db07203","67594955fdbe83757db07204","67594955fdbe83757db07205","5e7093ab878c28a0473aecf0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"626a20d14097075861ca3148","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"9","documentHash":"2e06daf9-85bc-40a7-9070-f8ecab5c9971"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mini-tensile test;","continuous cooling transformation diagram;","laser directed energy deposition;","selective laser melting"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060071958"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b56e7","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Poczęta","uuid":"87907DFD0B47838411AF9B3BCBFE5103DF1A3CED4D77F524963ED01D0FB03EBAAA828264113C4D1F927252E5379AD48AB9DECC316C3E6713C1A92A4969A88DA7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1446-491X","documentHash":"70fd00b2-950e-47d6-bab2-38e4716ec478"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b56d3","name":"Adam","lastName":"Krechowicz","uuid":"8C22CDEBE7BAB6683D96F965BB62A0B9BCC8AF5EBD181EEA0FF8844641A25E10004CD62033933D16F290E14FA6B880C546E343F00F13D8471E7A8A1FA16FE838","orcidId":"0000-0002-6177-9869","documentHash":"95ab9c81-ea57-4979-b4a3-ca684de6bd59"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55e4","name":"Maria","lastName":"Krechowicz","uuid":"0ECED86105E1B15E791F47308CD448E4572BA8A6D34BF918B8D5FE8E7BE33186F10C375475AF9D05183220BFD5021E61855BF1E32932A518B99141A3BC2962DE","documentHash":"d63c4af1-f248-40cb-99cb-f3ec4ce94e06"}],"objectId":"6759550bfdbe83757db13da3","doi":"10.3390/en15239146","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/23/9146/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Electricity Production from Renewable Energy Sources","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bearing in mind European Green Deal assumptions regarding a significant reduction of green house emissions, electricity generation from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) is more and more important nowadays. Besides this, accurate and reliable electricity generation forecasts from RES are needed for capacity planning, scheduling, managing inertia and frequency response during contingency events. The recent three years have proved that Machine Learning (ML) models are a promising solution for forecasting electricity generation from RES. In this review, the 8-step methodology was used to find and analyze 262 relevant research articles from the Scopus database. Statistic analysis based on eight criteria (ML method used, renewable energy source involved, affiliation location, hybrid model proposed, short term prediction, author name, number of citations, and journal title) was shown. The results indicate that (1) Extreme Learning Machine and ensemble methods were the most popular methods used for electricity generation forecasting from RES in the last three years (2020–2022), (2) most of the research was carried out for wind systems, (3) the hybrid models accounted for about a third of the analyzed works, (4) most of the articles concerned short-term models, (5) the most researchers came from China, (6) and the journal which published the most papers in the analyzed field was Energies.

This approach is justified both from economic and environmental points of view. However, as with any method, there are certain possibilities and limitations. The goal of the natural utilization of sewage sludge is to recover the valuable agronomic properties and fertilizing potential of the sludge. The main aspect limiting the possibility of using sludge as a fertilizer is the heavy metal content. In this paper, an analysis of the risk of environmental contamination in the case of application of sewage sludge with different forms of sludge treatment was carried out. Risk indices such as Igeo and PERI, based on the comparison of total metal content in sludge and soil, as well as RAC and ERD indices, which take into account the mobility of metals in soil, were calculated. It was shown that high levels of potential risk and geoaccumulation indicators do not necessarily disqualify the use of sewage sludge, the key aspect is the form of mobility in which the heavy metals are found in the sludge, and this should be the only aspect taken into account for the possibility of their environmental use."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709256878c28a047393f72","5e7092ef878c28a04739f759","5e70940c878c28a0473b561a","65a749b940e3ff6b129dc637"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"11829","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ef878c28a04739f759","5e709256878c28a047393f72","65a749b940e3ff6b129dc637","5e70940c878c28a0473b561a","675962fcfdbe83757db22f3a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","issn":"1660-4601","eissn":"1660-4601","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"bad4d5e4-600e-403a-9e35-0edb9dd89452"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63185d54409707796835b2d1","year":"2022","volume":"19","number":"18","documentHash":"a1199687-62bb-4fc2-ac61-be27618a09a6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["heavy metals","sewage sludge","mobility","environmental pollution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060077847"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709282878c28a047396fe7","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Bochnia","uuid":"0FF9C963ECD8F58C258E087D45343FAE4F6F09DAAFBB8F95BB0B4CD4A6459CFA95E37427B64B0C8FA8FAC6B0BBC0C9FADA605845CC235BE1B03944CED7282DEF","orcidId":"0000-0001-7540-3822","documentHash":"a0dba1f1-63dd-40cb-bb75-fbe4c525953e"}],"objectId":"675957abfdbe83757db18482","doi":"10.3390/ma16010400","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/1/400/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A Study of the Mechanical Properties of Naturally Aged Photopolymers Printed Using the PJM Technology","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Additive manufacturing is being increasingly used both for rapid prototyping as well as the fabrication of finished components. It is important to determine how the properties of 3D printed materials change over time and how they affect the durability and usability of products. The aim of the research presented in this article was to find out what influence the natural aging period had on the mechanical properties, especially the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity, of specimens made from the selected photocurable resins using the PolyJet Matrix (PJM) technology. The tests involved determining the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of specimens fabricated in 2013 and 2014 using two types of photosensitive resins, i.e., FullCure 720 and VeroWhite, respectively. Some of the specimens were stored under laboratory conditions until July 2022 and then tested using a universal testing machine. The experimental data obtained in 2022 for the naturally aged models were compared with those reported for the as-printed specimens. One of the main findings of this study was that the tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the naturally aged specimens were largely dependent on the printing direction (model orientation on the build tray). The test results show that aging generally decreased the tensile strength of the specimens. In one case, however, an increase in this property was observed. For the X and Y printing directions, Rm declined by 27.1% and 30.7%, respectively. For the Z direction, a decrease of only 5.5% was reported, for Full Cure 720. The modulus of elasticity of the models tested in 2022 differed considerably from that reported for the as-printed objects. Higher values of the modulus of elasticity implied that the material stiffness increased over time, and this is a common phenomenon in polymers. Interesting results were obtained for VeroWhite specimens. The modulus of elasticity decreased significantly by 25.1% and 42.4% for the specimens printed in the X and Z directions, respectively. However, for the models built in the Y direction, it increased by 27.4%. The experimental data may be of significance to users of products manufactured using the PJM method as well as to researchers dealing with the durability and reliability of such materials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709282878c28a047396fe7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"400","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709282878c28a047396fe7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b2841f409707109b1afb56","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"1","documentHash":"a93723eb-7482-4b5c-b1fe-852ece306519"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["3D printing","PJM","photocurable resins","polymers","polymer aging"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060077905"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b62f2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Gil-Mastalerczyk","uuid":"78EF92457826D629AB5752F38B54276820BF1150AB03A4A75987ADD0E71641C518E8983F0C146DB212CB52B3D5C0E0B10AA8B69FFDEC9CC2059001602AA4D6ED","documentHash":"f457a17d-3127-4696-9c6f-d55628ab1f04"},{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4f7f","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Gardyńska-Kieliś","uuid":"7D9E9187C6212A8C8D67774DF3F207F5CEDDBF9AC9264B9EB4376E6B1CC895D33138BD7EE69205B50A698B7BC06094EC8E4775F50A8293B381BD6CAC01BC533C","documentHash":"f64364c7-cbb4-440c-ba1a-d592557d68e3"}],"objectId":"67595c43fdbe83757db1bb14","doi":"10.30540/sae-2023-012","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.30540/sae-2023-012","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"ACCESSIBILITY STUDY OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS AND CONTEMPORARY HERITAGE – ON THE EXAMPLE OF KIELCE’S PUBLIC UTILITY BUILDINGS","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"STUDIUM DOSTĘPNOŚCI OBIEKTÓW ZABYTKOWYCH ORAZ DZIEDZICTWA WSPÓŁCZESNOŚCI – NA PRZYKŁADZIE OBIEKTÓW UŻYTECZNOŚCI PUBLICZNEJ KIELC"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Zapewnienie dostępności budynków i przestrzeni jest powszechnym współczesnym wyzwaniem w szczególności dla obiektów i przestrzeni zabytkowych oraz dziedzictwa kultury współczesnej.

The authors wanted to draw attention to the necessity to take into account the uncertainty in the description of design parameters during optimization. In the first step, using geometrically nonlinear relationships, a static-strength analysis is performed. The decisive form of loss of stability in this steel roof framing is the jump of the node (snap-through), and not the buckling of the most stressed structure bars. Therefore, when creating the limit function, it was decided to make a condition limiting the permissible displacement. Values of the implicit limit function were calculated with Abaqus software based on the finite element method. Reliability analysis, and robust and deterministic optimization were performed using Numpress Explore software. Numpress Explore software communicates with the Abaqus software to perform analysis. The task ended with the generation of information that contained the failure probability, reliability index and the values of optimized areas of the bars’ cross-sections. The end result of the optimization is not a cost analysis, but an assessment of the safety of the structure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709256878c28a047393f0a","5e7093ab878c28a0473aec90"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"5017","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aec90","5e709256878c28a047393f0a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cd64c34097073c6e308524","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"14","documentHash":"1c93ffa1-f51c-4c84-bcbf-6a1a92c3f05c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["steel roof framing","stability","reliability","deterministic optimization","robust optimization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060078052"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396659","name":"Medard","lastName":"Makrenek","uuid":"E6FE74B936E47EC5DDCBA469292AAF96183CBEE54383C56A807AF570BA52EC37ED9D9294D45B8F1F926C15724604C618FD17E84D5DD1064352857C3329C74166","orcidId":"0000-0003-4587-3027","documentHash":"92a881a1-173e-4676-8354-b5b5a95eaeef"}],"objectId":"67595d36fdbe83757db1c0e1","doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0054.2490","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.5604/01.3001.0054.2490","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Adhesion of titanium coatings applied by cold spraying on selected metal substrates","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose of this paper. Measurement of the adhesion of a Ti coating applied by cold spraying on metal substrates with different elastic modulus. An attempt to analytically describe the experimental results, taking into account cold gas spray parameters such as working gas, pressure p and temperature T. Methodology Ti coating was sprayed on flat bars made of metal: cooper, magnesium, brass, titanium, Al 7075, Al 2024 and steel with dimensions of 4x50x400 mm. All coatings were applied under the same spray conditions (p = 3.8 MPa, T = 800 oC, spray distance l = 50 mm and spray spead V = 400 mm/s). The state of plastic deformation of coatings and substrates was examined using optical methods, and the adhesion strength was measured with the POSITEST tester. Findings The experimental results are presented graphically. The adhesion force as a function of the relative modulus of elasticity showed a maximum. At this time, the mutual penetration depth of the coating and the substrate showed a minimum. The extremes of the above-mentioned relationships occurred for points where the relative modulus of elasticity took the value one. The curve described by formula (1) was fitted to the distribution of adhesion points as a function of the relative elastic modulus. The function parameter described by formula (1) is related to the spray parameters (p, T). Research limitations/implications To achieve a better accuracy of the analytical description of the adhesion of coatings deposited with cold gas, tests should be carried out on a larger number of substrates. The validity of the presented interpretation should be checked by applying coatings from other materials. Practical implications In coating technologies, adhesion is a key concept. Applying a coating with high adhesion strength is used primarily in regeneration and anti-corrosion protection processes. The analytical relationship between adhesion, relative modulus of elasticity and cold gas spray parameters will significantly speed up the selection of optimal spray parameters. Cold spray technology is a cost-intensive technology, so the economic element is not without significance Originality/value The article presents a method for limiting the number of variables on which the quality of the applied coatings depends. The relationship between the adhesion force, the relative elastic modulus and the selected spray parameters is indicated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a047396659"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"123","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"49-54","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927a878c28a047396659"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72a9f2467f01e930eef34","title":"Archives of Materials Science and Engineering","issn":"1897-2764","eissn":"1897-2764","websiteLink":"http://www.archivesmse.org/","documentHash":"90c69ad2-49ac-429c-8f1a-f7f653fd1a50"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67595d36fdbe83757db1c0e2","year":"2023","volume":"123","number":"2","documentHash":"38fb7d8a-b93d-425b-a7d3-1a611c8750bd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cold spray","adhesion","coating","elastic modulus","hardness","plastic deformation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060078106"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c59","name":"Artur","lastName":"Bartosik","uuid":"DF753864CEA4E3EC0E676854A99EF574AA6ACD565A1F4C43C06EAD53691E2BB1E7E329FF2CBE7D2A367F2D19EFE77FEB08BE35B00F2AB69A531DF9648AA9DAD5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2201-9135","documentHash":"ee1e98ce-faf3-4899-b401-f73a4a5423ae"}],"objectId":"67595e57fdbe83757db1c859","doi":"10.3390/en15082922","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/8/2922/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow: A Review of Contributions to the Special Issue","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper contains a summary of successful invited papers addressed to the Special Issue on ‘Numerical Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow’, which were published in 2021 in the scientific journal ‘Energies’.

Trends toward energy efficiency in buildings are often associated with inadequate air exchange in buildings and deterioration of indoor air quality. One solution to improve the situation is installations with alternating supply and exhaust. The study presented in the article is a decentralised façade ventilation unit. Its task is to improve the indoor microclimate. Aim. The purpose of the study is to analyse the size of airflow depending on the heat recovery exchanger used. Methods. The decentralised ventilation façade unit that performs alternative supply and exhaust has been analysed. The alternate flow was caused by the opening and closing dampers, which direct the airflow to the duct network. The device is equipped with a fan and a section of a heat recovery exchange. Three configurations of the unit were studied (without heat recovery exchanger, exchanger filled with gravel, and exchanger filled with gypsum). Three cycle setting variants were analysed: 2, 6 and 10 minutes. The airflow of the supply/exhaust was measured using a balometer. Conclusions and relevance to practice. The test results show that the supply/exhaust airflow of the decentralised façade ventilation unit is sufficient to ventilate living and public buildings. The smallest air flows were observed in the variant with a gravel-filled heat recovery exchanger. The exhaust air flow rate in each case analysed was less than the supply air flow rate. The device analysed effectively ventilates premises, but the legal requirements in Poland do not allow the use of this type of solution as a way to ventilate premises. Therefore, changes in legal regulations are needed, as well as further research on the effectiveness of using heat recovery and the possibility of achieving thermal comfort."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cc4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"54","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"34-40","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67596bdffdbe83757db2f526","67596bdffdbe83757db2f527","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cc4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abfdad204581b62ebb0b","mniswId":"201161","title":"Ciepłownictwo, Ogrzewnictwo, Wentylacja","issn":"0137-3676","eissn":"2449-9900","metadataSource":"MINISTRY","documentHash":"6c0625a3-bcd2-413c-9a88-a3c894fcefd1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67596bdffdbe83757db2f525","year":"2023","volume":"1","number":"6","documentHash":"43a470cf-d527-4f18-8029-93716ee714c0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["wentylacja fasadowa","naprzemienny nawiew/wywiew","strumień powietrza"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["facade ventilation","alternative supply/exhaust airflow","stream of air"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060081370"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b16af","name":"Damian","lastName":"Frej","uuid":"9B4F05C9B24E5D14A0A10379F44789EBD6B252F050C14C698D50E9A5AD79AF8A508B726C46C73A4865767A734EDEDAA61C313142C45ECE89D65A21106AFF6D86","documentHash":"01b718c7-e24a-4a8a-8b51-a3d680cb1fc0"}],"objectId":"67596e0bfdbe83757db3145a","doi":"10.3390/su152216015","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/22/16015/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of Head Displacement during a Frontal Collision at a Speed of 20 km/h—Experimental Studies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the research is to compare the head displacements of volunteers with the head displacements of the KPSIT C50 dummy, taking into account the change of vehicle seat belts. Unfortunately, sudden braking or collisions between vehicles is becoming more and more common, especially during traffic jams. There is considerable ignorance in the literature on the behavior of the human body during a low-speed collision, which motivates the development of low-speed crash test procedures in order to reduce the risk of cervical spine injuries. The tests were carried out at a teaching station designed to measure the forces in seat belts and the displacements of individual body elements (dummy or volunteer) during a low-speed crash test. The article is part of extensive research on crash tests using volunteers and KPSIT physical dummies. The study involved 150 volunteers who were divided into specific percentile groups. The article compares the head displacements of the constructed KPSIT C50 dummy with the head displacements of volunteers representing the 50th percentile group of the male population. The study conducted with volunteers was under control and was completely safe for people participating in the study. The research shows that the use of a bucket sports seat equipped with four-point or five-point seat belts significantly reduces the movement of the head during a low-speed collision. This type of vehicle seat is safer and provides a reduced risk of injury from hitting the head on the steering column in a low-speed collision when the airbag has not deployed. Moreover, research shows that standard seat belts placed in passenger vehicles allow the head to move freely forward in the event of an accident or low-speed collision. Therefore, if the speed is too low to deploy the airbag, there is a high probability that the driver and passengers will hit their heads against the cockpit of the passenger vehicle during a collision at a speed of 20 km/h."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d4878c28a0473b16af"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"16015","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d4878c28a0473b16af"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff3f8ad49b31ccec0f80e","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","documentHash":"4055bfb8-4fdb-408c-b314-7aa556a417fb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655c86044097071dcb5689ab","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"22","documentHash":"33d624db-6c59-4c03-9fae-e7211083c9c9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crash tests","anthropometric dummy","safety","collision","accident"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060081372"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55f9","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"4C09693DB02380B9F9FAE22A55200B7D69E7EFC38F952DAAD3C10660EBF2E989E5D2591EED0292289A94112AE42C48F6D45E2190C26FCBC6883F11BE19C1B22A","documentHash":"25278886-5f7e-4309-9df6-f21f64070905"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393f42","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Szychowski","uuid":"1FB1B7F484B7C00CE3D8356F2529FFCF584EBFABAD8ABB42483F500EC7CCC8F22E2E771B7767E63C2E3DD2996DA3D60891AD1CC951F4F588D9E75924D6A231C7","orcidId":"0000-0003-1653-0324","documentHash":"35dab230-bd74-43c3-9a88-23258456ed3e"}],"objectId":"675964b3fdbe83757db2622c","doi":"10.3390/ma15041275","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/4/1275/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Effect of Steel Beam Elastic Restraint on the Critical Moment of Lateral Torsional Buckling","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper reports the results of the next stage of the authors’ investigations into the effect of the elastic action of support nodes on the lateral torsional buckling of steel beams with a bisymmetric I-section. The analysis took into account beam elastic restraint against warping and against rotation in the bending plane. Such beams are found in building frames or frame structures. Taking into account the support conditions mentioned above allows for more effective design of such elements, compared with the boundary conditions of fork support, commonly adopted by designers. The entire range of variation in node rigidity was considered in the study, namely from complete freedom of warping to complete restraint, and from complete freedom of rotation relative to the stronger axis of the cross section (free support) to complete blockage (full fixity). The beams were conservatively assumed to be freely supported against lateral rotation, i.e., rotation in the lateral torsional buckling plane. Calculations were performed for various values of the indexes of fixity against warping and against rotation in the beam bending plane. In the study, formulas for the critical moment of bilaterally fixed beams were developed. Also, approximate formulas were devised for elastic restraint in the support nodes. The formulas concerned the most frequent loading variants applied to single-span beams. The critical moments determined in the study were compared, with values obtained using LTBeamN software (FEM). Good compliance of results was observed. The derived formulas are useful for the engineering design of this type of structures. The designs are based on a more accurate calculation model, which, at the same time offers simplicity of calculation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55f9","5e709256878c28a047393f42"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1275","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55f9","5e709256878c28a047393f42"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62175ff02467f05a132d3aca","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"4","documentHash":"5ca059e4-8ebd-4dad-b56e-2d15ebb44ec9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["critical moment of lateral torsional buckling","elastic supports","elastic restraint against warping","elastic restraint against rotation in the beam bending plane"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060081395"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394bf6","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"BB7A4A4CE1B8C23BDB4A2EDDCD9FBE26392C60102B1EF7A73FE582A3405BA93B6BE41346233B0CE245CBAAE8D524CC234E17A9B702747153B2B00B16A704540C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0461-8559","documentHash":"950004e7-806c-4a58-aaa1-cea0ed7de6c2"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394bf0","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Miłek","uuid":"FC6809047A4D8C27D0224D4EDF08CF838B637E340BA0705938AF6AD37DF51CB4E12578DC4C2AAF916C43E3B23FB1F51A103FF81C114C04E94A7D5E737DE55764","orcidId":"0000-0002-2358-4614","documentHash":"d54f3aaf-1469-4b75-9fa9-11251bdcd7d5"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393faf","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Latosińska","uuid":"D8B5E0AB461E95F666FCFBB7EC22BEF191D0759C72116DB53FCF71EF0606AF092E208DAC145BEFFE07A7539AB619C6FD14C66B329B1C2CCADABBC73085FC0758","orcidId":"0000-0001-8907-5305","documentHash":"05c88f41-585f-437c-878f-c19398ee97ee"}],"objectId":"6759654cfdbe83757db26692","doi":"10.3390/en15155576","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/15/5576/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Development of Renewable Energy Sources in the European Union in the Light of the European Green Deal","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate and energy policies are the key areas of the European Union’s development aspirations in the international arena. The European Green Deal sets ambitious new goals in this respect, emphasizing clean energy. The development of the energy sector, relying chiefly on renewable sources, is one of the conditions for the EU to transition to energies that do not produce waste that pollutes or is otherwise harmful to the Earth and human health. This paper assesses the development of renewable sources of energy in the EU and identifies challenges to the realization of the EU’s energy priorities. An analysis of renewable sources of energy in the EU in 2012 and 2020 is the prime method. The generation of primary energy from renewable sources, the share of energy from renewable sources in the final energy consumption, the structure of energy generation from renewable sources, and the share of energy from renewable sources in the energy used by the transport sector are discussed. Secondary data are employed, made available by Eurostat and Statistics Poland. To reach the objective of the study, Z. Hellwig’s taxonomic method is applied to assess the development of renewable energy sources (RES). Cluster analysis (Ward’s agglomerative clustering method) is additionally used for separation of objects and member states that are similar with regard to the phenomenon reviewed. Particular attention is paid to the challenges that societies and economies face in view of the assumptions of the EU’s new Green Deal, which envisages a balancing of CO2 emissions and absorption. This analysis discovers varied progress on the development of RES in the member states, posing a threat to the European community’s aspirations"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709262878c28a047394bf6","5e709256878c28a047393faf","5e709262878c28a047394bf0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"5576","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709262878c28a047394bf0","5e709256878c28a047393faf","5e709262878c28a047394bf6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e104ad40970720e718196b","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"15","documentHash":"9b409fd9-b0fd-4c50-96e8-fb39f3e79a07"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climate and energy policy","renewable energy sources","European Green Deal","Hellwigs method","Wards method"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060081456"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"675963f7fdbe83757db24ce1","name":"Lech","lastName":"Lichołai","documentHash":"5180c205-b842-44b3-a4e1-a409b4194453"},{"objectId":"5e7094e0878c28a0473c5e24","name":"Artur","lastName":"Pawelec","uuid":"6A747D4FA399D814011C540E69C8A08F7ECCCDC02604E8480F0B64A98E4EE552A283FB75E411571F5C69B58AC3BA26514196291E9ACFE6EF50B52855D33595AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2235-6601","documentHash":"43b7e61f-ee95-484e-a09f-b9834e176076"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b56d3","name":"Adam","lastName":"Krechowicz","uuid":"8C22CDEBE7BAB6683D96F965BB62A0B9BCC8AF5EBD181EEA0FF8844641A25E10004CD62033933D16F290E14FA6B880C546E343F00F13D8471E7A8A1FA16FE838","orcidId":"0000-0002-6177-9869","documentHash":"95ab9c81-ea57-4979-b4a3-ca684de6bd59"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55f4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Stępień","uuid":"90C8EEC90FC4CDCA1963BC66E3E0C24A56CB129CC1770E679C1994C521D0DA35316A1088086DE49A662E33A091C1729186D86E0BE8C9BE2D86494929C33C133E","documentHash":"06915bb5-5159-4e0c-936a-53f6a6b11fac"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55e4","name":"Maria","lastName":"Krechowicz","uuid":"0ECED86105E1B15E791F47308CD448E4572BA8A6D34BF918B8D5FE8E7BE33186F10C375475AF9D05183220BFD5021E61855BF1E32932A518B99141A3BC2962DE","documentHash":"d63c4af1-f248-40cb-99cb-f3ec4ce94e06"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393f04","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"5A3D600B4734F3A95DECFF4BD2E73B6130F1A89F6DCE6C13A058FD4BDC2C1831AE699A6BD13B9F9D599BC34B78BBEB1CEF7750BD308094320EC08D8BB9DBEA07","documentHash":"c37cee5e-7c8e-482a-b946-93cc2f699082"}],"objectId":"675963f7fdbe83757db24ce0","doi":"10.3390/en15114006","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/11/4006/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Reduction of the Risk of Inaccurate Prediction of Electricity Generation from PV Farms Using Machine Learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Problems with inaccurate prediction of electricity generation from photovoltaic (PV) farms cause severe operational, technical, and financial risks, which seriously affect both their owners and grid operators.

A nonlinear model of the plant was used to identify the mass, employing the weighted recursive least squares (WRLS) method for online identification. The identification and control processes involved filtration using differential filters, which provided appropriate derivatives of signals. Proportional integral derivative (PID) controller tuning was performed using the Gauss–Newton optimisation procedure on the plant. Differential filters played a crucial role in all the developed control systems by significantly reducing measurement noise. The results showed that the performance of classical PID controllers can be improved by using differential filters and gain scheduling.

In order to improve the bending mechanical properties of glulam beams, a new type of longitudinal glulam reinforcement with pre-stressed basalt fibre-reinforced polymer composites (BFRP) was developed using the Near Surface Mounted (NSM) technique. The strengthening method consisted of two pre-stressed BFRP bars glued into the grooves at the bottom side of the beam; meanwhile, for the second strengthening alternative, the third BFRP bar was embedded into the groove at the top side of the beam. Therefore, an experimental study was carried out to verify this strengthening technique, in which fifteen full-size timber beams were tested with and without bonded BFRP bar reinforcement in three series. According to the results of this experimental study, it can be seen that the effective load-bearing capacity of the reinforced beams increased up to 36% and that the stiffness of the beams increased by 23% compared to the unreinforced beams. The tensile stresses in the wooden fibres were reduced by 11.32% and 25.42% on average for the beams reinforced with two and three BFRP bars, respectively. On the other hand, the compressive stresses were reduced by 16.53% and 32.10% compared to the unreinforced beams. The usual failure mode saw the cracking of the wood fibres at the defects, while for some specimens, there were also signs of cracks in the epoxy adhesive bond; however, the crack propagation was, overall, significantly reduced. The numerical calculations also show a good correlation with the experimental results. The difference in the results between the experimental and numerical analysis of the reinforced and unreinforced full-sized beams ranged between 3.63% and 11.45%."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aeca8"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"2776","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aeca8","675967b7fdbe83757db2a902","675967b7fdbe83757db2a903"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642567d44097075f21c43a3a","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"7","documentHash":"4625e3c3-c90c-4c73-8e4e-9113699be6ca"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["timber beams","strengthening","near surface mounted NSM","bars","BFRP","bending resistance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060081593"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f759","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kowalik","uuid":"D743AE2ACD895A17DD7B7F5C0730644F44937F52BD76DF5931F920FF007B2BFB77D1FA58DD64555A9AA69C733C49980D4E5567E917F5F848A4370FD5C747CD70","documentHash":"b74a83ca-d12e-46ed-baf3-b792e10b49bc"}],"objectId":"67596d92fdbe83757db30cc0","doi":"10.15199/17.2023.2.4","publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/publikacja-142427-2023-3.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analiza zysku finansowego przy zastosowaniu instalacji odzysku ciepła ze ścieków spod prysznica dla budynku jednorodzinnego","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Woda grzewcza do zaopatrzenia w ciepłą wodę stanowi około 20% całkowitego zużycia energii w standardowym domu, a większość obciążenia przypada na wodę grzewczą do kąpieli lub prysznica.

One of the elements of this process is the use of renewable energy sources in the selection of heat sources. Two variants of thermo-modernization solutions for the tested facility were generated using the CERTO and the Aterm computer program. One was a heat pump, and the second was hybrid, in which the heat pump is supplied with electricity from photovoltaic panels. The key point of considerations was to conduct a comparative analysis of the operating costs of applied solutions. All variants were based on the same output data including the same building materials from which the thermal modernization process was carried out. The only difference was in the use of different types of thermal energy sources. The aim of the article was, therefore, to carry out a comparative analysis of variants of heat sources used in a single-family residential building—heating in a traditional way and through the use of photovoltaic panels and a heat pump. The results of the analysis in the context of benefits obtained from using renewable energy sources for heating residential buildings are discussed. The analysis showed that the simultaneous application of a heat pump and solar collectors in the analyzed building effectively influenced the values of indicators of annual demand for usable, primary, and final energy. The main conclusion of this research is that the amount of final energy demand in the analyzed case decreased from 86.04 kWh/(m2/year) with natural gas to 40.46 kWh/(m2/year) with a heat pump and a solar collector."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a04739665f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"4613","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927a878c28a04739665f","67596375fdbe83757db2353e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b30925409707737cf519c7","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"13","documentHash":"6d3d4e41-2f09-492c-9423-5a7dd3a0a115"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["renewable energy;","thermal modernization;","energy performance of buildings"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060081809"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6759739efdbe83757db3896f","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Wach","documentHash":"ea68bf40-36af-4714-9be9-29d5fc840ba3"},{"objectId":"6759739efdbe83757db3896e","name":"Marek","lastName":"Guzek","documentHash":"55c749ff-dd74-4a64-8e88-a1faaf8cdfa9"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ae9","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jurecki","uuid":"CB52D03B369410C57F329E005514F4A94BC43959428B45315AC01EAE524292C0E06AC42CA965513AF7EE8DDCC787BC188E3E11F91A41A39071BE402C5224FA1E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0105-1283","documentHash":"b97d0db1-5e79-43e4-9539-e3ae10777384"}],"objectId":"6759739efdbe83757db3896d","doi":"10.3390/en15134573","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/13/4573/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Vehicle and Traffic Safety","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394ae9"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"4573","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6759739efdbe83757db3896e","5e709261878c28a047394ae9","6759739efdbe83757db3896f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b30925409707737cf519c7","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"13","documentHash":"6d3d4e41-2f09-492c-9423-5a7dd3a0a115"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060081971"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709244878c28a047392b48","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kekez","uuid":"921160824B7D3068CE366999A6DACE743A5420B0A12894A3FDFB0077034E77A181098EB5CE1977EB0F1D75042A85135940D95AE129991D9DD4A97472EEF16513","orcidId":"0000-0001-9521-0788","documentHash":"1ee5f835-b70d-4bfa-9070-2f04474bad3c"}],"objectId":"6759673cfdbe83757db29a19","doi":"10.24425/ijet.2023.144361","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/127371/PDF/10-4056-Kekez-sk.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"An Approach to License Plate Recognition in Real Time Using Multi-stage Computational Intelligence Classifier","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Automatic car license plate recognition (LPR) is widely used nowadays.

The combination of these technologies creates new possibilities for building complex-shape composites that have not been comprehensively tested so far. The article describes the results of research on composites manufactured by combining samples prepared with two 3D printing technologies, Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and Photo-Curing of Liquid Polymer Resins (PJM) in combination with electrospinning (ES) technology. The surface morphology of composites manufactured from biocompatible materials was investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and contact angle measurements, and chemical composition analysis was studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). This approach to creating composites appears to be an alternative to developing research for filtration applications. The article presents basic research illustrating the quality of composites produced by combining two unconventional technologies: 3D printing and electrospinning (ES). The analysis of the research results showed clear differences in the structure of composites produced with the use of various 3D printing technologies. The CLSM analysis showed a much better orientation of the fibers in the MED610 + PAN/gelatin composite, and the measurement of the contact angle and its indirect interpretation also for this composite allows for the conclusion that it will be characterized by a higher value of adhesion force. Moreover, such composites could be used in the future for the construction of filtering devices and in medical applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473b9fe0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"48","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944d878c28a0473b9fe0","6759a3e8fdbe83757db7fa41","6759a3e8fdbe83757db7fa42","6759a3e8fdbe83757db7fa43"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bd6e","mniswId":"3957","title":"Coatings","issn":"2079-6412","eissn":"2079-6412","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"4e0160b7-f155-4bb5-939e-e216d63ebd2d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61de7ba42467f0772e376290","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"99c318e5-22bb-4b8d-8381-cc978559c839"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quality;","electrospinning;","3D printing;","PJM;","FFF;","bio-materials;","filtering"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060104683"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55df","name":"Anna","lastName":"Parka","uuid":"3EE5F5D55C2F662FAC48B603B82E469A993335FB58B44F7F682259EA479E16A052EBD2B246985F818533B34F158816D68A211048E5FBB1BBF5C51D8FA2386CF5","documentHash":"42b9d0af-676d-4929-bc55-175232fb5be2"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393f9b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kuliczkowski","uuid":"D1CEA82022B24296490305FA97EBB95165F1B8E66C8573D3D225D8C03AEDD53C77A22199D24F2BAC2F63572A70E0A40497E2E430FB1EFB4C2CFF2C4D2187D8D4","documentHash":"b6425cc0-25d9-498d-bc4e-301c010a11b8"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393f89","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Kuliczkowska","uuid":"53EA8999F5B9FBAEA49D8E43E05581BB8BABD605942EB909E20CABAF5ECEC5AD3D2F8C9EBD0EA16D0BAC2EF4B3A8151F51CAC0F523B212E8EAAB050C6A5A9AA6","documentHash":"45e96731-141c-411b-a10c-d47f8b3f02f4"}],"objectId":"6759a52efdbe83757db8088c","doi":"10.1016/j.engfailanal.2022.106103","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1350630722000772?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Damages in vitrified clay sewers in service for 130–142 years","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study was to analyze the damage occurring in vitrified clay sewers operated for a period of 130–142 years based on the results of their CCTV testing. In view of the fact that there are very large differences in the assessment of the forecast lifetime of sewer pipes, as reported by the different institutions, and significant differences in the survival functions developed for these pipes, particular attention has been paid to identification of the causes of this situation. One of the most important results of the research and analyses conducted is demonstration that models predicting the durability of vitrified clay pipes and the survival functions created for them should be developed separately for sewers laid in dry soils and water-saturated soils. The research has also shown that various so-called primary damages were observed in sewers, which occurred during transport, storage, and installation of pipes. Failure to take into account the possibility of these damages in the durability models being developed and in the related survival functions makes it impossible to predict the actual durability of these pipes. An analysis of the results also confirmed the thesis formulated on the basis of studies of vitrified clay pipes in Canada that the deterioration of vitrified clay pipes is not age-dependent when the pipes are properly designed and installed, with no damage during installation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940b878c28a0473b55df","5e709256878c28a047393f89","5e709256878c28a047393f9b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"135","pagesFromTo":"106103","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709256878c28a047393f89","5e709256878c28a047393f9b","5e70940b878c28a0473b55df"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ac1","mniswId":"5713","title":"Engineering Failure Analysis","issn":"1350-6307","eissn":"1873-1961","documentHash":"c89612da-b3cf-4927-86d3-8a3ebfec7a75"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"625571432467f052bcab17e7","year":"2022","volume":"135","documentHash":"df632abe-65fb-4e7e-af54-1cb8e6ce52fa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Damage assessment","Pipeline failures","Structural integrity","Vitrified clay pipes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060104718"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67599d18fdbe83757db7905c","name":"Hüsnügül","lastName":"Yılmaz-Atay","documentHash":"f84c7a86-4462-4ece-97d2-c012cce78369"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8998","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Wilk-Jakubowski","uuid":"8D06410141E3235278A8D21D02F40EA70D197015E93B59B78EB8104A29A32A1B070AB075435ADB4791BBB3B86171D5FB66034317069EB14E40388050CF8BF105","documentHash":"4cb86206-ad34-46b2-94d1-3aa6023bd9a2"}],"objectId":"67599d18fdbe83757db7905b","doi":"10.3390/polym14061224","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/14/6/1224/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Review of Environmentally Friendly Approaches in Fire Extinguishing: From Chemical Sciences to Innovations in Electrical Engineering","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"After the invention of fire, the fight against fire probably started, and it has been going on for thousands of years. During this time, the aim has always been to extinguish the fire as soon as possible and to produce fire-resistant materials. Symmetry plays an important role in reducing problems, as it is a common feature of modern life. Multidimensional signal processing has many applications, an example of which is the use of appropriately timed acoustic waves to extinguish flames. This article provides a brief review of issues related to the use of acoustic waves for flame suppression based on studies in the literature. In addition, measurement results available in the literature obtained using a high-power acoustic extinguisher are discussed as a review of the scientific literature. Furthermore, we provide the latest information on the situation of flame retardants, including the latest innovations in basic sciences. In this sense, from intrinsically fire-resistant materials to flame-retardant additives and nanocomposites, new processes and applications are briefly mentioned."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943c878c28a0473b8998"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1224","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67599d18fdbe83757db7905c","5e70943c878c28a0473b8998"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479331","mniswId":"16369","title":"Polymers","doi":"10.3390/polym","issn":"2073-4360","eissn":"2073-4360","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers","documentHash":"ab72f1ee-fa4b-4e2f-b2c6-7053b68d0ac9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6231d2bf2467f05185353d80","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"6","documentHash":"5d61ec84-8e58-4db5-b65d-207b596a4707"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Electrical engineering","flame extinction","firefighting","flame-extinguishing methods","acoustic oscillations","acoustic pressure","flame-retardant materials"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060104885"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b16af","name":"Damian","lastName":"Frej","uuid":"9B4F05C9B24E5D14A0A10379F44789EBD6B252F050C14C698D50E9A5AD79AF8A508B726C46C73A4865767A734EDEDAA61C313142C45ECE89D65A21106AFF6D86","documentHash":"01b718c7-e24a-4a8a-8b51-a3d680cb1fc0"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394acb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Jaśkiewicz","uuid":"1F0AD0476EDF9D843C9B5E27835438F9EDBDF454BA6CA005A0AF44EB913940D11D2922A807F1ED41C051C80E45F032B2A4A00E2C410224F7CB8B7F56A8E2B085","orcidId":"0000-0002-0032-9477","documentHash":"755c551d-b42c-4746-bea2-fd704a2beba6"}],"objectId":"6759a488fdbe83757db80005","doi":"10.3390/s22249720","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/24/9720/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Comparison of Volunteers’ Head Displacement with Computer Simulation—Crash Test with Low Speed of 20 km/h","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recently, the automotive industry has used simulation programs much more often than experimental research. Computer simulations are more and more often used due to the repeatability of simulation conditions and the possibility of making modifications in simulation objects. Experimental and simulation studies carried out are aimed at developing a model of a simulation dummy adapted to both frontal and rear crash tests, taking into account changes in the moment of resistance in individual joints. The main purpose of the article is to reproduce a real crash test at a low speed of 20 km/h in a simulation program. For this purpose, a series of experimental crash tests with the participation of volunteers was carried out, and then a crash test with a dummy was simulated in the MSC ADAMS program. The experimental studies involved 100 volunteers who were divided into three percentile groups (C5, C50, C95). With the help of force sensors and a high-speed camera, crash tests of volunteers were recorded. The collected data from the force sensors made it possible to map the force in the seat belts. For low-speed crash tests, the displacement and acceleration of individual body parts of the dummy and volunteers can be measured using vision systems. The article identified head displacements of volunteers in the TEMA program based on a video analysis of a crash test film with a frequency of up to 2500 frames per second. The displacement of the simulation dummy's head in the MSC ADAMS program in the considered crash time interval from 0.0 to 0.4 s for all three percentile groups coincided with the head displacement of the volunteers during the experimental crash test."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika

increasing interest for the technology of renewable energy sources for military applications. However, to profit fully from solar or wind energy, an energy storage system is needed. In this article, we present an energy storage system based on acid-lead batteries as a component of a modular generation-storage as a model of military “smart camp”. We proposed a technical approach to study four different types of batteries: DEEP CYCLE, AGM, WET and VRLA in laboratory and real conditions typical for military equipment. It was observed that the best performance was observed for AGM battery in terms of the highest cold cracking amperage equal to 1205 A combined with the most compact construction and resistance to varying thermal conditions from −25 °C, 25 °C and 50 °C. Additionally, a 12-month long-term testing in real conditions revealed that AGM and VRLA showed decrease in capacity value maintaining only approx. 80% of initial value."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709256878c28a047393f7d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e0","uid":"bEduVytcT2Cl4PNhsg9nvnQ","uuid":"3ac086e7-a605-4834-b1d7-4a9de566885f","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Techniki Inżynieryjnej im. profesora Józefa Kosackiego","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938e878c28a0473acae8","627ce1574097075f6793a558","5e7093b5878c28a0473af743"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e0","parentUuid":"3ac086e7-a605-4834-b1d7-4a9de566885f","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e0","rootUuid":"3ac086e7-a605-4834-b1d7-4a9de566885f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394ad3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1 - 10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["627ce1574097075f6793a558","5e7093b5878c28a0473af743","5e709261878c28a047394ad3","5e709256878c28a047393f7d","5e70938e878c28a0473acae8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"627ce1574097075f6793a660","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"10","documentHash":"0cd845d7-5bef-4b96-9932-45a546ab0729"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Akumulator ołowiowo-kwasowy","Energetyka słoneczna","Magazynowanie energii elektrycznej","Odnawialne źródła energii","Technologia","Wojsko"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Armed Forces","Energy harvesting","Energy storage","Lead-acid battery","Solar energy","Technology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061060353"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aeac0","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Frąckowiak","uuid":"7D21839143ACE9F79262072D740D7CF1F308A5F970A3BB02F3B5E14D0D2401E78661E47B7A762137C74DD79AF4E18F90A51656A1EE2748007285FE999CD53973","orcidId":"0000-0003-3416-4735","documentHash":"01827f82-695e-4c44-85da-d999ecd1f0e6"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aea11","name":"Magda","lastName":"Joachimiak","uuid":"F141F5FE037AA4B66D4554297BEB63088D996137DE18C0B0B1E14729AB67C7EF32B7A4BEC47971C272D2F8D616471E7CCA9C619EA4AF3D0E4B2F1E2658717B91","orcidId":"0000-0001-7035-1939","documentHash":"23d5b19c-ee18-4e73-9083-ac6806f364ab"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fc81","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ciałkowski","uuid":"C6023043FDD60FE9768194CF6F369895F347F912164760F7C9FC267FC6FE58C000C2C4DD7C960823811D558FC37AA6FC6621D16C5F9E02C8B1F0DF2E76AAFF24","orcidId":"0000-0002-5335-2072","documentHash":"880b7ef3-2592-4c1c-9850-052fd771bef5"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c53","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Olejnik","uuid":"E807F388329F9DC7FFCC330E2C5B32780163D533D327E3286C5E02AF45309A885832BB361BAB9F34B846C419FCCD06D7351F75D8920E35032F75B003A4F6EDD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2354-0782","documentHash":"b643e0ee-437e-48b8-8cec-dcccc3165146"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a0473949c5","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grysa","uuid":"08C0683B662675E28696A9F3021269C477578DF7266E9D5E3EDA981ECFF38D7427D171FC6DB045995E27A055291CB8074AA44C048B88231D95D2F955974A7473","orcidId":"0000-0002-4437-6830","documentHash":"68aac1eb-660a-4719-a0a4-3b99b1940aef"}],"objectId":"6156a44f2467f025d908face","doi":"10.1108/hff-09-2020-0584","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/HFF-09-2020-0584/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Cauchy type nonlinear inverse problem in a two-layer area","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<b>Purpose</b>\r\nTo reduce the heat load of a gas turbine blade, its surface is covered with an outer layer of ceramics with high thermal resistance. The purpose of this paper is the selection of ceramics with such a low heat conduction coefficient and thickness, so that the permissible metal temperature is not exceeded on the metal-ceramics interface due to the loss ofmechanical properties.\r\n\r\n<b>Design/methodology/approach</b>\r\n\r\nTherefore, for given temperature changes over time on the metal-ceramics interface, temperature changes over time on the inner side of the blade and the assumed initial temperature, the temperature change over time on the outer surface of the ceramics should be determined. The problem presented in this way is a Cauchy type problem. When analyzing the problem, it is taken into account that thermophysical properties of metal and ceramics may depend on temperature. Due to the thin layer of ceramics in relation to the wall thickness, the problem is considered in the area in the flat layer. Thus, a one-dimensional non-stationary heat flow is considered.\r\n\r\n<b>Findings</b>\r\n\r\nThe range of stability of the Cauchy problem as a function of time step, thickness of ceramics and thermophysical properties of metal and ceramics are examined. The numerical computations also involved the influence of disturbances in the temperature on metal-ceramics interface on the solution to the inverse problem.\r\n\r\n<b>Practical implications</b>\r\n\r\nThe computational model can be used to analyze the heat flow in gas turbine blades with thermal barrier.\r\n\r\n<b>Originality/value</b>\r\n\r\nA number of inverse problems of the type considered in the paper are presented in the literature. Inverse problems, especially those Cauchy-type, are ill-conditioned numerically, which means that a small change in the inputs may result in significant errors of the solution. In such a case, regularization of the inverse problem is needed. However, the Cauchy problem presented in the paper does not require regularization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a9878c28a0473aea11","5e7092f2878c28a04739fc81","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeac0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e178","uid":"bNsOc8LWMO-rYhuDMGKqClg","uuid":"b276c277-c4c6-4376-befd-8461236490bd","name":"Wydział Mechatroniki, Uzbrojenia i Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a4878c28a047399c53"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a0473949c5"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"313 - 331","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a9878c28a0473aeac0","5e7093a9878c28a0473aea11","5e7092f2878c28a04739fc81","5e7092a4878c28a047399c53","5e709261878c28a0473949c5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547826f","mniswId":"9190","title":"International Journal of Numerical Methods for Heat and Fluid Flow","issn":"0961-5539","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"9ca7f521-b2ab-4532-acb8-b1d59d927bd5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6211fb9e2467f077c36a964f","year":"2022","volume":"32","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"97201765-cc37-4e70-a9ad-8b7d82ab2a07"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy balance equation","two-layer area","cauchy type problem","inverse heat conduction problem","turbine blade"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654476378"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047392f3f","name":"Marian","lastName":"Gorzałczany","uuid":"1EE444D762C7D026455E2594B1ED8F2A03E6EC64BE2AC403C42301EEA305A7F3AB686E01EA0BA0866C8A8D19CE745CE06CE1DE9EB786FBD3FB875046729D0420","orcidId":"0000-0003-1174-3953","documentHash":"b3948fbb-5691-4020-a810-e23d80006011"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390756","name":"Filip","lastName":"Rudziński","uuid":"100B98F6AE3E6BB40084A067599BFCD042BE9F6E674E9117E0D6F0E6F49E44AC3279ACA84D4BB33C8D8D03D8B6188278BB1CDEF065F5C3B408AFEE98B75CDA17","orcidId":"0000-0003-3719-6572","documentHash":"ea6f262d-e42c-4a0a-a6d6-c9bd5774543e"}],"objectId":"644e14424097074d63c03ff7","doi":"10.1109/jiot.2022.3194837","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9844142","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Intrusion Detection in Internet of Things With MQTT Protocol—An Accurate and Interpretable Genetic-Fuzzy Rule-Based Solution","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article addresses the problem of an accurate and interpretable intrusion detection in Internet of Things (IoT) systems using the knowledge-discovery data-mining/machine-learning approach proposed by us.

A hybrid control structure consisting of a feedback controller and feedforward controller was proposed. A combination of input shaping and feedforward \u001clters is used, thus the badly damped vibrations are more effectively compensated, resulting in better control accuracy of the HSD-SDD system. The goal of optimizing the hybrid control structure is to determine a feedforward \u001clter coef\u001ccient that minimizes the objective function. Finally, the global minimum is calculated from the control error based on the measurement of the input and output signals. The highlight of this study is the development of a new hybrid control structure to compensate for badly damped vibrations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394ad0","5e709242878c28a0473929ff"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"7734-7752","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709242878c28a0473929ff","5e709261878c28a047394ad0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f9e","mniswId":"7872","title":"IEEE Access","issn":"2169-3536","eissn":"2169-3536","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"db1ab7b4-e66e-4b08-9f17-89e1c9bdefec"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6268e87c4097070159845896","year":"2022","volume":"10","documentHash":"b7fbd0db-ff50-471c-a991-8afc83a1dda5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hydraulic servo drive","crusher manipulator","exible connection","cyclical load force","hybrid control structure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654944604"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f6878c28a0473b40db","name":"Marta","lastName":"Grzyb","uuid":"7ADB470FF008AA01FAEEA1F06D667F09D0111D25F5B474E86D4118C3BD3A89A56F479741DCF933B89CB3D606EEDFA1E0B595BF3A6A9C2A8561FDA9C7211D27BD","documentHash":"c8c87942-c681-4814-9683-662f96a14a16"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a047392988","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Koruba","uuid":"FEB77E7585C27F8F1384841F6167BCEFE2ED20D7EF0AB53FE03A3601823E848E0E4071A349EA058619546980AB5F0F9F98BE723907BEE9237C8922CDCBF3904E","documentHash":"38bfef6e-dbd7-46ea-a65e-064845fcd3ef"}],"objectId":"67581bddfdbe835dc165cb04","doi":"10.14313/par_253/41","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.14313/par_253/41","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Comparative Analysis of the Guided Bomb Flight Control System for Different Initial Conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W artykule przedstawiono wyniki badań określających wpływ warunków początkowych samonaprowadzania bomby kierowanej na nieruchomy cel naziemny.

The aim of the study was to investigate the correlation between the initial tilt angle of the guided bomb and the precision of impact, as well as the time required to reach the surface target. To fulfil this purpose, the flight control system of the guided bomb needed to be designed accordingly. The need to develop these systems arises from emerging information that Ukraine and Israel are converting unguided bombs into precision-guided ones. This justification is based on objective reasons. The article analyses the application of classical controllers: PI, PD and PID. Their task was to accurately guide a stationary ground target under various initial conditions. A preliminary method has been proposed for selecting optimal gain coefficients for the PID controller, which constitutes the main component of the autopilot of the guided bomb flight control system. A proprietary interpolation method was suggested, starting with the use of an optimization function in MATLAB software. The numerical findings are presented in a graphical manner."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709241878c28a047392988","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40db"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"41-52","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f6878c28a0473b40db","5e709241878c28a047392988"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a2cd","mniswId":"200205","title":"Pomiary Automatyka Robotyka","issn":"1427-9126","eissn":"","websiteLink":"http://www.par.pl/","documentHash":"2c894541-6ff8-4d21-92e0-889f02d921b7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673318c5fdbe8343db1c838e","year":"2024","volume":"28","number":"3","documentHash":"c7b7d2f4-7da7-458f-8f3b-1b18e5868d22"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["control system","guided bomb","initialconditions","MATLAB","numerical simulation","optimization","PID controller","proportional navigation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655026463"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"615fad2875234017e0505d5c","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Skuza","uuid":"EF3AFE075525458CEBC896F0631C2A1AF866A825987244B270FB45D485D60C0739AFB20F778953BC8721E8024FB11846B47D05531A1109665C931B83F71BB814","documentHash":"66589be6-c777-479c-967d-09f9a5765339"},{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f69d","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Szumska","uuid":"586DC273D8FB3B03215D8F89946941421ACEEE38A421B4187F42B9D3CC118063D37FEFACEEA39B0909D99BA9033987A2D08DFC82D0EC3558679381BED697037B","documentHash":"ca2b7d02-7439-41a5-bad2-0c54cfa33de5"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ae9","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jurecki","uuid":"CB52D03B369410C57F329E005514F4A94BC43959428B45315AC01EAE524292C0E06AC42CA965513AF7EE8DDCC787BC188E3E11F91A41A39071BE402C5224FA1E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0105-1283","documentHash":"b97d0db1-5e79-43e4-9539-e3ae10777384"}],"objectId":"675820b8fdbe835dc166253b","doi":"10.14669/am/162079","publicUri":"http://www.aaejournal.com/pdf-162079-88791","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The analysis of energy recovered by an electric vehicle during selected braking manoeuvres","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Electrical vehicles have the ability to partially recover some kinetic energy during braking. Kinetic energy is transformed into electric energy, which is fed to the battery by the control system and stored there for further use. The aim of this paper was to analyse the levels of energy recovered by an electric vehicle during braking at various speeds and with different braking intensities. The first phase of testing consisted of vehicle braking tests in real-life conditions. The registered speed profiles were then used as input data for the simulation software. The authors have also analysed the effect of the state of charge of the battery and of the vehicle’s load on the amount of energy recovered during braking. The performed simulation tests demonstrated that the level of recovered energy is significantly affected by the initial braking speed and by the force of pressure applied to the brake pedal. The amount of recovered energy is less affected by the state of charge (SOC) of the battery and by the vehicle’s load. Energy regeneration during braking is currently an important research topic. The efficiency of an electric vehicle depends on the range, which can be extended thanks to the additional energy recovered during braking maneuvers. The presented preliminary simulation results are intended to assess the level of energy recovery in electric vehicles. The authors are aware that a full, comprehensive analysis requires additional research using electric vehicles that will verify the results presented in the paper."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","uid":"bnbnGQZbmk21nhxLcDgUVCA","uuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","name":"Politechnika Świętokrzyska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ef878c28a04739f69d","5e709261878c28a047394ae9","615fad2875234017e0505d5c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","parentUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2a","rootUuid":"f7e601ae-54e7-401b-812a-2c1217720a8b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"99","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"18-29","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ef878c28a04739f69d","615fad2875234017e0505d5c","5e709261878c28a047394ae9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac23ad204581b62ebba7","mniswId":"201403","title":"The Archives of Automotive Engineering - Archiwum Motoryzacji","issn":"2084-476X","documentHash":"29ac7032-2f68-47b2-b09a-dd80125350dc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"675820b8fdbe835dc166253c","year":"2023","volume":"99","number":"1","documentHash":"80e7d539-3305-4414-ba13-cdd9ef7d4d4f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["regenerative braking","electric vehicle","vehicle testing","regenerative energy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655026645"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f69d","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Szumska","uuid":"586DC273D8FB3B03215D8F89946941421ACEEE38A421B4187F42B9D3CC118063D37FEFACEEA39B0909D99BA9033987A2D08DFC82D0EC3558679381BED697037B","documentHash":"ca2b7d02-7439-41a5-bad2-0c54cfa33de5"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ae9","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jurecki","uuid":"CB52D03B369410C57F329E005514F4A94BC43959428B45315AC01EAE524292C0E06AC42CA965513AF7EE8DDCC787BC188E3E11F91A41A39071BE402C5224FA1E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0105-1283","documentHash":"b97d0db1-5e79-43e4-9539-e3ae10777384"}],"objectId":"67581f8ffdbe835dc1661b2d","doi":"10.19206/ce-168219","publicUri":"http://www.combustion-engines.eu/pdf-168219-91335","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Technological developments in vehicles with electric drive","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Flota pojazdów elektrycznych systematycznie się powiększa.
