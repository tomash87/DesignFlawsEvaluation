Three types of AgNPs of similar size distribution, but of diverse surface properties, were synthesized using trisodium citrate, sodium hexametaphosphate and tannic acid. The suspensions and solution of silver nitrate were applied in a hydroponic culture in order to assess their influence on the germination of Triticum aestivum seeds. Studies of the damage of the cell membrane and the activity of antioxidant enzymes were carried out on the shoots and roots of the seedlings. The differences in the plant condition were assessed while analyzing photosystem II. The results showed that the AgNPs stabilized with sodium hexametaphosphate exhibited a higher toxicity toward the tested plants than silver ions with the same concentration. It was found that the AgNPs obtained using tannic acid exerted an adverse effect on the crop plants. The citrate-stabilized AgNPs were the least toxic to the seedlings. The obtained results demonstrated that the surface properties of AgNPs strongly influence the phytotoxicity toward T. aestivum seedlings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The hybrids selected for the study differed in their susceptibility to growth under soil compaction stress conditions. We used appropriate methods of non-destructive cleaning and analysis of all intact compartments of the root system. Petrolatum–wax test, proved as an effective screening technique for selecting resistant and sensitive maize hybrids, was also employed. The seedlings were grown in custom-made ‘root-box’ and ‘rootbasket’ containers. The penetration resistance (PR) strength of 0.52 and 1.07 MPa was satisfactory for estimating root penetration index (RPA) among maize hybrids. The soil compaction stress affected root system structure (RSS) in maize hybrids. The resistant hybrids showed a lower decrease in root dry matter (DM) in M and H treatments at 0.0–15 cm soil depth, and an increase in the number of roots growing at an angle of 0°–30° in relation to the main growth axis, comparing to sensitive hybrids. The soil compaction stress lowered root number (RN) and length (RL), shoot and root DM, and increased shoot to root ratio (S/R). The changes were greater in sensitive than in resistant hybrids. In addition, a regression coefficient (R2 ) between stress susceptibility index (SSI) and relative trace change (RTC) marked for changes in dry matter of shoot (S), roots (R), shoot to root (S/R) ratio and root length (RL) and number RN was statistically significant. Seedlings of maize single-cross hybrids demonstrated differences in their responses to soil compaction stress, which caused changes in shoot and root dry matter and the distribution of roots in the soil profile."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e087","uid":"bb1eAT2BMBTGkk695wKT43A","uuid":"7c53f923-c0ac-4e2d-82db-2c93b9fd6578","name":"Wydział Rolniczo-Ekonomiczny","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930a878c28a0473a1a0b","5e70930a878c28a0473a1a10"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

A continuation of these dependencies using the defined model lipid systems is presented in this paper. The influence of homocastasterone (HCS) and castasterone (CS) (BRs for which the increase in concentration were characteristic of plants grown at low temperatures) on the membrane properties of their polar and the hydrophobic parts were studied. Results: Changes in the electrokinetic potential indicate that both BRs decreased the negative charge of the surface, which is an important factor in modifying the contacts with the polar substances. This property of BRs has not yet been described. The studies of the interactions that occur in the hydrophobic part of the membrane were investigated using the EPR methods and Langmuir techniques. The physicochemical parameters of the lipid structure were determined, and the excess of Gibbs free energy was calculated. Conclusion: We conclude that examined BRs modify both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the membranes, but to a greater extent HCS. The consequence of these changes may be the attempt to maintain the stability of the membranes in stressful temperature conditions and/or to the possibility of adsorption of other substances on membranes surfaces. The change of plant metabolism towards increasing the amount of BR, mainly HCS (under cooling) may by an important factor for maintaining optimal structural properties of membranes and their functionality despite temperature changes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a0473982f4","5e709292878c28a047398248","5e7092cb878c28a04739cbb0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Apart from that, the spectrum contained 10% yellow and orange light and 10% green light. The fresh weight of the plants ranged from 8 (perilla) to 1052 mg (nasturtium), whereas the length ranged for the same plants from 2.0 to 26.2 cm. The nasturtium was particularly strongly distinguished from the other species by the high values of its biometric parameters. The fresh mass of most of the other microgreens ranged from 20 to 100 mg, whereas their height ranged from 5 to 8 cm. Red light caused a significant increase in the fresh and dry weights of more than half of the species. The light spectrum had a lesser influence on the length of the plants.

The flag leaf colonization by aphids, as a possible bioindicator of the accumulation of cell wall-bound phenolics, was also estimated.\nMethods\n\nThe proteins of the photosynthetic apparatus that form its core and are crucial for maintaining its stability (D1/PsbA protein), limit destructive effects of light (PsbS, a protein binding carotenoids in the antennas) and participate in efficient electron transport between photosystems II (PSII) and PSI (Rieske iron–sulfur protein of the cytochrome b6f complex) were evaluated in two types of flag leaf rolling. Additionally, biochemical and physiological reactions to drought stress in rolling and non-rolling flag leaves were compared.\nKey Results\n\nThe study identified four types of genome-related types of flag leaf rolling. The biochemical basis for these differences was a different number of phenolic molecules incorporated into polycarbohydrate structures of the cell wall. In an extreme case of non-rolling dehydrated flag leaves, they were found to accumulate high amounts of cell wall-bound phenolics that limited cell water loss and protected the photosynthetic apparatus against excessive light. PSII was also additionally protected against excess light by the accumulation of photosynthetic apparatus proteins that ensured stable and efficient transport of excitation energy beyond PSII and its dissipation as far-red fluorescence and heat. Our analysis revealed a new type of flag leaf rolling brought about by an interaction between wheat and rye genomes, and resulting in biochemical specialization of flexible, rolling and rigid, non-rolling parts of the flag leaf. The study confirmed limited aphid colonization of the flag leaves with enhanced content of cell wall-bound phenolics.\nConclusions\n\nNon-rolling leaves developed effective adaptation mechanisms to reduce both water loss and photoinhibitory damage to the photosynthetic apparatus under drought stress."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

We assume that the invasive populations possess specific and effective adaptive mechanisms making them capable pioneer and nurse plants in dry environments. By colonizing the land, they limit its degradation and initiate revitalization of areas damaged by soil droughts. We analyzed plant water status, the photosynthetic apparatus activity, carbohydrate and phenolic content, the level of non-enzymatic antioxidants and RbcL protein associated with fixation of CO2. The research involved native (Northern Hemisphere: Poland, Spain) and invasive (Southern Hemisphere: Argentine, New Zealand) populations. Contrary to the native population, the invasive one demonstrated soil drought induced specific responses aimed at maintaining high water potential in the leaves, greater content of soluble carbohydrates, and higher osmotic potential. In the invasive population, the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates prevailed over their consumption for the synthesis of phenolic compounds. The invasive plants also maintained high content of assimilation pigments and showed greater level of non-enzymatic antioxidants. Reduced activity of the photosynthetic apparatus was associated both with increased energy amount dissipated from PSII and the efficiency with which an electron can move from the reduced intersystem electron acceptors to the PSI end electron acceptors. The study results pave the path for further research on the genetic basis of sweet briar response to soil drought in the context of progressive steppe formation and desertification."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

A specific response of wheat under both drought and flooding conditions involved an increase in ETo/RC ratio, describing electron transport flux converted into a single reaction center in PSII. Correlations between electrolyte leakage and the probability of electron transport beyond the plastoquinone QA, and the amount of energy used for the electron transport were also found. A specific response of maize during flooding was the increase of stomatal conductance. Additionally, a significant correlation between PN/Ci and relative water content was exhibited.

Therefore, in this paper the relationships between hydrogen peroxide content and effective recovery during rehydration after water stress were analyzed. The study focused on two DH lines of winter triticale with different regeneration potential, as shown by different numbers of lateral stems with ears, grown during rehydration after water stress. During rehydration, the GZDH27 line grows two to three lateral stems with ears, whereas the GZDH88 line grows a single lateral stem with ear. The two DH lines of winter triticale showed comparable responses to the drought stress but their responses to rehydration after the drought stress were clearly different. Results revealed, that the increased accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, which was induced during the drought, can be maintained during rehydration, thus stimulating plant senescence. In the line GZDH88, rehydration did not slow down drought-induced senescence. This was manifested by higher levels of hydrogen peroxide, accompanied by lower levels of chlorophyll in the flag leaves of GZDH88 plants, as the result of which only one lateral stem was formed during rehydration. However, development of one lateral stems during rehydration in the GZDH88 line allowed for smaller yield loss than in the GZDH77 line, that developed of three lateral stems during rehydration. The efficient production of carbohydrates and their effective allocation into the ears of the lateral stems required considerable energy expenditure in the GZDH27 line.

Doubled haploid lines with a high and low yield capacity which had been subjected to drought during their generative development stage were selected for the research. Despite varying levels of flag leaf hydration under drought conditions, the chlorophyll content values found in the flag leaves were at a similar level in the individual doubled haploid lines. In both the high- and low-yield doubled haploid lines, soil drought induced changes in the level of photosynthetic pigments, soluble carbohydrates, and phenols below a subflag leaf. Furthermore, the reduction in, or even the inhibition of senescence during the rehydration period was identified as an important factor for plant productivity after exposure to soil drought.

Higher activity of the primary metabolism of carbohydrates is a feature of the WDG type, while the dominance of the rye genome is associated with a higher activity of the secondary metabolism of phenolic compounds in the RDG type. The study analyzed carbohydrates and key enzymes of their synthesis, free phenolic compounds and carbohydrate-related components of the cell wall, monolignols, and shikimic acid (ShA), which is a key link between the primary and secondary metabolism of phenolic compounds. Under water stress, dominance of the wheat genome in the WDG type was manifested by an increased accumulation of the large subunit of Rubisco and sucrose phosphate synthase and a higher content of raffinose and stachyose compared with the RDG type. In dehydrated RDG plants, higher activity of L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and L-tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL), as well as a higher level of ShA, free and cell wall-bound p-hydroxybenzoic acid, free homovanillic acid, free sinapic acid, and cell wall-bound syringic acid can be considered biochemical indicators of the dominance of the rye genome."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

In commercial rhubarb stalk production, the bud dormancy development and release are crucial processes that determine the yields and quality of stalks. To date, reports on rhubarb bud dormancy regulation, however, are lacking. It is known that dormancy status depends on cultivars. The study aimed to determine the dormancy regulation in a valuable selection of rhubarb ‘Malinowy’. Changes in carbohydrate, total phenolic, endogenous hormone levels, and gene expression levels during dormancy development and release were studied in micropropagated rhubarb plantlets. Dormancy developed at high temperature (25.5 °C), and long day. Leaf senescence and dying were consistent with a significant increase in starch, total phenolics, ABA, IAA and SA levels. Five weeks of cooling at 4 °C were sufficient to break dormancy, but rhizomes stored for a longer duration showed faster and more uniformity leaf growing, and higher stalk length. No growth response was observed for non-cooled rhizomes. The low temperature activated carbohydrate and hormone metabolism and signalling in the buds. The increased expression of AMY3, BMY3, SUS3, BGLU17, GAMYB genes were consistent with a decrease in starch and increase in soluble sugars levels during dormancy release. Moreover, some genes (ZEP, ABF2, GASA4, GA2OX8) related to ABA and GA metabolism and signal transduction were activated. The relationship between auxin (IAA, IBA, 5-Cl-IAA), and phenolic, including SA levels and dormancy status was also observed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a047398705","5e7094a7878c28a0473c10e9"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

It is deposited in cell walls and creates a mechanical barrier against external factors. The aim of this study was to determine the role of silicon supplementation in the synthesis and distribution of callose in oilseed rape roots and to characterize the modifications of cell wall structure of these organs after exposure to drought stress. Histological and ultrastructural analyses were performed to determine the changes in the distribution of arabinogalactan proteins, pectins, and extensin in roots of Brassica napus growing under drought and supplemented with silicon. Callose deposition and the accumulation of callose synthase protein were assessed, followed by transcriptional analysis of callose synthase genes. Results The results showed that silicon supplementation under drought conditions alter the direction of cortex cell differentiation, promoting fiber formation and proliferation of callose-depositing cells in the roots of the tested plants. This was reflected in an increase in the level of callose synthase and a decrease in the transcriptional activity of the gene encoding this enzyme, indicating regulation based on negative feedback under drought stress. The changes in abundance and distribution of investigated arabinogalactan proteins, pectins and extensin in roots of Si supplemented plants growing under drought stress were observed, indicating cell walls remodeling. Conclusion Silicon supplementation in oilseed rape roots induced significant changes in cell wall composition, including increased callose deposition and altered pectins and arabinogalactan proteins distribution. These modifications, along with the formation of fibres in the root cortex, likely contribute to enhanced cell wall strength providing a physical barrier against water loss and mechanical stress, as a probable defence mechanism induced during drought stress."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a0473931d2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677d2f3efdbe831a382dfe8a","5e7092e7878c28a04739f004"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The experiment was performed in a phytotronic chamber (LEDs) and in a greenhouse (solar radiation supplemented with HPS lamps as a control). The effects were analyzed at the flowering phase with biometric measurements, leaf chlorophyll index, the kinetics of chlorophyll a fluorescence, content of soluble carbohydrates and phenolics in the leaves. Applied LED light decreased the biomass but stimulated the production of phenolics compared to control plants. In control plants, a positive correlation between flavonoid content and energy dissipation from photosystem II (DIo/CSm) was found, while in plants under LEDs total pool of phenolic content correlated with this parameter and the quantum yield of electron transport (φ Ro and ψ Ro) was lower than that of the control, probably affecting buckwheat biomass."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9b","uid":"bYCUNhDROBwukUMKDm2MWgQ","uuid":"c21fd2c0-91d1-4bec-849c-ed0cf62231ec","name":"Instytut Botaniki im.

Therefore, the impact of three types of AuNPs on Chlorella vulgaris was studied after short-term exposure. The AuNPs were prepared using sodium borohydride (SB), cysteamine hydrochloride (CH) and trisodium citrate (TC). Microscopic imaging revealed that the AuNPs were characterized by quasi-spherical shape and an average size within the range 9–12 nm. CHSBAuNPs were positively charged whereas TCAuNPs and SBAuNPs were negatively charged. The results of studies showed that the exposure to each type of AuNPs led to the dose-dependent decrease of growth rate of C. vulgaris biomass. The swelling of the cells was observed especially at concentration of 5 mg L−1. For all treatments, significant changes in efficiency of the photosystem II were detected. Each type of AuNPs applied in concentration of 1 mg L−1 caused an increase and in concentration of 5 mg L−1 a decrease of photosynthetic pigments content. Based on recorded Raman spectra, it was found that the cell chemical composition was disturbed radically after the treatment with SBAuNPs and CHSBAuNPs. It was established that the changes in the morphology and physiology of C. vulgaris cells, as a result of the exposure on the AuNPs, were strongly dependent on the surface properties of AuNPs. Nevertheless, it was impossible to indicate the most harmful type of AuNPs. Obtained findings did not confirm that the stabilization of AuNPs by molecules of well-documented toxicity lead to the increase of their toxic effects. It was not confirmed that positively charged CHSBAuNPs, stabilized by cysteamine, were more harmful for C. vulgaris than negatively charged TCAuNPs and SBAuNPs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","uid":"blTedeK8fuVutIuS0UC1hLA","uuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","name":"Politechnika Krakowska im.

Thus far, little is known about the factors and mechanisms involved in the dormancy development of micropropagated herbaceous perennials, including rhubarb. This study determined physiological and molecular changes in the Rheum rhaponticum (culinary rhubarb) ‘Raspberry’ planting material in response to photoperiod and temperature. We found that the rhubarb plantlets that were grown under a 16-h photoperiod (LD) and a temperature within the normal growth range (17–23 °C) showed active growth of leaves and rhizomes and did not develop dormancy. Rapid growth cessation and dormancy development were observed in response to a 10-h photoperiod (SD) or elevated temperature under LD. These morphological changes were accompanied by enhanced abscisic acid (ABA) and starch levels and also the upregulation of various genes involved in carbohydrate synthesis and transport (SUS3, AMY3, BMY3, BGLU17) and ABA synthesis and signaling (ZEP and ABF2). We also found enhanced expression levels of heat shock transcription factors (HSFA2 and HSFA6B), heat shock proteins (HSP22, HSP70.1, HSP90.2 and HSP101) and antioxidant enzymes (PRX12, APX2 and GPX). This may suggest that dormancy induction in micropropagated rhubarb plantlets is a stress response to light deficiency and high temperatures and is endogenously coordinated by the ABA, carbohydrate and ROS pathways."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a047398705","5e7094a7878c28a0473c10e9"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Among abiotic stresses, temperature stresses are a serious and at the same time unpredictable problem for plant production. Both frost (in the case of winter cereals) and high temperatures in summer (especially combined with a water deficit in the soil) can result in significant yield losses. Plants have developed various adaptive mechanisms that have enabled them to survive periods of extreme temperatures. The processes of acclimation to low and high temperatures are controlled, among others, by phytohormones. The current review is devoted to the role of brassinosteroids (BR) in cereal acclimation to temperature stress with special attention being paid to the impact of BR on photosynthesis and the membrane properties. In cereals, the exogenous application of BR increases frost tolerance (winter rye, winter wheat), tolerance to cold (maize) and tolerance to a high temperature (rice). Disturbances in BR biosynthesis and signaling are accompanied by a decrease in frost tolerance but unexpectedly an improvement of tolerance to high temperature (barley). BR exogenous treatment increases the efficiency of the photosynthetic light reactions under various temperature conditions (winter rye, barley, rice), but interestingly, BR mutants with disturbances in BR biosynthesis are also characterized by an increased efficiency of PSII (barley). BR regulate the sugar metabolism including an increase in the sugar content, which is of key importance for acclimation, especially to low temperatures (winter rye, barley, maize). BR either participate in the temperature-dependent regulation of fatty acid biosynthesis or control the processes that are responsible for the transport or incorporation of the fatty acids into the membranes, which influences membrane fluidity (and subsequently the tolerance to high/low temperatures) (barley). BR may be one of the players, along with gibberellins or ABA, in acquiring tolerance to temperature stress in cereals (particularly important for the acclimation of cereals to low temperature)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

These factors may also affect the physiological activity of plants, causing changes in pollen allergenicity. The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of air pollutants on the chemical composition of birch pollen and the secondary structures of the Bet v1 protein. The research was conducted in seven locations in Malopolska region, South of Poland of a different pollution level. We have found slight fluctuations in the values of parameters describing the photosynthetic light reactions, similar spectra of leaf reflectance and the negligible differences in the discrimination values of the δ13C carbon isotope were found. The obtained results show a minor effect of a degree of pollution on the physiological condition B. pendula specimen. On the other hand, mean Bet v1 concentration measured in pollen samples collected in Kraków was significantly higher than in less polluted places (p = .03886), while FT-Raman spectra showed the most distinct variations in the wavenumbers characteristic of proteins. Pollen collected at sites of the increased NOx and PM concentration, show the highest percentage values of potential aggregated forms and antiparallel β-sheets in the expense of α-helix, presenting a substantial impact on chemical compounds of pollen, Bet v1 concentration and on formation of the secondary structure of proteins, what can influence their functions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ce878c28a0473b118a","5e709313878c28a0473a2649","5e709325878c28a0473a3a2d"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a0473982e4","5e709292878c28a047398296","5e7092cb878c28a04739cbb8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

As strains with the lower pre-IC control (lowPICC) we used, Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterozygous strains having only one functional copy of genes, encoding essential replication proteins such as Cdc6, Dbf4, Sld3, Sld7, Sld2, and Mcm10. The lowPICC strains exhibited a significant reduction in the respective genes' mRNA levels, causing cell cycle aberrations and doubling time extensions. Additionally, the reduced expression of the lowPICC genes led to an aberrant DNA damage response, affected cellular and mitochondrial DNA content, extended the lifespan of post-mitotic cells, and increased the yeast's reproductive potential.

A comparative study was conducted on cultivars with different agronomic and physiological traits. The deacclimation process can occur when there are periods of higher temperatures, particularly in the late autumn or winter. This interrupts the process of the acclimation (hardening) of winter crops to low temperatures, thus reducing their frost tolerance and becoming a serious problem for agriculture. The experimental model included plants that were non-acclimated, cold acclimated (at 4 °C) and deacclimated (at 16 °C/9 °C, one week). We found that deacclimation tolerance (maintaining a high frost tolerance despite warm deacclimating periods) was a cultivar-dependent trait. Some of the cultivars developed a high frost tolerance after cold acclimation and maintained it after deacclimation. However, there were also cultivars that had a high frost tolerance after cold acclimation but lost some of it after deacclimation (the cultivars that were more susceptible to deacclimation). Deacclimation reversed the changes in the photosystem efficiency that had been induced by cold acclimation, and therefore, measuring the different signals associated with photosynthetic efficiency (based on prompt and delayed chlorophyll fluorescence) of plants could be a sensitive tool for monitoring the deacclimation process (and possible changes in frost tolerance) in oilseed rape. Higher levels of BR were characteristic of the better frost-tolerant cultivars in both the cold-acclimated and deacclimated plants. The relative expression of the BRI1 transcript (encoding the BR-receptor protein) was lower after cold acclimation and remained low in the more frost-tolerant cultivars after deacclimation. The role of brassinosteroids in oilseed rape acclimation/deacclimation is briefly discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

To avoid genetic instability, each DNA fragment needs to be amplified only once per cell cycle. DNA replication in eukaryotes starts with the binding of the origin recognition complex (ORC) to the origins of DNA replication. The genes encoding ORC subunits have been conserved across eukaryotic evolution and are essential for the initiation of DNA replication. In this study, we conducted an extensive physiological and aging-dependent analysis of heterozygous cells lacking one copy of ORC genes in the BY4743 background. Cells with only one copy of the ORC genes showed a significant decrease in the level of ORC mRNA, a delay in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and an extended doubling time. Here, we also show that the reducing the levels of Orc1-6 proteins significantly extends both the budding and average chronological lifespans. Heterozygous ORC/orcΔ and wild-type diploid cells easily undergo haploidization during chronological aging. This ploidy shift might be related to nutrient starvation or the inability to survive under stress conditions. A Raman spectroscopy analysis helped us to strengthen the hypothesis of the importance of lipid metabolism and homeostasis in aging."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709216878c28a04738fbb1","5e7093a2878c28a0473ae225","5e70922a878c28a047390eb9"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e2878c28a0473b299c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

This study aims to: (1) Determine the efect of varying microwave treatment \n(MWT) durations on the control of S. hogweed using a device emitting microwaves at 2.45GHz, \n32.8 kW/m2\n; (2) Evaluate the impact of MWT on soil by an ecotoxicological bioassays; (3) Analyze \nbiochemical changes occurring in the roots during the process. A feld study was performed to assess \nthe efcacy of S. hogweed control using MWT in times from 2.5 to 15 min. The MWT-treated soil was \ncollected immediately after treatment (AT) and tested using bioassays (Phytotoxkit, Ostracodtoxkit, \nand Microtox). Fourteen days AT, the MWT hogweed roots were dug out, air-dried, and analyzed for \nthe content and composition of essential oil, sugars, and fatty acids. According to the ecotoxicological \nbiotests, the MWT soils were classifed as non-toxic or low-toxic. The regeneration of hogweed was \nobserved only in non-treated plants (control). Hogweed MWT for 2.5–15 min did not regenerate up to \n14 days AT. The average weight of roots in hogweed MWT for 15.0 min was ca. two times smaller than \nthe control plants. Those roots contained signifcantly higher amounts of sugars and saturated fatty \nacids than the control. We did not fnd a correlation between S. hogweed root essential oil content and \ncomposition and MWT time. The main compounds of essential oil were p-cymene and myristicin. No \nhighly photosensitizing compounds were identifed in the tested root oil. We conclude that MWT of \nS. hogweed could be an environmentally safe and prospective control method, but more studies are \nneeded"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709335878c28a0473a4e88"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

As a consequence, plants are exposed to a variety of abiotic stressors that contribute to their morpho-physiological, biochemical, and molecular alterations, which affects plant growth and development as well as the quality and productivity of crops. Thus, novel strategies are still being developed to meet the challenges of the modern world related to climate changes and natural ecosystem degradation. Innovative methods that have recently received special attention include eco-friendly, easily available, inexpensive, and, very often, plant-based methods. However, such approaches require better cognition and understanding of plant adaptations and acclimation mechanisms in response to adverse conditions. In this succinct review, we have highlighted defense mechanisms against external stimuli (mainly exposure to elevated levels of metal elements) which can be activated through permanent microevolutionary changes in metal-tolerant species or through exogenously applied priming agents that may ensure plant acclimation and thereby elevated stress resistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a639a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Oat cultivars of ‘Krezus’ and ‘Akt’ were investigated regarding embryo anatomy, the endogenous phytohormone profiles, and antioxidant capacity. The zygotic embryos of oat were used as a reference. It was found that twenty-one days old haploid embryos were smaller and had a less advanced structure than zygotic ones. Morphology and anatomy modifications of haploid embryos were accompanied by extremely low levels of endogenous auxins. Higher levels of cytokinins, as well as tenfold higher cytokinin to auxin ratio in haploid than in zygotic embryos, may suggest an earlier stage of development of these former. Individual gibberellins reached higher values in ‘Akt’ haploid embryos than in the respective zygotic ones, while the differences in both types of ‘Krezus’ embryos were not noticed. Additionally to the hormonal regulation of haploid embryogenesis, the poor germination of oat haploid embryos can be a result of the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and therefore higher levels of low molecular weight antioxidants and stress hormones.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that the deletion of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis leads to significant impact on aging. In this study, we analysed five deletion mutants: crh2Δ, cwp1Δ, flo11Δ, gas1Δ and hsp12Δ. We showed a correlation between Raman spectroscopy signatures assigned to proteins, nucleic acids and RNA and replicative aging. Using Raman spectroscopy, we also revealed that a lack GAS1 gene results in significant changes in the biochemical composition of the cells that may increase sensitivity to environmental stressors. Our data unequivocally indicate that employing yeast as a model in aging research is appropriate, as long as the factors under analysis are not implicated in cell wall biogenesis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70946d878c28a0473bcd2e","5e70922a878c28a047390eb9","6705eaa8ece39845a342abcc"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The  application  of  dithiothreitol  into  co-cultivation and regeneration media led to a significant decrease in the activities of ascorbate peroxidase and catalase in both infected and non-infected explants of both cultivars. In contrast, explants regenerated without dithiothreitol exhibited a significant increase in ascorbate peroxidase  activity  and  a  decrease  in  catalase  activity,  although  the  decrease  in  catalase  activity  was  not  as  pronounced.  The  proline content  increased  significantly  in  all  analysed  explants,  with  the  highest  increase  observed  in  explants  regenerated  in  the  presence  of dithiothreitol.

Stress is an inevitable factor accompanying every professional athlete at various stages of sports competition. A group of professional female volleyball players being at the preparatory stage for the sports season were involved in this research. The correlation between laboratory tests cortisol concentration and the FTIR absorbance value as well as Raman intensity corresponding to the vibrations of the lipid functional groups was shown. The degree of this revealed correlation was determined by the Pearson test. It was shown that correlation was best reflected by the absorbance value of FTIR spectra for the 1240 cm−1 and 2930 cm−1 wavenumbers. Moreover, the error level for the proposed spectral analysis is less than 25%. This interdisciplinary research showed for the first time the potential use of the FTIR spectroscopy method in a stress level measure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae0aa"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

In our experiment, we compared the influence of ozone (100 ppb) on photosynthesis and changes in the pigment composition of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis) leaves depending on the spectral composition of light. We used white LED light (WL), a combination of red + green + blue (RGBL) with a dominant red component and white +blue (WBL) with a dominant blue component in comparison with the classic sodium lamp lighting (yellow light—YL). The values of the parameters describing the light-dependent phase of photosynthesis and the parameters of the gas exchange, as well as non-photosynthesis pigment contents, show that the spectral composition strongly differentiates the response of Chinese cabbage leaves to ozone. In general, the efficiency of photochemical reactions was the highest in YL, but after O3 fumigation, it decreased. In plants growing in WL and WBL, the increase of O3 concentration stimulated light photosynthesis reactions and led to the enhancement of transpiration, stomatal conductance and intracellular CO2 concentration. Changes in photosynthetic activity were accompanied by an increase in the content of anthocyanins and flavonols."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a0473982e4","5e709292878c28a047398296","5e7092cb878c28a04739cbb8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Red-stalked cultivars and selection are more attractive for the fresh market and processing industry. In vitro cultures are important for rapidly multiplying value genotypes and producing plants free of viruses. This study aimed to develop an in vitro propagation method for six rhubarb selections from the Raspberry (R1, R2, R3), Leader (L1, L2), and Karpow Lipskiego (KL) groups. In addition, the planting material of six rhubarb selections was subjected to phytochemical analysis using the HPLC method to assess the content of bioactive compounds. The cultures were initiated from underground buds on the crowns. The initial growth was obtained for 45 to 75% of initial explants because of bacterial contamination and low bud activity of some genotypes. The type and concentration of cytokinin and its interaction with gibberellin acid (GA3) were shown to have a significant effect on the cyclic multiplication and commercially interesting rate of all rhubarb genotypes. A high in vitro rooting frequency, 93.7 to 95.8% for rhubarb Raspberry, 94.3 to 100% for rhubarb Leader, and 96.7% KP selections were obtained after two-cycle rooting on a medium containing IBA and NAA. The polyphenolic compounds, such as cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, rhaponticin, resveratrol, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid were detected in selected rhubarb genotypes. The highest content of anthocyanins (2.9 mg·1 g−1 DM) and rhaponticin (107.8 µg·1 g−1 DM) was found in Raspberry selections. On the other hand, Leader selections were characterized by the highest content of resveratrol (0.25 µg·1 g−1 DM) and phenolic acids (1.3 µg·1 g−1 DM). The less attractive for functional food production seems to be KL selection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a047398705"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Diagnosis of this disease is based on: physical examination, peripheral blood findings, bone marrow morphology, cytogenetics, and molecular markers. However, the molecular marker of PM, which is a mutation in the JAK2V617F gene, was observed also in other myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Therefore, there is a need to find methods that provide a marker unique to PM and allow for higher accuracy of PM diagnosis and consequently the treatment of the disease. Continuing, in this study, we used Raman spectroscopy, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis as helpful diagnostic tools for PM. Consequently, we used serum collected from PM patients, which were classified using clinical parameters of PM such as the dynamic international prognostic scoring system (DIPSS) for primary myelofibrosis plus score, the JAK2V617F mutation, spleen size, bone marrow reticulin fibrosis degree and use of hydroxyurea drug features. Raman spectra showed higher amounts of C-H, C-C and C-C/C-N and amide II and lower amounts of amide I and vibrations of CH3 groups in PM patients than in healthy ones. Furthermore, shifts of amides II and I vibrations in PM patients were noticed. Machine learning methods were used to analyze Raman regions: (i) 800 cm−1 and 1800 cm−1, (ii) 1600 cm−1–1700 cm−1, and (iii) 2700 cm−1–3000 cm−1 showed 100 % accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Differences in the spectral dynamic showed that differences in the amide II and amide I regions were the most significant in distinguishing between PM and healthy subjects. Importantly, until now, the efficacy of Raman spectroscopy has not been established in clinical diagnostics of PM disease using the correlation between Raman spectra and PM clinical prognostic scoring.

Two essential components of chromatin, the linker histone Hho1p and actin-related protein 4 (Arp4p), have been shown to physically interact in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, thus maintaining chromatin dynamics and function, as well as genome stability and cellular morphology. Disrupting this interaction has been proven to influence the stability of the yeast genome and the way cells respond to stress during chronological ageing. It has also been proven that the abrogated interaction between these two chromatin proteins elicited premature ageing phenotypes. Alterations in chromatin compaction have also been associated with replicative ageing, though the main players are not well recognized. Based on this knowledge, here, we examine how the interaction between Hho1p and Arp4p impacts the ageing of mitotically active yeast cells. For this purpose, two sets of strains were used&amp;mdash;haploids (WT(n), arp4, hho1&amp;Delta; and arp4 hho1&amp;Delta;) and their heterozygous diploid counterparts (WT(2n), ARP4/arp4, HHO1/hho1&amp;Delta; and ARP4 HHO1/arp4 hho1&amp;Delta;)&amp;mdash;for the performance of extensive morphological and physiological analyses during replicative ageing. These analyses included a comparative examination of the yeast cells&amp;rsquo; chromatin structure, proliferative and reproductive potential, and resilience to stress, as well as polysome profiles and chemical composition. The results demonstrated that the haploid chromatin mutants arp4 and arp4 hho1&amp;Delta; demonstrated a significant reduction in replicative and total lifespan. These findings lead to the conclusion that the importance of a healthy interaction between Arp4p and Hho1p in replicative ageing is significant. This is proof of the concomitant importance of Hho1p and Arp4p in chronological and replicative ageing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The\nstudy was carried out on germinating seeds and mature plants of a Polish SMH87 line, an Australian\ncultivar ‘Tamaroi’ (salt-sensitive), and the BC5Nax2 line (salt-tolerant) exposed to 0–150 mM NaCl.\nGermination parameters, electrolyte leakage (EL), and salt susceptibility index were determined in\nthe germinating caryopses, whereas photosynthetic parameters, carbohydrate and phenolic content,\nantioxidant activity as well as yield were measured in fully developed plants. The parameters\nthat most differentiated the examined accessions in the germination phase were the percentage of\ngerminating seeds (PGS) and germination vigor (Vi). In the fully developed plants, parameters\nincluded whether the plants had the maximum efficiency of the water-splitting reaction on the donor\nside of photosystem II (PSII)–Fv/F0, energy dissipation from PSII–DIo/CSm, and the content of\nphotosynthetic pigments and hydrogen peroxide, which differentiated studied genotypes in terms\nof salinity tolerance degree. Salinity has a negative impact on grain yield by reducing the number\nof seeds per spike and the mass of one thousand seeds (MTS), which can be used as the most\nsuitable parameter for determining tolerance to salinity stress. The most salt-tolerant BC5Nax2 line\nwas characterized by the highest PGS, and Vi for NaCl concentration of 100–150 mM, content of\nchlorophyll a, b, carotenoids, and also MTS at all applied salt concentrations as compared with the\nother accessions.

One such potential source of low-temperature waste heat is the process of seed germination during food plant cultivation. In traditional production facilities, germinating plants generate low-temperature heat (20–40 °C), which is typically discharged into the environment. This paper presents a study on the heat recovery potential of germinating Mung bean seeds under laboratory and controlled cultivation conditions using an isothermal calorimeter and a process line, respectively. This study represents the first quantitative determination of the heat generated during the Mung bean sprout production cycle, and a comparison of the changes in emitted heat on both micro and macro scales. Additionally, the research includes the first determination of the amount of energy generated by Mung bean sprouts using microcalorimetric studies lasting up as long as 120 h. The paper determines the amount of heat generated and estimates the possible and actual heat recovery potential. The results show that the average amount of heat generated in the calorimetric studies is 2.43±0.72 kJ/gseeds, while under controlled cultivation conditions it is 2.29 kJ/gseed. These findings highlight the significant potential for recovering waste heat from germinating seeds, which can be harnessed to improve the energy efficiency of the food sprout production process. In addition, the calorimetric method is suitable for determining the energy potential of plants and facilitating the design of the most efficient crop cultivation techniques in terms of energy consumption."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Much less is known about the presence and functions of pregnane derivatives in plants. The main objectives of this work were (1) to determine the presence of pregnane derivatives\nin winter wheat (2) verify if there are changes of concentration of pregnane derivatives during wheat growth/development\nwith special attention to vernalisation process (3) to answer the question of whether selected pregnane derivatives are\nstimulators of wheat development and whether the potential stimulation of this development is accompanied by the expression of the Vrn1 (Vernalisation1) gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates the presence of pregnenolone and 5α-dihydroprogesterone in the leaves and intact crowns of winter wheat. The levels of some of the pregnane derivatives changed during plant growth/development, it was demonstrated that pregnenolone, pregnanolone and 17α-hydroxypregnenolone stimulated wheat development. The changes in the Vrn1 expression are discussed in light of the stimulation of generative development by the pregnane derivatives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709394878c28a0473ad420"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

This study investigates the distribution patterns of closely related Oenothera species focusing on their adaptations to environmental conditions through morphological traits and photosynthetic adjustments. We documented the three distinct distribution patterns in Europe among the studied species. Oenothera rubricaulis, found at higher latitudes, has the smallest flowers and the highest chlorophyll content, accompanied by anthocyanin accumulation, which maximizes light acquisition under low light conditions. Oenothera suaveolens, observed at lower latitudes, displays the largest flowers, a pure green phenotype, the highest stomatal conductance, and a light avoidance strategy, reflected by rapid photoinhibition and hyponasty. Oenothera biennis, with the widest distribution, exhibits an intermediate phenotype, suggesting high plasticity and adaptability of its photosynthetic apparatus. Given the close relationship of these species, our findings suggest that environmental selection following hybridization events has been crucial for their establishment in Europe."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397cc0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9b","uid":"bYCUNhDROBwukUMKDm2MWgQ","uuid":"c21fd2c0-91d1-4bec-849c-ed0cf62231ec","name":"Instytut Botaniki im.

We hypothesized that iron (FeSOD) and/or manganese (MnSOD) dominate as active forms in these cyanobacteria. Activity staining and three different spectroscopic methods of SOD activity bands excised from the gels were used to identify a suitable metal in the separated samples. FeSODs or enzymes belonging to the Fe-MnSOD superfamily were detected. The spectroscopic analyses showed that only Fe is present in the SOD activity bands. We found FeSOD in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 while two forms in G. violaceus and Geitlerinema sp. ZHR1A: FeSOD1 and FeSOD2 were present. However, no active Cu/ZnSODs were identified in G. violaceus and Geitlerinema sp. ZHR1A. We have shown that selected spectroscopic techniques can be complementary to the commonly used method of staining for SOD activity in a gel. Furthermore, the occurrence of active SODs in the cyanobacteria studied is also discussed in the context of SOD evolution in oxyphotrophs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

This machinery is known as a replisome and is highly evolutionarily conserved, from simple unicellular organisms such as yeast to human cells. The replisome comprises multiple protein complexes responsible for various steps in the replication process. One crucial component of the replisome is the Cdc45-MCM-GINS (CMG) helicase complex, which unwinds double-stranded DNA and coordinates the assembly and function of other replisome components, including DNA polymerases. The genes encoding the CMG helicase components are essential for initiating DNA replication. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the absence of one copy of the CMG complex genes in heterozygous Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells impacts the cells' physiology and aging. Our data revealed that these cells exhibited a significant reduction in transcript levels for the respective CMG helicase complex proteins, as well as disruptions in the cell cycle, extended doubling times, and alterations in their biochemical profile. Notably, this study provided the first demonstration that cells heterozygous for genes encoding subunits of the CMG helicase exhibited a significantly increased reproductive potential and delayed chronological aging. Additionally, we observed a noteworthy correlation between RNA and polysaccharide levels in yeast and their reproductive potential, as well as a correlation between fatty acid levels and cell doubling times.

We ran field and greenhouse experiments and determined effects on grain yield, biomass, weight of 1000 grains, shoot and roots dry matter (DM), shoot-to-roots ratio, harvest index, plant height, emergence index, leaf area and greening and root number and length. Individual and combined effects of both stresses were observed in the field and greenhouse. Compared with plants growing in loose soil and optimal irrigation (LI), the resistant hybrids in treatments HI, LD and HD showed a smaller reduction in GY, BY, S, R, RN and RL than the sensitive. In both groups, stress influence on HA, W-1000, LA and SPAD was smaller and the differences were insignificant. Compared with LI treatment, the roots of LD, HI and HD increased their DM, number and length in the upper level of the soil profile and the number of roots developed at 0–30° and 30–60° in relation to the root main axis. Analysis of those traits in the hybrids resistant and sensitive to both stress factors enabled to explain a defence response. Our study demonstrated that soil compaction and soil drought, which usually occurs simultaneously, caused significant changes in components of plant yield and showed plant plasticity in response to environmental factors under natural conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

This study investigated the effects of blue, red, and white-red LED lights on plant biomass growth, photosynthetic pigments, soluble sugars, phenolic compounds, the production of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes in Leucojum aestivum L. cultures. A white fluorescent light was used as a control. The plants that were grown under white-red and red light showed the highest fresh biomass increments. The blue light stimulated chlorophyll a, carotenoid, and flavonoid production. The white-red and blue lights were favourable for phenolic acid biosynthesis. Chlorogenic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric, ferulic, sinapic, and benzoic acids were identified in plant materials, with ferulic acid dominating. The blue light had a significant beneficial effect both on galanthamine (4.67 µg/g of dry weight (DW)) and lycorine (115 µg/g DW) biosynthesis. Red light treatment increased catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, and high catalase activity was also observed in plants treated with white-red and blue light. This is the first report to provide evidence of the effects of LED light on the biosynthesis of phenolic acid and Amaryllidaceae alkaloids in L. aestivum cultures, which is of pharmacological importance and can propose new strategies for their production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

It forms numerous rhizomes that are important in the sequestration of carbon dioxide. The plant can be a source of lignin and cellulose, biomass for renewable energy production, and can be used in small garden architecture, or to strengthen the banks of landslides. Breeding this species is difficult, as it is a sterile allotriploid with 57 chromosomes. The aim of the study was to obtain fertile plants of this species by treating its callus and regenerants with chromosome doubling agents such as colchicine, oryzalin, trifluralin, and caffeine at variable concentrations and durations. Callus cells naturally showed large variations in the number of chromosomes but only euploid cells regenerated plants. Treatment of the regenerants with 1252 µM colchicine for 18 h allowed for obtaining two hexaploid shoots; however, they died before flowering.

The balance between endogenous phytohormones must be altered to induce microspore reprogramming from the classical pollen-formation pathway to embryogenic development, but too extensive changes may be detrimental. In the present study, the levels of auxins, cytokinins and abscisic acid were monitored in the anthers of two Polish winter wheat F1 lines and the spring cultivar Pavon highly differentiated in terms of ME effectiveness. Analyses were carried out at subsequent steps of the ME induction procedure that combined low temperature, sodium selenate and mannitol tiller pre-treatment.\nResults\nOf all the factors tested, mannitol induced the most profound effect on phytohormones and their homeostasis in wheat anthers. It significantly increased the accumulation of all auxins and decreased the levels of most cytokinins, while the change in ABA content was limited to cv. Pavon. In an attempt to alleviate this hormonal shock, we tested several modifications of the induction medium hormonal composition and found thidiazuron to be the most promising in stimulating the embryogenic development of wheat microspores.\nConclusions\nThe lack of ABA-driven stress defence responses may be one of the reasons for the low effectiveness of ME induction in winter wheat microspore cultures. Low cytokinin level and a disturbed auxin/cytokinin balance may then be responsible for the morphological abnormalities observed during the next phases of embryogenic microspore development. One possible solution is to modify the hormonal composition of the induction medium with thidiazuron identified as the most promising component."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["68231c58fdbe8345015fd99a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"68231c58fdbe8345015fd99c","name":"Institute of Experimental Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Centre of the Region Haná for Biotechnological and Agricultural Research ","affiliatedPersonIDs":["68231c58fdbe8345015fd998","68231c58fdbe8345015fd999"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Usually, their effect on the germination and growth of weeds is investigated. However, less attention is paid to the effect of the allelopathic compounds from extracts on cultivated plants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of herbal extracts that have allelopathic properties on selected physiological and biochemical processes of two plants of great economic importance—white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. var. oleifera). The extracts were prepared from mountain arnica (Arnica montana L.), ribwort (Plantago lanceolata L.), hypericum (Hypericum perforatum L.), common milfoil (Achillea millefolium L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and sage (Salvia officinalis L.). The germination of white mustard and oilseed rape was most inhibited by the extracts that were prepared from sage and sunflower. Additionally, in the germinating plants, the sunflower extracts increased the membrane permeability, which indicates membrane injuries. The metabolic changes in the plants were monitored using isothermal calorimetry and FT-Raman spectroscopy. The total heat production, which provided information about the metabolic activity of the white mustard and oilseed rape, was decreased the most by the sage extract but generally all of the tested extracts disturbed the shape of the heat emission curves compared to the water control. The impact of the allelopathic compounds that are present in the herbal extracts on the metabolism of the seedlings was clearly visible on the FT-Raman spectra—in the fatty acids and flavonoids range, confirmed using a cluster analysis. In conclusion, the herbal extracts from medicinal plants that have herbicidal activity could be used as a natural herbicide for weed control, but since they may also have negative impacts on cultivated plants, preliminary tests are advisable to find the extract from the species that has the least negative effect on a protected crop."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Global climate change is causing changes in weather patterns such as the occurrence of warmer periods during late autumn or in winter. An increase in temperature after cold acclimation can decrease frost tolerance, which is particularly dangerous for winter crops. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of brassinosteroids (BRs) and BR analogues as protective agents against the negative results of deacclimation. Plants were cold-acclimated (3 weeks, 4 °C) and deacclimated (1 week, 16/9 °C d/n). Deacclimation generally reversed the cold-induced changes in the level of the putative brassinosteroid receptor protein (BRI1), the expression of BR-induced COR, and the expression of SERK1, which is involved in BR signal transduction. The deacclimation-induced decrease in frost tolerance in oilseed rape could to some extent be limited by applying steroid regulators. The deacclimation in plants could be detected using non-invasive measurements such as leaf reflectance, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and gas exchange monitoring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The validity of HR has been confirmed in animals, and more recently in some dioecious plants (Silene and Rumex). Dioecious Rumex hastatulus has two races differing in the sex chromosome system: Texas (T) and North Carolina (NC), and T × NC males showed both reduced pollen fertility and rarity—two classical symptoms of Haldane’s rule (HR). The reduced fertility of these plants has a simple mechanistic explanation, but the reason for their rarity was not elucidated. Here, we measured selected physiological parameters related to the antioxidant defense system in parental races and reciprocal hybrids of R. hastatulus. We showed that the X-autosome configurations, as well as asymmetries associated with Y chromosomes and cytoplasm, could modulate this system in hybrids. The levels and quantitative patterns of the measured parameters distinguish the T × NC hybrid from the other analyzed forms.

This study investigated the effect of heat shock treatment on host and non-host barley powdery mildew interactions using brassinosteroid (BR) mutants of barley. Brassinosteroids are plant steroid hormones, but so far little is known about their role in plant-fungal interactions. Wild type barley cultivar Bowman and its near-isogenic lines with disturbances in BR biosynthesis or signalling showed high compatibility to barley powdery mildew race A6, while cultivar Delisa and its BR-deficient mutants 522DK and 527DK were fully incompatible with this pathogen (host plant-pathogen interactions). On the other hand, Bowman and its mutants were highly resistant to wheat powdery mildew, representing non-host plant-pathogen interactions. Heat pre-treatment induced shifts in these plant-pathogen interactions towards higher susceptibility. In agreement with the more severe disease symptoms, light microscopy showed a decrease in papillae formation and hypersensitive response, characteristic of incompatible interactions, when heat pre-treatment was applied. Mutant 527DK, but not 522DK, maintained high resistance to barley powdery mildew race A6 despite heat pre-treatment. By 10 days after heat treatment and infection, a noticeable shift became apparent in the chlorophyll a fluorescence and in various leaf reflectance parameters at all genotypes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Under prolonged salinity conditions (7 or 10 days of 0.4 M NaCl treatment) we noted an enlarged pool of open PSII reaction centers and increased energy conservation efficiency, as envisaged by parameters of the fast and slow kinetics of chlorophyll a fluorescence. Measurements of oxygen evolution, using 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone as an electron acceptor, showed stimulation of the PSII activity due to salinity. In salt-acclimated plants (10 days of NaCl treatment), the improved PSII performance was associated with an increase in the size of the photochemically active PQ pool and the extent of its reduction. This was accompanied by a rise in the $NADP^{+}$/NADPH ratio.

To follow up on the progression of the disease, tumor markers are commonly used. Here, we report serum analysis based on Raman spectroscopy to provide a rapid cancer diagnosis with tumor markers and two new cell adhesion molecules measured using the ELİSA method. Raman spectra showed higher Raman intensities at 1447 cm−1 1560 cm−1, 1665 cm-1, and 1769 cm−1, which originated from CH2 proteins and lipids, amide II and amide I, and Cdouble bondO lipids vibrations. Furthermore, the correlation test showed, that only the CEA colon cancer marker correlated with the Raman spectra. Importantly, machine learning methods showed, that the accuracy of the Raman method in the detection of colon cancer was around 95 %. Obtained results suggest, that Raman shifts at 1302 cm−1 and 1306 cm−1 can be used as spectroscopy markers of colon cancer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70920c878c28a04738f153"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Their main function is to act as molecular chaperones for other proteins. It has also been proven that HSPs have a protective effect during other environmental stresses including low temperature (LT). To the best of our knowledge, the expression and role of HSPs in plants that have been exposed to LT have not yet been sufficiently reviewed. The aims of this minireview were (1) to briefly describe the origin, classification, structure, localisation and functions of HSPs, (2) to present the current knowledge about the changes in the accumulation of HSPs in plants that have been exposed to LT, (3) to discuss some of the molecular changes that occur during LT action and that lead to the accumulation of HSPs in plants and (4) to discuss the potential role of HSPs in acquiring tolerance to cold and frost in plants including economically important crop species. Some directions of research on the role of HSPs in plants growing in LT conditions are proposed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

To address the effect of culture conditions and elicitor treatments, CC established on 1 mg L−1 2,4-D + 0.5 mg L−1 BAP, or 2.5 mg L−1 NAA + 0.5 mg L−1 KIN was exposed to various spectral light treatments during four weeks and compared to those grown in dark. The composition of CC was analysed both using an FT-Raman spectrometer equipped with laser 1064 nm, and spectrophotometrically. The spectral composition of light had a higher influence on the chemical composition of CC grown on NAA + KIN than on 2,4-D + BAP medium. Spectrophotometrically, no differences in the content of protein or sugar were determined in relation to the plant growth regulators applied. However, significant differences in frequencies and intensities of vibrational bands associated with proteins (S-S disulfide stretching, tyrosine, cystine, and methionine at lower spectral ranges, and amide III stretching in the higher spectral range), and carbohydrates (C–O–C skeletal mode at lower spectral ranges, and C–O–H vibrations at higher spectral ranges) within the Raman spectra were estimated and discussed. The 1525 cm−1 and 1606 cm−1 peaks with high intensities of vibration bands were identified and assigned to carotenoids and phenolics. In all treatments applied the major Raman peaks were detected at 1606, 1629, and 1633 cm−1. PCA analysis showed that CC under blue-red light and blue-red light + UVa (2,4-D + BAP) had higher content of carotenoids and ester groups, while chlorophyll a and phenolics were found in CC grown on NAA + KIN under blue-red light + UVa and blue-red light + far-red. Compared to traditional methods of analysis, which are preceded by the sample destruction before extraction and analysis, it can be concluded that the FT-Raman spectroscopy may serve as a valuable tool for the non-destructive and non-invasive identification of major biochemical changes in basil CC without any sample preparation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The research aimed to study the relationship between wax cover attributes and the physio-biochemical drought reactions and yield of rye NILs and to uncover the differences in drought resistance levels of these lines. The greatest differences between glaucous and non-glaucous NILs were observed in the RXL10/RXL10bw pair. Of particular note were the stable grain number and the thousand grain weight of the non-glaucous line RXL10bw under drought and the accompanying reactions, such as an approximately 60% increase in MDA and a two-fold increase in wax amount, both of which were significantly higher than in the glaucous line RXL10 and in other NILs. The surprisingly high level of MDA in the RXL10bw line requires further analysis. Moreover, additional wax crystal aggregates were found under drought conditions on the abaxial leaf surface of the glaucous lines 811 and RXL10. The use of rye NILs indicated that line-specific drought resistance could be associated with wax biosynthetic pathways involved in physiological and biochemical responses important for increased drought resistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709302878c28a0473a100f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

hybridization followed by genome elimination, are based on the unique ability of plant cells to form haploid embryos without fertilization. All of these are possible because of various in vitro culture systems that enable the growth and development of tissues or single cells outside of the parental organism. The possibility of re-directing cell development from its original pathway to embryogenesis brings several benefits to many research areas, but the most important is the possibility of its implementation in breeding programs.\nThis review summarizes the achievements of Polish research groups in studies of the mechanisms of haploid/DH embryo development and demonstrates the practical applications of these systems in basic studies and plant breeding. It shows the results of studies on economically important crops including barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), triticale (×Triticosecale Wittm.), oat (Avena sativa L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris L.), and some vegetable species, including carrot (Daucus carota L.), onion (Allium cepa L.), red beet (Beta vulgaris L.), and members of the Brassicaceae."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","uid":"bmfkTgrYux51kKuOA70Q27Q","uuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","name":"Instytut Hodowli i Aklimatyzacji Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709481878c28a0473beac5","5e7093fc878c28a0473b467a","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4946","5e70943f878c28a0473b8b9e","5e7093fc878c28a0473b46db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","parentUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","rootUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709419878c28a0473b634a","5e7092e7878c28a04739f019"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

In this article, we showed what kind of cold change an extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field (ELF-MF) exposure 500 μT 50 Hz by using a Meritt Coil System causes in the samples of the brain and liver samples. To measure oxidative load, we measured malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels. To identify the chemical changes, we collected Raman spectra of cerebellum, left brain, right brain and liver tissue from the control group of animals and from the animal, which were exposed to an electromagnetic field (ELF-MF group). Obtained results showed, that lipid peroxidation was increased and the antioxidant response was decreased. In the brain samples the shift of peaks corresponding to the amide III vibrations existed after ELF-MF exposure. Structural changes were detected in CH2 vibrations originating from lipids in both hemispheres. Additionally, the number of amide III bonds was increased with ELF-MF exposure in the cerebellum and left-brain tissue. In liver tissue higher Raman intensities were visible in the tissues from the ELF-MF group. In this group electromagnetic field also caused structural changes in lipids. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed, that it is possible to distinguish ELF-MF and control groups. Consequently, hierarchical component analysis (HCA) showed that tissues from ELF-MF and control groups separately created similarity with the groups. Obtained results suggest that the electromagnetic field caused structural and quantitative chemical changes in brain and liver tissue. Additionally, present data suggest that ELF-MF plays an important role in the regulation of enzyme activity and has effects on biochemical processes, possibly improved by production of ROS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

M. crystallinum, known for its semi-halophytic nature, can transition its metabolism from C3 to CAM under salt stress conditions. The research encompasses the antioxidant system of the plants, covering both enzymatic and low molecular weight components. The findings indicate that Pip supplementation confers a beneficial effect on certain elements of the antioxidant system when the plants are subjected to stress induced by bacteria. Notably, during critical periods, particularly in the initial days post-bacterial treatment, M. crystallinum plants supplemented with Pip and exhibiting C3 metabolism display heightened total antioxidant capacity. This enhancement includes increased superoxide dismutase activity and elevated levels of glutathione and proline. However, in plants with salinity-induced CAM, where these parameters are naturally higher, the supplementation of Pip does not yield significant effects. These results validate the hypothesis that the regulatory influence of Pip on defence mechanisms against biotic stress is contingent upon the metabolic state of the plant. Furthermore, this regulatory effect is more pronounced in C3 plants of M. crystallinum than those undergoing CAM metabolism induced by salinity stress."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Such conditions may bring about different effects when compared with a single stress trigger, such as low-temperature or water excess. The effects of waterlogging are clearly related to water temperature, and the consequences of water excess might be less severe, as more oxygen is dissolved in colder water. The effect of waterlogging during cold acclimation (CA) is poorly understood; most experiments concerning water excess are performed at relatively high-temperatures. In this study, we examined the effect of 3 weeks of waterlogging (approx. 2 cm above the soil level) on CA in Festuca pratensis Huds. (Fp), a cool-season grass. Measurements were taken before CA (after prehardening, before flooding) and after 3 weeks of CA in waterlogged (treated) and non-waterlogged (control) plants. The work included: (i) freezing tolerance test (regrowth after freezing), (ii) analysis of abscisic acid (ABA) content in the leaf, (iii) leaf stomatal conductance, (iv) leaf water content, (v) carbohydrates analysis, including fructans, and (vi) transcript levels of selected genes involved in freezing tolerance, ABA signalling and fructan biosynthesis. The aim of the study was to test a hypothesis that low-temperature waterlogging in Fp enhances freezing tolerance (plant regrowth after freezing) related to increased ABA accumulation, increased C-repeat-binding transcription factor expression and/or increased carbohydrate accumulation, including fructans. Two out of four genotypes exhibited enhanced regrowth following freezing due to waterlogging relative to control. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a positive correlation between ABA levels and freezing tolerance in both treatments, with a more pronounced effect observed in the waterlogged plants. However, the phytohormone played different roles in these two treatments. In the context of low-temperature waterlogging, ABA may be involved in the dehydration tolerance response in genotypes suffering from physiological drought, as well as the induction of C-repeat-binding transcription factors (CBFs) and sucrose, which may improve freezing tolerance. The increased fructan amount and polymerisation degree due to waterlogging may provide a carbohydrate sink to maintain a high photosynthetic efficiency, but are not directly responsible for freezing tolerance changes. The study indicates that tolerance mechanisms of Fp exposed to low-temperature waterlogging involve maintaining a high photosynthetic rate, as well as oxidative and dehydration stress tolerance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

In vitro regenerated plants were exposed to different sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations (0, 43, and 86 mM), and the resulting changes in morphology, photosynthetic performance, and biochemical profiles were analyzed. Salt stress resulted in significant morphological adaptations, including reduced leaf area and closed stomata, particularly in the male plants, indicating adaptive strategies to minimize water loss and ion toxicity. Photosynthetic efficiency, especially the photochemical performance of photosystem II, decreased under elevated NaCl levels, with a marked reduction observed at 86 mM. Biochemical analyses revealed remarkable responses, including increased enzymatic antioxidant activities and the accumulation of free proline, a known compatible osmolyte, as well as branched-chain amino acids, soluble proteins, and carbohydrates. These shifts in metabolite profiles varied by sex, with male plants showing a greater increase in compounds such as proline, γ-aminobutyric acid, methionine, and the osmoprotectant sucrose, highlighting sex-specific patterns of metabolic adaptation. Females showed higher chlorophyll retention and greater resistance to oxidative damage, suggesting a range of different adaptive strategies. The study highlights the importance of identifying sex-specific stress responses in R. thyrsiflorus, which has implications for breeding programmes aiming to improve crop resilience. These results expand our understanding of plant stress biology and provide valuable insights for further research into how dioecious plants respond to environmental challenges."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The statistical differences between the length of the cooling period and anther viability for all genotypes were observed. Anthers cultured for five days at 32 °C showed a decrease in viability compared to those not subjected to heat shock. Callus induction and embryo-like structure development were observed in seven genotypes out of the twelve examined. The largest number of calluses were obtained from genotype STH 65488 × Chimene. Among the three types of media tested, the most efficient was W14-1, on which anthers produced 12 calluses and 4 embryo-like structures, while on W14-2 and C17 media, anthers produced three calluses and two or one embryo-like structure, respectively.

In vitro culture techniques seek to expedite the breeding process and enhance selection efficiency. Maximum yields are achieved from hybrid plants produced by crossing pure (homozygous) lines with the desired traits. Homozygous lines can be produced through conventional breeding methods, which are time-consuming and costly. Alternatively, the production of homozygous lines can be accelerated by producing doubled haploid (DH) plants derived from (haploid) male gametophytes or their microspores (androgenesis). This method condenses the various stages required for producing homozygous lines in a single generation, resulting in significant time and cost savings. These and other advantages render androgenic DHs the preferred choice in numerous important crops where any of the various in vitro experimental techniques (anthers culture or isolated microspores culture) are well-established. However, in the case of oat (Avena sativa L.), an efficient plant regeneration method remains not very effective compared to the most common cereals, possibly due to the known recalcitrance of this cereal to in vitro culture. This review presents the methods through anther and microspore cultures utilized in the production of oat DHs revealing the crucial factors influencing the efficiency of this method in oat (Avena sativa L.)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

ER bodies accumulate β-glucosidases, which hydrolyze specialized thioglucosides known as glucosinolates to generate bioactive substances. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leaf ER (LER) bodies are formed in large pavement cells, which are found in the petioles, margins and blades of rosette leaves. However, the regulatory mechanisms involved in establishing large pavement cells are unknown. Here, we show that the ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA MERISTEM L1 LAYER (ATML1) transcription factor regulates the formation of LER bodies in large pavement cells of rosette leaves. Overexpression of ATML1 enhanced the expression of LER body–related genes and the number of LER body–containing large pavement cells, whereas its knock-out resulted in opposite effects. ATML1 enhances endoreduplication and cell size through LOSS OF GIANT CELLS FROM ORGANS (LGO). Although the overexpression and knock-out of LGO affected the appearance of large pavement cells in Arabidopsis, the effect on LER body–related gene expression and LER body formation was weak.

Capsicum is an economically important crop valued for its piquancy and nutritional content, but is quite sensitive to drought. This study investigated the effect of two levels of foliar application of melatonin (0 and 50 μM) on growth parameters, pigment accumulation, and osmolyte and inorganic ion content of three Capsicum species (C. frutesence, C. chinense, and C. annum) under well-watered as well as mild and severe drought conditions. Drought exerted negative effects on growth and development of the Capsicum spp., as indicated by changes in height, decreased leaf area, biomass, and photosynthetic pigment concentrations. Drought strongly decreased chlorophyll a, b, and carotenoid content, but increased root biomass, total soluble sugar, and proline concentrations of Capsicum compared to well-watered plants. In C. frutesence, severe drought significantly enhanced Na+ and SO42−, while mild drought increased Ca2+ and SO42−. Mild and severe drought increased Na+, decreased K+ and Ca2+, and had no significant effects on Cl− and SO42− in C. chinense and C. annum. Foliar application of melatonin had positive but varying effects on Capsicum, as indicated by differences in growth, photosynthetic pigments, and ion accumulation. These findings pointed to beneficial effects of foliar application of melatonin in facilitating and improving drought tolerance of Capsicum via increased osmolyte accumulation, pigments, and total concentration of inorganic ions under drought conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The objective of the present study was to ascertain whether seed treatment with gamma radiation of 30 or 40 Gy would enhance yield and the content of amino acids. Plants obtained from irradiated seeds were named M0 generation. Subsequently, the mutants were subjected to cross-pollination under isolation conditions within groups, contingent upon the radiation dose, to yield the M1, M2, and M3 generations. To estimate the extent of mutation changes, genotyping by sequencing analysis was performed on selected M0 plants. Each year, the selection of plants was based on their seed yield. The amino acid composition in the seeds of the M2 and M3 generations was determined. The number of unique heterozygote variants identified for the 40 Gy plants was found to be less than that observed in remaining plants. The M0 and M1 plants of 40 Gy group exhibited an augmented seed yield; however, this characteristic did not reoccur in the M2 generation. In the M2, the control seeds exhibited the highest amino acid content compared to the mutants. In the M3 generation, only one accession of the 40 Gy group demonstrated higher amino acid content than the other plants. The findings suggest that irradiating seeds with 40 Gy can enhance seed yield and amino acid content."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

One of these solutions could be silicon supplementation. The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis that silicon changes aquaporin expression and antioxidant system activity in a direction which may alleviate the effects of drought stress in oilseed rape. The accumulation of BnPIP1, BnPIP2-1-7 and BnTIP1;1 aquaporins and the expression of their genes, the level of catalase, superoxide dismutase activities and hydrogen peroxide content as well as total non-enzymatic antioxidant activity were analyzed in leaf tissue from control and silicon-treated oilseed rape plants growing under well-watered and drought conditions. Silicon was applied in two forms – pure silicon and a silicon complex. It was shown that under drought conditions, both pure silicon and the silicon complex (with Fe) significantly increased the accumulation of aquaporins and improved the activity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic components of the antioxidant system, while under well-watered conditions, these effects were observed only in the case of the silicon complex. The presented study proves that silicon supplementation in oilseed rape improves the regulation of water management and contributes to the protection against oxidative stress caused by drought."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Oat (Avena sativa L.) is sensitive to water\r\ndeficiency during growth. Plant metallothioneins (pMTs) show tremendous promise in\r\nenhancing general stress tolerance in plants. This study aimed to verify whether pMTs\r\nand elements of the antioxidant defence system protect oat against osmotic stress.\r\nCoding and genomic regions of A. sativa L. MTs belonging to three different types\r\nwere cloned. To evaluate the role of MTs in osmotic stress, the expression of genes\r\nencoding AsMT1-3\r\nwas checked by qRT-PCR\r\nin the roots and shoots of oat plants\r\ngrowing in a hydroponic culture in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000)\r\nand mannitol. The expression of AsMT1-3\r\nchanged in response to osmotic stress; however,\r\nthe changes depended on the type of MT and the treatment. The amount of\r\nAsMT3 transcript was about five-fold\r\nand nine-fold\r\nhigher in shoots and roots, respectively,\r\nin the presence of mannitol. To further analyse the response of oat to osmotic\r\nstress, the level of phenolic compounds, soluble sugars, abscisic acid, and the activity\r\nof antioxidant enzymes were tested using spectrophotometric and chromatographic\r\nmethods. During osmotic stress, the content of phenols, soluble sugars, abscisic acid,\r\nand the activity of catalase and peroxidase in shoots increased. In roots treated with\r\nPEG 6000, the amount of phenolic compounds was higher than that in roots treated\r\nwith mannitol. The activity of superoxide dismutase was about 5-fold\r\nhigher in roots\r\nthan in shoots. MTs are involved in plant response to osmotic stress.

The OMA II line was characterized by larger size of single cells in the outer bundle sheath and greater number of seeds per plant among tested lines."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ec878c28a04739f417"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The aim of this study was to determine differences in physiological and biochemical responses to drought stress in two wheat cultivars—Chinese Spring (CS) and SQ1 (which are parents of a mapping population of doubled haploid lines)—and to relate these responses to final yield and agronomic traits. Drought stress was induced by withholding water for 14 days, after which plants were re-watered and maintained until harvest. Instantaneous gas exchange parameters were evaluated on the 3rd, 5th, 10th, and 14th days of seedling growth under drought. After 14 days, water content and levels of chlorophyll a+b, carotenoids, malondialdehyde, soluble carbohydrates, phenolics, salicylic acid, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyamines were measured. At final maturity, yield components (grain number and weight), biomass, straw weight, and harvest index were evaluated. Physiological and biochemical parameters of CS responded more than those of SQ1 to the 14-day drought, reflected in a greater reduction in final biomass and yield in CS. Marked biochemical differences between responses of CS and SQ1 to the drought were found for soluble carbohydrates and polyamines. These would be good candidates for testing in the mapping population for the coincidence of the genetic control of these traits and final biomass and yield."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

New sources of this alkaloid are still being explored. In this study, a novel strain PLV of endophytic bacterium Paenibacillus lautus was isolated from in vitro L. aestivum plants. We report the whole genome sequence of that strain and its capacity to produce alkaloids and growth regulators. The effect of elicitation with autoclaved bacteria on the production of alkaloids was examined. Ten alkaloids were identified in bacteria extracts: galanthamine, lycorine, ismine, lycoramine, haemanthamine, tazettine, galanthine, homolycorine, 1,2-dihydrochlidanthine, and hippeastrine. The mean contents of galanthamine and lycorine were 37.51 µg/g of dry weight (DW) and 129.93 µg/g of DW, respectively. Moreover, isolated P. lautus strain synthesized: indole-3-acetic acid, t-zeatin, c-zeatin, kinetin, gibberellin A1, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid. In vitro elicitation of cultures with P. lautus increased dry biomass, stimulated galanthamine and lycorine production, contributed to 8,9-desmethylenebis (oxy)-7,9 dimethoxy-crinan biosynthesis, change pigments content, and antioxidant enzymes activities.

The phytochemical analysis included the isolation and quantification of 17 compounds from dibenzocyclooctadiene, aryltetralin lignans, and neolignans using centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC), HPLC-DAD, and UHPLC-MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry with triple quadrupole mass filter methods. Higher contents of compounds were found in microshoots extracts (max. 543.99 mg/100 g DW). The major compound was schisantherin B both in the extracts from microshoots and the leaves (390.16 and 361.24 mg/100 g DW, respectively). The results of the anti-inflammatory activity in terms of the inhibition of COX-1, COX-2, sPLA2, and LOX-15 enzymes indicated that PlantForm microshoot extracts showed strong activity against COX-1 and COX-2 (for 177 mg/mL the inhibition percentage was 76% and 66%, respectively). The antioxidant potential assessed using FRAP, CUPRAC, and DPPH assays showed that extracts from microshoot cultures had 5.6, 3.8, and 3.3 times higher power compared to extracts from the leaves of the parent plant, respectively. The total polyphenol content (TPC) was 4.1 times higher in extracts from the in vitro culture compared to the leaves. The antiproliferative activity against T-cell lymphoblast line Jurkat, breast adenocarcinoma cultures (MCF-7), colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29), and cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa), showed that both extracts have considerable effects on the tested cell lines. The antimicrobial activity tested against strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi showed the highest activity towards H. pylori (MIC and MBC 0.625 mg/mL)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60374ab29543c7410626fc8a","5e7092c8878c28a04739c931","5e7092c8878c28a04739c7e3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3871","5e70932c878c28a0473a43d1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

(basil) are among the most cultivated plants due to their large content of secondary metabolites, in particular essential oils and phenolic compounds. Still, different conditions of basil cultivation cause significant variations of quantitative and qualitative characteristics of material originating from basil plants. The application of plant tissue culture to produce biologically active compounds is a well-established alternative to the cultivation of whole plants. It provides the opportunity to obtain biotechnologically valuable plant characteristics, including a high content of secondary metabolites such as phenolic acids and flavonoids for the shortest period. The present paper summarizes the most cultivated basil genotypes worldwide and data about the mass propagation, somatic embryogenesis, basil cell and organ cultures, together with the main properties regarding the enhanced synthesis of secondary metabolites under tissue culture conditions. For most of the studies, increased synthesis of biologically active compounds (in particular phenolic acids, isoprenoids, and flavonoids) can be seen. However, for many of them, information regarding the used genotype or origin of plant material is missing.

In the last two decades, significant climatic changes have been observed, generating unfavorable and harmful impacts on plant development. Drought stress can be considered one of the most dangerous environmental factors affecting the life cycle of plants, reducing biomass production and, finally, the yield. Plants can respond to water deficit in a wide range, which depends on the species, genetic variability within the species, the plant’s ontogenesis stage, the intensity of the stress, and other potential stress factors. In plants, it is possible to observe hybrids between different taxa that certain traits adopted to tolerate stress conditions better than the parent plants. Oat × maize addition (OMA) plants are good examples of hybrids generated via wide crossing. They can exhibit morphological, physiological, and biochemical variations implemented by the occurrence of extra chromosomes of maize, as well as the interaction of maize and oat chromatin. The initial goal of the study was to identify OMA lines among plants produced by wide crossing with maize. The main goal was to investigate differences in OMA lines according to the Excised Leaf Water Loss (ELWL) test and to identify specific biochemical changes and agronomic traits under optimal water conditions and soil drought. Additionally, detection of any potential alterations that are stable in F2 and F3 generations. The aforementioned outcomes were the basis for the selection of OMA lines that tolerate growth in an environment with limited water availability. The molecular analysis indicated 12.5% OMA lines among all tested descendants of wide oat-maize crossing. The OMA lines significantly differ according to ELWL test results, which implies some anatomical and physiological adaptation to water loss from tissues. On the first day of drought, plants possessed 34% more soluble sugars compared to control plants. On the fourteen day of drought, the amount of soluble sugars was reduced by 41.2%. A significant increase of phenolic compounds was observed in the fourteen day of drought, an average of 6%, even up to 57% in line 9. Soil drought substantially reduced stem biomass, grains number, and mass per plant. Lower water loss revealed by results of the ELWL test correlated with the high yield of OMA lines. Phenolic compound content might be used as a biochemical indicator of plant drought tolerance since there was a significant correlation with the high yield of plants subjected to soil drought."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709344878c28a0473a6213"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

It is a natural interspecific hybrid with 57 chromosomes (2n = 3x = 57). Due to its sterility, M. × giganteus has limited genetic variability, making traditional breeding methods ineffective for its improvement. Consequently, alternative approaches are being explored to enhance its cultivation and utility. The study aimed to investigate the potential for M. × giganteus plant regeneration through ovary and flower bud cultures. Indirect in vitro regeneration of M. × giganteus plants was successfully achieved using flower bud cultures. Embryogenic-like callus was derived from explants originating from inflorescences that had undergone a four-day pretreating at 10 °C. The most effective medium for callus induction was a modified MS medium supplemented with 5 mg·dm−3 dicamba, 0.2 mg dm−3 6-benzylaminopurine, 30 g dm−3 sucrose, and solidified with 8 g dm−3 agar or agarose. The optimal conditions for callus induction were achieved by culturing in the dark. The regenerated plants exhibited the characteristic chromosome number of the species, confirming that the regenerants did not develop from embryo sac cells. In contrast, ovary culture failed to produce callus or regenerated plants, highlighting its ineffectiveness for M. × giganteus regeneration. These findings underscore the potential of flower bud culture as a successful in vitro regeneration method while demonstrating the limitations of ovary culture for this species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The composition of the fermented pollen was analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES), Raman spectroscopy, and SDS-PAGE and compared to natural bee bread and the original pollen. In vitro biological activity was assessed as antioxidant activity using a yeast model (BY4741 and sod1∆ strains). Fermentation of pollen occurred spontaneously and after inoculation, as demonstrated by lower pH and higher lactic acid content. Raman spectroscopy and ICP-OES confirmed changes in composition compared to the initial pollen. Compared to bee bread, the fermented pollen showed a higher content of polyphenols and comparable antioxidant activity; moreover, it accelerated yeast growth rate. In addition, a protective effect was observed for Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (sod1∆ yeast mutant exposed to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress).

Secondary metabolites produced by alien plants may be allelopathic; if they enter the soil, they may be transported by agricultural activities, negatively affecting crop yield and biodiversity. It is unknown whether substances from different alien species in combination have a greater impact on crops and wild plants than if they are from only one of the alien species. In this study, we used a set of common garden experiments to test the hypothesis that mixed extracts from two common invasive species have synergistic effects on crops and weeds (defined as all non-crop plants) in European agricultural fields compared to single-species extracts. We found that both the combined and individual extracts had detrimental effects on the seed germination, seedling growth, biomass, and photosynthetic performance of both crops and weeds. We found that the negative effect of mixed extracts was not additive and that crop plants were more strongly affected by invasive species extracts than the weeds. Our results are important for managing invasive species in unique ecosystems on agricultural land and preventing economic losses in yield production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","uid":"bqvFVl6-FYxc-KjUUrbTwDw","uuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","name":"Instytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709316878c28a0473a2ad0","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fa1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","parentUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","rootUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","uid":"bi0054EFyZHNUwKK3x5HmqA","uuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","name":"Instytut Systematyki i Ewolucji Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f9878c28a0473b445a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","parentUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","rootUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e087","uid":"bb1eAT2BMBTGkk695wKT43A","uuid":"7c53f923-c0ac-4e2d-82db-2c93b9fd6578","name":"Wydział Rolniczo-Ekonomiczny","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092de878c28a04739e6ec","5e7092de878c28a04739e6e9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

It was demonstrated for the first time that BnTIP1 accumulation in oilseed rape roots is reduced under drought compared to wellwatered plants, and that this effect is intensified in plants supplemented with silicon. In addition, it was shown that silicon supplementation of oilseed rape increases catalase activity in the roots, which correlates with their high metabolic activity under drought and ultimately stimulates their growth. It was shown that silicon improves water balance in oilseed rape plants subjected to drought stress, and that an important role in these processes is played by tonoplast aquaporins. In addition, it was demonstrated that silicon reduces oxidative stress in roots under drought conditions by increasing the activity of catalase."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The effects of these stresses tested separately are relatively well understood, but still little is known about their simultaneous effects on plants. Our research involved four single hybrids of maize differing in their degree of susceptibility to soil compaction and drought. We investigated the effects of low and high soil compaction under optimal irrigation (LI, HI) and under three-week long soil drought (LD, HD), on the gas exchange (Pn, E, gS, Ci) and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (F0, Fm, Fv, Fv/Fm), total leaf area (LA), leaf greening (SPAD), leaf water deficit (WD), leaf water potential (ψ) and membrane injury (MI). The plants experiencing high soil compaction (HI) showed a decrease in all parameters of gas exchange (Pn, E, gS, Ci), leaf area (LA), leaf greening (SPAD) and the maximal quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) in comparison with plants growing in non-compacted soil (LI). An increase was observed in the other fluorescence parameters, i.e., F0, Fm and Fv and leaf WD, ψ and MI in HI vs. LI variants. In the plants exposed to drought (LD, HD), the changes in the measured traits were greater, especially for the sensitive hybrids P-8400 and NS-3023, than for the plants from LI treatment. A significant interaction between the degree of stress susceptibility and relative trait change was observed for practically all of the measured features. Moreover, in the short recovery period after the end of drought, the measured traits in LD and HD plants did not fully return to the control level, especially in the case of the sensitive hybrids (P-8400 NS-3023). The physiological reaction of maize hybrids to soil compaction and/or soil drought indicated the genetically determined variability of tolerance to those stresses. Significant correlation between RTC and stress susceptibility indexes (S-SI) provided suitable criteria for the hybrid selection. Also, our results showed the plasticity and capability of maize hybrids to respond to environmental conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal that poses a severe threat to humans’ and animals’ health and lives. Plants can easily absorb Cd from the soil, and plant-based food is the main means of exposure to this hazardous element for humans and animals. Phytoremediation is a promising plant-based approach to removing heavy metals from the soil, and plant growth-promoting micro-organisms such as the fungi Trichoderma can enhance the ability of plants to accumulate metals. Inoculation of Avena sativa L. (oat) with Trichoderma viride enhances germination and seedling growth in the presence of Cd and, in this study, the growth of 6-month-old oat plants in Cd-contaminated soil was not increased by inoculation with T. viride, but a 1.7-fold increase in yield was observed. The content of Cd in oat shoots depended on the Cd content in the soil. Still, it was unaffected by the inoculation with T. viride. A. sativa metallothioneins (AsMTs) participate in plant–fungi interaction, however, their role in this study depended on MT type and Cd concentration. The inoculation of A. sativa with T. viride could be a promising approach to obtaining a high yield in Cd-contaminated soil without increasing the Cd content in the plant."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67642bd3fdbe837ab144e7d3","5e7092c0878c28a04739bfd8","5f77e7c8085dcb410a25e899","5e7093e7878c28a0473b303c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The low percentage of germinating seeds largely limits its generative reproduction. The germination tests confirmed deep dormancy of the Iris aphylla seeds. The dormancy was disrupted by isolation of embryos from seeds, which were further cultivated in vitro. The germination of isolated embryos proved the localization of endogenous inhibitors of germinating seeds of I. aphylla in the endosperm. The comparison of phytohormonal profiles of seeds, endosperm and embryos of I. aphylla and Iris sibirica, i.e. a species with a high percentage of germinating seed, revealed that the deep dormancy of I. aphylla seeds was associated with the balance between abscisic acid and gibberellins (ABA/GA), a significant predominance of ABA and a massive accumulation of salicylic acid.

Among a large group of species, those from the Brassicaceae family, including kale, are very popularly grown as microgreens. Typically, microgreens are grown under controlled conditions under light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the effect of light on the quality of grown microgreens varies. The present study aimed to determine the effect of artificial white light with varying proportions of red (R) and blue (B) light on the morphological and photosynthetic parameters of kale microgreens with green and red leaves. The R:B ratios were for white light (W) 0.63, for red-enhanced white light (W + R) 0.75, and for white and blue light (W + B) 0.38 at 230 µmol m−2 s−1 PPFD. The addition of both blue and red light had a positive effect on the content of active compounds in the plants, including flavonoids and carotenoids. Red light had a stronger effect on the seedling area and the dry mass and relative chlorophyll content of red-leaved kale microgreens. Blue light, in turn, had a stronger effect on green kale, including dry mass. The W + B light combination negatively affected the chlorophyll content of both cultivars although the leaves were significantly thicker compared to cultivation under W + R light. In general, the cultivar with red leaves had less sensitivity to the photosynthetic apparatus to the spectrum used. The changes in PSII were much smaller in red kale compared to green kale. Too much red light caused a deterioration in the PSII vitality index in green kale. Red and green kale require an individual spectrum with different proportions of blue and red light at different growth stages to achieve plants with a large leaf area and high nutritional value."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a0473953d2","5e709335878c28a0473a4ea7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

While PM is one of the most important wheat leaf diseases globally, rye is highly tolerant to PM. It has been reported that in barley infected with PM, polyamine oxidase (PAO) activity related to the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has increased, which may promote defense against biotrophic or hemibiotrophic pathogens. The current study aimed to assess the relationship between the segregation of the polymorphic marker for rye PAO (ScPAO) and the level of PM infection in plants. The genetic mapping in two interline populations shows that ScPAO is located on chromosome 7R. Further analysis comparing ScPAO location to mapped wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) PAO duplicates suggests the ScPAO homology with TaPAO6 or TaPAO7. A possible association of ScPAO from 7R with PM resistance is demonstrated in the recombinant inbred lines (RIL)-L population phenotyped for PM infection. Finally, three novel QTLs for PM resistance on the 7R chromosome of rye are detected."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709302878c28a0473a100f","5e7092ab878c28a04739a4ff"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Traditional plant breeding is a time-consuming process that, depending on the crop, might take up to 25 years before an improved cultivar is available to farmers. This is a problematic technique since both beneficial qualities (such as pest resistance) and negative ones (such as decreased yield) can be passed down from generation to generation. In vitro cultures provide various advantages over traditional methods, including the capacity to add desirable characteristics and speed up the development of new cultivars. When it comes to oat (Avena sativa L.), the efficient method of plant regeneration is still missing compared to the most common cereals, possibly because this cereal is known to be recalcitrant to in vitro culture. In this review, an effort has been made to provide a succinct overview of the various in vitro techniques utilized or potentially involved in the breeding of oat. The present work aims to summarize the crucial methods of A. sativa L. cultivation under tissue culture conditions with a focus on the progress that has been made in biotechnological techniques that are used in the breeding of this species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Warm breaks during/after cold acclimation disturb the natural process of acclimation, thereby decreasing frost tolerance and can even result in a resumption of growth. This phenomenon is called deacclimation. In the last few years, studies that are devoted to deacclimation have become more important (due to climate changes) and necessary to be able to understand the mechanisms that occur during this phenomenon. In the acclimation of plants to low temperatures, the importance of plant membranes is indisputable; that is why the main aim of our studies was to answer the question of whether (and to what extent) deacclimation alters the physicochemical properties of the plant membranes. The studies were focused on chloroplast membranes from non-acclimated, cold-acclimated and deacclimated cultivars of winter oilseed rape. The analysis of the membranes (formed from chloroplast lipid fractions) using the Langmuir technique revealed that cold acclimation increased membrane fluidity (expressed as the Alim values), while deacclimation generally decreased the values that were induced by cold.

However, the process depends on complex interactions between many genetic, physiological and environmental variables, and in many cases, e.g., winter wheat, does not operate with the efficiency required for commercial use. Stress associated with low-temperature treatment, isolation and transfer to in vitro culture has been shown to disturb redox homeostasis and generate relatively high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), affecting microspore vitality. The aim of this study was to investigate whether controlled plant growth, specific tiller pre-treatment and culture conditions could improve the potential of microspores to cope with stress and effectively induce ME. To understand the mechanism of the stress response, hydrogen peroxide levels, total activity and the content of the most important low-molecular-weight antioxidants (glutathione and ascorbate), as well as the content of selected macro- (Mg, Ca, NA, K) and micronutrients (Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mo) were determined. These analyses, combined with the cytological characteristics of the microspore suspensions, allowed us to demonstrate that an increased microspore vitality and stronger response to ME induction were associated with higher stress resistance based on more efficient ROS scavenging and nutrient management. It was shown that a modified procedure, combining a low temperature with mannitol and sodium selenate tiller pre-treatment, reduced oxidative stress and improved the effectiveness of ME in winter wheat lines."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

To provide comprehensive spatiotemporal information about biological processes in developing seeds of cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare), we performed a transcriptomic study of the embryo, endosperm, and seed maternal tissues collected from grains 4–32 days after pollination. Weighted gene co-expression network and motif enrichment analyses identified specific groups of genes and transcription factors (TFs) potentially regulating barley seed tissue development. We defined a set of tissue-specific marker genes and families of TFs for functional studies of the pathways controlling barley grain development. Assessing selected groups of chromatin regulators revealed that epigenetic processes are highly dynamic and likely play a major role during barley endosperm development.

After stress pretreatment the anthers were cultured in the presence of 10 mg L−1 GA (Gm) or on control medium (Cm) and compared with respect to activity of selected antioxidant and respiratory enzymes and endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content. The anthers from Cm and Gm differed in the strategy against H2O2 overproduction, in that the total peroxidase (POX) activity and the number of POX isoforms were significantly higher in Gm- than in Cm-cultured material. High POX activity on Gm paralleled with H2O2 decrease, suggesting the utilization of this chemical for the POX-mediated cell wall formation and reconstruction during growth of multicellular structures. The total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity on Cm and Gm were at similar level for most of the culture period but the activity of MnSOD was dozen times higher on Gm and this coincided with high activity of fumarase and cytochrome c oxidase. It indicates close interplay between efficient antioxidative protection and high metabolic rate accompanying efficient androgenesis. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of POX and other antioxidative and defense enzymes in protein fraction of GA used in the experiments, however as revealed by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay, the Gm and Cm displayed similar total antioxidant capacity. Thus, the effect of GA on androgenic cultures of barley can be linked to its influence on the activity of anther antioxidant system, rather than its native antioxidative properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","uid":"bmfkTgrYux51kKuOA70Q27Q","uuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","name":"Instytut Hodowli i Aklimatyzacji Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b467a","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4946"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","parentUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","rootUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebee621752340254fc44d1b","5e709316878c28a0473a29b0","5e709315878c28a0473a2861"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the endophytic bacterium Pantoea vagans SRS89 strain on carrot germination and growth under saline conditions. The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions on agar gel and in pots with a soil mixture. First, we determined the NaCl doses that cause stress to carrot seeds. Among the tested NaCl concentrations (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mM), we selected 150 and 100 mM for further study. They were critical for germination and seedling growth, respectively. In the next step, carrot seeds were inoculated with the bacterium for 1 and 3 h and germinated under selected NaCl concentrations. In a soil mixture watered with a 150 mM NaCl inoculation, depending on the duration, increased germination by 30 % and 18 %, compared to the control. Under these conditions, the morphological parameters of the plants, as well as the content of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll b and carotenoids) and soluble sugars, were also significantly higher. The positive effect of the P. vagans SRS89 strain on carrot seed germination and seedling growth in laboratory conditions suggests the need for further studies to confirm this effect in field conditions, assuming the practical application of the tested strain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

In this work, we aimed to provide new information on changes occurring in tomato interacting with the beneficial fungus Beauveria bassiana. The tomato leaf proteome revealed perturbed molecular pathways during the establishment of the plant–fungus relationship. In the early stages of colonization (5–7 d), proteins related to defense responses to the fungus were down-regulated and proteins related to calcium transport were up-regulated. At later time points (12–19 d after colonization), up-regulation of molecular pathways linked to protein/amino acid turnover and to biosynthesis of energy compounds suggests beneficial interaction enhancing plant growth and development. At the later stage, the profile of leaf hormones and related compounds was also investigated, highlighting up-regulation of those related to plant growth and defense.

Anatomical sections of the embryos were compared with the profile of phytohormones, amino acids, phenolic acids, polyamines, and sugars determined by HPLC. We noticed that the development rate of haploid oat embryos depends on the genotype, as 21-day-old ‘Krezus’ embryos were characterized by a more advanced anatomical structure compared to ‘Akt’ embryos. We have shown that small ‘Krezus’ embryos accumulate significant amounts of active phytohormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, as well as amino acids: tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine; phenolic acids: cinnamic, ferulic, sinapinic, chlorogenic, and polyamines: spermidine and spermine.

Generally, a number of plant species are capable of acquiring tolerance to frost after exposure to cold (in the cold-acclimation/cold-hardening process). In the last few decades, there have been more and more frequent periods of higher temperatures—warm periods that, e.g., break down the process of cold acclimation. This generates deacclimation, which could stimulate growth and lower frost tolerance in plants. Generally, deacclimation causes the reversal of changes induced by cold acclimation (i.e., in concentration of sugars, accumulation of protective proteins, or hormonal homeostasis). Unlike cold acclimation, the phenomenon of deacclimation has been less studied. The aim of this article was (1) to briefly describe the problem of deacclimation, with more attention being paid to its significance for economically important winter crop species, (2) to review and characterize the physiological-biochemical changes that are induced in plants by deacclimation, and (3) to discuss the possibilities of detecting deacclimation earlier in order to counteract its effects on crops."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

We also evaluated expression of such nodulation genes as NIC1, NOD21, and NORKb. The following inoculants were used: Nitragina IUNG, Nitragina Biofood, Nitroflora Mycoflor, Rhizobium Bio-Gen, and HiStick® Soy. The study was carried out on plants grown in pots in an open foil tunnel or glasshouse conditions. Experimental seeds were inoculated before sowing, while the control ones were not. Physiological and biochemical analyses involved the leaves, and gene expression was investigated in the roots. The bacterial inoculants significantly affected individual parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence. The highest photochemical efficiency was induced by Nitroflora Mycoflor, which also activated nitrate reductase to the greatest extent. Nitragina IUNG most strongly stimulated accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, facilitated formation of the greatest number of nodules, and improved seed yield per plant in comparison with the control and other inoculants. Of the studied nodulation genes, NIC1 showed the strongest expression following HiStick®Soy treatment. Nitragina Biofood and Nitragina IUNG most significantly reduced the expression of all studied genes. Expression of NOD21 and NORKb exposed to other inoculants was the same as in the control plants. High content of hydrogen peroxide can be considered a marker of the inoculant ability to increase nodulation and yield of soybean.

Oat is one of the cereals with particular health benefits, but it unfortunately still remains recalcitrant to haploidization. Our previous studies have clearly demonstrated that post-pollination with hormone treatment is a key step in haploid production through wide hybridization and indicated it as the most effective method for this species. Therefore, we subsequently addressed the problem of the influence of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) concentration on consecutive stages of DH production.\nMethods\nTwenty-nine genotypes were tested, 9,465 florets were pollinated with maize pollen 2 days after emasculation and then treated with 2,4-D at 50 mg/L and 100 mg/L.\nResults\nThe applied treatments did not reveal any differences in the number of obtained haploid embryos. However, almost twice as many haploid plants formed on MS medium after applying a higher auxin concentration and 20% more successfully acclimatized. Moreover, 100 mg/L 2,4-D treatment resulted in twice as many DH lines that produced almost three times more seeds compared to 50 mg/L treatment. Nevertheless, the results have confirmed the existence of strong genotypic variation, which may significantly limit the development of an effective and economically feasible method that could be incorporated into breeding programs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

An interesting feature of many of them is the presence of psbA and psbD, genes that encode D1 and D2 proteins, respectively. The D1 and D2 are core proteins of the photosystem II (PSII) in cyanobacteria, algae and plants and influence the proper function of oxygenic photosynthesis (OP) in all oxyphototrophs on Earth. The frequent occurrence of psbA and psbD in cyanophages raises the question whether these genes coevolved with hosts during the early stages of cyanophage and cyanobacterial evolution, or whether they are direct descendants of genes adopted from the genomes of cyanobacterial hosts. The phylogeny of D1/D2 proteins encoded in the genomes of selected cyanophages and oxyphototrophs was reconstructed. In addition, common ancestral sequences of D1 and D2 proteins were predicted for cyanophages and oxyphototrophs. Based on this, the reconstruction of the 3D structures of D1 and D2 proteins was performed. In addition, the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous (dN/dS) nucleotide substitutions in the coding sequences (CDSs) of psbA and psbD was determined. The results of the predicted spatial structures of the D1 and D2 proteins and purifying selection for the CDSs of psbA and psbD suggest that they belong to the ancient proteins, which may have formed the primordial PSII.

Non-uniform use of synonymous codons during translation, known as codon usage bias (CUB), depends on the balance between mutations bias and natural selection. We estimated different CUB indices, i.e. the effective number of codons (ENC), G + C content in the 3rd codon positions (GC3), and codon adaptation index for CDSs of intrinsic proteins of photosystem II (PSII), such as psbA (D1), psbD (D2), psbB (CP47), psbC (CP43), and CDSs of the extrinsic protein psbO (PsbO). These genes occur in all organisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis (OP) on Earth: cyanobacteria, algae and plants. Comparatively, a similar analysis of codon bias for CDSs of L and M subunits that constitute the core proteins of the type II reaction centre (RCII) in anoxygenic bacteria was performed. Analysis of CUB indices and determination of the number of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) in all analysed CDSs indicated that the crucial PSII and RCII proteins were under strong purifying (negative) selection in course of evolution. Purifying selection was also estimated for CDSs of atpA, the α subunit of ATP synthase, an enzyme that was most likely already present in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).

Due to sexual dimorphism and the content of bioactive constituents used in pharmacology, this species is an interesting object of study. A complex analysis of selected physiological and biochemical aspects of the sex-related response to heat stress in vitro and in vivo was carried out. The experiment included in vitro regenerated plants and plants obtained from seeds. Regenerants were obtained from hypocotyls on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2.27 μM thidiazuron (TDZ). The sex of the plants was determined by molecular analysis based on genetic sex markers. Analysis of the main photosynthetic parameters indicated that in vitro regenerated plants showed a decrease in photosystem II (PSII) activity when directly exposed to a stressor. However, in contrast to the seed-derived plants, they adapted efficiently to the recovery conditions within 1 week after the stress was terminated. Furthermore, in vitro regenerated male and female plants acclimatised well to field conditions and showed greater stress tolerance based on better efficiency of the photosynthetic apparatus and the highest chlorophyll a/b ratio. In case of plants derived from seeds, male plants were less sensitive to heat stress and showed greater stability of PSII at high temperatures compared to female plants. The results showed that the response to high-temperature stress depends on the sex and the origin of the plants, i. e. in vitro regenerated plants versus plants obtained from seeds. Even short-term heat stress resulted in differences in photosynthetic efficiency. Biochemical analysis of antioxidant activity in response to heat stress, carried out for the first time in Rumex thyrsiflorus, has allowed the identification of the following forms of superoxide dismutase (SOD): manganese (MnSOD), iron (FeSOD) and two copper-zinc isoforms (Cu/ZnSOD I and Cu/ZnSOD II)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709316878c28a0473a29a3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

It is characterized by a strong self-incompatibility resulting from heterostyly, i.e. the occurrence of two types of flowers: Pin and Thrum, differing in the length of pistils and stamens. Fertilization occurs only as a result of cross-pollination between these morphs. Suspicions exist that the disturbed ratio between plants producing Pin and Thrum flowers (with the latter type generating more seeds) causes low seed yield. The aim of the study was to analyze: (1) the ratio between plants with Pin and Thrum morphs, (2) flower and seed production, as well as abortion of flowers, (3) the composition of nectar collected at an early flowering stage and during full flowering. The study was performed under semi-controlled and field conditions on six Polish accessions. The results indicated that under semi-controlled conditions the Pin-to-Thrum ratio was indeed disproportionate; such a phenomenon is called anisoplethy. In the field, however, the Pin-to-Thrum ratio was well-balanced (isoplethy). The plants with both morphs aborted a similar percentage of flowers and produced a comparable number of empty seeds. The number of flowers, their abortion, and ripe seed production were independent of flower type, however, they were genotypically controlled. A strong correlation between the number of flowers produced by a plant, flower abortion and the number of empty seeds was found. The percentage of aborted flowers correlated positively with the weight of ripe seeds. Nectar composition was similar for all buckwheat genotypes, but we found some differences in the amount of individual sugars depending on the blooming stage. In the majority of accessions, the nectar produced at the early blooming stage was characterized by a greater mass and volume, and contained more individual sugars than at the full-flowering stage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709318878c28a0473a2c0f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Buckwheat does not contain gluten and is characterized by an excellent composition of amino acids. This species is also a melliferous plant. Despite many advantages, the area of buckwheat cultivation is decreasing due to unstable yields. One of the reasons for low seed yield is its sensitivity to drought, high temperatures, and assimilate deficiencies. These factors have a significant impact on the nectar composition, which is important for visiting pollinators and thus for pollination. High temperature during flowering increases the degeneration of embryo sacs and embryos, which is high anyway (genetic determination) in common buckwheat. This phenomenon seems to be unbreakable by breeding methods. The authors aimed to determine whether stimulants commonly used in agriculture could increase the seed yield of this plant species. The aim of the work was to choose from eight different stimulants the most effective one that would improve the seed yield of two accessions of common buckwheat by increasing the efficiency of nectar production and reducing the number of empty seeds. The plants were sprayed at either the beginning of flowering or at full bloom. The content of sugars and amino acids was higher in the nectar produced at the beginning of flowering. The nectar of both lines included also polyamines. The level of sugars in the nectar increased mainly after spraying with the stimulants in the second phase of flowering. A positive correlation between the total amount of sugars and amino acids in the nectar and seed yield was found. All the stimulants used reduced the number of empty seeds in both accessions.

Haploids/doubled haploids (DHs) derived from in vitro-cultured microspores are widely used in plant breeding and genetic engineering. However, the mechanism underlying the developmental switch from regular pollen maturation towards microspore-derived plant regeneration remains poorly defined. Here, RNA-sequencing was employed to elucidate the transcriptional landscapes of four early stages of microspore embryogenesis (ME) in barley cultivars Golden Promise and Igri, which exhibit contrasting responsiveness to microspore-derived plant formation. Our experiments revealed fundamental regulatory networks, specific groups of genes, and transcription factor (TF) families potentially regulating the developmental switch. We identified a set of candidate genes crucial for genotype-dependent responsiveness/recalcitrance to ME. Our high-resolution temporal transcriptome atlas provides an important resource for future functional studies on the genetic control of microspore developmental transition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709433878c28a0473b7fc1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Due to climatic change detected over two decades, the harmful influence of abiotic factors is increasing. One of the most threatening issues reducing plant productivity is drought stress. The strength of plant response to water shortages could differ depending on the strength of the drought stress, type of crop, genetic background, presence of additional stresses, and stage of plant development. There are examples of sexual hybridization between crop plants like oat (Avena sativa L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) with which stable fertile hybrids were generated. Additional maize chromosomes in oat plants (oat × maize addition, OMA) often infer morphological and physiological (e.g., PS II photosystem activity and chlorophyll production) changes modulated by the interaction of certain maize chromosomes added to the oat genome. The aim of the research was to evaluate the chosen physiological, biochemical, and agronomic parameters of OMA plants subjected to soil drought. Analysis of variance indicated that the main effects of genotype as well as treatment × genotype interaction were significant for all the traits studied (photosynthetic pigment content, selected PSII indices, mass of stem, number of grains/plant, mass of grains/plant). Most of the examined lines severely reduced PSII photosystem parameters, pigment content, and yield-related traits under drought stress.

Since little is known about the molecular mechanisms contributing to its invasiveness, we examined the natural dynamics of the content of rhizome compounds, which can be crucial for plant resistance and adaptation to environmental stress. We focused on rhizomes because they are the main vector of giant goldenrod dispersion in invaded lands. Water-soluble sugars, proline, and abscisic acid (ABA) were quantified in rhizomes, as well as ABA in the rhizosphere from three different but geographically close natural locations in Poland (50°04′11.3″ N, 19°50′40.2″ E) under extreme light, thermal, and soil conditions, in early spring, late summer, and late autumn. The genetic diversity of plants between locations was checked using the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Sugar and proline content was assayed spectrophotometrically, and abscisic acid (ABA) with the ELISA immunomethod. It can be assumed that the accumulation of sugars in giant goldenrod rhizomes facilitated the process of plant adaptation to adverse environmental conditions (high temperature and/or water scarcity) caused by extreme weather in summer and autumn. The same was true for high levels of proline and ABA in summer. On the other hand, the lowering of proline and ABA in autumn did not confirm the previous assumptions about their synthesis in rhizomes during the acquisition of frost resistance by giant goldenrod. However, in the location with intensive sunlight and most extreme soil conditions, a constant amount of ABA in rhizomes was noticed as well as its exudation into the rhizosphere. This research indicates that soluble sugars, proline, and ABA alterations in rhizomes can participate in the mechanism of acclimation of S. gigantea to specific soil and meteorological conditions in the country of invasion irrespective of plant genetic variation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Two DH lines, showing full (Type O) and limited (Type V) flag leaf rolling, were investigated. The measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence, analysis of red/far-red fluorescence excitation spectra, as well as detection of selected PSII proteins (PsbA/D1, PsbS) and transmembrane cytochrome complex b6f (PetC/Rieske protein) were performed. The measurements were carried out on the last day of drought and after 1 h, 3 h, and 5 h of rehydration. The physiological condition of flag leaves was studied based on measurements of water relations, the progress of leaf senescence, histochemical detection of reactive oxygen species, and the content of sugars and phenolic compounds. In Type O, as compared with Type V, a further decline in the activity of the photosynthetic apparatus was observed during the post-drought rehydration period. This was accompanied by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and more advanced senescence of flag leaves. Fluorescence excitation spectra revealed disorders in photosynthetic light conversion in Type O flag leaves during drought and rehydration over the entire range of excitation wavelengths corresponding to UVC, UVB, and UVA radiation. Type V flag leaves developed an effective UV protection mechanism in the form of increased accumulation of cell wall-bound phenolics, which efficiently absorbed UV radiation. Both types differed in the level of accumulation of PsbA, PsbS, and PetC proteins during drought and early rehydration. Soil drought caused a similar reduction in grain yield in both types. However, in Type O, the largest share in the grain yield was ascribed to the ears of lateral stems, while in Type V to the ears of the main stems. Our research has shown that the limited rolling of flag leaves under drought stress corresponds to the effective photoprotection of the photosynthetic apparatus in the first hours of rehydration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Fly ash contains silicon and aluminum oxides, and could serve as a substrate for the synthesis of zeolite. The novelty of this study was to assign a potential of fly ashes from lignite combustion in three energy blocks operating on circulating fluidized bed boilers to convert them into zeolites. The X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy; pore volume, size and specific surface area tests; thermal analysis; leaching test; and radioisotope activity analysis were applied to characterize the materials. Zeolites were synthesized using hydrothermal and fusion methods modified in the molar concentration of NaOH, the ratio of NaOH to raw material, drying and heating temperatures, and treatment time. Both, hydrothermal and fusion synthesis were found to result in the efficient formation of the zeolite Linde Type A, gismondine, and sodalite; with the largest specific surface area of zeolite developed after fusion synthesis (132 m2 g−1). The zeolite had surpassingly high efficiency of adsorption of cationic impurities from post-production wastewater, ranging from 85% to 97% and from 89% to 100%, when tested with methylene blue and lead ions, respectively. The costs of zeolite production were estimated to range from 3.82 to 6.36 $ per 1 kg, thus reducing the price of commercial zeolite by up to 99.5%. The new engineering method of zeolite is an attractive alternative to the storage of hazardous byproducts from coal-fired power plants. Eco-zeolite is also a technological innovation in the cleaning of post-production wastewater from harmful impurities, while water reuse in a closed circuit.

Niestety, cechuje ją bardzo niski i niestabilny plon nasion w porównaniu z innymi roślinami uprawnymi. Specyficzna biologia kwitnienia w tym, samo-niezgodność (brak możliwości zapylenia własnym pyłkiem), samo-niekończące kwitnienie i krótka żywotność pojedynczego kwiatu utrudnia sukces reprodukcyjny gryki. Przyczyn słabego plonowania gryki zwyczajnej upatruje się w zaburzeniach rozwoju gametofitu żeńskiego powodujących odrzucanie (aborcję) kwiatów. Czynnikami wpływającymi na to zjawisko są także stres termiczny oraz troficzny (pokarmowy). Wytworzenie formy samo- kończącej kwitnienie mogłoby skrócić okres kwitnienia i zapobiec zjawisku silnej konkurencji o związki odżywcze pomiędzy stale powstającymi kwiatami a zawiązanymi już nasionami, co mogłoby zdecydowanie zwiększyć plon nasion."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Common buckwheat is a valuable plant crop treated as superfood of the 21st century due to the above-average nutritional value of the seeds and pharmacological potential. Unfortunately, it is characterized by a very low and unstable seed\nyield compared to other crops. The specific flowering biology, including self-incompatibility (no possibility of pollination with own pollen), non-self-ending flowering and short life of a single flower, hinder the reproductive success of\nbuckwheat. The reasons of poor yielding of buckwheat are believed to be disorders in the development of the female\ngametophyte causing abortion of flowers. Factors determining flower abortion in the critical period in the buckwheat\ndevelopment cycle are most likely thermal and trophic (nutritional) stress. The development of a self- terminating\nvariety of flowering may shorten the flowering period and prevent the phenomenon of strong competition for nutrients\nbetween the continuously formed flowers and already existing seeds, which would significantly increase the seed\nyield."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9b","uid":"bYCUNhDROBwukUMKDm2MWgQ","uuid":"c21fd2c0-91d1-4bec-849c-ed0cf62231ec","name":"Instytut Botaniki im.
