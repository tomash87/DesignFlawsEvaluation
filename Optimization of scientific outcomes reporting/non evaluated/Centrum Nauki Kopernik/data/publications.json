Such science centers support bottom-up interactions, encouraging visitors to spontaneously explore the exhibits in various ways. We analyze one distinctive way of interaction, when young visitors ignore an exhibit’s instruction and use it as if it were a kind of a toy or machine to play with (this is particularly common with exhibits that are unfamiliar “open-ended objects”). Drawing on cognitive semiotics we describe this particular way of interacting with exhibits as the <jats:italic>reality mode</jats:italic> of experience, in which the user ignores an intended exhibit’s representational function. We consider whether such interactive objects can be framed as cognitive artifacts, given that standard conceptualizations of artifacts emphasize their representational function. How can we convincingly describe the process by which the cognitive function of an exhibit experienced in <jats:italic>reality mode</jats:italic> is constituted? In this paper we apply concept of ecological cognitive artifact and the idea of the enactive signification to these questions. We argue that exhibits experienced in <jats:italic>reality mode</jats:italic> do indeed perform cognitive functions, even in the absence of a representational relation. Our investigation provides insights into the cognitive functions of exhibits and contributes to the conceptualization of non-representational cognitive artifacts.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6f","uid":"brPo86c_tekewx-XjU9GBlA","uuid":"01ff2083-eedf-4ae4-b240-4fcb4903fd75","name":"Wydział Filozofii i Socjologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a04739fe7e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"623a7fbc7523402df095f8d4","uid":"bYcI4UKkeZAK5TZdPx-NQyQ","uuid":"607fd079-0cfc-4e1f-a718-64ca651197c1","name":"Centrum Nauki Kopernik","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677f847efdbe831a384017c8"],"parentId":"623a7fbc7523402df095f8d4","parentUuid":"607fd079-0cfc-4e1f-a718-64ca651197c1","rootId":"623a7fbc7523402df095f8d4","rootUuid":"607fd079-0cfc-4e1f-a718-64ca651197c1","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-25","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a04739fe7e","677f847efdbe831a384017c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d49","mniswId":"6794","title":"Foundations of Science","issn":"1233-1821","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"7e4fb282-4976-4db1-b291-23cbb0690be8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f718a9fdbe831edeb338a6","year":"2024","documentHash":"e9e8e717-ddf9-46de-8a57-648452921a6f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Science center","Situated cognition","Interactive exhibit ·\nRepresentation","Cognitive artifact","Enactive signifcation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060396431"}]
