L) is a European tree species highly sensitive to drought. If declining symptoms appear they are often detectable at the crown (such as dieback) enabling monitoring using aerial images and remote sensing methods. Here, we analyzed the impact of short and long-term drought on oaks located in western Poland, between the years of 2014 and 2017. We used both leaf nitrogen (N) and leaf phosphorus (P) concentrations measured in the laboratory, aerial images collected in the range of 460-880 nm and machine learning techniques to estimate nutrient concentrations on the > 4000 oaks growing on stagnic luvisols in the study area. We determined a negative impact on N and P concentrations during both types of drought stress (-23% and -19% for N concentration in leaves; -27% and -10% for P concentration in leaves). Decreased water availability had inconsiderable impact on N:P values (3% increase of N:P ratio during short and 7% decrease of N:P ratio during long-term drought stress). We found that the long-term drought impact was spatially diverse, possibly depending on the presence of drainage ditches and competing species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61e671fd2467f030e8b8bddb","61e671fd2467f030e8b8bdd9","61e671fd2467f030e8b8bddc"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2","issue":"31","pagesFromTo":"1137-1151","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61e671fd2467f030e8b8bdd9","5e70929f878c28a047399704","61e671fd2467f030e8b8bddb","61e671fd2467f030e8b8bddc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479300","mniswId":"16298","title":"Polish Journal of Environmental Studies","issn":"1230-1485","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"747e133a-d702-4b1d-925b-61dd40d9fefe"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"614058842467f0723cada5b2","year":"2021","documentHash":"14466af5-121b-4d0b-8d25-feec5c321569"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["drought oak plant nutrition remote sensing machine learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058018471"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ee878c28a0473b38be","name":"Adam","lastName":"Okniński","uuid":"A9EA44DF4D5AB234E098B6392607432DEE5C179E87D5DEE6E10E58352B621CD32FFC3E3EBF4C386DD19758E6C3F7712D239C0ECA2441F0858B69492499ED8400","documentHash":"8ce1903c-edf1-46ad-b6aa-55f2cd90d725"}],"objectId":"61efff0a2467f0312282531f","doi":"10.1016/j.cja.2021.07.038","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1000936121003319?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Solid rocket propulsion technology for de-orbiting spacecraft","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the topic of using solid rocket propulsion for de-orbiting spacecraft, in order to fulfil space debris mitigation requirements. The benefits and disadvantages of using such means are discussed. A dedicated system can be implemented in the satellite design phase and shall be a key subsystem of platforms inserted into orbit. Uncontrolled, semi-controlled and controlled de-orbit can be completed using solid rocket motors. Their impact on the space debris environment is discussed. Specific requirements for dedicated propellants and systems are provided. While the majority of presently developed rocket systems worldwide require high burn rates, several applications, including de-orbiting, benefit from solid propellants with decreased regression rates. This allows limiting spacecraft accelerations and loads during de-orbit manoeuvres. Moreover, the requirement of minimising solid particle generation is presented. Heritage technology from the Mercury and Gemini human spaceflight programmes, where de-orbit motors were used, is shown. Historical Soviet, American and Chinese film-return-capsule solid propellant retrorockets, enabling de-orbit, are also presented. A detailed survey of current work worldwide on end-of-life disposal using solid propulsion is included. Challenges of developing dedicated systems are discussed.

The main purpose of this work is to obtain reliable information about aerodynamic properties, which will be useful in the preliminary design of a low-cost satellite launch system based on a system consisting of a carrier aircraft and a space rocket orbiter. The numerical geometry of the aircraft carrier was developed as a result of the digitization process of the external surface of a real aircraft. Aerodynamic analysis was performed using specialized software based on solving partial differential equations using the finite volumes method. The results of the aerodynamic analysis were presented in a quantitative and qualitative manner. Furthermore, in order to confirm the correctness of the chosen method, the obtained\nresults were compared with the results of experimental tests carried out in a wind tunnel. This will also prove that the adopted method is sufficient for solving this type of problem. The main advantage of the presented method is obtainment of reliable results in a relatively short time, which is extremely important during the preliminary design stage. The results presented in this paper will certainly be helpful for all researchers involved in the development of new and low-cost methods for launching small satellites into LEO."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947e878c28a0473be592"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","uid":"byIMgWh_9RUyyDH3dMzNDyw","uuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

Thus, an airborne-launcher-to-space-system may be attractive to countries\nwithout ground-based space rocket launch sites.\nDesign/methodology/approach – For considered launch-to-orbit system configurations, simulations of space rocket effects on aerodynamic\ncharacteristics were performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD ANSYS Fluent) methods. In addition, experimental studies were performed\nin a wind tunnel to verify the numerical simulations. Discrete models of the aircraft structure were developed for analysis using finite element\nmethod (FEM). The analysis of simulated structural properties of the models was carried out to test its stiffness and mass characteristics important\nfor solving the static and dynamic problems of the structure. The validation analyses of aircraft models were based on mass distribution estimation\nand matching the stiffness properties of the individual airframe structural assemblies.\nFindings – The results of numerical analyses and tunnel tests indicate that the influence of carrier rockets on the change of aerodynamic and\nstrength characteristics of the airframe is rather negligible. The aircraft can be used as launching platforms for space rockets. Simulations have\nindicated that the aircraft will successfully perform a mission of taking away and launching a rocket of at least about 1,000 kg total weight with a\n10 kg space payload included.\nPractical implications – The combat aircraft can be used as launch platforms for space rockets, and the air/rocket set can become the equivalent of\nresponsive space assets for countries with small space budgets.\nOriginality/value – The work presents original results obtained by the authors during a preliminary design of a low-cost satellite launch system\nconsisting of a carrier aircraft and a space rocket orbiter. The possibility of using decommissioned combat aircraft as air-launch-to-orbit platforms\nwas taken into consideration. In the absence of aircraft design documentation, reverse engineering methods and techniques were used to develop\naircraft geometry and airframe strength structure. Use of CFD, FEM and simulation methods to evaluate system capabilities was demonstrated.\nNumerical results from CFD simulations were finally verified in experimental tests."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63ad3ba140970728ba304be8"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e178","uid":"bNsOc8LWMO-rYhuDMGKqClg","uuid":"b276c277-c4c6-4376-befd-8461236490bd","name":"Wydział Mechatroniki, Uzbrojenia i Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709390878c28a0473aceb1","5e709390878c28a0473acebe","5e7092a4878c28a047399c74","5e7092a4878c28a047399c85","5e7092a4878c28a047399c53","5e7092a4878c28a047399c6e","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e8d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"95","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"629-636","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a4878c28a047399c53","5e7092a4878c28a047399c6e","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e8d","5e7092a4878c28a047399c85","63ad3ba140970728ba304be8","5e7092a4878c28a047399c74","5e709390878c28a0473acebe","5e709390878c28a0473aceb1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f3b","mniswId":"730","title":"Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology","issn":"1748-8842","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fc89415a-86ef-43d3-93ba-c141df4dcfe3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ad3ba140970728ba304be3","year":"2022","documentHash":"605cf8fd-af18-44e1-b560-49128711741a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Air-launch-to-orbit system","Reverse engineering (RE)","Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)","Finite element method modeling (FEM)","Wind tunnel tests"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058371498"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba4c7","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Nasiłowska","uuid":"2C8F678054F83C3C44EF36F80F1B2F814BD021B8ACE302D85C57B69879FAA162E64A053351E2B7DDF7B04B9A48CAFBF47EA6775C33632002F9EB8126384F8984","orcidId":"0000-0003-0960-5260","documentHash":"7d61d48f-b864-40b7-9d3d-81d53e1bc9b5"},{"objectId":"5e70930b878c28a0473a1c25","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Mierczyk","uuid":"2E4DCDCF732F353C34D6221995B5EEB91D4E3172B5A1B82C34CF92519D171B18425C71A40ACBCB66105B102761A725FE3664299FD4D671AEF2606CD19BBCC5F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8453-6894","documentHash":"8a22aaa4-7f4c-4cef-b5e0-ba0e097e7efe"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739970a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szcześniak","uuid":"1C4326AA48992ECD6301B620C7D4CA165D3759A0393A5B02D131C80B25335B80AFA1EB304295F805567A3477E54298A4D9BB34F36705EC64EDC1389A34E17034","orcidId":"0000-0002-3936-9847","documentHash":"0c06bc13-586b-49aa-860b-00fdec6f8d17"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399707","name":"Adam","lastName":"Stolarski","uuid":"4783FEE0AE982D2A3CA735CAEC6A69AAAEAB4AAB1A373E2ABD171C27105185E49B510099032957A26140AD103C1B94FD46DCEBACA194B150E5A6F3EB6FA44B0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4754-3067","documentHash":"7f93e5c1-61d9-406a-bb5f-f8820431a632"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399704","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Siwiński","uuid":"8DD2A9E90407D26FAEC91C0EECC6C7E398EF58BD118B1C39090DFC540929A5E4E429C0687828C93DB963A767C67B7B0DADF46B905B0084505B7B02C817D04CD2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4805-166X","documentHash":"41ccdf39-8e54-4d7a-9ee7-76171440f687"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941c5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kubiak-Siwińska","uuid":"649BF12CB2E6ED13225835FF2584F8D2D2DD345E64C41C3686F7206D1E5E0F4B40AD86CFCEB4CDE9949F44FD4B259371EF0E20E9627118D7D7DACDFF53E528B0","documentHash":"97036340-08c3-4e83-8527-4c98814e8deb"}],"objectId":"63be683740970720586c9865","doi":"10.24425/ace.2022.143027","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of the mix composition with superplasticizer admixture on mechanical properties of high–strength concrete based on reactive powders","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper outlines effect of the mix composition on mechanical properties of high–strength concrete based on aggregate size like in of Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC) but without fiber reinforcement. The main purpose which guided the authors choosing proportion of water and superplasticizer (SP) was to achieve a similar consistency in the test slump for various concrete mix. Test results for 3 groups of superplasticizers, designated as D – with chemical base – acrylic polymer, V – with chemical base – polycarboxylate ether, P – with chemical base – modified polycarboxylates, two cement groups, designated as Cem A – with fineness Blaine 3980 cm2/g, Cem B – with fineness Blaine 4430 cm2/g and 2 types of aggregate: basalt and granite were presented. After curing for 1, 7 and 28 days samples were tested for compressive strength and flexural tensile strength. The article also presents the study of the elemental composition and structure of the SP with the use of the SEM electron microscope. The amount of solid particles in the SP was also determined by the water vaporization. The assumption of the paper was to maintain the consistency of the mixture at the S2 level according to the Eurocode standard. The paper proposes a method based on SEM analysis in order to select a superplasticizer with the best ductility parameters, and the best results of the compressive and flexural tensile strength of concrete samples were obtained. The best results for compressive strength after 28 days are obtained for concrete series with the polycarboxylate ether superplasticizer and modified polycarboxylate ether superplasticizer in combination with the use of type A cement and it is greater than for the concrete series with type B cement by 11.7%."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","uid":"byIMgWh_9RUyyDH3dMzNDyw","uuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

As such, N+2 generation aircraft with propulsion placed in the aft of the aircraft are gaining in popularity. the boundary layer is formed on the fuselage before enteringthe engine located in the aft of the aircraft. Due to significant difficulties in performing experimental testsof BLI propulsors with full-size aircraft, distortion gauzes are one of the methods to provide the desiredair velocity profile at the inlet. this paper describes a novel method of designing such gauzes, a topic whichis not well covered in the existing literature. In the first stage of the presented method, single orifices ofdifferent sizes were calculated using CFD tools. the relationship between their size and the gauze resistancecoefficient was identified, making it possible to model the distortion gauze using porous media. An iterativeapproach was used to design a gauze that meets the requirements. this is, to our knowledge, the firstdistortion   gauze   design   description   where   a   porous   media   model   has   been   used.   experimental   testsdemonstrated that the produced distortion gauze yields a velocity profile comparable to the desired one.this indicates the great potential of using the presented approach in further research on boundary layeringesting propulsions. It offers an opportunity to reduce substantially both the costs of experimentalresearch and the time required to design a distortion-tolerant fan"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63de63394097070c2f2f9abe","63de63394097070c2f2f9abc","63de63394097070c2f2f9abd"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2022","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63de63394097070c2f2f9abc","63de63394097070c2f2f9abd","63de63394097070c2f2f9abe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec0089aad49b31ccedbe8a8","title":"Transactions on Aerospace Research","issn":"2545-2835","websiteLink":"http://ilot.edu.pl","documentHash":"df5c0fc8-33bb-4d7c-94a6-0cedb5746878"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63de62d84097070c2f2f9784","year":"2022","volume":"2022","number":"1","documentHash":"1fd6397a-2459-467a-9edd-551c7dafcc83"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058481237"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ee878c28a0473b38be","name":"Adam","lastName":"Okniński","uuid":"A9EA44DF4D5AB234E098B6392607432DEE5C179E87D5DEE6E10E58352B621CD32FFC3E3EBF4C386DD19758E6C3F7712D239C0ECA2441F0858B69492499ED8400","documentHash":"8ce1903c-edf1-46ad-b6aa-55f2cd90d725"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63de6b8f4097070c2f2fccc9","doi":"10.22211/cejem/154720","publicUri":"https://ipo.lukasiewicz.gov.pl/wydawnictwa/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CEJEM-1184v0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"HTPB-based Binder Surrogates and their Effects on Preliminary Rocket Motor Analyses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a comparison of the hydroxyl-terminated\npolybutadiene (HTPB) models used during conceptual and preliminary rocket\npropulsion analyses.

The Benson additivity rule\nwas used to estimate the HTPB enthalpy of formation and to compare it with\nvalues found in the literature. The HTPB binder models are set side by side in\nterms of solid rocket motor performance and observable combustion products,\nusing chemical equilibrium software. Moreover, simple heat transfer and\naluminum combustion models are used to present the impact of using different\nmodels of binders on design calculations.

Advancements in technology created cheaper cells, that can store more energy and have higher power density, which enabled manufacturers to build many new electric vehicles. However, accumulator in EVs is still the most expensive part of electric powertrain and cells are very sensitive to operating conditions. Temperatures outside of their specific range can cause quicker loss of their capacity, lower power performance or even cause thermal runaway events that are almost inextinguishable - that’s why proper thermal management receives a lot of attention. This paper discloses important aspects of accumulators, that have to be considered during thermal design, reviews every current solution, their advantages and disadvantages, with examples of EVs that use them. Current trends and possible changes in near future are then disclosed, to create good knowledge base about current situation and trends on the market to make early phase of conceptual work easier."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ee878c28a0473b3923","5e7092ae878c28a04739a809"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"4","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ee878c28a0473b3923","5e7092ae878c28a04739a809","63de68c04097070c2f2fbd1e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a473","mniswId":"26316","title":"Rynek Energii","issn":"1425-5960","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"bce8caa9-3a3b-4765-802e-c108acbeaa1d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058481462"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63de62d84097070c2f2f9787","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Loroch","documentHash":"a372f3bd-ef77-444b-b740-7512ac626ba4"},{"objectId":"63de62d84097070c2f2f9786","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Głowacki","documentHash":"86ba5323-3018-468a-9c42-5a35bc4e851a"},{"objectId":"63de62d84097070c2f2f9785","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Balicki","documentHash":"1edf9ad5-e4ee-4a06-878f-80d9c9d24a83"}],"objectId":"63de62d84097070c2f2f9783","doi":"10.2478/tar-2022-0002","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/tar-2022-0002","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Threats to Aviation Safety Caused by Defects in Aircraft Airframe Systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Alongside the increase in air traffic and number of aircraft, the number of reported aviation eventshas also been increasing.

The accuracy of the measurements of state variables affects the quality and effectiveness of flight stabilization. When designing closed-loop systems, it is desirable to use sensors of the highest class and reliability, the signals of which will be as error-free as possible. False indications lead to malfunctioning of the stabilization system, and its operation does not meet the requirements set for it. There are many types of errors—bias, white noise, hysteresis, or bias drift—which affect the measurement signals from the sensors. One of the significant problems is assessing what maximum level of sensor errors stabilization system will still operate as required. In this paper, the impact of different sensor errors on flight stabilization was presented. The research was carried out using the example of an automatic flight stabilization system using aircraft trimming surfaces in a longitudinal control channel in Hardware-in-the-Loop simulations. The model simulates various types of sensor errors during flight, while the stabilization system is implemented in hardware interfaced with a real-time computer. The results of the simulations are presented and analyzed. Their comparison indicated which sensor errors affects the flight stability the most and how the effectiveness of the stabilization system changes as error increases. The presented results show changes in flight parameters due to added sensor errors. Depending on the accuracy class of the IMU, the errors more or less disrupt the operation of the system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz -

It caused the necessity of developing such a system for small aircraft. The proposed system was developed using Model-Based Design then tuned and tested in Model, Pilot and Hardware in the Loop Simulations. The paper presents the next advanced stage of testing—verification in simulation and ground tests on the PZL-130 Orlik airplane. The implementation of this system does not modify the pilot’s primary manual controls. The newly introduced electrical trim is used for automatic stabilization but can be used at manual trimming as it was previously, depending on the chosen operation mode. The ground tests were planned according to civil aviation authority and aviation law requirements. Chosen results from simulated flights were analyzed and presented, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed system. The dedicated application allowing the test engineer to change stabilization system parameters during the flight on a touchscreen tablet was developed and described. The outcome of the stabilization system test campaign was a verification of its performance before the flight tests. The comparison of simulated and real flight data will allow identifying model deficiencies and flight stabilization system efficiency, which makes possible improvements implementation. Additionally, it appeared to be the cost-effective and less electrical energy-consuming automatic flight stabilization system for small aircraft. Such features benefit initiatives like Future Sky, More Electric Aircraft and aircraft stabilization system retrofit."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63de60b84097070c2f2f88ba","63de60b84097070c2f2f88bc","63de60b84097070c2f2f88bb"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"111","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63de60b84097070c2f2f88ba","63de60b84097070c2f2f88bb","63de60b84097070c2f2f88bc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b89b","mniswId":"558","title":"Aerospace","issn":"2226-4310","eissn":"2226-4310","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"320427a6-10d3-497f-a5e3-0c40eb1fd9f1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63de60b84097070c2f2f88b9","year":"2022","volume":"9","number":"2","documentHash":"2d22d745-ef1a-4747-b0bc-7488435cccee"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["flight stabilization;"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058639748"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63de63de4097070c2f2f9e3b","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Szczepański","documentHash":"df6a6ab5-59c4-4759-810c-524eb33ca008"},{"objectId":"63de63de4097070c2f2f9e3a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Filipowicz","documentHash":"62b339d6-2d2c-4768-a306-effa989e425f"}],"objectId":"63de63de4097070c2f2f9e39","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-03502-9_13","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-03502-9_13","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Hardware and Software Design of Onboard Computer Controlling the Flight Stabilisation System","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the design and performance of the flight stabilisation system onboard computer developed in Łukasiewicz Research Network – Institute of Aviation.

The aim of this study was the experimental investigation of an alternative solution for decomposition of 98%+ hydrogen peroxide, strictly for chemical propulsion. High-porosity open cell metal foams have been identified as structures with great potential. Low density, good mechanical and thermal properties, availability of various materials and alloys as well as new technologies of manufacturing, make metal foam a potential solution for many different propellants, not only hydrogen peroxide. Open cell NiCrAl foam has been processed to prepare several catalysts, with different content and dispersion of the active phase. Cleaning and drying were performed to prepare carriers for further processing: wet impregnation, slow drying, and calcination. Simple drop tests with 98% hydrogen peroxide have been conducted to estimate activity level of catalysts, in a simplified scale: low, medium, high. Then, real-environment tests have been performed in a catalyst bed. Temperature, pressure along the bed and propellant mass flow rate were measured while testing. The analysis of the test results provided a general conclusion that metal foam supported manganese oxide catalyst is a promising solution for hydrogen peroxide propulsion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947e878c28a0473be5a4","5e7094ac878c28a0473c1669"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"215","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ac878c28a0473c1669","5e70947e878c28a0473be5a4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b89b","mniswId":"558","title":"Aerospace","issn":"2226-4310","eissn":"2226-4310","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"320427a6-10d3-497f-a5e3-0c40eb1fd9f1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b3a200409707713dfeb2de","year":"2023","volume":"10","number":"3","documentHash":"60648883-fb12-425b-b1d6-b9d411ac9721"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059290146"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebee7e1752340254fc4542c","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Moneta","uuid":"6E5B18880FBE1E93D72BF7888D72182480D712DAC9B70BDAFF8E1CAAEC3BFEB5A265B1BC96682BFB7D3DD8AF4DD7574B5C2D08E573298D5156E4FFB948937480","documentHash":"d0629f48-4de7-4428-8c63-171740161b76"}],"objectId":"65b3b472409707713d022a8a","doi":"10.2478/fas-2022-0006","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/fas-2022-0006","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Insight into Damping Sources in Turbines","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Blade vibrations in aircraft engines are a significant challenge that must be overcome during the design and development of modern turbine engines. Vibrations lead to cyclic displacements and result in alternating stress and strain in undesired environments (high temperatures, erosion, corrosion of the surface, etc.). Under resonance conditions, stress amplitudes can increase and exceed their safety limits, and in extreme cases, can lead to engine failure. One method to reduce resonance vibrations is to increase damping in the turbine assembly. This paper presents and describes vibration damping sources in the turbine, including aerodynamic, material, and friction damping.

Limited data sets of the Mars atmosphere profile are available, while ambitious exploration plans for the next years and decades require achieving game-changing capabilities in terms of extensive atmospheric data acquisition. Planetary landers, orbiters or rovers have limited capabilities regarding gathering data of the atmosphere. Aircraft and rotorcraft are among other solutions for Mars exploration, but they enable conducting soundings only at relatively low altitudes. It is therefore of uttermost importance to ensure the capability for further data acquisition supporting safe and sustainable exploration of Mars.\n\nThis paper proposes the concept of use of Mars-dedicated sounding rockets. Unlike other concepts, considering rocket propulsion on vehicles capable of doing tasks including i.e. descent and landing, bringing samples of Martian soil to orbit and serving as a long-range Mars surface transportation system, the proposed concept is focused only on conducting ballistic flights with the main purpose of atmospheric research, aiding exploration and potential future activities. Rocket design drivers are discussed and compared with the state-of-the-art approach regarding Earth atmospheric sounding. Means for propelling suborbital flights on Mars are discussed. Optimization of vehicles for a reference mission is described and effects of sizing rockets for Martian application instead of Terrestrial utilization are given. Finally, recommendations for future dedicated Martian sounding rocket developments and a technical scenarios outlook are provided."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092bc878c28a04739bc39","5e7092c4878c28a04739c442","5e7093ee878c28a0473b38be"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"203","pagesFromTo":"370-384","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c442","5e7092bc878c28a04739bc39","5e7093ee878c28a0473b38be"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dda","mniswId":"157","title":"Acta Astronautica","issn":"0094-5765","eissn":"1879-2030","documentHash":"0e27d0ba-ad12-4eb0-853a-1e3dde23cde2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b3a01e409707713dfe80ea","year":"2023","volume":"203","documentHash":"13b81f5e-d13c-4123-9137-910005ac5635"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059290454"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b3b0a7409707713d01aa96","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kurdelski","documentHash":"d9d5cd8b-30a3-4927-8148-e34f41c1b06d"},{"objectId":"65b3b0a7409707713d01aa95","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Reymer","documentHash":"20000e26-056c-4c74-965c-c2180f0e378a"},{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b43b1","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Leski","uuid":"5BEC336C1CBB7B3B94CC56EB5CEF9FFF189F20F4A0C7CB34A920FF3F288E561AB45F24B067BA76E7A837A98C154733B80043A62566E4D7C33E38B2E411EF8C4D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3006-8877","documentHash":"26b7f87d-c35c-43cd-afa5-375831e84252"}],"objectId":"65b3b0a7409707713d01aa93","doi":"10.2478/fas-2022-0002","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/fas-2022-0002","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sensitivity Analysis of the Nasgro Equation Based on the PZL-130 TC-II Orlik Trainer Aircraft Full Scale Fatigue Test","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study investigates the sensitivity of numerical crack propagation estimations based on the Nasgro equation.

They are caused by various factors, such as aerodynamic effects on the external surfaces and engine combustion instability. The second factor is especially pronounced in hybrid rocket engines, such as the main engine of the ILR-33 AMBER 2K rocket. In order to ensure the correct operation of all the equipment and payload on board, vibration testing of the devices is necessary as part of pre-flight qualification. For such tests to be truly indicative of in-flight performance, the vibration environment of the vehicle must be analysed. A conceptual measurement method was proposed, along with a prototype measurement system. The system is adapted to be integrated into the modular ILR-33 AMBER 2K on-board computer or work independently as a separate module. The device measures vibration in three axes in several key points onboard the rocket, with the possibility of connecting multiple units in a daisy-chain configuration. This paper presents the design of the module, including the key aspects of integrating it as part of the avionics package. The means of acquiring and storing of measurement data are presented. The method of validating the system's data acquisition capabilities is described in detail. Qualification testing results and identified issues are discussed.

Therefore, some aircraft types have tested the possibility of controlling the flight in automatic mode or stabilising the flight with trimmers. Previous research on cost-effective and less electrical-energy-consuming automatic stabilisation systems for an aircraft resulted in constructing a laboratory model of the system. Such a feature is beneficial for initiatives like Future Sky, electric aircraft and aircraft stabilisation system retrofits. The system was developed using model-based design and next tuned and tested in model, pilot and hardware-in-the-loop simulations. The implementation of this system does not modify the pilot’s primary manual controls. Instead, the electrical trim system is used for automatic stabilisation or manual trimming, depending on the chosen operation mode. The paper presents the development process of the laboratory model of the system and its simulation under degraded actuator speeds. The results were the basis for its control performance assessment. First, the control performance measure was defined. Then the simulation scenarios that compare system behaviour in stabilisation mode after aerodynamic disturbance with three different trim tab actuator speeds were described. The performance measure is highly degraded by the slower actuator speeds, although altitude and heading are finally stabilised in all cases. Moreover, the performance of stabilisation in a lateral channel is less affected by the slowest actuator than in a longitudinal channel."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b59c6","5e7091f8878c28a04738def9","5e70937f878c28a0473ab21c"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"429","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937f878c28a0473ab21c","5e709410878c28a0473b59c6","5e7091f8878c28a04738def9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b89b","mniswId":"558","title":"Aerospace","issn":"2226-4310","eissn":"2226-4310","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"320427a6-10d3-497f-a5e3-0c40eb1fd9f1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b3a293409707713dfec010","year":"2023","volume":"10","number":"5","documentHash":"ad543f23-43ac-491f-9ded-cfff4b987e0b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["flight tests","flight stabilisation system"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059328092"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b397b","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":"8ABE83FF30D5BFE209C0FE5D5D4838B3390716B3814E74CF9F938FDB6D0C560AE873EBACBBD40EFB61FB39627F46D34CE7F6B7BE1B6305F98DAFA367BAE46207","documentHash":"15905b37-de4a-490c-994a-f95b79c297e9"}],"objectId":"65b3b04d409707713d01a5f6","doi":"10.1016/j.engfracmech.2023.109075","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013794423000334?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Investigation of the applicability of single cantilever beam test for the evaluation of fracture toughness of sandwich composites","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sandwich composites are widely used in load-carrying structures and there is a need for a testing method that will allow for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the bond between the facesheets and the core. The presented research investigates the applicability of the single cantilever beam (SCB) test to the evaluation of the mode I dominated fracture toughness of such structures under both quasi-static and fatigue loading.\n\nThe SCB method uses a relatively simple fixture, the debond front loading conditions are independent of the debond length and the propagation takes place near the facesheet-to-core interface. It allows for the determination of the initiation and the propagation fracture toughness and can also be used for fatigue testing.\n\nA sandwich composite, made of carbon-epoxy facesheets and an aramid honeycomb core, was tested in quasi-static and fatigue loading conditions. The initiation values of the Energy Release Rate (ERR) were determined using the Modified Beam Theory (MBT) approach for different definitions of the initiation point. The propagation tests were conducted along with the visual observation of the debond growth. The propagation fracture toughness was determined using two approaches – MBT and the Area Method. The fatigue testing was realized, using the same setup, by cycling the specimens through a range of ERR values. The debond length was measured during the test which allowed for the determination of a relationship between the ERR and the debond length growth rate.\n\nThe research confirmed that the SCB method can be used for the quantitative measurement of the fracture toughness of sandwich structures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f0878c28a0473b397b"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"281","pagesFromTo":"109075","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f0878c28a0473b397b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ac2","mniswId":"5714","title":"Engineering Fracture Mechanics","issn":"0013-7944","documentHash":"76d6c1f3-ee95-4a73-8b8f-b71e08d2213b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b3b04d409707713d01a5f7","year":"2023","volume":"281","documentHash":"db61415b-7a48-40b8-95e9-923cbbe50579"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059328466"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ee878c28a0473b3930","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":"E9A0A276719C33F5A5F006834EE30E80298F6857B5080EA71085EF1A4EBAFAA7D9559CB9586143132BA6AE0D7ADC55CA7D5C47397B669B884131163986588041","orcidId":"0000-0002-6094-4105","documentHash":"f7ce2581-0c19-4ae8-bda7-e7c62d51970c"},{"objectId":"5e7093ee878c28a0473b38bc","name":"Jan","lastName":"Matyszewski","uuid":"7141A357C90CDF4EDAAED8B840B7330BAABF4872367EB903E989796D74C35284EC30D10B633BEFEE44E1E8F87B2D3CF13AE6F4BE2D33E9B36B0B2995B2640869","documentHash":"94ffebb0-f1b1-4401-b47a-4ac3e7bd0d1c"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bc39","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Cieśliński","uuid":"EC9787D54EED1C5E292FE8D5B90B3D6189A0AD354D2672CCBD5E620C266CA163C5A3A3F418363C884230DC3E0DC34CAF2709178FF218783CC12C328C39B5CD13","documentHash":"434b6ae1-8f9e-413e-bd7f-5dc2d06aa872"}],"objectId":"65b3b795409707713d02709d","doi":"10.15866/irease.v16i1.22619","publicUri":"https://www.praiseworthyprize.org/jsm/index.php?journal=irease&page=article&op=viewFile&path[]=26932&path[]=pdf_265","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Verifying the ILR-33 AMBER Rocket Recovery System by Means of a Drop Test Campaign","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the evaluation process of a Recovery System developed for the ILR-33 AMBER suborbital rocket, designed for small payloads and capable of launching 10 kg to altitudes up to 100 km.

After presenting the design of the Recovery System, this study focuses mainly on a subsonic drop test campaign that allowed the system to be qualified for the first version of the AMBER rocket vehicle. Analytical and numerical methods for the recovery phase development are presented and compared with the experimental results obtained from the drop tests.

Additionally, airfoil parameters including maximum camber and its position, as well as the position of maximum thickness, were added. Secondly, a blade geometry-resolved aerodynamic model based on steady RANS was established. A two-equation SST turbulence model was used for compressible flow with periodic boundary conditions. Thirdly, an aeroacoustic model for far-field tonal noise calculation was defined, based on the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings analogy and a RANS solution. A global sensitivity analysis was performed to establish the importance of individual design variables. Consequently, surrogate modeling-based optimization strategy was devised to efficiently establish Pareto front of propeller geometries in multi-objective aeroacoustic optimization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ee878c28a0473b385f","5e7094af878c28a0473c18cf"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"306","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094af878c28a0473c18cf","5e7093ee878c28a0473b385f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b89b","mniswId":"558","title":"Aerospace","eissn":"2226-4310","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"bf5bb54c-f7c1-4c76-a808-943dadc2fd90"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b3a200409707713dfeb2de","year":"2023","volume":"10","number":"3","documentHash":"60648883-fb12-425b-b1d6-b9d411ac9721"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059341106"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d01888d","name":"Maria","lastName":"Trzaska","documentHash":"bb37b406-de57-4126-8c19-1fe5fac91fcb"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d01888c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kapuścińska","documentHash":"713b710f-97d6-4108-802b-cc2549172c59"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d01888b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Głowacki","documentHash":"772d7cea-6fa9-42e3-b0e8-49e48fa6371f"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d01888a","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Wojda","documentHash":"a9d02a1f-dce9-44bd-a2f1-e65a0e9d696b"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d018889","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Pęśko","documentHash":"5e5c7a26-0970-44a1-a3a1-542863a02dbb"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d018888","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Dąbrowski","documentHash":"79a6855a-c5c9-4dd2-9a21-91585a5da703"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d018887","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Skroban","documentHash":"59d1055f-a39f-4bf6-9e15-649fb143bd5d"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d018886","name":"Tinatin","lastName":"Ciciszwili","documentHash":"a48bc306-d9ea-4f29-ab96-4f100265a7af"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d018885","name":"Marta","lastName":"Gostomska","documentHash":"5a60c794-a842-4cbe-888f-67e6086d1235"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d018884","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Cieślak","documentHash":"6de143d1-5b92-4d46-83c0-25f6d292ef42"},{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d018883","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gajewska-Midziałek","documentHash":"b6b0f6d4-71ee-4a18-af8f-1a1d2936b599"}],"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d018881","doi":"10.3390/coatings13091535","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/13/9/1535/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Properties of Ni-B/B Composite Coatings Produced by Chemical Reduction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the results of research on composite Ni-B coatings with embedded particles of boron produced by a chemical reduction method and their influence on the mechanical, tribological, and corrosion properties of produced materials.

The paper also presents the characteristics of the used boron particles. Results of morphology and surface topography (SEM) as well as the structure (XRD) of the produced coatings are presented. The mechanical properties of the produced coatings, like Knoop hardness, Martens hardness, and indentation hardness, as well as the modulus of elasticity, were determined. The tribological tests were carried out using the ball-on-disc method. Electrochemical corrosion tests were conducted by the potentiodynamic method. The adhesion of the coatings to the substrate was evaluated by the scratch test method. Consequently, this investigation yielded a novel material in the form of Ni-B/B composite coatings, exhibiting significantly improved mechanical and tribological properties compared to Ni-B coatings without embedded particles of the dispersion phase."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65b3af51409707713d01888c"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1535","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b3af51409707713d018883","65b3af51409707713d018884","65b3af51409707713d018885","65b3af51409707713d018886","65b3af51409707713d018887","65b3af51409707713d018888","65b3af51409707713d018889","65b3af51409707713d01888a","65b3af51409707713d01888b","65b3af51409707713d01888c","65b3af51409707713d01888d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bd6e","mniswId":"3957","title":"Coatings","issn":"2079-6412","eissn":"2079-6412","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"4e0160b7-f155-4bb5-939e-e216d63ebd2d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b3af51409707713d018882","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"9","documentHash":"3ef43838-dd4b-4091-857e-7e0ad9b7336f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059341143"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e7c","name":"Stefano","lastName":"Proietti","documentHash":"1c482c46-9008-4e85-a851-ecf748a9114f"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e7b","name":"Luigi","lastName":"Brucculeri","documentHash":"f9112e23-ef6e-48d2-84b7-91ffe3db3411"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e7a","name":"Raffaella","lastName":"Russo","documentHash":"965037b2-f2e6-414a-848c-9c74e3bf90ab"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e79","name":"Gabriella","lastName":"Duca","documentHash":"f0047ba9-3886-49e8-881d-0cac58730fc5"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e78","name":"Abdel el","lastName":"Makhloufi","documentHash":"b2c3d5cd-c987-4836-9db6-a30fd8822310"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e77","name":"Margarita","lastName":"Bagamanova","documentHash":"237c6052-70e8-49f0-a8a3-46a33ce833ad"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e76","name":"Miguel","lastName":"Mujica Mota","documentHash":"d8ffcc88-a85c-45f8-8372-c56d00139e4a"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e75","name":"Fares","lastName":"Naser","documentHash":"e1d553c8-dd55-432d-bf64-47801a2bd73e"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e74","name":"Peter A.","lastName":"Meincke","documentHash":"2381153d-a63b-48bf-9d98-a29c6edab7aa"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e73","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Cerasuolo","documentHash":"63c8caff-27f3-4ac3-8bc3-501e8af110e4"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e72","name":"Roberto Valentino","lastName":"Montaquila","documentHash":"9eed1f06-9581-42a2-9375-ef1485cfeccd"},{"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e71","name":"Vittorio","lastName":"Di Vito","documentHash":"d6c6f19e-ab92-401f-a1a6-6122bbda8c98"},{"objectId":"5e709485878c28a0473bedf5","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Mączka","uuid":"9923B86252BDF674550618306554C12A6221948907D385A570D70096D49E5DF82D52C4E6537AB86633BE46DEB17CAB7DB5064D9796621683654D694D06E28A9A","documentHash":"ffde4afd-6385-4c8a-8f4a-79c1a2222025"},{"objectId":"5e709485878c28a0473bede9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"CDB53D2CCB773C300542089601E9599DF915AAC4F431FD74835977CC1CC2821BDE6CCBB75896F9A8BCF8149624F3B6CC420EEE440EE591C88AE3BCD8FC972078","documentHash":"39c363d9-e1b7-4444-893c-d22bd38a2aaa"},{"objectId":"5e709482878c28a0473beb65","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Dziugieł","uuid":"9B1B6F8DAF8B5E841D4F99974A87B749B593C5B80B1A0EAEC892793E081EB57EED0C23DDA4DEF59E88424E83B6FF57C82423A180BB1860E20337893093CF318F","documentHash":"6ca0f119-e2e4-4b87-aec3-63c959e05d19"}],"objectId":"65b640074097071432323e70","doi":"10.3390/su15032380","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/3/2380/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"X-TEAM D2D Project: Designing and Validating a Concept of Operations for Door-To-Door Multimodal Transport","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The project X-TEAM D2D (extended ATM for door-to-door travel) has been funded by SESAR JU in the framework of the research activities devoted to the investigation of integration of Air Traffic Management (ATM) and aviation into a wider transport system able to support the implementation of the door-to-door (D2D) travel concept. The project defines a concept for the seamless integration of ATM and Air Transport into an intermodal network, including other available transportation means, such as surface and waterways, to contribute to the 4 h door-to-door connectivity targeted by the European Commission in the ACARE SRIA FlightPath 2050 goals. In particular, the project focused on the design of a concept of operations for urban and extended urban (up to regional) integrated mobility, taking into account the evolution of transportation and passengers service scenarios for the next decades, according to baseline (2025), intermediate (2035) and final target (2050) time horizons. The designed ConOps encompassed both the transportation platforms integration concepts and the innovative seamless Mobility as a Service, integrating emerging technologies, such as Urban Air Mobility (e.g., electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles) and new mobility forms (e.g., micromobility vehicles) into the intermodal traffic network, including Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). The developed concept has been evaluated against existing KPAs and KPIs, implementing both qualitative and quantitative performance assessment approaches, while also considering specific performance metrics related to transport integration efficiency from the passenger point of view, being the proposed solution designed to be centered around the passenger needs. The aim of this paper is to provide a description of the activities carried out in the project and to present at high level the related outcomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709485878c28a0473bedf5","5e709485878c28a0473bede9","5e709482878c28a0473beb65"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"2380","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b640074097071432323e71","65b640074097071432323e72","65b640074097071432323e73","65b640074097071432323e74","65b640074097071432323e75","65b640074097071432323e76","65b640074097071432323e77","65b640074097071432323e78","65b640074097071432323e79","65b640074097071432323e7a","65b640074097071432323e7b","65b640074097071432323e7c","5e709482878c28a0473beb65","5e709485878c28a0473bedf5","5e709485878c28a0473bede9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec0064fad49b31cced97ee1","title":"Sustainability","doi":"10.3390/su","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","documentHash":"eb388892-6801-4141-aec4-18c5219948bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d79a7c4097074c7426a298","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"3","documentHash":"6c954aac-71e9-40e0-bf5c-5d5715319c74"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059347873"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b639fd409707143231df38","name":"Ali","lastName":"Mehmanparast","documentHash":"0426386a-d65c-4f92-ba2a-ea09e1c87cf3"},{"objectId":"65b639fd409707143231df37","name":"Filippo","lastName":"Berto","documentHash":"6d666108-206d-44a5-af42-f897f3b1ff14"},{"objectId":"65b639fd409707143231df36","name":"Supriyo","lastName":"Ganguly","documentHash":"bb20e384-5ba6-4528-8b1c-264f1bd22794"},{"objectId":"65b639fd409707143231df35","name":"Anna","lastName":"Paradowska","documentHash":"918a70b1-26f2-45b4-9574-933817489a1c"},{"objectId":"65b639fd409707143231df34","name":"Mark","lastName":"Reid","documentHash":"c01ae1f8-09cf-4139-8662-bfe3901ab1de"},{"objectId":"65b639fd409707143231df33","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Cabeza","documentHash":"13471526-9d03-49fe-b142-07456bd42e86"},{"objectId":"65b639fd409707143231df32","name":"Nima","lastName":"Razavi","documentHash":"206ea518-9250-45d0-977f-1e16bee90933"},{"objectId":"65b639fd409707143231df31","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ermakova","documentHash":"40cd6168-15fc-4884-9d89-7f25847712e1"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b58e3","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Gadalińska","uuid":"DAA4075E09B0671356F31659998C401D8DE59D485064C002E6F6C86697D5061E382C3F2C723CE12992B1A30187F87DA343DFC1C4F429D52C394E67182438C4B6","documentHash":"e72ead5d-9fde-449b-89d8-31ef691569ec"}],"objectId":"65b639fd409707143231df30","doi":"10.1016/j.jmrt.2023.03.227","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2238785423006907?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The effect of surface treatment and orientation on fatigue crack growth rate and residual stress distribution of wire arc additively manufactured low carbon steel components","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The directed energy deposition (DED) processes, such as laser metal deposition or Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM), are gradually becoming the preferred method for fabrication of large-scale components using metal additive manufacturing (AM) technology.

A series of fatigue crack propagation tests were performed on surface treated ER70S-6 and ER100S-1 WAAM built specimens, and the results were analysed and compared with the untreated materials tested under the same loading conditions. The obtained results were interpreted in terms of the sensitivity of the cracking behaviour to the specimen orientation and extraction location. Furthermore, the residual stress profiles were measured, before and after applying the surface treatment techniques, and the effects of locked-in residual stresses on the fatigue performance of WAAM built components were discussed. Finally, a detailed texture analysis was performed on the surface treated and untreated regions of both WAAM built materials considered in this work. The obtained results from this study provide an insight into the advantages and disadvantages of various surface treatment techniques for fatigue life enhancement of WAAM built components with the view to extend the application of this advanced manufacturing technology to a wider range of industrial applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b58e3"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"2988-3004","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b639fd409707143231df31","65b639fd409707143231df32","65b639fd409707143231df33","65b639fd409707143231df34","65b639fd409707143231df35","65b639fd409707143231df36","65b639fd409707143231df37","65b639fd409707143231df38","5e70940f878c28a0473b58e3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c92c","mniswId":"11761","title":"Journal of Materials Research and Technology","issn":"2238-7854","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-materials-research-and-technology/","documentHash":"ee2084b0-2233-4898-9058-862198e9f51c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642be7f74097075f213fe005","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"24","documentHash":"e2bed854-c9f7-4dfb-adad-34cb6b5eaaa4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059347888"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b63a67409707143231e4d7","name":"Luca","lastName":"Iuliano","documentHash":"322bc7f8-0168-40dc-847e-e49ca733e9c3"},{"objectId":"65b63a67409707143231e4d6","name":"Abdollah","lastName":"Saboori","documentHash":"a07923a5-8ecc-4812-ae20-168560b542e0"},{"objectId":"65b63a67409707143231e4d5","name":"Sara","lastName":"Bagherifard","documentHash":"767bcb8d-40f5-4321-9ed4-b4be64b3c3f6"},{"objectId":"65b63a67409707143231e4d4","name":"Erika","lastName":"Lannunziata","documentHash":"6715c2e6-e4ab-4f8d-9ae6-0c365220e8b9"},{"objectId":"65b63a67409707143231e4d3","name":"Aboozar","lastName":"Taherizadeh","documentHash":"abb0fc09-abe7-4949-be43-fe77df7b379d"},{"objectId":"65b63a67409707143231e4d2","name":"Morteza","lastName":"Shamanian","documentHash":"05e0208f-cc52-4087-8d6d-30440d04c411"},{"objectId":"65b63a67409707143231e4d1","name":"Amir","lastName":"Behjat","documentHash":"c67c13cd-935a-4087-a569-438f7bb37e5c"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b58e3","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Gadalińska","uuid":"DAA4075E09B0671356F31659998C401D8DE59D485064C002E6F6C86697D5061E382C3F2C723CE12992B1A30187F87DA343DFC1C4F429D52C394E67182438C4B6","documentHash":"e72ead5d-9fde-449b-89d8-31ef691569ec"}],"objectId":"65b63a67409707143231e4cf","doi":"10.1016/j.jmrt.2023.01.229","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2238785423002314?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Microstructure-electrochemical behavior relationship in post processed AISI316L stainless steel parts fabricated by laser powder bed fusion","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"AISI316L stainless steel components produced via additive manufacturing techniques have quickly found new applications across several industrial sectors. However, parts manufactured through this method generally exhibit poor surface quality and performance in the as-built state. This work addresses the influence of laser polishing and water jet assisted recirculating shot peening on the surface quality, microstructure and electrochemical properties of AISI316L samples produced by the laser powder bed fusion method. To do so, surface roughness analysis, residual stress measurement, scanning electron microscope and electron backscatter diffraction analysis were employed along with electrochemical tests, including cyclic potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Mott-Schottky analysis. Laser polished samples exhibited a smooth surface with high tensile residual stress on the surface, which led to the reduction of pitting potential and formation of passive layers, including more crystal defects. Microscopical analysis evidenced that the higher density of lattice defects and local microstrain on the surface of the shot peened samples promoted surface hardness and induced compressive residual stress. Therfore, the shot peened samples exhibited a wider passive range in cyclic potentiodynamic polarization measurements, higher polarization resistance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, and less defective passive film in Mott-Schottky analysis. Moreover, it was calculated that the passive film thickness of the shot peened sample was slightly larger than the other samples. Low surface roughness, high crystal defect density, and compressive residual stresses enhanced the passive layer's resistance to defect transport, lowered the point defect concentration in the passive film, and improved the pitting resistance of the samples."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b58e3"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"3294-3311","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b63a67409707143231e4d1","65b63a67409707143231e4d2","65b63a67409707143231e4d3","65b63a67409707143231e4d4","65b63a67409707143231e4d5","65b63a67409707143231e4d6","65b63a67409707143231e4d7","5e70940f878c28a0473b58e3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c92c","mniswId":"11761","title":"Journal of Materials Research and Technology","issn":"2238-7854","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-materials-research-and-technology/","documentHash":"ee2084b0-2233-4898-9058-862198e9f51c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b63a67409707143231e4d0","year":"2023","volume":"23","documentHash":"d6fd2f70-08f1-418d-81ca-d68f5ee2d6f8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059348148"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64f84f354097076d885bd224","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kubiak","documentHash":"8d523f46-5e4b-4ad3-bd73-cd2c96507bb1"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739970a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szcześniak","uuid":"1C4326AA48992ECD6301B620C7D4CA165D3759A0393A5B02D131C80B25335B80AFA1EB304295F805567A3477E54298A4D9BB34F36705EC64EDC1389A34E17034","orcidId":"0000-0002-3936-9847","documentHash":"0c06bc13-586b-49aa-860b-00fdec6f8d17"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399707","name":"Adam","lastName":"Stolarski","uuid":"4783FEE0AE982D2A3CA735CAEC6A69AAAEAB4AAB1A373E2ABD171C27105185E49B510099032957A26140AD103C1B94FD46DCEBACA194B150E5A6F3EB6FA44B0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4754-3067","documentHash":"7f93e5c1-61d9-406a-bb5f-f8820431a632"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399704","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Siwiński","uuid":"8DD2A9E90407D26FAEC91C0EECC6C7E398EF58BD118B1C39090DFC540929A5E4E429C0687828C93DB963A767C67B7B0DADF46B905B0084505B7B02C817D04CD2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4805-166X","documentHash":"41ccdf39-8e54-4d7a-9ee7-76171440f687"}],"objectId":"64f84f354097076d885bd223","doi":"10.3390/ma16145056","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/14/5056/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Experimental Calibration of a Homogeneous Substitute Material Model for Reinforced High-Performance Concrete Modeling","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of this work was to develop a substitute material model for the analysis of reinforced concrete structures. This paper presents proposals to solve the problem of limited calculation time, both to perform simulation models and to perform effective numerical or analytical analyses of structural elements in order to achieve results consistent with experimental results. Achieving this aim is conditional upon the determination of the material model parameters, taking into account the type of structure, the system of reinforcement, and the static strength–deformation parameters of the component materials. A universal procedure is proposed for determining the parameters of the substitute material model on the basis of the homogenization function, in which the homogenization coefficient is assumed as being equal to the effective reinforcement ratio of real reinforced concrete structural elements. In addition, the introduction of a new concrete constraint coefficient to this procedure, which corresponds to the proportionality coefficient of biaxial to uniaxial compressive strength, is proposed. On the basis of the conducted comparative analyses, the possibility of using the hypothetical substitute material model for the design of building elements and structures was confirmed. The average values of the obtained results for individual research series did not differ from the experimental results by more than 8.5%, for both the numerical and analytical models"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e4","uid":"bkbp2VYA4xopaIA4HrQlzTQ","uuid":"21621076-b7f2-4bc3-a5a5-e684c8630041","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Lądowej i Geodezji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a047399707","5e70929f878c28a047399704","5e70929f878c28a04739970a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["64f84f354097076d885bd224"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"5056","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929f878c28a047399704","5e70929f878c28a04739970a","64f84f354097076d885bd224","5e70929f878c28a047399707"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d41af5b0-6841-4344-89c1-f17a3ca3fcd6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64b10a234097071386f3f97d","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"14","documentHash":"df1ea5f8-8a13-4984-b576-ab1bd4e9e75d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060150837"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63de67e04097070c2f2fb9d7","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wolański","documentHash":"b49a2221-37e3-4b6c-9516-69b2ad2f320f"},{"objectId":"63de67e04097070c2f2fb9d6","name":"Adam","lastName":"Bilar","documentHash":"8dd5ea91-6c52-49a9-9c05-546ddce8678a"},{"objectId":"63de67e04097070c2f2fb9d5","name":"Borys","lastName":"Łukasik","documentHash":"8a7b0f81-c01b-4eed-8030-b67d2410f08b"},{"objectId":"63de67e04097070c2f2fb9d4","name":"Witold","lastName":"Perkowski","documentHash":"07deb5ec-6cee-459f-a999-1af4233a9a0e"},{"objectId":"63de67e04097070c2f2fb9d3","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kawalec","documentHash":"3161778d-4c01-421b-9274-1d4f73693c21"}],"objectId":"63de67e04097070c2f2fb9d2","doi":"10.19206/ce-145409","publicUri":"http://www.combustion-engines.eu/pdf-145409-71293","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Applications of the continuously rotating detonation to combustion engines at the Łukasiewicz - Institute of Aviation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the paper short information about advantages of introduction of detonation combustion to propulsion systems is briefly discussed and then research conducted at the Łukasiewicz-Institute of Aviation on development of the rotating detonation engines (RDE) is presented.

Three rocket model configurations were investigated.\n\nFindings\nThe results of the presented studies showed that the presence of boosters causes a significant increase in the total rocket drag, which depends on both the Mach number and the rocket flight phase. Experimental tests of the rocket model allowed to determine the difference in drag coefficient between active and passive flight versus Mach number. It was found that, in the case of a deviation from the rocket’s flight direction, the aerodynamic coefficients strongly depend on the location of the boosters in relation to the direction of the deviation.\n\nPractical implications\nStudies of the rocket model aerodynamic characteristics allow the assessment of the influence of parallel boosters on rocket performance, which is important when the decision of a rocket staging type is taken.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe presented wind tunnel test results of the rocket model equipped with the two parallel boosters are an original contribution to the rocket research results presented in the literature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092bc878c28a04739bc39","65b3a865409707713dffe3b7","5e709410878c28a0473b5a28","5e709410878c28a0473b5ad7"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"95","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"193-200","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b3a865409707713dffe3b7","5e709410878c28a0473b5ad7","5e7092bc878c28a04739bc39","5e709410878c28a0473b5a28"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f3b","mniswId":"730","title":"AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY","issn":"1748-8842","eissn":"1758-4213","documentHash":"96f4141f-9e3a-4f90-ad1d-002fb4b4c769"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b3a865409707713dffe3b6","year":"2022","volume":"95","number":"2","documentHash":"883d0686-cc57-4d8e-90ed-80027fc8c047"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654916836"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b3a95e409707713dfff72f","name":"Marta","lastName":"Tojal Castro","documentHash":"2f1ded50-cd20-4680-b13a-d4432f4abf70"},{"objectId":"65b3a95e409707713dfff72e","name":"Jens T.","lastName":"Ten Thije","documentHash":"082d0fe9-10d2-444c-9c0c-52e56fe2c519"},{"objectId":"65b3a95e409707713dfff72d","name":"Anna Dorota","lastName":"Stanczyk","documentHash":"4409b655-6c17-4850-9254-2e605c39e756"},{"objectId":"65b3a95e409707713dfff72c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ginter","documentHash":"0e06f2eb-41f2-4201-9ae9-fccf54f85902"},{"objectId":"5e709485878c28a0473bede9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"CDB53D2CCB773C300542089601E9599DF915AAC4F431FD74835977CC1CC2821BDE6CCBB75896F9A8BCF8149624F3B6CC420EEE440EE591C88AE3BCD8FC972078","documentHash":"39c363d9-e1b7-4444-893c-d22bd38a2aaa"},{"objectId":"5e709482878c28a0473beb65","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Dziugieł","uuid":"9B1B6F8DAF8B5E841D4F99974A87B749B593C5B80B1A0EAEC892793E081EB57EED0C23DDA4DEF59E88424E83B6FF57C82423A180BB1860E20337893093CF318F","documentHash":"6ca0f119-e2e4-4b87-aec3-63c959e05d19"},{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b7873","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Woroniecka","documentHash":"314dd875-3c2e-42b1-bf36-c83ef56416fb"},{"objectId":"5e709340878c28a0473a5ab9","name":"Adam","lastName":"Liberacki","uuid":"C294EA11CB9A7B416E9AC1C263D53F8D62B3B8E589303611FE60F015FAD9A3880CED1F5A312334BD0C83907324B1ECEB3C694F3CB1880CA3AE05A673CBC52C48","documentHash":"da6adffd-df24-43bd-82cd-274fae9a06a5"}],"objectId":"65b3a95e409707713dfff72b","doi":"10.1108/aeat-10-2022-0273","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/AEAT-10-2022-0273/full/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Key factors in reducing cost of UAM implementation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\nThe purpose of the paper is the identification of the main factors affecting the cost of urban air mobility (UAM) based on results of ASSURED-UAM project.

Thus, an airborne-launcher-to-space-system may be attractive to countries without ground-based space rocket launch sites.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nFor considered launch-to-orbit system configurations, simulations of space rocket effects on aerodynamic characteristics were performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD ANSYS Fluent) methods. In addition, experimental studies were performed in a wind tunnel to verify the numerical simulations. Discrete models of the aircraft structure were developed for analysis using finite element method (FEM). The analysis of simulated structural properties of the models was carried out to test its stiffness and mass characteristics important for solving the static and dynamic problems of the structure. The validation analyses of aircraft models were based on mass distribution estimation and matching the stiffness properties of the individual airframe structural assemblies.\n\nFindings\nThe results of numerical analyses and tunnel tests indicate that the influence of carrier rockets on the change of aerodynamic and strength characteristics of the airframe is rather negligible. The aircraft can be used as launching platforms for space rockets. Simulations have indicated that the aircraft will successfully perform a mission of taking away and launching a rocket of at least about 1,000 kg total weight with a 10 kg space payload included.\n\nPractical implications\nThe combat aircraft can be used as launch platforms for space rockets, and the air/rocket set can become the equivalent of responsive space assets for countries with small space budgets.\n\nOriginality/value\nThe work presents original results obtained by the authors during a preliminary design of a low-cost satellite launch system consisting of a carrier aircraft and a space rocket orbiter. The possibility of using decommissioned combat aircraft as air-launch-to-orbit platforms was taken into consideration. In the absence of aircraft design documentation, reverse engineering methods and techniques were used to develop aircraft geometry and airframe strength structure. Use of CFD, FEM and simulation methods to evaluate system capabilities was demonstrated. Numerical results from CFD simulations were finally verified in experimental tests."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","uid":"bzB5aUdq6Blrs0aqLRRPKlA","uuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091f8878c28a04738def9","5e709443878c28a0473b92ba"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","parentUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856fc","rootUuid":"51edc81e-fdc2-4fa8-8dee-6e2b9177c1af","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"95","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"629-636","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f8878c28a04738def9","5e709443878c28a0473b92ba"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f3b","mniswId":"730","title":"AIRCRAFT ENGINEERING AND AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY","issn":"1748-8842","eissn":"1758-4213","documentHash":"96f4141f-9e3a-4f90-ad1d-002fb4b4c769"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b3aee7409707713d017ab8","year":"2023","documentHash":"de15e14f-0c86-49e0-a7bb-c70ebea9aa85"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654930125"}]
