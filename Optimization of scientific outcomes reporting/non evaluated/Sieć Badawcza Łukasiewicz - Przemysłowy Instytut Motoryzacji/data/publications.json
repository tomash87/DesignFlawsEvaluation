In many publications dealing with such devices, the increasing of RUPD stiffness by applying innovative design solutions or using high-strength materials has been considered; in some designs, additional RUPD components are introduced to absorb the impact energy. In this paper, a review of the RUPD designs is presented and some of them are analyzed, where their characteristics that are essential for the compliance with normative market requirements are indicated. Results of the authors’ research on the selection of an energy absorber incorporated in the rear impact guard bar of an HGV are presented as well."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","uid":"bE7I8l3CfAzl8w-7AJ0IrTw","uuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Przemysłowy Instytut Motoryzacji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a4878c28a0473ae467","5e709270878c28a047395b91"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","parentUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","rootUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b5878c28a047385c19","uid":"bzPZmmp8S2zN3FIBGmhP2-A","uuid":"2f4b58f0-ff22-4767-bf70-4a4950ffa081","name":"Instytut Pojazdów i Transportu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709270878c28a047395b91","5e70929e878c28a047399496"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1-23","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709270878c28a047395b91","5e70929e878c28a047399496","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae467"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["vehicle passive safety; road traffic crash analysis; crashworthiness"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138983"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b58d5","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Owczuk","uuid":"30862B8D6F3AA414EC34A02020AA550FEF8A9FCA096789E8B52D0D17856A901DD83A557F6E533E1DCF6A5CFA6EC427D893DA53F497940B63DDEB925624DC5288","orcidId":"0000-0001-9024-2537","documentHash":"3e313ae5-34a0-4129-ad06-3ae1c91227b9"},{"objectId":"5e7093b3878c28a0473af6d1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Matuszewska","uuid":"86BEE2CCCE89366DDC8CA7634759D83C5E645592C591E39C73A28C799971522D4BFA619E61BE21661AA1922208D06E415B27A7C17D5D18D3FFA14D075D8D0CB8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7853-7401","documentHash":"03667505-60fb-4271-8170-6d70a976d117"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739afc6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Biernat","uuid":"9437D059500F31758DDC948AFA22C9090A7DC368939B53FFE0AD0AB2F7F95901116557D6A2A2F01C58718E1182C2DD4577F27F604EEF2E56169EE48F58F1628B","documentHash":"c39b6de7-42ae-4a70-b6cc-79bbe7cc5b6f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6278f11e4097077547e9ba1d","doi":"10.3390/en15082719","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/8/2719/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Current Trends in Waste Plastics’ Liquefaction into Fuel Fraction: A Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Polymers and plastics are crucial materials in many sectors of our economy, due to their numerous advantages. They also have some disadvantages, among the most important are problems with the recycling and disposal of used plastics. The recovery of waste plastics is increasing every year, but over 27% of plastics are landfilled. The rest is recycled, where, unfortunately, incineration is still the most common management method. From an economic perspective, waste management methods that lead to added-value products are most preferred—as in the case of material and chemical recycling. Since chemical recycling can be used for difficult wastes (poorly selected, contaminated), it seems to be the most effective way of managing these materials. Moreover, as a result this of kind of recycling, it is possible to obtain commercially valuable products, such as fractions for fuel composition and monomers for the reproduction of polymers. This review focuses on various liquefaction technologies as a prospective recycling method for three types of plastic waste: PE, PP and PS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","uid":"bE7I8l3CfAzl8w-7AJ0IrTw","uuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Przemysłowy Instytut Motoryzacji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b3878c28a04739afc6","5e7093b3878c28a0473af6d1","5e70940f878c28a0473b58d5"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","parentUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","rootUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2719","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b3878c28a0473af6d1","5e70940f878c28a0473b58d5","5e7092b3878c28a04739afc6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","issn":"1996-1073","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6253e8d62467f02e69a1ed72","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"8","documentHash":"fefc1c04-33d9-4512-9038-a476e44034d9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["plastic waste","liquefaction","fuels","quality standards"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058155722"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473beae2","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Jemioł","uuid":"FFD07F0014A62E5009759938A536219DF8E0049C34CBD1ADDCE3C8618BE0C8E98D1822E00D0F6379FF48D353A09B9629990C9CC7789430C62AC8E2679D0B6237","orcidId":"0000-0001-8898-4937","documentHash":"87ea5126-1b5c-459e-875f-99d86684a8d2"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739947d","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Żardecki","uuid":"113892450FA37DA60952C71A3864EF89CA7F43CA7956FB77C2E013E35B18866CE4567454E79302786E2C5B2A0BCDD97C41BA0E939386817DDC57D70425B2F8CA","orcidId":"0000-0002-3934-2150","documentHash":"50d8a85f-eab2-4834-ae88-1354eaa5817f"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395b91","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Gidlewski","uuid":"AD39BF7EEB75E950BB82EAC0C2DCF156E966F8F8545EA9AF510EA3B8C05D6C86CAFA302B09E55840BA4FCC1C1EA3CE5D918A8C2C62CA580C990E1AD77CC1EC2F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5775-184X","documentHash":"b0dfdc92-187c-4fb3-8a4b-ac856ab175be"}],"objectId":"6315e30240970717dcf92524","doi":"10.1088/1757-899x/1247/1/012030","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Simulation tests of the integrated lane change control system","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\r\n               <jats:p>This paper presents the concept of an integrated control system for lane change by a two-axle truck.

The measurements were carried out during crash tests involving a frontal-side collision of two cars or a motorcycle with a car. The results has been shown in the time interval 0-0.5 s. During this period, the following phases of the experiment are observed: vehicle collision and the process of their deformation, the separation of vehicles, the start of independent movement of both vehicles after the collision.

It is a phase that requires a lot of modelling and experimental research. Experimental research into these vehicles is in its initial state. There is a lack of findings and standardized recommendations for the organization and creation of research scenarios. There are also many difficulties in creating research scenarios. The main difficulties are the large number of systems for simultaneous checking. Additionally, the vehicles have a very complicated structure. A review of current publications allowed for systematization of the research scenarios of vehicles and their components as well as the measurement systems used. These include perception systems, automated response to threats, and critical situations in the area of road safety. The scenarios analyzed ensure that the planned research tasks can be carried out, including the investigation of systems that enable autonomous driving. This study uses passenger cars equipped with highly sophisticated sensor systems and localization devices. Perception systems are the necessary equipment during the conducted study. They provide recognition of the environment, mainly through vision sensors (cameras) and lidars. The research tasks include autonomous driving along a detected road lane on a curvilinear track. The effective maintenance of the vehicle in this lane is assessed. The location used in the study is a set of specialized research tracks on which stationary or moving obstacles are often placed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b5878c28a047385c19","uid":"bzPZmmp8S2zN3FIBGmhP2-A","uuid":"2f4b58f0-ff22-4767-bf70-4a4950ffa081","name":"Instytut Pojazdów i Transportu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387","5e70929e878c28a047399475","5ebed4d1752340254fc3ffe4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","uid":"bE7I8l3CfAzl8w-7AJ0IrTw","uuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Przemysłowy Instytut Motoryzacji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a047399475","5ebed4d1752340254fc3ffe4"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","parentUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","rootUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-27","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a047399475","5ebed4d1752340254fc3ffe4","5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["research and test scenarios; specialized test tracks; proving grounds; automated and autonomous vehicles; experimental research; ADAS; perception sensors; lidars; cameras; radars"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058240313"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebed4d1752340254fc3ffe4","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Szwajkowski","uuid":"2530A3A1266A35B7FA7BD4A8C8BE5686DE9B12FF675F9FF8D7A2DEC1AFCFBC6FFD024139F20E66F113A76A66FB9F6E3BCFD37F6942FF6FBD983E8A8D2808A32E","documentHash":"1a099941-3d4d-484e-821e-387f2a1f6934"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Ziubiński","uuid":"C02A2740D627BC1D18FEA40A7095B108D426736554B9E8C358A5B9EC008A40E7204A29447B05285123D2B0C865C55AF5CB07A339C6E143591B42252174826D42","orcidId":"0000-0003-4955-2095","documentHash":"124fa2bd-f37f-493b-9a39-baefd9beca51"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399475","name":"Leon","lastName":"Prochowski","uuid":"09B98E82D7C14513EA8D71310B50D7F13B25A7DBBBF0FEF8C0CA25943A212E357765A00EF1842E4FB3D991EDA4E41F8643887287EDEECA059E06BD2669B095C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2093-1585","documentHash":"ee252622-f322-4769-a652-d7b0264d5a80"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395b8e","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"DZIEWIECKI","uuid":"697532757BA01F607F370C965160D850CF6802C869CC75EC59846705A2987D1FB85900D10107BA05A7B330352013AD6A549EC10DCE5DD58B7C7B03E76A7CEA63","orcidId":"0000-0003-4734-6378","documentHash":"93f98bb2-4efb-48ed-b536-4051fb488c51"}],"objectId":"63329f35409707247a175860","doi":"10.1007/s11071-022-07779-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-022-07779-8","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Impact energy and the risk of injury to motorcar occupants in the front-to-side vehicle collision","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The effects of a road accident where one vehicle hits its front on the side of another one are explored. In such cases, the impacted vehicle’s side is usually significantly deformed, which causes a risk of serious injury to vehicle occupants. An analysis of the front-to-side collision covers many nonlinear and highly complex processes, especially when it is based on the collision energy balance. For the analysis, a model of a front-to-side motorcar collision and a dummy representing the impacted vehicle’s driver was prepared. The model simulations carried out were supplemented with important experimental test results. The model validation and the drawing of conclusions from research results were based on crash test results. The shares of major components in the front-to-side collision energy balance were determined. The impact energy has been proposed as an alternative predicate of the road accident effects; as a measure of the effects, the risk of injury to vehicle occupant’s head and torso is considered. The model simulations were found to be in good conformity with experimental test results. The research results enabled determining the relation between the side impact energy and the risk of dummy’s head and torso injuries according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale. The relation obtained was approximated using the logit model. This relation helps to reconstruct road accidents and to improve the car side’s passive safety systems. A discussion of the results obtained has shown good consistence between the results of this work and other comparable research results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b5878c28a047385c19","uid":"bzPZmmp8S2zN3FIBGmhP2-A","uuid":"2f4b58f0-ff22-4767-bf70-4a4950ffa081","name":"Instytut Pojazdów i Transportu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387","5e70929e878c28a047399475"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","uid":"bE7I8l3CfAzl8w-7AJ0IrTw","uuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Przemysłowy Instytut Motoryzacji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a047399475","5ebed4d1752340254fc3ffe4"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","parentUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","rootUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"249","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a047399475","5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387","5e709270878c28a047395b8e","5ebed4d1752340254fc3ffe4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547904e","mniswId":"15122","title":"Nonlinear Dynamics","doi":"","issn":"0924-090X","eissn":"1573-269X","websiteLink":"http://link.springer.com/journal/11071","documentHash":"2b83eeac-5ec9-4ee8-83aa-185664ef296f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Front to side collision; Modelling of motorcar collisions; Collision energy balance; Injury risk; Abbreviated injury scale (AIS)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058243239"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebed6d8752340254fc4089d","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"BD6960DBD18A08169C6E312435B759E880B177C04D9CE35698916C156FBCC82725A93C1070A9E6546B70097E9283F40D3A31A97296811F4FC84589399DEAD6BB","orcidId":"0000-0003-3477-9676","documentHash":"5951570a-cf5e-4760-ba62-3271c1c0e9e5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63c9441d4097074220cc964a","doi":"10.34752/2022-n280","publicUri":"http://wiedzaobronna.edu.pl/index.php/wo/article/view/182/169","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Unmanned Land Vehicles - Directions of Research and Development","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The  article  presents  the  historical  background  and  development  of  unmanned  land  platforms  in selected countries, including Russia, Germany, the US and Poland.

The paper presents the general concept as well as an example of the procedure. It covers determining the spectrum and time-domain realization of a load on a selected node of the vehicle structure under durability tests. The author used both the mathematical and physical model of the tractor-semitrailer unit, where the input was considered as a random process resulting from the road profile. He calculated the transmittance modules and the power spectral densities of the vertical force on the joint between the tractor’s fifth wheel and the kingpin of the semitrailer and the extreme values of the dynamic components of this force. The inverse discrete Fourier transform makes it possible to generate the realization of the said force. It can be used in durability studies. The limitation of the work to the testing of a specific structural node reduces the scope and, in consequence, the cost of the process. The method presented may also be used for various types of vehicle models, including hybrid and electric vehicles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","uid":"bE7I8l3CfAzl8w-7AJ0IrTw","uuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Przemysłowy Instytut Motoryzacji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fc878c28a0473a074d"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","parentUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","rootUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"9398","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092fc878c28a0473a074d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6396de06409707231272458f","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"24","documentHash":"ded6a837-c734-4996-a6be-874f26418052"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058449657"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a17","name":"Karol","lastName":"Zielonka","uuid":"643B156365B3669F26C8D2FC40C2B1FC59BD43592CFD63767EDEB53693E26A902E0352C8CDB1DF79A2B105689E7CAD26D5E4501BB932DD13D9BA34B9820D457C","orcidId":"0000-0003-4854-8940","documentHash":"5ff8face-bb2f-443d-a3f0-87e732318a75"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae467","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Posuniak","uuid":"0CA40E1AE2F7143DA3B9037289EF2DDB0AD996425696AE9CEEACF2DC72809256117229553E1A06CDF875F5A916E00BFA000446A20C391439500E6622379C0B39","orcidId":"0000-0002-6208-6204","documentHash":"bd30b960-3c5f-4a3c-ad7d-8c6052c87d32"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399496","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Jackowski","uuid":"657A1EEADF0D07CCF096ACB6ABB41E66BEE9A1F81C054E51B4392D43CEEF141A981EA67FAF38131EF4330CAE0FCE52E6362624C5910E492EA52B421CDFC9C7A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-5787-1451","documentHash":"8fcceafc-87a2-4611-9be3-781d2056f935"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394ae9","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jurecki","uuid":"CB52D03B369410C57F329E005514F4A94BC43959428B45315AC01EAE524292C0E06AC42CA965513AF7EE8DDCC787BC188E3E11F91A41A39071BE402C5224FA1E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0105-1283","documentHash":"b97d0db1-5e79-43e4-9539-e3ae10777384"}],"objectId":"63ff468a4097075fba73b619","doi":"10.3390/en16052183","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/5/2183/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Experimental Testing of Energy-Absorbing Structures Used to Enhance the Crashworthiness of the Vehicles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Selected structures intended to absorb impact energy have been analysed in respect of their use in the rear underrun protective devices (RUPD) of motor trucks. The main purpose of the RUPD is to prevent a passenger car from running under the rear of a motor truck provided with such a device. From the point of view of the safety of the car occupants, it is important to take into account the components whose additional role would be to absorb a part of the impact energy so that the loads on the said occupants were minimised. This article presents experimental test results concerning selected energy-absorbing structures. Based on quasi-static strength tests, simplified material models were defined. As a result of experimental crash tests, the possible applications of selected energy absorbers to the RUPDs as their components accountable for the passive safety of passenger cars were indicated. Absorbers proposed in this paper can be considered effective energy-absorbing structures, e.g., in the case of the central impact of a medium-class car with a speed of about 40 km/h. They are relatively inexpensive in production and easily implementable to motor trucks, even taking into account some limitations related to the type-approval regulations on the European market."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","uid":"bE7I8l3CfAzl8w-7AJ0IrTw","uuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz -

In the front-to-side collision, the hazards for he occupants of the struck vehicle results from the inertial loads they are subjected to together with the vehicle and from excessive deformation of the bodywork, often involving the space occupied by people. Action is needed to reduce this hazard. One of such actions is to increase the stiffness of the side part of the vehicle body in order to limit the range of its deformation. However, this is an activity that requires a compromise approach, because as stiffness increases, greater lateral forces on the struck vehicle will occur, which will result in inertial loads. The aim of the study is to assess the impact of changes in the stiffness of the side part of the bodywork on the course of the hazard emergence process during a front-to-side vehicles' collision. Model tests in the PC-Crash program have been prepared and implemented. Their results allowed to establish the relationship between the increased side-stiffness and the characteristic values of physical quantities, which are the measure of the hazard and its effects in a vehicles' collision."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b5878c28a047385c19","uid":"bzPZmmp8S2zN3FIBGmhP2-A","uuid":"2f4b58f0-ff22-4767-bf70-4a4950ffa081","name":"Instytut Pojazdów i Transportu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387","5e70929e878c28a047399475"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","uid":"bE7I8l3CfAzl8w-7AJ0IrTw","uuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Przemysłowy Instytut Motoryzacji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929e878c28a047399475"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","parentUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","rootUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1247","pagesFromTo":"1-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b3387","5e70929e878c28a047399475"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff624ad49b31ccec2de0b","title":"IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering","issn":"1757-899X","documentHash":"7e461f55-236e-4ebe-88a2-1695db03883b"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["front-to-side vehicles’ collision, motorcar bodywork stiffness, passive safety, hazards for occupants during vehicle lateral impact, vehicle movement"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654639888"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b41875409707221447220a","name":"Z","lastName":"Rożnowicz","documentHash":"b0ede6b4-7fbc-4d29-bc0e-c3192659c137"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae467","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Posuniak","uuid":"0CA40E1AE2F7143DA3B9037289EF2DDB0AD996425696AE9CEEACF2DC72809256117229553E1A06CDF875F5A916E00BFA000446A20C391439500E6622379C0B39","orcidId":"0000-0002-6208-6204","documentHash":"bd30b960-3c5f-4a3c-ad7d-8c6052c87d32"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399496","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Jackowski","uuid":"657A1EEADF0D07CCF096ACB6ABB41E66BEE9A1F81C054E51B4392D43CEEF141A981EA67FAF38131EF4330CAE0FCE52E6362624C5910E492EA52B421CDFC9C7A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-5787-1451","documentHash":"8fcceafc-87a2-4611-9be3-781d2056f935"}],"objectId":"63b418754097072214472209","doi":"10.1088/1757-899x/1247/1/012023","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1247/1/012023","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Experimental testing of selected energy absorbers in the context of their use in rear underrun protective devices","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The energy-absorbing structures have been being developed for many years by various research centres all over the world.

An innovative load balancing system for tandem axles, which limits the occurring overloads, is presented. A mathematical model is proposed to represent the suspension of a front “quarter” of\na four-axle vehicle provided with a novel system to equalise the loads on two closely spaced (tandem) axles. The “quarter” of the vehicle is described as a set of rigid bodies linked with each other by spring and damping elements. The model has three degrees of freedom and defines vehicle’s responses to excitations (inputs) generated by road irregularities. The mathematical models known from the literature describe typical suspension systems and specific types of load balancing systems for two- and three-axle vehicles. This makes it impossible to apply them directly to simulation test of a vehicle with two front axles. A new model dedicated to the proposed load equalizing system, which allows simulation tests for the design and verification of the new system's operation, has been prepared."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","uid":"bE7I8l3CfAzl8w-7AJ0IrTw","uuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Przemysłowy Instytut Motoryzacji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7a54","5e7092fc878c28a0473a0758"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","parentUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385736","rootUuid":"b28fd273-56d9-41d3-a620-30856c5f0b3c","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"1247","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"12019","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"6304a9fe40970739a76326f0","fullName":"The 13th International conference on Automotive Safety","shortName":"Automotive Safety 2022","website":"http://automotivesafetyconference.com/","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"0425a63e-e3ef-4264-86c4-dd4425d8aa24"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6304a9fe40970739a76326f1","startDate":"2022-04-26","endDate":"2022-04-29","fullName":"The 13th International conference on Automotive Safety","shortName":"Automotive Safety 2022","city":"Kaluza","country":"SK","website":"http://automotivesafetyconference.com/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"760f44c0-6a90-4375-b932-b08bbb3938ea"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942d878c28a0473b7a54","5e7092fc878c28a0473a0758"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00a07ad49b31ccedcc46a","title":"IOP Conference Series : Materials Science and Engineering","issn":"1757-8981","documentHash":"a4047b03-aad9-43a1-96cd-fb65fba5d2a6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ff7f5b40970761e76679f2","year":"2022","volume":"1247","number":"1","documentHash":"5acdc4fc-fc3f-424a-80a2-a821889afe48"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654752816"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092fc878c28a0473a074d","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"LOZIA","uuid":"27F4648FB7BFAD708BC2F86973B1BE8730AC5DA54390C947C9BF6CAFCE39EF67B7F799CDE18E58C22EF091D1BF69E7A2F8AF776FF921D88AB1992B1D6F7AB96C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3188-545X","documentHash":"42fd7418-15d8-4901-a7bc-97cd9cd31fb1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63c93a594097074220cb8651","doi":"10.1088/1757-899x/1247/1/012011","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/1247/1/012011","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The concept of the application of modelling and simulation to simplify and reduce the cost of durability tests of vehicles and their components","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper deals with durability tests of road vehicle components. They may be performed in a real work environment or in the laboratory. New or modified structures of vehicles and their components should and are tested in an accelerated manner in real or simulated conditions, corresponding to the anticipated conditions of use. The work presents the concept of using modelling and simulation to determine the inputs during the tests of the car's structural components (assemblies, subassemblies, and parts), without the need to test the entire vehicle. The author proposes the use of physical and mathematical models of vehicles to determine the excitations affecting the assembly, subassembly, or element of interest during the research tests of the entire vehicle. This approach reduces the dimensionality of the experimental research and\nlimits its scope to the structural node of interest, which in turn reduces the costs.
