However, the impact of summer break on body composition in athlete children has not been thoroughly investigated. The current study was aimed at identifying possible changes in body composition and respiratory muscle strength after an 8-week summer break in age-group swimmers. Eighteen girls and fifteen boys ages 10-13 years (mean 11.6±1.0) participated in the study. The  measurements  were taken in June and repeated in September the same year. Body composition was assessed with an  InBody  720  analyzer,  and  respiratory  muscle  strength  was  assessed  with  a  MicroRPM device. A fifty-meter front-crawl test was conducted to induce respiratory muscle fatigue. All analyzed body composition parameters; i.e., body mass, body mass index, tissue, and muscle components increased substantially after the summer break (p<0.05). No significant changes in  maximum  inspiratory  pressure  (MIP)  and  maximum  expiratory  pressure  (MEP)  were detected in both boys and girls after the detraining period (p>0.05). It can be concluded that 8-week summer break had an effect on body composition parameters in juvenile swimmers, but no  effect  on  their  respiratory  muscle  strength  was  apparent.  Studies  involving  a  greater number of participants engaged in various sports activities are needed to better understand the effect of summer break on anthropomorphic and respiratory parameters in youth athletes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.
