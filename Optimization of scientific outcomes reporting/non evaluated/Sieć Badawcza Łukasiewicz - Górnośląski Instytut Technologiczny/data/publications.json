However, the effects of the Si addition are not fully understood. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the Si content that is optimal for oxidation resistance. Therefore, pure Al and several Al-Si coatings with varying Si contents between 1 and 81 at.% were studied. The coatings were produced using a combinatorial magnetron sputtering process. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were used for structure and chemical analysis. The phases were identified by X-ray diffraction. Cyclic oxidation tests at 900 degrees C were conducted up to 5000 cycles of 1 h each and subsequently evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis. Si addition in the range of 1 to 12 at.% did not deteriorate the oxidation resistance compared to a pure Al coating up for 1000 cycles (1 h) of oxidation at 900 degrees C, while higher Si contents led to a high mass gain. For oxidation times up to 5000 cycles (1 h), a sufficient thickness of the coatings is crucial for good oxidation resistance. The main effect of Si addition is to enhance the transformation speed of the deposited Al and Si to the high temperature stable Ti(Al,Si)(3) phase during the heat treatment. Si additions of up to 12 at.% led to increased initial mass gains and a decrease in the oxidation rates during subsequent exposures compared to pure Al coatings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee7","uid":"bR13GLTFVd1JUSfFen3OzVA","uuid":"2cd707c9-2ecf-40e0-868b-1af1db59c602","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Górnośląski Instytut Technologiczny","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62f3628f409707058d1a9bc8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee7","parentUuid":"2cd707c9-2ecf-40e0-868b-1af1db59c602","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee7","rootUuid":"2cd707c9-2ecf-40e0-868b-1af1db59c602","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"859","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62f3628f409707058d1a9bc6","62f3628f409707058d1a9bc7","62f3628f409707058d1a9bc8","62f3628f409707058d1a9bc9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bd6e","mniswId":"3957","title":"Coatings","issn":"2079-6412","eissn":"2079-6412","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"4e0160b7-f155-4bb5-939e-e216d63ebd2d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f3628f409707058d1a9bc5","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"6","documentHash":"546c5475-e10d-48f7-8986-3071e81dfdb8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["combinatorial PVD magnetron sputtering","Al-Si coatings","oxidation resistance","gamma-TiAl alloys","thermogravimetric analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058214706"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4e0e","name":"Adam","lastName":"ZIELIŃSKI","uuid":"DDA3E54207D743BFC101D0AEBF4C42F7B844B6D699AFCF569B222FFDA6D2688C395178408D966E9B7D7D24E23A9145F5B91872497798ABF22B828C40EA69B0E6","orcidId":"0000-0003-1205-5482","documentHash":"fecc960e-bb0d-4926-953b-9c75d047bdce"},{"objectId":"5e7093df878c28a0473b25b3","name":"Milena","lastName":"Kierat","uuid":"FDB86E5DB179B9BF65453E17389379A6E3B1943328E0F0EBC6BBB706A59B17070A450B405FD3C8F12F511B7ED60950564EA4687F051BEE64077B2907C2E6DCB4","orcidId":"0000-0002-6288-197X","documentHash":"2c7c86fc-595e-4245-9d5f-62dba23212b1"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aaec4","name":"Tymoteusz","lastName":"Jung","uuid":"0A2DAC581D30F66F7370C7574EDDB59E7F8EC147F59782951CAEFC7C7847FF9611E4ADE0D00289D0D0258F2997A22F626C0CE8F3C14C5E55A082E3CBC2834DD7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1219-0329","documentHash":"7e200a21-ed40-4d02-9be4-4bb34403c78a"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Moskal","uuid":"78C02F7E257C44906FFD96A25B79CE805A883E092168DBB1C916E8C0421591B7D21DBAE421486318FE761EBD6790F1978B94EB690598741EF5087FF8B957C5EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7396-6568","documentHash":"30f43abd-3ddb-475b-bab8-a2f62e94c049"}],"objectId":"62f37be1409707058d1bfc20","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/137782/edition/123272/content","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"INFLUENCE OF ALLOYING ELEMENTS ON THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND SELECTED HIGH-TEMPERATURE PROPERTIES OF NEW COBALT-BASED L12-REINFORCED SUPERALLOYS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"the study investigated the primary structure of the new generation of superalloys based on Co-10al-5Mo-2nb and Co-20ni-\n10al-5Mo-2nb cobalt. research on a group of cobalt-based materials was initiated in 2006 by J. sato [1]. these materials may\nreplace nickel-based superalloys in the future due to their excellent properties at elevated temperatures relative to nickel-based superalloys. the primary microstructure characterisation of the Co-10al-5Mo-2nb and Co-20ni-10al-5Mo-2nb alloy are the basic subject of this article. the Co-10al-5Mo-2nb and Co-20ni-10al-5Mo-2nb alloy are tungsten free alloys of a new type with the final microstructure based on the Co-based solid solution l1 2 phase of the Co 3(al,Mo,nb) type as a strengthened structural element. the analysed alloys were investigated in an as-cast state after a vacuum casting process applied on graphite moulds. the primary microstructure of the alloys and the chemical constituent of dendritic and interdendritic areas were analysed using light, scanning electron and transmission microscopy.

A special simulation procedure was applied for the DD reaction to predict a jerky motion of the RF. The Fe-13.5 at.% Zn alloy was selected in which go- and -stop behaviour was revealed in the form of characteristic lines (called \"ghost lines\") showing successive positions of receding RF. The results presented for the DD process are quite different from those relevant for the DP reaction at the same Fe-13.5 at.% Zn alloy in terms of go- and -stop motion and movement distance. For the presented case, the go- and -stop periods are relatively long and obtain an order of several dozen seconds, while for the DP reaction, it was only a few seconds. A similar conclusion was formulated after a comparison of the movement distance which, for the DD reaction, is usually longer by 1-2 orders of magnitude. The simulation results of the DD reaction indicate a good agreement with the experimental data presented in the literature for the same dissolution rate. It is necessary to emphasize that the simulation is the only source of data for z parameter changes during the -stop period of the DD reaction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee7","uid":"bR13GLTFVd1JUSfFen3OzVA","uuid":"2cd707c9-2ecf-40e0-868b-1af1db59c602","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Górnośląski Instytut Technologiczny","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62f364e7409707058d1b23b2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee7","parentUuid":"2cd707c9-2ecf-40e0-868b-1af1db59c602","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee7","rootUuid":"2cd707c9-2ecf-40e0-868b-1af1db59c602","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","uid":"bFdp5gORDGmB2AOTB2xubqg","uuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","name":"Instytut Metalurgii i Inżynierii Materiałowej im.

During cyclic oxidation at 900 °C for 1000 1 h cycles, the coating system with a Ti5Si3 interlayer maintained the Al-rich phases of TiAl3 and TiAl2 in the Al-Ti top layer around 5–10 times longer compared to a coating without intermediate barrier layer. Moreover, the substrate alloying elements (Nb and Cr) are suggested to have a noticeably positive impact on the reduced Al diffusion due to segregations at the grain boundaries in the Ti5Si3 interlayer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee7","uid":"bR13GLTFVd1JUSfFen3OzVA","uuid":"2cd707c9-2ecf-40e0-868b-1af1db59c602","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Górnośląski Instytut Technologiczny","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62f363cd409707058d1af4fe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee7","parentUuid":"2cd707c9-2ecf-40e0-868b-1af1db59c602","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee7","rootUuid":"2cd707c9-2ecf-40e0-868b-1af1db59c602","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"201","pagesFromTo":"110265","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62f363cd409707058d1af4fd","62f363cd409707058d1af4fe","62f363cd409707058d1af4ff","62f363cd409707058d1af500"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477808","mniswId":"4439","title":"CORROSION SCIENCE","issn":"0010-938X","eissn":"1879-0496","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ee03e26d-21d5-4814-9d57-f4432e792304"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f363cd409707058d1af4fc","year":"2022","volume":"201","documentHash":"fc65a6d8-40e3-4f5e-be4a-90c99ee18f52"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ti5Si3 interlayer","Al diffusion","Diffusion barrier","γ-TiAl alloys","Oxidation protective Al-Ti coating","Mass gain analysis","Magnetron sputtering"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058328346"}]
