The aim of the study was to present the effect of lipoic acid (LA) on oxidative stress induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\nMaterials/Methods. The studies were conducted on male rats of the Wistar strain. The animals were divided into four groups. I: the controls received saline (0.2 ml); II: LPS,\nreceived LPS (Escherichia coli 026: B6) at a dose of 6 mg/kg body weight; III: LA, received LA at a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight; IV: LA + LPS, received LA (60 mg/kg b.w.)\nand after 30 min received LPS (6 mg/kg b.w.). All compounds were administered to the tail vein. After 5 hours of the experiment, the animals were anesthetized and striated\nmuscle from the thigh was prepared. The isolated muscle was homogenized. Concentrations of superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)\nwere determined in the homogenates with the application of ELISA.\nResults. The study showed a signifi cant decrease in SOD-1 content and an increase in TNF-α in striated muscle after LPS administration. LA given 30 min before administra-\ntion of LPS caused a signifi cant increase in the level of SOD-1 and decreased levels of TNF-α in homogenates.\nConclusion. LA reduced the parameters of LPS oxidative stress, thus contributing to an increase in the body’s antioxidant defense."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd8f","uid":"bdJcqGuHtTGcKh4izYyUw6Q","uuid":"44549988-d2a2-4e0d-83fc-755d21da549c","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Kosmetyki i Nauk o Zdrowiu w Łodzi","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709241878c28a04739291c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd8f","parentUuid":"44549988-d2a2-4e0d-83fc-755d21da549c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd8f","rootUuid":"44549988-d2a2-4e0d-83fc-755d21da549c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","affiliatedPersonIDs":["615d0a2875234017e04f5af5","5e7092e3878c28a04739ebcb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"76","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"11-15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e3878c28a04739ebcb","615d0a2875234017e04f5af5","5e709241878c28a04739291c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e721312467f01e93045e79","title":"Postępy Higieny i Medycyny Doświadczalnej","issn":"1732-2693","eissn":"1732-2693","documentHash":"42e23464-3a5d-4070-b121-6790410eb161"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"623478762467f00ffe95a773","year":"2022","volume":"76","number":"1","documentHash":"110d7d20-2353-4d90-9ec4-b47498af01be"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lipoic acid","oxidative stress","SOD-1","TNF-α","lipopolysaccharide"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059287151"}]
