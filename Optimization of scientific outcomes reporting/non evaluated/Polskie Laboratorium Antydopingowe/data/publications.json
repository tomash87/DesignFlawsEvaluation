Ligandrol was first included in the WADA Prohibited List in 2018. This work presents a method that allows for the detection and identification of ligandrol and its metabolite in athletes’ urine and in dietary supplements by means of ultra performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). Samples were prepared according to an approach involving acid hydrolysis and double liquid–liquid extraction (LLE). Furthermore, due to the lack of reference material for ligandrol metabolites, the urine collected from the control excretion study was analyzed. The presented method is appropriate to monitor ligandrol and its metabolites. The samples collected for doping control purpose contained multiple metabolites, which may potentially rule out the hypothesis of ingesting a single 1 µg or 10 µg dose only. Another aspect to take into account is that ligandrol can be applied together with SARMs, steroids, and GHSs. This will also affect the substances’ metabolism and elimination. It is also worth noting that dietary supplements may contain ligandrol as an official ingredient or as a contaminant. The described method may be usefully applied by other anti-doping or toxicological laboratories."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5ec08d957523403547daeee1","uid":"b3MIWzk-tqcwLYM-usfFlKw","uuid":"5b4e5026-8fb4-4c6b-b479-7879f24cc357","name":"Polskie Laboratorium Antydopingowe","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65b946784097073f660fee22","65b946784097073f660fee21","65b946784097073f660fee26","65b946784097073f660fee25","65b946784097073f660fee24","65b946784097073f660fee23"],"parentId":"5ec08d957523403547daeee1","parentUuid":"5b4e5026-8fb4-4c6b-b479-7879f24cc357","rootId":"5ec08d957523403547daeee1","rootUuid":"5b4e5026-8fb4-4c6b-b479-7879f24cc357","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"6486","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b946784097073f660fee21","65b946784097073f660fee22","65b946784097073f660fee23","65b946784097073f660fee24","65b946784097073f660fee25","65b946784097073f660fee26"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"650199ed4097072b3198c9a5","year":"2023","volume":"28","number":"18","documentHash":"a6ff7cd2-83b9-4543-8f08-ecae29175726"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ligandrol","LGD-4033","VK-5211","WADA","metabolism","metabolites","steroids","SARMs","GHSs"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059354774"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b939364097073f660f2696","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kwiatkowska","documentHash":"b61ab08a-f259-4569-ba0d-161ffdd2047c"},{"objectId":"65b939364097073f660f2695","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Konarski","documentHash":"c6ba8bc6-df14-408c-b9d7-db981bafae06"},{"objectId":"65b939364097073f660f2694","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Drapała","documentHash":"d3e9f32d-facc-4463-9153-1ee825b35c97"},{"objectId":"65b939364097073f660f2693","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grucza","documentHash":"885a7cf8-b64b-406c-b07d-6c6176c54e5f"},{"objectId":"65b939364097073f660f2692","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Wicka","documentHash":"72dad7b8-b1f5-4b51-89ec-b8147ce98971"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65b939364097073f660f2691","doi":"10.3390/separations10030155","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2297-8739/10/3/155/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Determination of 27 Glucocorticoids in Urine by Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Using UniSprayTM Source","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Glucocorticoids (GCs) are a group of the most important and commonly used anti-inflammatory, antiallergenic, and immunosuppressive drugs.

It is a highly potent derivative of triamcinolone, with a strength that is about eight times greater than prednisone. Although it is sometimes used by athletes, it is important to note that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibits the use of glucocorticoids in competition when administered via injection, oral (including oromucosal, such as buccal, gingival, or sublingual), or rectal routes. However, they are allowed if administered otherwise, such as via inhalation or topical application to the skin. Anti-doping laboratories generally report Adverse Analytical Findings (AAF) for glucocorticoid group substances when their estimated concentration exceeds 30 ng/mL, with some exceptions such as triamcinolone acetonide, which has a reporting limit of 15 ng/mL. It is important to note that this only applies to the parent compound of specified metabolites. To address interpretation issues that can arise with other glucocorticoids, such as budesonide, the authors of this study investigated whether similar issues occur with triamcinolone acetonide. Specifically, they examined whether therapeutic doses of the commonly used medication Previsone could result in anti-doping rule violations due to the presence of triamcinolone acetonide and its metabolites in urine. The study involved ten healthy volunteers, and the analytical procedure was developed using liquid/liquid extraction, hydrolysis, and LC/MS/MS analysis. The results of the study showed that topical administration of therapeutic doses of Previsone does not pose a threat of anti-doping rules violation, as the excretion of the parent compound does not exceed the reporting limit in urine. Additionally, the concentration of 6β-hydroxy Triamcinolone acetonide was also well below the reporting limit."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5ef9db77ad49b350a4acb2f1","name":"Centrum Nauk Biologiczno-Chemicznych Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65b93d654097073f660f5110"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5ec08d957523403547daeee1","uid":"b3MIWzk-tqcwLYM-usfFlKw","uuid":"5b4e5026-8fb4-4c6b-b479-7879f24cc357","name":"Polskie Laboratorium Antydopingowe","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65b93d654097073f660f5111","65b93d654097073f660f510e","65b93d654097073f660f510f"],"parentId":"5ec08d957523403547daeee1","parentUuid":"5b4e5026-8fb4-4c6b-b479-7879f24cc357","rootId":"5ec08d957523403547daeee1","rootUuid":"5b4e5026-8fb4-4c6b-b479-7879f24cc357","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"164","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b93d654097073f660f510e","65b93d654097073f660f510f","65b93d654097073f660f5110","65b93d654097073f660f5111"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d2e6","mniswId":"18392","title":"Separations","eissn":"2297-8739","documentHash":"35448e59-b691-4270-a156-0b7359afe7c1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646deb3f40970770404bb268","year":"2023","volume":"10","number":"3","documentHash":"a22cb017-80b1-465f-9b16-e68cbdd2987c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["triamcinolone acetonide","6β-tiamcinolone acetonide; doping","WADA","liquid chromatography","mass spectrometry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059360609"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b949674097073f661007d5","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kwiatkowska","documentHash":"f1207558-5b2e-4633-bb75-7d94320f6370"},{"objectId":"65b949674097073f661007d4","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Małkowska","documentHash":"60cfff0f-ade6-4582-8f3d-825c8a371391"},{"objectId":"65b949674097073f661007d3","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grucza","documentHash":"7dc6aed8-4b1f-4e53-a04e-80fb286d7f34"},{"objectId":"65b949674097073f661007d2","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Ługowska","documentHash":"b51a23cf-2a4f-495e-834c-72ccfe2e1bc7"},{"objectId":"65b949674097073f661007d1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Małkowska","documentHash":"72c054d8-f20f-4045-806d-7968d4ec90e4"}],"objectId":"65b949674097073f661007cf","doi":"10.1016/j.alcohol.2023.08.010","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0741832923002628?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate in the zebrafish after ethanol exposure","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ethanol exposure during pregnancy is an important problem and is the cause of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The etiology of FAS and FASD can be elucidated using animal models. Recently, a novel model, the zebrafish (Danio rerio), has garnered the interest of researchers. This study confirmed the negative influence of ethyl alcohol (0.5 %, 1.5 %, and 2.5 % v/v) on the development of zebrafish embryos. The observed malformations included pericardial and yolk sac edema, increased body curvature, tail edema, and a decreased embryo hatching rate. The differences in body length, body width, and heart rate were statistically significant. Due to the similarities in the quantity and function of ethanol biotransformation enzymes between zebrafish and mammals, this study investigated the nonoxidative metabolites of ethanol – ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and ethyl sulfate (EtS) – in zebrafish following ethanol exposure. This research confirmed that EtG and EtS concentrations can be measured in zebrafish embryos, and the levels of these metabolites appear to be associated with the ethyl alcohol concentration in the medium."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5ec08d957523403547daeee1","uid":"b3MIWzk-tqcwLYM-usfFlKw","uuid":"5b4e5026-8fb4-4c6b-b479-7879f24cc357","name":"Polskie Laboratorium Antydopingowe","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65b949674097073f661007d3","65b949674097073f661007d5"],"parentId":"5ec08d957523403547daeee1","parentUuid":"5b4e5026-8fb4-4c6b-b479-7879f24cc357","rootId":"5ec08d957523403547daeee1","rootUuid":"5b4e5026-8fb4-4c6b-b479-7879f24cc357","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"115","pagesFromTo":"33-39","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b949674097073f661007d1","65b949674097073f661007d2","65b949674097073f661007d3","65b949674097073f661007d4","65b949674097073f661007d5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f42","mniswId":"761","title":"Alcohol","doi":"10.1016/j.alcohol","issn":"0741-8329","eissn":"1873-6823","websiteLink":"http://sciencedirect.com/science/journal/07418329","documentHash":"48295262-b4fd-4f7b-90cf-5e5a6362c780"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b949674097073f661007d0","year":"2024","volume":"115","documentHash":"a4e501a2-b4a2-4d01-81ab-7160b9ab0c27"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060770805"}]
