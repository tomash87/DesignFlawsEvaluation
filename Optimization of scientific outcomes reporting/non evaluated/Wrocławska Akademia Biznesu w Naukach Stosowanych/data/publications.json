The future workforce is expected to possess not only digital and technical competences but also the often intangible “elusive soft skills”—encompassing multicultural communication, emotional intelligence, leadership, self-awareness, and critical thinking—all of which will hold substantial importance.\n\nThe objective of this chapter is to identify and analyze the opportunities and challenges presented by cultural diversity in the management of a specific organization, in this case, a private university. It is posited that the inherent cultural diversity in staff management, research, and education services necessitates the aforementioned “elusive soft skills.” This diversity also poses a host of challenges for management, administrative staff, and academics, each group experiencing its impact distinctly.\n\nFor academics, a multicultural environment offers numerous positive prospects, with its benefits outweighing potential downsides. Conversely, management and administrative staff are less influenced by these advantages. The selected case study revolves around the Vistula Group of Universities (VGU), specifically Vistula University in Warsaw (VU) and Wroclaw Business University of Applied Sciences (WAB). The former stands as one of Poland’s most internationalized institutions. To accomplish this objective, a survey conducted among employees of Vistula and WAB Universities will be utilized."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dce3","uid":"bnvWrs01mI4xlRyAV4NIX4A","uuid":"e05ed102-dfb3-43e6-a961-484a5124a4f6","name":"Wrocławska Akademia Biznesu w Naukach Stosowanych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709265878c28a047395024","5e709422878c28a0473b6de5"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dce3","parentUuid":"e05ed102-dfb3-43e6-a961-484a5124a4f6","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dce3","rootUuid":"e05ed102-dfb3-43e6-a961-484a5124a4f6","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"129 - 137","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709422878c28a0473b6de5","5e709411878c28a0473b5be7","5e709235878c28a047391a70","5e709265878c28a047395024"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66e18344fdbe8317d036c25c","doi":"10.4324/9781003502272","title":"Organizational Development, Innovation, and Economy 5.0: Challenges in the Digital Era","year":2024,"isbn":"9781003502272","url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003502272","translation":false,"documentHash":"e15bcc99-7ae6-43c2-a868-d7b484960f31","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"38a8b0b6-6f32-428b-ab15-a3fd3338c9df"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059844216"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ce878c28a0473b1227","name":"Marta","lastName":"Drozdowska","uuid":"10380382D21D9965D4B78B7935703CDE9B341B91A3CDE7502AF418C7A73C0DCD1E4A04B49FC07A9E64B378A0A480DB251EAAB188098E22307FA3EAD0046D83AB","documentHash":"b0ab49c8-84cf-468b-b251-9ce96e4c3d71"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047395004","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Gruszka","uuid":"1AF3490D28D3F154FB5EB56E44762F4367A3D970BF4FF21882215B12E97647CB7506F238A053B179FF3FEA00E3B3B96A6537B255A7773B83F796A29DD486644F","documentHash":"1d45db82-4e59-496a-85ff-2e5ee761b07d"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a047391468","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Ilnicki","uuid":"705BAC3C3A4CB04D326873D0728A6EF7D7C7382F689C3522DF47A880F3AFE3C7B4275ED1A2148FA13E58D67C64D277BA788A3F6974897C2F8ADBB4272618F91D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9147-3767","documentHash":"42c1b885-1d9e-44eb-9344-a0c1bbe1de97"}],"objectId":"6718b906fdbe8353f75a7aae","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003502272","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Sustainable development and transition from Economy 4.0 to Economy 5.0","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The concept of Economy 5.0 is based on three key values: human orientation, sustainable development, and resilience to economic changes and crises.
