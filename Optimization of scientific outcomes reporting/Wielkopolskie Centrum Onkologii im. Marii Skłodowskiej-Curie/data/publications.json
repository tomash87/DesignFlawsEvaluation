Multiple representative treatment plans (n = 12) for TrueBeam and CyberKnife were prepared and evaluated. Nontarget doses were measured with anionization chamber, in a quasi-humanoid phantom at four sites corresponding to the intestines, right lung, thyroid, and head. The following parameters were modified: radiotherapy technique, presence or not of a flattening filter, degree of modulation, and use or not of jaw tracking function for TrueBeam and beam orientation set-up, optimization techniques, and number of MUs for CyberKnife. After usual optimization doses in intestines (near the target) were 0.73% and 0.76%, in head (farthest from target) 0.05% and 0.19% for TrueBeam and CyberKnife, respectively. For TrueBeam the highest peripheral (head, thyroid, lung) doses occurred for the VMAT with the flattening filter while the lowest for 3DCRT. For CyberKnife the highest doses were for gantry with caudal direction beams blocked (gantry close to OARs) while the lowest was the low modulated VOLO optimization technique. The easiest method to reduce peripheral doses was to combine FFF with jaw tracking and reducing monitor units at TrueBeam and to avoid gantry position close to OARs together with reduction of monitor units at CyberKnife, respectively. The presented strategies allowed to significantly reduce out-of-field and nontarget doses during prostate radiotherapy delivered with TrueBeam and CyberKnife. A different approach was required to reduce peripheral doses because of the difference in dose delivery techniques: non-coplanar using CyberKnife and coplanar using TrueBeam, respectively."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5ebe74c275234012661a465e","uid":"bW32tTWOKLKZhlxsCBxw1FA","uuid":"c1c8ada2-ad4c-46c3-b06a-287acd2813f4","name":"Wielkopolskie Centrum Onkologii im.

According to the literature, the potential mechanism of vitamin D's influence on the effectiveness of therapy is most likely related to the amount and activity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. There are data showing the effect of vitamin D on cells regulating the activity of CD8 lymphocytes.\n\nMethods: A total of 200 patients with advanced melanoma were included in the study. All patients received anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) as first-line treatment. Serum vitamin D levels were measured in patients both before and every 12 weeks during treatment. Part of the group had vitamin D measured retrospectively from the preserved serum. The other part of the supplementation group was tested prospectively.\n\nResults: The response rate in the group with low vitamin D levels and not supplemented was 36.2%, whereas in the group with normal baseline levels or a normal level obtained with supplementation was 56.0% (p = .01). Moreover, progression-free survival in these groups was 5.75 and 11.25 months, respectively (p = .03). In terms of overall survival, there was also a difference in favor of the group with normal vitamin D levels (27 vs. 31.5 months, respectively; p = .39).\n\nConclusions: In our opinion, maintaining the vitamin D level within the normal range during anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in advanced melanoma patients should be a standard procedure allowing the improvement of treatment outcomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5ebe74c275234012661a465e","uid":"bW32tTWOKLKZhlxsCBxw1FA","uuid":"c1c8ada2-ad4c-46c3-b06a-287acd2813f4","name":"Wielkopolskie Centrum Onkologii im.

A cost-effective strategy to extend therapeutic options in this malignancy is drug repurposing aimed at overcoming chemoresistance. Here, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are worth considering.\nMaterial and methods: We searched literature for publications supporting the idea of adjuvant application of ACE-Is in ovarian malignancy. Then, we searched The Cancer Genome Atlas databases for relevant alternations of gene expression patterns. We also performed in silico structure-activity relationship evaluation for predicting ACE-Is’\n1\ncytotoxicity against ovarian cancer cell lines. Finally, we reviewed the potential obstacles in ACE-Is repurposing process.\nResults: The alternation of angiotensin receptor expression in ovarian cancer translates into poorer patient survival. This confirms the participation of the renin-angiotensin system in ovarian carcinogenesis. In observational studies, ACE-Is were shown synergize with both, platinum-based chemotherapy as well as with antiangiogenic therapy. Consistently, our in silico simulation showed that ACE-Is are probably cytotoxic against ovarian cancer cells. However, the publications on their chemopreventive properties were inconclusive. In addition, some reports correlated ACE-Is use with increased general cancer incidence. We hypothesized that this effect could be associated with mutagenic nitrosamine formation in ACE-Is’ pharmaceutical formulations, as was the case with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and other well-established pharmaceuticals.\nConclusions: Available data warrant further research into repositioning ACE-Is to ovarian cancer as chemosensitizers. Prior to this, however, a special research program is needed to detect possible genotoxic contaminants of ACE-Is."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5ebe74c275234012661a465e","uid":"bW32tTWOKLKZhlxsCBxw1FA","uuid":"c1c8ada2-ad4c-46c3-b06a-287acd2813f4","name":"Wielkopolskie Centrum Onkologii im.

While KC and its treatment can negatively impact patients quality of life (QoL), existing QoL instruments lack specificity for unique KC-related issues. This systematic review explores the relevant QoL issues pertinent to patients with KC.\nMethods: Literature from Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from 1946 to January 2023 was systematically reviewed. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted studies of all designs discussing KC-specific QoL issues.\nResults: The systematic review identified prevalent QoL issues in the literature. Some generic QoL-related issues are covered by more general cancer QoL instruments that are not site specific to KC, such as the EORTC QLQ-C30. These include pain, functioning, daily activities, work, leisure time, and social and family relationships. More KC-specific issues include the impact of cosmetic outcomes on QoL, such as scarring, skin pigmentation change, embarrassment, distress, and social withdrawal. Improved sun awareness, including increased sunscreen use, avoidance of outdoor activities, and sun-protective clothing usage, emerged as common changes in behavior. These issues may result from both the disease and the treatment.\nConclusions: This review has identified multiple KC-specific QoL issues, highlighting need for a tailored QoL instrument to measure these KC-specific issues. As the landscape of KC research and treatment modalities evolve, a gap persists in terms of a standardized QoL measurement for both clinical and research contexts. A new QoL instrument needs to be developed which is better tailored to the needs of patients with KC."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5ebe74c275234012661a465e","uid":"bW32tTWOKLKZhlxsCBxw1FA","uuid":"c1c8ada2-ad4c-46c3-b06a-287acd2813f4","name":"Wielkopolskie Centrum Onkologii im.

of real-time dosimetry of ultra-high dose rate beams at AQURE FLASH RT on the sample surface","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: FLASH radiotherapy involves delivering a dose of ultra-high-dose-rate ionising radiation (>40 Gy/s) in less than 200 ms, resulting in sparing healthy tissue and effectively destroying cancerous tissue. This article presents a preliminary verification of the feasibility of using real-time internal dosimetry at the sample surface to measure doses generated by the AQURE FLASH RT accelerator dedicated to FLASH radiotherapy studies.\nMaterial and Methods: The AQURE FLASH RT emits a 6 and 9 MeV electron beam with a dose rate higher than 40 Gy/s. The real-time dosimetry system to measure doses on the sample surface was implemented into the accelerator and consists of inductive sensors in which the moving electron charge induces a voltage in the secondary toroidal winding. The internal dosimetric system was preliminarily calibrated for single pulse irradiations using passive dosimetry methods, i.e. film and alanine dosimetry.\nResults: The study showed that there was no effect of the tested dosimetry system on the beam (PDD and beam profile). The linearity of the system’s response to successive pulses was tested and found to be <2% only for irradiation with two or more pulses. Therefore, a single pulse calibration of the system was performed to verify the applicability of the system for single pulse irradiation. The measurement results showed that the differences between the results obtained by the different methods were less than 2% for triode grid voltages below 30 V.\nConclusion: The results confirmed the possibility of using the real-time dosimetry system to measure doses on the sample surface delivered by ultra-high dose rate beams at the AQURE FLASH RT accelerator. The system has been tested and validated over the full range of dose rates emitted by the accelerator to measure a dose in a single pulse. The results of the dosimetric measurements confirmed that the system did not affect the beam parameters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5ebe74c275234012661a465e","uid":"bW32tTWOKLKZhlxsCBxw1FA","uuid":"c1c8ada2-ad4c-46c3-b06a-287acd2813f4","name":"Wielkopolskie Centrum Onkologii im.

This can be achieved by various biomarkers, especially imaging parameters and gene expression signatures are commonly used. So far, combination approaches are sparse. The aim of the study was to independently validate the prognostic value of the novel positron emission tomography (PET) parameter tumor asphericity (ASP) in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and to investigate associations between published gene expression profiles and ASP. This was a retrospective evaluation of PET imaging and gene expression data from three public databases and two institutional datasets. The whole cohort comprised 253 NSCLC patients, all treated with curative intent surgery. Clinical parameters, standard PET parameters and ASP were evaluated in all patients. Additional gene expression data were available for 120 patients. Univariate Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed for the primary endpoint progression-free survival (PFS) and additional endpoints. Furthermore, multivariate cox regression testing was performed including clinically significant parameters, ASP, and the extracellular matrix-related prognostic gene signature (EPPI). In the whole cohort, a significant association with PFS was observed for ASP (p < 0.001) and EPPI (p = 0.012). Upon multivariate testing, EPPI remained significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.018) in the subgroup of patients with additional gene expression data, while ASP was significantly associated with PFS in the whole cohort (p = 0.012). In stage II patients, ASP was significantly associated with PFS (p = 0.009), and a previously published cutoff value for ASP (19.5%) was successfully validated (p = 0.008). In patients with additional gene expression data, EPPI showed a significant association with PFS, too (p = 0.033). The exploratory combination of ASP and EPPI showed that the combinatory approach has potential to further improve patient stratification compared to the use of only one parameter. We report the first successful validation of EPPI and ASP in stage II NSCLC patients. The combination of both parameters seems to be a very promising approach for improvement of risk stratification in a group of patients with urgent need for a more personalized treatment approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5ebe74c275234012661a465e","uid":"bW32tTWOKLKZhlxsCBxw1FA","uuid":"c1c8ada2-ad4c-46c3-b06a-287acd2813f4","name":"Wielkopolskie Centrum Onkologii im.
