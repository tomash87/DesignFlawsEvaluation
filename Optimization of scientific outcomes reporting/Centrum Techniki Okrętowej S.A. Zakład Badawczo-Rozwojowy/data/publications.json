In this study, we used low-resolution, dual-energy, full-body X-ray\nabsorptiometry images to train deep learning models to predict age. In particular, we proposed\na preprocessing framework and adapted many partially pretrained convolutional neural network\n(CNN) models to predict the age of children and young adults. We used a new dataset of 910\nmultispectral images that were weakly annotated by specialists. The experimental results showed\nthat the proposed preprocessing techniques and the adapted approach to the CNN model achieved a\ndiscrepancy between chronological age and predicted age of around 15.56 months for low-resolution\nwhole-body X-rays. Furthermore, we found that the main factor that influenced age prediction scores\nwas spatial features, not multispectral features."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856cf","uid":"bP3F9yBUBmtSSYSKb6jbZkw","uuid":"3eb12b62-d496-416f-a200-b6e9cd43e7c8","name":"Centrum Techniki Okrętowej S.A.

Additional material was gathered from open-water tests that were conducted throughout several research projects on the CP469 model, which is a model of the Nawigator XXI propeller. The latter is a controllable pitch propeller; its pitch was reset before each test repetition. Known procedures for the determination of the open-water test uncertainty do not allow one to extract the manufacture impact directly, without building many models. This factor was addressed with the use of lifting surface calculations. Under certain additional assumptions, these calculations were performed for 100 generic versions of each propeller’s geometry, which were generated by random deviations from the theoretical data within the limits of allowed tolerances. The results of the conducted analyses made it possible to extract separate factors, which were connected to the test’s repeatability, measurement bias and geometry tolerance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856cf","uid":"bP3F9yBUBmtSSYSKb6jbZkw","uuid":"3eb12b62-d496-416f-a200-b6e9cd43e7c8","name":"Centrum Techniki Okrętowej S.A.

An algorithm for automated modification of the hull is presented, allowing for varying the sectional area distribution with a negligible influence on the resulting displacement. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver STAR-CCM+ and computer computer-aided design (CAD) software NX were used to search the optimal volume distribution of selected parent shapes, with respect to total resistance. The bow part and the aft part were optimised separately. The resulting resistances of the selected optimal shapes were then verified by means of scale model tests, realised in the towing tank at the Maritime Advanced Research Centre (CTO) S.A. A noticeable gain in total resistance was achieved and confirmed by experimental tests. The proposed approach seems to be a promising method for relatively quick parametric optimisation of the designed hull shapes; it is also applicable for generic CFD optimisation studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856cf","uid":"bP3F9yBUBmtSSYSKb6jbZkw","uuid":"3eb12b62-d496-416f-a200-b6e9cd43e7c8","name":"Centrum Techniki Okrętowej S.A.

By the vacuum lamination method, composite materials were produced in the form of plates with the addition of rubber recyclate in four variants of the amount of recyclate used in the produced composite – 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%. Each variant contained 6 layers of fabric and five layers of rubber recyclate. The samples were tested in the vibroacoustic laboratory on a dedicated measuring station of a set of reverberation chambers without flanking transmission, in which the specific acoustic insulation Rw was determined following PN-EN ISO 10140-2 and related standards, i.e. PN-EN ISO 10140-1, PN-EN ISO 10140-2, PN-EN ISO 10140-4, PN-EN ISO 10140-5 and PN EN ISO 717-1.

Existing testing protocols, such as Regulation No. 100, utilize petrol pool fires to simulate real-world fire hazards but lack comprehensive analysis regarding their repeatability and reliability. This study addresses this critical gap by evaluating the variability and consistency of fire-resistance tests performed on multiple battery energy storage systems (BESSs) under standardized conditions. A custom-built measurement system incorporating thermocouples, anemometers, and hygrometers provided high-resolution data on flame dynamics, ambient conditions, and pool fire efficiency. Statistical evaluations following ISO 5725 series guidelines revealed substantial inconsistencies, including unstable exposure temperatures and sensitivity to local turbulence. These findings call into question the robustness of current testing methods, and we propose an alternative approach employing LPG burners for improved precision and repeatability. By identifying significant flaws in existing standards and offering scientifically grounded enhancements, this work contributes a novel perspective to the field of EV safety, advancing global fire-resistance testing protocols."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856cf","uid":"bP3F9yBUBmtSSYSKb6jbZkw","uuid":"3eb12b62-d496-416f-a200-b6e9cd43e7c8","name":"Centrum Techniki Okrętowej S.A.

To achieve this goal, novel deep eutectic solvents were synthesized by using 2-(butylamino)ethanol (BAE) as the hydrogen bond donor (HBD), along with tetrabutylammonium bromide TBAB), tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC), or tetraethylammonium chloride (TEAC) as the hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) at various molar ratios (1:6, 1:8, and 1:10). To confirm the presence of hydrogen bond interactions between the components Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy measurements were conducted. Furthermore, thermal properties, including melting points and thermal stability, of these deep eutectic solvents as well as key physical properties, such as density, viscosity, refractive index, and sound velocity, within the temperature range of 293.15–333.15 K and at a pressure of 0.1 MPa were examined. The effect of the molar ratio of HBA to HBD, the type of anion, and the length of the alkyl chain were studied and analysed in regard to physicochemical properties. In this work, the solubility of carbon dioxide in DESs derived from 2-(butylamino)ethanol, 3-aminopropan-1-ol (AP), and 2-(methylamino)ethanol (MAE) was measured. The highest CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> capacity was found for TEAC:MAE 1:10 DES characterized by the shortest alkyl chain length in both HBA and HBD molecules, the highest amine content, and the lowest viscosity. Additionally, the effect of water addition on carbon dioxide solubility was explored. The results showed that the influence of water on CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> solubility varies with the type of DES. In general, this work highlighted that DESs can serve as effective media for carbon dioxide capture, and their performance can be tailored by changing the type of hydrogen bond acceptor or donor, their molar ratio and by the addition of water."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856cf","uid":"bP3F9yBUBmtSSYSKb6jbZkw","uuid":"3eb12b62-d496-416f-a200-b6e9cd43e7c8","name":"Centrum Techniki Okrętowej S.A.

This is\nachieved by modifying the composite material's structure through the addition of rubber recyclate. Acoustic insulation tests were conducted on a sandwich composite made from Epidian® 6 epoxy resin, combined with Z-1 hardener, and a randomly arranged glass mat with a density of 350 g/m². Rubber recyclate, obtained from the disposal process of car tires, was used as a damping-enhancing additive. The composite materials were fabricated using the hand lamination technique and tested in three configurations, varying the number of sandwich layers containing recyclate: one, two, and three layers. Field tests were conducted under “in-situ” conditions to measure the reduction of impact sound levels. The setup compared a structure comprising a \"concrete slab + composite slab + ceiling\" to a reference structure of \"concrete slab + ceiling.\"\nThe parameter ΔL'n was determined in accordance with PN-EN ISO 16283-2 and PN-EN ISO 717-2\nstandards. Additionally, the reduction of impact sound levels in a ceiling fitted with the composite plate was ts.compared to a ceiling without it, also conforming to PN-EN ISO 16283-2 and PN-EN ISO 717-2 standards.\nThe results indicate a significant decrease in impact sound levels for the composite board with three\nsandwich layers compared to a composite board without rubber recyclate. This demonstrates the\neffectiveness of rubber recyclate additives in attenuating structural sounds. The integration of rubber\nrecyclate, sourced from car tire disposal, not only enhances acoustic performance but also contributes to\nenvironmental protection efforts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856cf","uid":"bP3F9yBUBmtSSYSKb6jbZkw","uuid":"3eb12b62-d496-416f-a200-b6e9cd43e7c8","name":"Centrum Techniki Okrętowej S.A.
