Although\nrecently proposed predictive access solutions that schedule the uplink traffic based on forecasts of IoT device\ntraffic achieve high network performance, these solutions depend heavily on the performance of forecasters.\nHence, the design and selection of forecasting schemes are key to enabling massive access for such predictive\naccess solutions. To this end, in this paper, first, we develop a framework that emulates the relationship\nbetween the IoT device class composition in the coverage area of an IoT gateway and the resulting network\nperformance by virtue of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Second, based on this framework, we develop the\nDynamic Automatic Forecaster Selection (DAFS) method, which selects the best-performing forecasting scheme\nfor predictive access, in particular for Joint Forecasting-Scheduling (JFS), in a manner that adapts dynamically\nto a changing number of IoT devices in each device class in the coverage area. We evaluate the performance\nof DAFS via simulations and show that our method is able to achieve at least 80% of the best performance\nthat can be attained for both throughput and energy consumption.

Unfortunately, most of the well-known quantum algorithms are too demanding to be run on currently available quantum devices. Moreover, even the state-of-the-art algorithms developed for the NISQ era often suffer from high space complexity requirements for particular problem classes. In this paper, we show that it is possible to greatly reduce the number of qubits needed for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), a paradigmatic optimization task, at the cost of having deeper variational circuits. While the focus is on this particular problem, we claim that the approach can be generalized for other problems where the standard bit-encoding is highly inefficient. Finally, we also propose encoding schemes which smoothly interpolate between the qubit-efficient and the circuit depth-efficient models. All the proposed encodings have the same volume up to polylogarithmic factors and remain efficient to implement within the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm framework."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej

As a superiority of quantum computing, QFAs have been shown exponentially more succinct on certain problems such as recognizing the language MODp={aj∣j≡0modp} with bounded error, where p is a prime number. In this paper we present improved circuit based implementations for QFA algorithms recognizing the MODp problem using the Qiskit framework. We focus on the case p=11 and provide a 3 qubit implementation for the MOD11 problem reducing the total number of required gates using alternative approaches. We run the circuits on real IBM quantum devices but due to the limitation of the real quantum devices in the NISQ era, the results are heavily affected by the noise. This limitation reveals once again the need for algorithms using less amount of resources. Consequently, we consider an alternative 3 qubit implementation which works better in practice and obtain promising results even for the problem MOD31."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61454f299543c7051ff01cf2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157418c4","mniswId":"952","fullName":"International Conference on Computational Science","shortName":"ICCS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"9690889e-bedf-4a40-a0bf-ea4bccddb401"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"60c1e3c72467f078d80f5f6f","startDate":"2021-06-16","endDate":"2021-06-18","fullName":"21st International Conference on Computational Science","shortName":"ICCS 2021","city":"Kraków","country":"PL","website":"https://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2021/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"06963471-0280-4aff-85ca-5441b179df9c"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6357d61b4097072c1fa2eacd","61454f299543c7051ff01cf2","6357d61b4097072c1fa2eace","6357d61b4097072c1fa2eacf","6357d61b4097072c1fa2ead0"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"60c1e4e02467f078d80f5f87","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-77980-1","title":"Computational Science – ICCS 2021: 21st International Conference, Krakow, Poland, June 16–18, 2021, Proceedings, Part VI","year":2021,"volume":"VI","isbn":"978-3-030-77979-5","issn":"0302-9743","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-77980-1.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"3399db23-d8d7-4b84-ac6f-7ef3ae4d9802"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058282438"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"630378c74097075e4a6d3316","name":"Mátyás","lastName":"Koniorczyk","documentHash":"bd67c702-7c46-43ee-b55c-1135cddc1d8b"},{"objectId":"5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Domino","uuid":"CA9728FF4DE4C64ED7452CC84E2C9FA5A4B954B211AB6AC7375C427567DA859A9FA7C2633E6FDD3147DA0343C6BEBE5E46B83E70571CF5120C82D77C5745B899","orcidId":"0000-0001-7386-5441","documentHash":"ea82a803-78b7-40f1-84a6-a858acb10900"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Puchała","uuid":"084E5F6A60B0C0CA41B364C281E70B8FFF17CAB5C42C464CF3B473E5DDDE7CF4F75350AFE021EEFC95F81444AEB0EDF8B955A7569D9FAC1A7DC77CAD370DD038","orcidId":"0000-0002-4739-0400","documentHash":"a6454553-3823-42b4-904b-d14ce1638536"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"630378c74097075e4a6d3314","doi":"10.1007/s11128-022-03623-5","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11128-022-03623-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Statistical quality assessment of Ising-based annealer outputs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The ability to evaluate the outcomes of quantum annealers is essential for such devices to be used in complex computational tasks.

Assuming a plausible model of the univariate energy distribution of the sample, we express the ground-state energy and temperature as a function of cumulants up to the third order. Using the annealer samples, we evaluate this multiple times using Bootstrap resampling, resulting in an estimated histogram of ground-state energies and deduce the desired parameter on this basis.

Although there are many sophisticated models of opinion formation, they often lack the connection with real life data, and there are still sociological processes that need to be explained. To address this, we propose a model describing the dynamics of opinion formation which mimics the process of the virus or disease spreading in the population. The introduced model is motivated by the model of disease spread with three possible channels — direct contact, indirect contact, and contact with “contaminated” elements. We demonstrate that the presence of “contaminated” elements, which in the case of on-line communities can be represented as the content published on the Internet, has considerable impact on the process of opinion formation. We argue that by using a simple mechanism of opinion spreading via passive elements, the introduced model captures the meaningful elements of opinion formation in complex communities.

Our measurements show that the mean RSSI value equals -65.5 dBm, -78.4 dBm, -84.1 dBm and -90.8 dBm for 1m, 5m, 10m, and 16m, respectively. The standard deviation changes from 5.7 dBm through 5.9 dBm, 4.5 dBm to 3.5 dBm for 1m, 5m, 10m, and 16m, respectively. We also investigate the influence of the interference, emulating environment in which devices actively transmit BLE signals with varying intensities; on average, at every 0ms (no additional signals), 4ms and 8ms. The experiments show that from 13% to 40% fewer packets are delivered per second in the presence of interferences. Nevertheless, the RSSI characteristics remain very similar regardless of the presence of emulated traffic or not."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","5e709444878c28a0473b94d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621b878c2877157415e6","mniswId":"76","fullName":"ACM/IEEE International Conference on Modelling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems","shortName":"MSWIM","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"b56aa313-d876-4cbd-9473-e05e9b3160b2"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63bfd65040970702a6657fb2","startDate":"2022-10-24","endDate":"2022-10-28","fullName":"ACM MSWIM 22 - The 25th International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems","shortName":"ACM MSWIM 22","city":"Montreal","country":"CA","website":"https://mswimconf.com/2022/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"e0fb39be-8bf5-4292-b709-2ab371a48be9"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058379148"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63567e384097076f28bfb45c","name":"Krisztián","lastName":"Búza","documentHash":"aa4c6191-fad7-4913-8d2f-ecc9c6dc817a"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d4","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Książek","uuid":"D89949D0F75B67CE9F451472DB19F0A6BF6D7F2F2606150E9584C9AD3B6D03C289B6EBD4439677FD75526EDC2F4B4445D9A69DDC82967012B66F54FA88F553A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0201-6220","documentHash":"b61af690-ba0e-4f43-8e0c-7952ac630f87"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d3","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Grabowski","uuid":"24170E87AEF346D87AC3D3BB0827F717B98AB1A116CFBC9273957236611300D41F1377FDDACEB30AC98C65AE0621C5804D024E0E5E5338573A8D6E6FA26071C9","documentHash":"a16a62e2-ed3a-4bed-8d23-02f9faf5e200"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa031","name":"Michał","lastName":"Romaszewski","uuid":"794BD3547A8C73952F65D57A0FD3FF33B13690959E9AE28F002050B9026AF3C5143015AF3D68A11D34922CD16D0846F6C5095BBBD497B639C920863DF2126982","orcidId":"0000-0002-8227-929X","documentHash":"06589218-e8d0-4a53-9e39-8d8ccfadb95c"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa030","name":"Michał","lastName":"Cholewa","uuid":"47699C878B3AD5E38C0A505FC84A47A065643A57A3D8A402D2BA6D348CBACF7B7FAFDC34C006484FAB36434989FA5EDAFF39AF29A82591DADA599F2EA2E4FBCE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6549-1590","documentHash":"9afc1c06-2697-4a7a-a02d-3e833155f6ab"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Głomb","uuid":"67B5DF4EBEF036D7B1861B26A48C3ABE0E65A55A852DCAAEEF5DFCD3DEF99C6112C878B3A303C0B2F361D1FD7CAE0F6524E3EE80853F54592EC6A1FEE1A7D1B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0215-4674","documentHash":"f96d93e7-9254-4b2f-8620-8a6cffc11fbb"}],"objectId":"63567e384097076f28bfb45b","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-06427-2_33","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Improving Autoencoder Training Performance for Hyperspectral Unmixing with Network Reinitialisation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Neural networks, in particular autoencoders, are one of the most promising solutions for unmixing hyperspectral data, i.e. reconstructing the spectra of observed substances (endmembers) and their relative mixing fractions (abundances), which is needed for effective hyperspectral analysis and classification.

Multiple objectives are required for the design of the HPC mix proportion. This paper develops a hybrid intelligent framework based on the random forest (RF) algorithm, the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) algorithm and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with an elite strategy (NSGA-II) to realize the efficient optimization of concrete mixture. The developed framework can identify the key influencing factors in terms of the concrete mix proportion, predict concrete performance, and obtain a series of optimized solutions through multi-objective optimization. The optimal solution is then determined according to the engineer's preference as the recommended mix proportion. An actual engineering case is studied to verify the feasibility of the developed framework, in which the material proportions in the concrete composition are taken as decision variables and the frost resistance, impermeability and cost of the concrete are taken as objectives. The results are as follows: (1) In the RF-based importance ranking, the water–binder ratio, cement content, fly ash content, fine aggregate content, coarse aggregate content and compound superplasticizer content are found to be key factors influencing concrete durability, indicating that predictions based on these factors will yield more accurate results. (2) LSSVM models show excellent predictive fitting capabilities, with the goodness of fit for predicting the frost resistance and impermeability of concrete reaching 0.94084 and 0.9443, respectively. The obtained surrogate model can be used to establish the fitness function for the optimization algorithm to improve efficiency. (3) The LSSVM–NSGA-II algorithm can determine the optimal mix proportion for concrete considering durability and cost. Compared with the average performance of the original mixture, the permeability and frost resistance of the obtained mixture are increased by 30.71% and 3.17%, respectively, and the cost is lower by 1.84%. In practice, the proposed approach can provide guidance for realizing multi-objective optimization of concrete and improve the efficiency of concrete mix proportion design. Notably, the current algorithm needs to be trained on a large amount of data to obtain accurate results; in the future, either a large amount of data should be collected or the algorithm should be improved to enhance its universality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"129","pagesFromTo":"104446","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c00b3440970702a66cd1a1","63c00b3440970702a66cd1a2","63c00b3440970702a66cd1a3","63c00b3440970702a66cd1a4","5e709252878c28a047393b56","63c00b3440970702a66cd1a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547759a","mniswId":"3403","title":"Cement and Concrete Composites","issn":"0958-9465","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5f7258b9-0fb8-4272-bdbe-d91266c63787"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c00b3440970702a66cd1a0","year":"2022","volume":"129","documentHash":"bd5254cf-8b7f-4f66-b86e-c46df4b97cdf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058428423"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c0061340970702a66bfe39","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","documentHash":"afde5ad1-9f2c-4977-bcc0-e52fb34da6e1"},{"objectId":"63c0061340970702a66bfe38","name":"Zhengze","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"94544d9c-14dd-4076-9ab2-51310f1fcc19"},{"objectId":"63c0061340970702a66bfe37","name":"Rosa M.","lastName":"Rodríguez","documentHash":"e3bc694a-77fc-4868-9e59-8ea02054d0bd"},{"objectId":"63c0061340970702a66bfe36","name":"Li-Ping","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"e322934c-35a4-4fd2-8ece-37cea20f3b84"},{"objectId":"63c0061340970702a66bfe35","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"976d5ca6-f576-49b6-90f8-91696bd0fecc"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"63c0061340970702a66bfe33","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2022.109790","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1568494622008390?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"BIM-aided large-scale group decision support: Optimization of the retrofit strategy for existing buildings","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"With the rapid development of the construction industry, buildings have become the single largest consumer of energy in the world.

Within this framework, BIM provides massive geometric and non-geometric data for the multi-criteria large-scale group decision-making process. Taking into account the needs of various stakeholder groups and sustainable principle, we establish a comprehensive and innovative evaluation index system for community retrofitting, and use the group best-worst method to determine the criteria weights. The stakeholers evaluate alternative retrofit strategies through distribution linguistic preferences, with a consistency-driven optimization model used to personalize the stakeholers’ numerical evaluation scales. Through k-means clustering and the consensus-reaching process, combined with objective data from BIM, we obtain the ranking of the alternative strategies.

With its systematic operation mechanism for translating customer requirements (CRs) into corresponding engineering characteristics (ECs), QFD highly facilitates product/service design and improvement. However, the evolution of the decision-making environment has made the quantification within the traditional QFD operation could hardly able to meet the demanded efficiency as well as the accuracy of the generated results. To cope with the problem, an enhanced large-scale group decision-making method that integrates proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (PHFLTSs) and the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is put forward by this study to determine the ranking priority of ECs in doing QFD. To facilitate QFD team members carry out an easier and more accurate evaluation, they would use comparative linguistic expressions in making judgments, and the comparative linguistic expressions are subsequently transformed into hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (HFLTSs). The obtained HFLTSs are transformed into PHFLTSs based on the statistical method under a group decision-making environment for preventing information loss, and, at the same time, improving calculation accuracy. Taking decision-makers’ heterogeneity and risk attitudes into consideration, the CPT method is adopted and extended under the PHFL environment to prioritize the ECs in QFD operation. To illustrate how the proposed large-scale group decision-making-based QFD method is to be applied, a case study about solar photovoltaic cell development is presented. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is conducted to exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed QFD method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"127","pagesFromTo":"109359","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c0094740970702a66caaf6","63c0094740970702a66caaf7","63c0094740970702a66caaf8","63c0094740970702a66caaf9","63c0094740970702a66caafa","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477150","mniswId":"1519","title":"APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING","issn":"1568-4946","eissn":"1872-9681","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d6682289-a2a9-4f76-b79c-2480e8a12e1d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058428589"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d4","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Książek","uuid":"D89949D0F75B67CE9F451472DB19F0A6BF6D7F2F2606150E9584C9AD3B6D03C289B6EBD4439677FD75526EDC2F4B4445D9A69DDC82967012B66F54FA88F553A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0201-6220","documentHash":"b61af690-ba0e-4f43-8e0c-7952ac630f87"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d3","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Grabowski","uuid":"24170E87AEF346D87AC3D3BB0827F717B98AB1A116CFBC9273957236611300D41F1377FDDACEB30AC98C65AE0621C5804D024E0E5E5338573A8D6E6FA26071C9","documentHash":"a16a62e2-ed3a-4bed-8d23-02f9faf5e200"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4859","name":"Krisztián","lastName":"Buza","uuid":"722AF0932D77B6FD6C5E3A599DA5E6BD1C2CB668956C0C2728871BB0E3AE06B05A6B970780C9613733FDACF2F21CF62ADBABA1447EA521A9B49AF947A9A395DF","documentHash":"46aa830f-b6c3-4ce3-9b38-7e1245a7e408"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Głomb","uuid":"67B5DF4EBEF036D7B1861B26A48C3ABE0E65A55A852DCAAEEF5DFCD3DEF99C6112C878B3A303C0B2F361D1FD7CAE0F6524E3EE80853F54592EC6A1FEE1A7D1B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0215-4674","documentHash":"f96d93e7-9254-4b2f-8620-8a6cffc11fbb"}],"objectId":"63bd2d1b40970735969c4f40","doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-8234-7_9","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Improving Autoencoders Performance for Hyperspectral Unmixing Using Clustering","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hyperspectral cameras acquire images containing information across the electromagnetic spectrum, which convey useful information about the scene. To enable effective analysis of such data, spectral unmixing is often used. It is an important task in hyperspectral imaging, allowing one to obtain the information about spectral endmembers which make up each hyperspectral pixel. This task, traditionally solved with dedicated statistical methods, has recently been explored with deep learning methods. One of the methods well-suited to this task are autoencoders. These neural networks are initialized using multiple random weights, and their initialization often has a significant impact on their efficiency. Because of that, to improve the initialization of autoencoders for the spectral unmixing task, we propose to use the pre-training scheme consisting of clustering-based artificial labeling. We test the approach on two popular hyperspectral datasets, i.e. Samson and Jasper Ridge. Our experiment delivers promising results, improving autoencoders effectiveness in the case of Samson dataset, i.e. for 25-class labeling endmembers’ and abundances’ errors improve by 0.045 and 0.008, respectively. The worse results in the case of Jasper Ridge dataset (improvement of the endmembers’ error by 0.001, and worsening of the abundances’ error by 0.006 for 25-classes labeling) show that more research is required to understand when the proposed approach improves the results of the spectral unmixing. The auxiliary experiments that we also conduct allow us to partially answer that question."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709444878c28a0473b94d3","5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","5e709444878c28a0473b94d4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621b878c287715741630","mniswId":"2188","fullName":"Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems","shortName":"ACIIDS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bbc7a810-f06f-4794-afdb-a5ac01fe1107"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63919b9b40970764e07b6699","startDate":"2022-11-28","endDate":"2022-11-30","fullName":"14th Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems","shortName":"ACIIDS 2022","city":"Ho Chi Minh City","country":"VN","website":"https://aciids.pwr.edu.pl/2022/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"abb353e7-6dd0-4e83-907c-2b0b1222deaa"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709444878c28a0473b94d3","5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","5e709444878c28a0473b94d4","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4859"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"63919ca140970764e07b83eb","doi":"10.1007/978-981-19-8234-7","title":"Recent Challenges in Intelligent Information and Database Systems: 14th Asian Conference, ACIIDS 2022, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, November 28-30, 2022, Proceedings","year":2022,"isbn":"978-981-19-8234-7","issn":"1865-0929","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-19-8234-7.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"710f4ec8-494a-47a7-95d8-4407ad873ae6"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058431570"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd4bcd40970735969fd2aa","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Duda","documentHash":"93df1bde-0a46-40f6-a3f9-e5b3494790e2"},{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"},{"objectId":"5e709247878c28a047392e2d","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"0DEC457574FAA87F53423432FA7FDF3801A1D9798E4E76FE16992F4C726EE6EA9184469B0E0F27472A57A040C07219D12A9C21FE91888586F7A96731C02E2DA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-0775-4935","documentHash":"1cacfc2c-c38b-44b8-9d8e-13039a9d7dcb"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Domańska","uuid":"4A1A11F10A925F650E6B59202EE7CBE9E2A25C68AF861B8CB2D7FF318E2B00DA7F4C678616ADC0C8082C8C1B0A3575CEC53207B122F0FC1DABD0F41341DD6884","orcidId":"0000-0002-1935-8358","documentHash":"f852ee1c-d3c4-48f8-9ff9-17b3e049a012"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63bd4bcd40970735969fd2a9","doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-06201-y","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06201-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Cost-effective filtering of unreliable proximity detection results based on BLE RSSI and IMU readings using smartphones","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Indoor environments are a major challenge in the domain of location-based services due to the inability to use GPS. Currently, Bluetooth Low Energy has been the most commonly used technology for such services due to its low cost, low power consumption, ubiquitous availability in smartphones and the dependence of the signal strength on the distance between devices. The article proposes a system that detects the proximity between static (anchors) and moving objects, evaluates the quality of this prediction and filters out the unreliable results based on custom metrics. We define three metrics: two matrics based on RSSI and Intertial Measurement Unit (IMU) readings and one joint metric. This way the filtering is based on both, the external information (RSSI) and the internal information (IMU). To process the IMU data, we use machine learning activity recognition models (we apply feature selection and compare three models and choose the best one—Gradient Boosted Decision Trees). The proposed system is flexible and can be easily customized. The great majority of operations can be conducted directly on smartphones. The solution is easy to implement, cost-efficient and can be deployed in real-life applications (MICE industry, museums, industry)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709247878c28a047392e2d","5e709245878c28a047392d1a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","5e709247878c28a047392e2d","5e709245878c28a047392d1a","63bd4bcd40970735969fd2aa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","documentHash":"b6d73d02-ec27-4baa-91e9-d28a7a700218"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058431578"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c0078a40970702a66c6469","name":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"853f70f5-c2cd-41b4-b7f7-1918705831a1"},{"objectId":"63c0078a40970702a66c6468","name":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"4b6266ec-5d7f-4997-9208-1570c97f50cf"},{"objectId":"63c0078a40970702a66c6467","name":"Shiyi","lastName":"Zheng","documentHash":"a50f904c-83c7-4187-9159-11acaa67ce83"},{"objectId":"63c0078a40970702a66c6466","name":"Yawei","lastName":"Qin","documentHash":"12a302d8-97c0-4471-a586-eb395ea4f840"},{"objectId":"63c0078a40970702a66c6465","name":"Hongyu","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"fcf0a2f3-ea48-40e3-8d7d-4167bb06f79f"},{"objectId":"63c0078a40970702a66c6464","name":"Zongbao","lastName":"Feng","documentHash":"c22cbd30-8263-493d-a0cd-a10a7402a85f"},{"objectId":"63c0078a40970702a66c6463","name":"Xianguo","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"ed654175-233b-49ae-a245-1d469962d8b2"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"63c0078a40970702a66c6461","doi":"10.1016/j.rser.2022.112703","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1364032122005925?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Intelligent optimization framework of near zero energy consumption building performance based on a hybrid machine learning algorithm","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The realization of a near zero energy consumption building (NZEB) is one of the important goals to promote the sustainable development of green buildings. To achieve the goal of NZEB and to allow for factors such as building comfort, environmental protection and cost, an intelligent optimization framework that combines Building Information Modeling DesignBuilder(BIM-DB) and random forest-nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (RF-NSGA-III) is proposed to study the multiobjective optimization of NZEB performance. The data in this paper are simulated by BIM-DB through orthogonal experimental design. RF is used to establish the complex relationship between building design parameters and NZEB performance. After the accuracy of the model is verified by the goodness of fit (R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE), the obtained nonlinear mapping relationship is taken as the fitness function of NSGA-III, and the multiobjective Pareto optimal solution set is obtained by using the proposed RF-NSGA-III intelligent optimization framework. Taking a teaching building in Wuhan as an example, the effectiveness of this method is verified. The results show that (1) the RF prediction accuracy is good, the RMSE range for the performance of NZEB is 0.015–0.035, and the R2 range is 0.91–0.93. (2) After optimization, the energy-saving rate of the building body is 21.25%, which meets the near zero energy consumption standard. (3) The proposed RF-NSGA-III intelligent optimization framework can achieve multiobjective optimization, and the comprehensive optimization rate of five objectives is the best compared with three and four objectives. Accordingly, this intelligent method that combines BIM-DB and RF-NSGA-III provides an effective idea for the design optimization of NZEB."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"167","pagesFromTo":"112703","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c0078a40970702a66c6463","63c0078a40970702a66c6464","63c0078a40970702a66c6465","63c0078a40970702a66c6466","63c0078a40970702a66c6467","63c0078a40970702a66c6468","63c0078a40970702a66c6469","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794fd","mniswId":"17182","title":"Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews","issn":"1364-0321","documentHash":"6bf36d3c-dfb3-49b5-a507-35940853a66b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c0078a40970702a66c6462","year":"2022","volume":"167","documentHash":"2514d8ad-d3c8-4add-8452-d1ed18b33a62"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058438733"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"}],"objectId":"6397062240970751e8289b4a","doi":"10.1016/j.physa.2022.126997","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378437122000802?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Constructing games on networks for controlling the inequalities in the capital distribution","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The inequality in capital or resource distribution is among the important phenomena observed in populations.

In this paper, we focus on threats related to 6 common types of threats in TensorFlow implementation. We identify them using Common Weakness Enumeration. We analyze more than 100 vulnerability instances. We focus on vulnerabilities’ severity, impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, as well as possible results of exploitation. We also use Orthogonal Defect Classification (ODC). The results show that a majority of vulnerabilities are caused by missing/incorrect checking statements, however some fixes require more advanced algorithmic changes. Static Analysis Tools tested in our study show low effectiveness in detecting known vulnerabilities in TensorFlow, but we provide some recommendations based on the obtained alerts to improve overall code quality. Further analysis of vulnerabilities helped us to understand and characterize different vulnerability types and provide a set of observations. We believe that these observations can be useful for the creators of new static analysis tools as a source of inspiration and to build the test cases. We also aim to draw the programmers’ attention to the prevalence of vulnerabilities in deep learning applications and a low effectiveness of automatic tools to find software vulnerabilities in such products."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709245878c28a047392d1a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"124","pagesFromTo":"102948","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","5e709245878c28a047392d1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777b3","mniswId":"4267","title":"COMPUTERS & SECURITY","issn":"0167-4048","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"6db7dbbd-cb09-4897-9598-afeac8af061d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058509416"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Strzoda","uuid":"B0D6BFD33F8756550BC38B6185859322A184B3218CD98302394D0F3F0656FFC9ABA9C0B7A0D1DF0937FAD3533FAC8C4EC0A7208C4C29B23D42E7C222AC2040EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3994-1428","documentHash":"de4a5946-337f-4f96-9f61-e50ef06171cd"},{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abc53","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Marjasz","uuid":"E8D6AC5A29FA294ED1BEE9D77C42213DF5440A192232E8879796967716E7FAF87CE88C81304AD79357C7E16CF0050973AACB8A99DAEA4927F24D37EEFB4F91EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9187-0009","documentHash":"933c3234-e315-4184-995f-a25ed49ce8b9"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"}],"objectId":"63a57def40970715e70b742a","publicUri":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3551662.3561260?cid=99659913397","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"How Accurate is LoRa Positioning in Realistic Conditions?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The LoRa communication technology has been developed for data transmission, but recent research papers showed that it could also be used to estimate the transmitting devices' location. The location can be found with reasonable accuracy, with median error as low as tens of meters; however, in many cases, it is evaluated in very optimistic transmission conditions, e.g. using line-of-sight communication and on a small data set. We estimate how LoRa localization performs in a realistic scenario, using an extensive data set of a telemetric network of a few thousand devices to calculate the location using the trilateration and estimate the error of the calculation. Within the analysed dataset the true-range multilateration provides highly inaccurate location estimation, with a median error of 588.64 m and an average error of 808.57 m. We argue that the LoRa localization in real-life conditions is ineffective, as the estimation of the distance between the node and the gateway changes heavily depending on the location of the node and radio channel attenuation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709384878c28a0473abc53","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","5e709444878c28a0473b94d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621b878c2877157415e6","mniswId":"76","fullName":"ACM/IEEE International Conference on Modelling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems","shortName":"MSWIM","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"b56aa313-d876-4cbd-9473-e05e9b3160b2"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63bfd65040970702a6657fb2","startDate":"2022-10-24","endDate":"2022-10-28","fullName":"ACM MSWIM 22 - The 25th International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems","shortName":"ACM MSWIM 22","city":"Montreal","country":"CA","website":"https://mswimconf.com/2022/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"e0fb39be-8bf5-4292-b709-2ab371a48be9"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","5e709384878c28a0473abc53","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058516201"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c00f6840970702a66d519f","name":"Ming","lastName":"Hu","documentHash":"68b961ec-2692-4074-b494-9a793d221cb0"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"63c00f6840970702a66d519d","doi":"10.1080/17452007.2022.2068497","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17452007.2022.2068497","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The impact of the design team characteristics on the sustainable building construction cost: structural equation model analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this study was to identify impact of the design team characteristics and project characteristics on the sustainable building construction cost (SBCC) using the structural equation model (SEM). The cost data was drawn from 72 built LEED certified buildings in the United States. The design team characteristics are latent variables used to measure a design team’s performance in the early design stages, which are reflected in six observed variables: skill, experience, communication, collaboration, innovation, and procurement. The project characteristics are also latent variables and are measured in five observed variables: level of sustainability, building type, construction type, technical complexity, and project location. The SEM analysis illustrated that the design team characteristics negatively affected the unit cost (coefficient = −3.119) and cost overrun (coefficient = −0.939). The SEM also showed that project characteristics positively affected the unit cost (coefficient = 1.00). The conclusion indicates that the higher the design team’s skill, the more experienced the design team was, and the fewer communication channels there were, the better the team could mitigate potential risks and uncertainty during the construction phase, hence reducing the risk of cost overrun."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"614-630","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c00f6840970702a66d519f","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547ba13","mniswId":"1601","title":"Architectural Engineering and Design Management","issn":"1745-2007","eissn":"1752-7589","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d5bd4f1d-2412-47f5-97fa-c7adf42db97b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c00f6840970702a66d519e","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"5","documentHash":"18f5050a-0376-4b48-960a-e37fd4ce2ae8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058585978"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c00acf40970702a66cca70","name":"Limao","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"aaaca46f-6525-4c8d-a9c9-ec6ab96e32f2"},{"objectId":"63c00acf40970702a66cca6f","name":"Yawei","lastName":"Qin","documentHash":"2765d881-213c-46c5-a01b-2ace92635618"},{"objectId":"63c00acf40970702a66cca6e","name":"Hongyu","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"cc08f437-5a35-4cb6-a43e-1fc6372907f5"},{"objectId":"63c00acf40970702a66cca6d","name":"Xianguo","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"6291e783-3c5d-4e14-b650-3069485604b2"},{"objectId":"63c00acf40970702a66cca6c","name":"Zongbao","lastName":"Feng","documentHash":"2374b96c-ed49-49bb-b996-d3af376f503c"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"63c00acf40970702a66cca6b","doi":"10.1016/j.energy.2022.123612","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0360544222005151?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"An energy performance contracting parameter optimization method based on the response surface method: A case study of a metro in China","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As an effective mechanism for improving energy efficiency, energy performance contracting (EPC) is receiving increasing attention. However, due to many uncertain factors that affect contract parameters, a reasonable distribution of participants' interests is necessary. To reasonably determine EPC contract parameters, this paper proposes a framework based on Geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the response surface method (RSM) to optimize EPC contract parameters. First, GBM is used to simulate the energy prices, energy savings, energy-saving revenue allocation, etc. Then, the RSM is proposed to optimize multiple contract parameters. Finally, the proposed method is applied to the Wuhan Metro Line 2 lighting system renovation project. The results demonstrate that (a) the contract parameter optimization framework based on the GBM-RSM provides an effective method for optimizing the combination of EPC contract parameters. (b) The GBM-based method of quantitative simulation effectively expresses the uncertain factors of energy-saving performance in EPC renovation and provides reasonable data support for optimizing EPC contract parameters. (c) The established response surface optimization model of EPC contract parameters is an efficiently fitted model. A comparison between the optimization results and actual application results shows the feasibility of response surface optimization of EPC contract parameters, which improves the benefits for the owner of energy-saving renovation and thus increases the owner's enthusiasm, while guaranteeing a reasonable return for energy-saving companies.

The results indicate that different BIM applications provide various proinnovation environments wherein CI may flourish. Extra attention should be paid to BIM-enabled systematic collaborative innovation and digital innovation ecosystems with BIM as the core infrastructure that integrates the physical space with cyberspace to accelerate radical innovation. This study extends BIM management research by considering digital innovation and providing a new perspective for CI management theory and practice.

This work examines the problem of single-shot discrimination between process matrices which are an universal method defining a causal structure. We provide an exact expression for the optimal probability of correct distinction. In addition, we present an alternative way to achieve this expression by using the convex cone structure theory. We also express the discrimination task as semidefinite programming. Due to that, we have created the SDP calculating the distance between process matrices and we quantify it in terms of the trace norm. As a valuable by-product, the program finds an optimal realization of the discrimination task. We also find two classes of process matrices which can be distinguished perfectly. Our main result, however, is a consideration of the discrimination task for process matrices corresponding to quantum combs. We study which strategy, adaptive or non-signalling, should be used during the discrimination task. We proved that no matter which strategy you choose, the probability of distinguishing two process matrices being a quantum comb is the same."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","5e709444878c28a0473b94d5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709444878c28a0473b94d5","5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"3ee113d7-e583-4a13-8002-d0395774636a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058694333"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"649ab541409707195f0232c2","name":"Cüneyt","lastName":"Güzeliş","documentHash":"dd5ea52d-1407-4bd9-a4ee-dfdb7a07b319"},{"objectId":"649ab541409707195f0232c1","name":"Emrah","lastName":"Biyik","documentHash":"a1f74c85-fdc8-4de6-9465-bb8d7863f381"},{"objectId":"649ab541409707195f0232c0","name":"Onur","lastName":"Çopur","documentHash":"46f04f6b-e149-4eaf-9b15-8f32092f389e"},{"objectId":"5f532814752340073806a95f","name":"Mert","lastName":"Nakip","uuid":"6EE14383BEC5E308B4B31DB96075B5B9D11B8A3380D47274C583232C87DFE62BA1A38BDA3547E4792533BA246FBB798E501DC0CB82FB2CDB3128BF0BF7CAC8CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6723-6494","documentHash":"d9b43af6-35d8-4aeb-b4af-c25f660650fa"}],"objectId":"649ab541409707195f0232be","doi":"10.1016/j.apenergy.2023.121014","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0306261923003781?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Renewable energy management in smart home environment via forecast embedded scheduling based on Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Smart home energy management systems help the distribution grid operate more efficiently and reliably, and enable effective penetration of distributed renewable energy sources. These systems rely on robust forecasting, optimization, and control/scheduling algorithms that can handle the uncertain nature of demand and renewable generation. This paper proposes an advanced ML algorithm, called Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network based Forecast Embedded Scheduling (rTPNN-FES), to provide efficient residential demand control. rTPNN-FES is a novel neural network architecture that simultaneously forecasts renewable energy generation and schedules household appliances. By its embedded structure, rTPNN-FES eliminates the utilization of separate algorithms for forecasting and scheduling and generates a schedule that is robust against forecasting errors. This paper also evaluates the performance of the proposed algorithm for an IoT-enabled smart home. The evaluation results reveal that rTPNN-FES provides near-optimal scheduling 37.5 times faster than the optimization while outperforming state-of-the-art forecasting techniques."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"340","pagesFromTo":"121014","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["649ab541409707195f0232c0","649ab541409707195f0232c1","649ab541409707195f0232c2","5f532814752340073806a95f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477122","mniswId":"1463","title":"Applied Energy","issn":"0306-2619","eissn":"0306-2619","documentHash":"9d19992b-ebc8-4b3e-859c-3f1226051964"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649ab541409707195f0232bf","year":"2023","volume":"340","documentHash":"d36d6d73-5956-4867-8c82-3a0674deebd6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058694539"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"649ab133409707195f01e35b","name":"Aritra","lastName":"Sarkar","documentHash":"04a65c7b-e235-4365-80da-c25512a6349a"},{"objectId":"649ab133409707195f01e35a","name":"Tamal","lastName":"Acharya","documentHash":"2f902008-9f04-4930-8ae7-d4ee5b2f1cb2"},{"objectId":"649ab133409707195f01e359","name":"Bao Gia","lastName":"Bach","documentHash":"804c1fd1-62bf-4230-a0eb-cf0d9476e001"},{"objectId":"61b6be387523402a58cb0715","name":"Akash ","lastName":"Kundu ","uuid":"48B4FABA47A4E541C4E25ADD51BADBEDF1A41546DCC138A847E050229060A2DA2520FB6393DE49C13D554132B2B2CE431472F6479E346C0D082589589285D015","documentHash":"ea477fa4-c2cb-4a2c-a2d4-ce6a9ff1caf2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"649ab133409707195f01e358","doi":"10.3390/e25050763","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/5/763/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Visualizing Quantum Circuit Probability: Estimating Quantum State Complexity for Quantum Program Synthesis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work applies concepts from algorithmic probability to Boolean and quantum combinatorial logic circuits.

Furthermore, we show that the choice of the measurement basis in the protocol can drastically affect the fidelity of quantum teleportation and we argue that perfect information transfer can be attained by choosing an adequate basis reflecting the salient properties of the quantum channel, i.e. Hubbard projective measurements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62f5bb287523404ea24196c9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["649ab48a409707195f022a41","62f5bb287523404ea24196c9","649ab48a409707195f022a42"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"3ee113d7-e583-4a13-8002-d0395774636a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058818487"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"650ae2884097070d18c1f962","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Krupska‐Wolas","documentHash":"bd8ebe7f-475d-4c58-87ca-e2fbf19db841"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa031","name":"Michał","lastName":"Romaszewski","uuid":"794BD3547A8C73952F65D57A0FD3FF33B13690959E9AE28F002050B9026AF3C5143015AF3D68A11D34922CD16D0846F6C5095BBBD497B639C920863DF2126982","orcidId":"0000-0002-8227-929X","documentHash":"06589218-e8d0-4a53-9e39-8d8ccfadb95c"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Głomb","uuid":"67B5DF4EBEF036D7B1861B26A48C3ABE0E65A55A852DCAAEEF5DFCD3DEF99C6112C878B3A303C0B2F361D1FD7CAE0F6524E3EE80853F54592EC6A1FEE1A7D1B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0215-4674","documentHash":"f96d93e7-9254-4b2f-8620-8a6cffc11fbb"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a53ea","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"CIEMIĘGA","uuid":"FAE895016828BD24AA4D603EACD668DF8FA7514E93ABA0BF8E470ECE1A8E07B8812C177F0660CB607E02188CE026DF9484D9C6DC02C9CE667BEB6DA1145D79C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-8837-8862","documentHash":"a439c5e6-ad2b-4b7c-b90d-725e65616280"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f45b","name":"Krystian","lastName":"Prusik","uuid":"E84855E2F232C46C771F713243524D199A955B85410863EB02330CB25B7FA814A0D5901048EA3CB39A55FF91FA1BC0113300038670E3621BE414A2A151C3E0DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0538-0749","documentHash":"f6346000-d355-4c2a-a8d0-6ac967e33328"},{"objectId":"5e7092b2878c28a04739aed0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"MARESZ","uuid":"6674678B750470CA8B4970E8B95923C56E3CAA72E5ABBA217C43AFB68C37664DEB119496CB872CD0CB83085463797C3680B3C19A756E73C841BA31E91B2D9654","orcidId":"0000-0002-5348-7911","documentHash":"8158a253-2888-442a-bddd-abd8327fe4a7"}],"objectId":"650ae2884097070d18c1f95f","doi":"10.1002/ppsc.202200204","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ppsc.202200204","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Hyperspectral Imaging as a Facile and Non‐Destructive Method for Size Analysis of Gold Nanoparticles Deposited on Porous Materials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Herein, the feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for fast and non-destructive size estimation of supported gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) is demonstrated.

Under the greenness-based subsidy policy, the government provides subsidies based on NEVs’ carbon emission reduction to consumers. Under the dual credit policy, the FV manufacturer has to purchase NEV credits from the NEV manufacturer before starting to manufacture. The government’s optimal subsidy strategy and the two manufacturers’ pricing and production strategies of two kinds of vehicles are studied. The impact of consumers’ low-carbon awareness, NEVs’ carbon emission reduction, unit production cost, and unit cost gap between two kinds of vehicles with respect to equilibrium decisions are analyzed. The results show that both the greenness-based subsidy policy and dual credit policy can improve NEVs’ market share when the manufacturing cost gap is relatively low, and enhance the NEV firm’s competitiveness when the investment cost of greenness-enhancement is relatively low. The subsidy policy can improve social welfare, whereas the dual credit policy is harmful to social welfare. In terms of promoting the sales and profits of NEVs, both the subsidy policy and dual credit policy can play a positive role under different conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"185","pagesFromTo":"109620","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["653ba9014097072fe52ab9ce","6520c2a940e3ff22d3492b00","653ba9014097072fe52ab9d0","653ba9014097072fe52ab9d1","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777b0","mniswId":"4264","title":"Computers and Industrial Engineering","issn":"0360-8352","eissn":"1879-0550","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-industrial-engineering/","documentHash":"94b36bde-84cb-41e5-a7a8-a05f720dfa78"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["New energy vehicle","Carbon emission reduction","Consumers’ low-carbon awareness","Government subsidy","Dual-credit policy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058970821"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709418878c28a0473b6184","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Wojewódka-Ściążko","uuid":"D2B4B669AC5BDA289FF470C285838E955349CEC8C3F17E9C5880F4CC50B37B50E7028CB55562E1D9FC1F8F6F7F0141FF0E8634B83874A53CACA444F93913A124","orcidId":"0000-0002-8248-5018","documentHash":"fe573664-2fad-4fd8-bcff-b37d83b70568"},{"objectId":"5e7093ce878c28a0473b1208","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Czapla","uuid":"D167D24A18BF6AE46607BAE4C4611D428EFCFCC5DCBC3FAFAA277D7B4C64040933F5E8319009F86BEF51A2C55180582A01BE4241ACDD2B6D48C10A2CDE6A83DA","orcidId":"0000-0002-0562-773X","documentHash":"f28e9a92-f3f6-4dc0-ab7d-4490f8bf638a"},{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739ee4f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Horbacz","uuid":"9F85FEC9F533D5CD725675DF383E89E4BF4C2E5BDBC3041B3A3DCCDC3A8B34BBB7F0172512AAF1D1B47D4716789887252044A2C54020B39E760B19EC3110168C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2900-0031","documentHash":"6db4168b-69d6-446c-9802-5a4aa066d961"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"650e34274097071947fef038","doi":"10.1007/s12346-023-00862-4","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12346-023-00862-4","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Central Limit Theorem for Markov Processes that are Exponentially Ergodic in the Bounded-Lipschitz Norm","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we establish a version of the central limit theorem for Markov–Feller continuous time processes (with a Polish state space) that are exponentially ergodic in the bounded-Lipschitz distance and enjoy a continuous form of the Foster–Lyapunov condition.

This is the first approach that uses the Entropy value directly for pooling rather than creating a weighting mechanism for feature maps obtained via convolution. This way, we use the ”amount” of information (expressed by Entropy) to describe the feature maps in contrast to the most commonly used averaging (Global Average Pooling, GAP). We use our method in a rather unusual way. We replace GAP with GEP and use the same feature extractor and classifier weights for the prediction — with no additional training. Our layer can be easily integrated (instead of the GAP layer) into various pre-trained CNN models. From a technical perspective, it is possible to integrate GEP without additional training, because it does not contain any parameters that have to be trained. Also, its input and output have the same format as the GAP’s one. We examine how the replacement impacts the model behavior. Despite a completely different form of pooling, utilization of the GEP layer in the examined pre-trained models (InceptionV3, Xception and InceptionResNetV2) allowed us to obtain some accuracy improvements in comparison to the original networks on the subsets of the ImageNet dataset. Moreover, networks modified with our layer exhibit an interesting property — they are more ”confident” in the predictions they return. It manifests itself through higher values of the probabilities assigned to correctly predicted classes. This opens a possibility to use not only the initial layers of the pretrained network, but also to modify network’s middle parts and reuse its classifier trained on an original model as well."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709245878c28a047392d1a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"555","pagesFromTo":"126615","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","5e709245878c28a047392d1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fd0","mniswId":"14934","title":"NEUROCOMPUTING","issn":"0925-2312","eissn":"0925-2312","documentHash":"6b1f8ef5-77a3-4569-8323-284325e7fdb7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658d44934097071376084724","year":"2023","volume":"555","documentHash":"968ee04c-d323-46c1-8486-5534e9c2cec3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059183787"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658d6e8340970713760ce464","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Semenov","documentHash":"cc78c9e3-0c80-4064-a207-62a8442f1cb6"},{"objectId":"658d6e8340970713760ce463","name":"Mohd Anul","lastName":"Haq","documentHash":"74462131-796b-4578-8bf8-114af81fa0c6"},{"objectId":"658d6e8340970713760ce462","name":"Vyacheslav","lastName":"Kharchenko","documentHash":"753aac16-e1cf-41a4-a97f-0f9b471eb91a"},{"objectId":"651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","name":"Viacheslav","lastName":"Kovtun","uuid":"9FC62B6CAFD057D03E6804B3F80616C02A8D90918E4C8860CB76DF6E0D495E2CFBF9B48C39D339CD5EE3E10A5B4FC53850D3BFF0F25D48826EEEEEAAE921D9DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7624-7072","documentHash":"f9a3daf0-7063-4e84-974c-0517698c246d"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"658d6e8340970713760ce461","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-49007-2","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49007-2.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Stochastic forecasting of variable small data as a basis for analyzing an early stage of a cyber epidemic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) technologies play an important role in the architecture of modern cyber protection tools. One of the main scenarios for the use of SIEM is the detection of attacks on protected information infrastructure. Consorting that ISO 27001, NIST SP 800-61, and NIST SP 800-83 standards objectively do not keep up with the evolution of cyber threats, research aimed at forecasting the development of cyber epidemics is relevant. The article proposes a stochastic concept of describing variable small data on the Shannon entropy basis. The core of the concept is the description of small data by linear differential equations with stochastic characteristic parameters. The practical value of the proposed concept is embodied in the method of forecasting the\ndevelopment of a cyber epidemic at an early stage (in conditions of a lack of empirical information). In the context of the research object, the stochastic characteristic parameters of the model are the generation rate, the death rate, and the independent coefficient of variability of the measurement of the initial parameter of the research object. Analytical expressions for estimating the probability distribution densities of these characteristic parameters are proposed. It is assumed that these stochastic parameters of the model are imposed on the intervals, which allows for manipulation of the nature and type of the corresponding functions of the probability distribution densities. The task of finding optimal functions of the probability distribution densities of the characteristic parameters\nof the model with maximum entropy is formulated. The proposed method allows for generating sets of trajectories of values of characteristic parameters with optimal functions of the probability distribution densities. The example demonstrates both the flexibility and reliability of the proposed concept and method in comparison with the concepts of forecasting numerical series implemented in the base of Matlab functions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","658d6e8340970713760ce462","658d6e8340970713760ce463","658d6e8340970713760ce464"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059187454"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658d7f8240970713760ea2cc","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kempa","documentHash":"74edb374-4c5a-45de-bda0-d2ce238b8c7a"},{"objectId":"651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","name":"Viacheslav","lastName":"Kovtun","uuid":"9FC62B6CAFD057D03E6804B3F80616C02A8D90918E4C8860CB76DF6E0D495E2CFBF9B48C39D339CD5EE3E10A5B4FC53850D3BFF0F25D48826EEEEEAAE921D9DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7624-7072","documentHash":"f9a3daf0-7063-4e84-974c-0517698c246d"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"},{"objectId":"5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Połys","uuid":"ADE4B07DB1C8B5BA8A18065ADE4F3B183CC049C5C42CF8C2C6FA17441262138F448972AFEFBFC90EE7C93E8F4F04D93F0FDC14D693FA020625F944B58B7255A3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2794-3450","documentHash":"2adc629f-ac82-4ca8-81f7-f834dd4071e7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-06","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"658d7f8240970713760ea2ca","doi":"10.3390/electronics12244920","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/24/4920/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Reliably Controlling Massive Traffic between a Sensor Network End Internet of Things Device Environment and a Hub Using Transmission Control Protocol Mechanisms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The constant growth of Internet of Things traffic is ensured by the ongoing evolution of\nthe hierarchy of all hardware links of sensor networks. At the same time, the implementation of the Edge computing ideology regulates the complexity of the “first-mile” section (from the sensors array to the peripheral server). Here, the authors suggest paying attention to the growing share of massive traffic from target sensors in the total traffic of the sensors array. This circumstance makes it expedient to introduce an additional link to the peripheral server for summarizing massive traffic from target sensors. The authors present a sensor network end IoT device (SNEIoTD), implemented\ngrounded on a reliable and cheap Raspberry Pi computing platform, as such a link. The introduction of this SNEIoTD makes it possible to reduce the probability of information loss from the critical infrastructure of a smart city and increase the flexibility of controlling the massive traffic of the first mile. In this context, the urgent task is the reliable control of information transfer from the SNEIoTD environment to a hub, which the authors formalize based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). This article proposes a mathematical model of the interaction of the main mechanisms of the TCP in the form of a queuing system. As part of this model, a semi-Markov process of an information transfer with a unified speed is selected and its stationary distribution is analytically formalized. A computationally efficient information technology for determining the TCPWindow Size is formulated, taking into account the interaction of TCP mechanisms in the process of massive traffic control. Using the example of TCP Westwood+ protocol modification, it is shown that the results of the application of information technology permit increases in the stability of data transfer\nunder the circumstances of increasing Round-Trip Times."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"4920","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","658d7f8240970713760ea2cc","5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics","issn":"2079-9292","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"84e7903c-f300-44fa-a9fd-204491284c02"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"658d7f8240970713760ea2cb","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"24","documentHash":"b5d02092-da7a-4f7d-9fbd-aa1600a4e33c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059193709"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","name":"Akash ","lastName":"Kundu ","uuid":"70EF4FF1C1BF816CC3B984BCD37EA6A8D6FD08B7B5F083C04D729C4496000CCD839F3A895088F8E4A8A66892E390213313379D4319F9CE4E542CE870D22450B5","documentHash":"8452fc8c-3054-495d-a245-09e1edeca4ad"},{"objectId":"61454f299543c7051ff01cf2","name":"Özlem","lastName":"Salehi Köken","uuid":"1BB864961AD1BECAA93CE2DA320078B3E414A265EC5D68F29DE1741522DCEA349BDDB4F25FBE838F8E7F9A2FEF2DBF9F89C28CB843E92C036CA8CD80223402E3","documentHash":"b5f48943-137b-482a-9b7f-9d2442249283"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa430","name":"Adam","lastName":"Glos","uuid":"36560034A39468FB258FD97A695698C29235FFCDC7F0417AAD29FCDC2B0FB7F17F23E2B39ED7962591350FFC3DFFE2D4F376983D82B9FA2F8D9CF67DD037C8F3","orcidId":"0000-0001-6320-7699","documentHash":"aff4e283-b1a9-4fe9-99f8-51bad4fe7a10"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"658d51c74097071376099eaf","doi":"10.1007/s42979-023-02071-x","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42979-023-02071-x.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Optimizing the Production of Test Vehicles Using Hybrid Constrained Quantum Annealing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Optimization of pre-production vehicle configurations is one of the challenges in the automotive industry. Given a list of tests requiring cars with certain features, it is desirable to find the minimum number of cars that cover the tests and obey the configuration rules. In this paper, we model the problem in the framework of satisfiability and solve it utilizing the newly introduced hybrid constrained quadratic model (CQM) solver provided by D-Wave. The problem definition is based on the “Optimizing the Production of Test Vehicles” use-case given in the BMW quantum computing challenge. We formulate a constrained quadratic model for the problem and use a greedy algorithm to configure the cars. We benchmark the results obtained from the CQM solver with the results from the classical solvers like coin-or branch and cut and Gurobi solver. We conclude that the performance of the CQM solver is comparable to the classical solvers in optimizing the number of test vehicles, given the noise-prone quantum hardware. However, the CQM solver takes much more time, which prohibits obtaining useful quantum advantages. As an extension to the problem, we describe how the scheduling of the tests can be incorporated into the model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","5e709375878c28a0473aa430"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"4","issue":"5","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709375878c28a0473aa430","66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","61454f299543c7051ff01cf2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"64f04bf6cf9a7471b0ea3f24","mniswId":"31558","title":"SN Computer Science","issn":"2662-995X","eissn":"2661-8907","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"802e4410-e59c-4dc4-99ad-e836fccf2fe1"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059193760"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6581af3b409707482c2a7b78","name":"Filip B.","lastName":"Maciejewski","documentHash":"58daf7d1-e8d8-43bd-8df5-108d9a8af055"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Puchała","uuid":"084E5F6A60B0C0CA41B364C281E70B8FFF17CAB5C42C464CF3B473E5DDDE7CF4F75350AFE021EEFC95F81444AEB0EDF8B955A7569D9FAC1A7DC77CAD370DD038","orcidId":"0000-0002-4739-0400","documentHash":"a6454553-3823-42b4-904b-d14ce1638536"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a72a5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Oszmaniec","uuid":"93BCA83A52CC970812777EF1009A06EFA1BF261D549A394974D04AF0C17502D73F7A8A4FE43A27362F8EFEB89F1232D65E2200E0E698F6B7C14FF587634D31BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4946-6835","documentHash":"1e6a92a0-c6d3-4b88-a054-55d9c193d06e"}],"objectId":"6581af3b409707482c2a7b77","doi":"10.22331/q-2023-09-11-1106","publicUri":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-09-11-1106/pdf/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Operational Quantum Average-Case Distances","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","uid":"bWWUVYe-Cljroqid25B6Vkw","uuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","name":"Centrum Fizyki Teoretycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a72a5"],"parentId":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","parentUuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","rootId":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","rootUuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"1106","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6581af3b409707482c2a7b78","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","5e709352878c28a0473a72a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d018","mniswId":"16923","title":"Quantum","issn":"2521-327X","eissn":"2521-327X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"9f86b1af-c370-4a2d-9cd0-07f2b5088441"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6581945c409707482c2819b8","year":"2023","volume":"7","documentHash":"50e6f296-2fa7-4922-8e87-f156ce313b3a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059217888"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"}],"objectId":"659ea88a4097077f7b566890","doi":"10.1088/1402-4896/acfc6c","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/acfc6c","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Rule switching mechanisms in the Game of Life with synchronous and asynchronous updating policy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The emergence of complex structures in the systems governed by a simple set of rules is among the most fascinating aspects of Nature.

We also demonstrate that the choice of the synchronization policy can be used to control the trade-off between the stability and the growth in the system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"98","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"115210","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479257","mniswId":"16067","title":"PHYSICA SCRIPTA","doi":"10.1088/issn.1402-4896","issn":"0031-8949","documentHash":"447f3473-bd29-4a53-a874-90f4195797f5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659ea88a4097077f7b566891","year":"2023","volume":"98","number":"11","documentHash":"724e09f4-8a46-4074-885b-849ae5f16d70"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059231012"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6024b9df9543c7744e88f35a","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Jałowiecki","uuid":"A7FAB60E6C1FC74D992B19737C00296A00416BAF2D837CC088C734A67D25945A1B539E21EAEF2505564B250158FD9EBC8A4F1D5C62DAFD5B55A0A0FD716312CA","documentHash":"2da1cf2d-eb70-4dfd-b3dd-3118d027acbd"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d5","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Lewandowska","uuid":"D1D458975F5D7106EB19D65289259344A30207DAF9035FD3E365EEA5F075ECFBC78B2D940D2C585E27A721D2BD08F49DB5010AD0B527C012496F15B5C0BD5937","orcidId":"0000-0003-1564-7782","documentHash":"337d1a03-66ac-488a-93ab-d10c53f2c7fb"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawela","uuid":"068B730D2C136A32A8BA02EE7CD80A8C260FDD4556CF79F5C2F70EDDF891933ACE74BCB5A2F5F4BDC3024342BFF8AE78616CB1C0A435CA6477DA4C1A6F40E51B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0476-7132","documentHash":"0edf79c6-1d52-4bb1-a0da-0af3724cb1c1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"659ea43b4097077f7b5600d6","doi":"10.1016/j.softx.2023.101558","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352711023002546?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"PyQBench: A Python library for benchmarking gate-based quantum computers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We introduce PyQBench, an innovative open-source framework for benchmarking gate-based quantum computers.

In the context of real estate enterprises, credit risk assessment provides a basis for banks and other financial institutions to choose suitable investment objects. Additionally, it encourages real estate enterprises to abide by market norms and provide reliable information for the standardized management of the real estate industry. However, Chinese real estate companies are hesitant to disclose their actual operating data due to privacy concerns, making subjective evaluation approaches inevitable, occupying important roles in accomplishing Chinese real estate enterprise credit risk assessment tasks. To improve the normative and reliability of credit risk assessment for Chinese real estate enterprises, this study proposes an integrated multi-criteria group decision-making approach. First, a credit risk assessment index for Chinese real estate enterprises is established. Then, the proposed framework combines proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets and preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation II methods. This approach is suitable for processing large amounts of data with high uncertainty, which is often the case in credit risk assessment tasks of Chinese real estate enterprises involving massive subjective evaluation information. Finally, the proposed model is validated through a case study accompanied by sensitivity and comparative analyses to verify its rationality and feasibility. This study contributes to the research on credit assessment for Chinese real estate enterprises and provides a revised paradigm for real estate enterprise credit risk assessment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659fec0540970707a12fe44e","659fec0540970707a12fe44f","659fec0540970707a12fe450","659fec0540970707a12fe451","659fec0540970707a12fe452","659fec0540970707a12fe453","659fec0540970707a12fe454","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c160","mniswId":"6600","title":"Financial Innovation","issn":"2199-4730","eissn":"2199-4730","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6154f965-9fc0-46e4-9aee-73bcc6c0f82b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659fec0540970707a12fe44d","year":"2023","volume":"9","number":"1","documentHash":"b797fbaf-836a-4bfa-8ebc-0d16ff9d0f6e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059237961"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659ff22c40970707a1306fd1","name":"Zhipeng","lastName":"Qi","documentHash":"fe3e372a-7c31-4520-bf3d-ac140dee6ef5"},{"objectId":"659ff22c40970707a1306fd0","name":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"81868a01-9a42-49b6-a6d7-cbb6372d7652"},{"objectId":"659ff22c40970707a1306fcf","name":"Sai","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"af2f8c77-2d40-4323-9185-8e0090156537"},{"objectId":"659ff22c40970707a1306fce","name":"Xuhui","lastName":"Cong","documentHash":"d164a0f1-1a2f-45e8-a570-9cf7ce69f05f"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"659ff22c40970707a1306fcc","doi":"10.3846/tede.2023.18792","publicUri":"https://journals.vilniustech.lt/index.php/TEDE/article/view/18792/11673","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"NEW SMART CITY CLUSTERS’ CONSTRUCTION LEVEL EVALUATION UNDER ECONOMIC CIRCLES: THE CASE OF SHANDONG, CHINA","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"China’s Shandong Province plans to create a new smart city cluster that is developmentfocused, demand-led, people-oriented, and data-driven. This entails the scientific assessment of construction levels, analysis of potential hurdles, and formulation of upgraded strategies. However, existing research has mainly focused on measuring single or multiple traditional smart cities, therein overlooking the construction level of new smart city clusters. Thus, this study takes the new smart city clusters in Shandong Province and uses both entropy method and the Moran index to analyze the construction level and spatial differences in the four dimensions of social livelihood, economic production, innovation-driven development, and safeguard measures. Results show that the construction level of the provincial capital economic circle is uneven and has polarization issues. Meanwhile, the construction level of Jiaodong economic circle is relatively good, although the economic driving capacity needs further improvement. The low urbanization rate of the Lunan economic circle occupies a gathering zone with low construction levels, making the construction of digital villages necessary. Targeted suggestions in improving the radiationdriven capacity of core cities, improving digital infrastructure, and developing smart industries are then forwarded to promote the establishment of new smart city clusters and achieve top-notch economic growth."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"949-980","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659ff22c40970707a1306fce","659ff22c40970707a1306fcf","659ff22c40970707a1306fd0","659ff22c40970707a1306fd1","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798de","mniswId":"19300","title":"Technological and Economic Development of Economy","issn":"2029-4913","eissn":"2029-4921","documentHash":"37f64a55-a1df-4dd7-a8cf-556415305791"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659ff22c40970707a1306fcd","year":"2023","volume":"29","number":"3","documentHash":"8050380c-d0ee-4cf2-ba78-d099a0d2c245"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059238075"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659ff1a440970707a130650f","name":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"378db026-d570-4f1e-a473-ef0b02e9a2bc"},{"objectId":"659ff1a440970707a130650e","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"8d0654af-5980-4961-b9a5-bab3b57216cf"},{"objectId":"659ff1a440970707a130650d","name":"Yawei","lastName":"Qin","documentHash":"f253c163-a8f0-4cb2-8814-272ce1a78343"},{"objectId":"659ff1a440970707a130650c","name":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"effadd7e-ba2f-41f0-af94-bc3f55b79b18"},{"objectId":"659ff1a440970707a130650b","name":"Zongbao","lastName":"Feng","documentHash":"16a53e92-6145-44af-8b5f-b564a2042d87"},{"objectId":"659ff1a440970707a130650a","name":"Xinyi","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"b46a32fc-bcf9-453d-b23d-289384155c3e"},{"objectId":"659ff1a440970707a1306509","name":"Hongyu","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"da589bc5-3adb-467d-932a-109ece543920"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"659ff1a440970707a1306508","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2023.03.004","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0020025523003006?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Shield attitude prediction based on Bayesian-LGBM machine learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Effective shield attitude control is essential for the quality and safety of shield construction.

Several useful properties and application characteristics of the EPG operator are highlighted. Subsequently, the proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic normalized Manhattan distance is proposed, which is a basic concept for the construction of the proportional hesitant fuzzy linguistic extended power geometry (PHFLEPG) operator. Combined with the clustering model for decision-makers, a PHFLEPG-operator-based consensus-reaching approach is provided to simplify and rationalize the decision-making process. Furthermore, the comprehensive LSGDM result is derived by utilizing the PHFLEPG operator.

The result of each iteration of the measurement is an instance of the class of the investigated object in the form of a set of values of characteristic parameters. An ordered set of instances forms a collection whose dimensionality for a real object is a factor that cannot be ignored. Managing the dimensionality of data collections, as well as classification, regression, and clustering, are fundamental problems for machine learning. Compactification is the approximation of the original data collection by an equivalent collection (with a reduced dimension of characteristic parameters) with the control of accompanying information capacity losses. Related to compactification is the data completeness verifying procedure, which is characteristic of the data reliability assessment. If there are stochastic parameters among the initial data collection characteristic parameters, the compactification procedure becomes more complicated. To take this into account, this study proposes a model of a structured collection of stochastic data defined in terms of relative entropy. The compactification of such a data model is formalized by an iterative procedure aimed at maximizing the relative entropy of sequential implementation of direct and reverse projections of data collections, taking into account the estimates of the probability distribution densities of their attributes. The procedure for approximating the relative entropy function of compactification to reduce the computational complexity of the latter is proposed. To qualitatively assess compactification this study undertakes a formal analysis that uses data collection information capacity and the absolute and relative share of information losses due to compaction as its metrics. Taking into account the semantic connection of compactification and completeness, the proposed metric is also relevant for the task of assessing data reliability. Testing the proposed compactification procedure proved both its stability and efficiency in comparison with previously used analogues, such as the principal component analysis method and the random projection method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1567","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","659e8dab4097077f7b53c127","659e8dab4097077f7b53c128","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","659e8dab4097077f7b53c129"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ae1","mniswId":"5774","title":"Entropy","issn":"1099-4300","eissn":"1099-4300","documentHash":"326c4a3d-8fe2-43e4-b926-8473e54837e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"657ae3a14097071019305220","year":"2023","volume":"25","number":"12","documentHash":"f12f5bee-6d60-43f9-adf5-d9249f5f6769"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059241700"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d4","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Książek","uuid":"D89949D0F75B67CE9F451472DB19F0A6BF6D7F2F2606150E9584C9AD3B6D03C289B6EBD4439677FD75526EDC2F4B4445D9A69DDC82967012B66F54FA88F553A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0201-6220","documentHash":"b61af690-ba0e-4f43-8e0c-7952ac630f87"},{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abb64","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"06E31499A431605B816F23C8733E2FE4AD9AF5979AD8076B48B21A21F3F2D15765BAE5CC5BC2452E6E1187FB8F17E95ACDA9AE7E806A3F99353D6B631F05A241","orcidId":"0000-0003-0695-8386","documentHash":"2ec9cfdc-080f-43c7-8474-892cee793eee"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa3d2","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"E3D24B6A5C01404811271B9409004C30CEF27B269279C11F33661E241358397FCC27AAE784C6A864CADDD6B00DB2DA85780AEFB8B935CD942534D850CF6DE056","orcidId":"0000-0003-0380-8411","documentHash":"9b05653a-732f-4e28-813e-63b890464eb3"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"659ea7174097077f7b564319","doi":"10.24425/bpasts.2023.147340","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/128931/PDF-MASTER/BPASTS_2023_71_6_3833.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A deep learning method for hard-hat-wearing detection based on head center localization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years, a lot of attention has been paid to deep learning methods in the context of vision-based construction site safety\nsystems.

We deliver a short survey of the most popular approaches in the field of quantum software development, pointing their strengths and weaknesses. This helps to formulate a list of desirable characteristics which should be included in quantum computing frameworks. Next, we describe a software architecture and its preliminary implementation supporting the development of quantum programs using symbolic approach, encouraging the functional programming paradigm, and, at the same, time enabling the integration with high-performance and cloud computing. The described software consists of several packages developed to address different needs, but nevertheless sharing common design concepts.

SSS is a requirement-driven multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem and the existing pieces of literature have attempted to integrate quality function deployment (QFD) with various MCDM methods to model the problem. However, these models have not conducted SSS based on stakeholders’ satisfaction from alternatives and used the weights of criteria obtained from stakeholders’ preferences for requirements, which is used to model the compensation among satisfaction levels of different requirements, to guide the compensation among alternatives’ performances on different criteria. In order to address these deficiencies, this paper develops a novel generalized (QFD)-based MCDM structure for SSS, based on which we further design a QFD-based multi-stakeholders and multi-experts MCDM model considering stakeholders’ consensus of interest and wisdom of expert crowds. Firstly, multiple stakeholder groups with multiple participants in each one are asked to output their expectations and preferences for their own requirements; within each group, the algorithm for consensus reaching process (CRP) is designed to formulate the acceptable collective expectations, and the best-worst method (BWM) method integrated with an algorithm for consistency improving process (CIP) and an algorithm for CRP is developed to weight requirements. Secondly, multiple experts use basic uncertain linguistic information (BULI) to characterize performances of alternatives on criteria and the relationship between requirements and criteria, and a method of weighting individual judgments with the capability of drawing on the wisdom of crowds (WOC) while accommodating organizers’ trust level in reliability given by experts is used to facilitate formulating a collective judgment. Thirdly, for each alternative and each requirement of each stakeholder group, we can quantify the comprehensive performance of the alternative on the requirement with the help of QFD, based on which and the group’s expectation we can use the value function of prospect theory to quantify the group’s satisfaction of the requirement from the alternative; aggregating the weighted satisfaction levels of requirements gives rise to the comprehensive satisfaction level of each group from each alternative, and then the Maximin decision rule is introduced to rank alternatives because of its ability to accommodate the non-compensation among different stakeholder groups. Finally, a case study is conducted to investigate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"175","pagesFromTo":"108903","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659ff52740970707a130b4fb","659ff52740970707a130b4fc","659ff52740970707a130b4fd","659ff52740970707a130b4fe","659ff52740970707a130b4ff","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777b0","mniswId":"4264","title":"Computers and Industrial Engineering","issn":"0360-8352","eissn":"1879-0550","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computers-and-industrial-engineering/","documentHash":"94b36bde-84cb-41e5-a7a8-a05f720dfa78"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659ff52740970707a130b4fa","year":"2023","volume":"175","documentHash":"345ec8cb-2a28-461a-a198-7f861e930a1b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059252483"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Strzoda","uuid":"B0D6BFD33F8756550BC38B6185859322A184B3218CD98302394D0F3F0656FFC9ABA9C0B7A0D1DF0937FAD3533FAC8C4EC0A7208C4C29B23D42E7C222AC2040EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3994-1428","documentHash":"de4a5946-337f-4f96-9f61-e50ef06171cd"}],"objectId":"659fcbec40970707a12bf1d0","doi":"10.15199/59.2023.4.79","publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/publikacja-144807-2023-4.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Zastosowanie Heurystyki do Wyboru Lokalizacji Węzłów Pośredniczących w Sieciach LP WAN","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przedmiotem pracy jest propozycja algorytmu wyboru węzłów pośredniczących w sieciach LP WAN dla urządzeń końcowych znajdujących się w położeniu o niekorzystnych warunkach transmisyjnych powodujących utratę pakietów.

In this paper, variable radian 3D printing nozzle is firstly developed to verify the controllability of extruded concrete material based on self-developed 3D building printer. Then, variable radian forming theory is presented and used to evaluate the mechanism material fracture and accumulation, and improve the molding quality of nonlinear structure. Finally, simulation analysis and experiments are designed to explore the controllable mechanism of variable radian molding and verify the consistency between the experimental results and the theoretical analysis. The research results can promote the application of 3D printing in the construction industry, and provide support for the utilization of building resources and green buildings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"235","pagesFromTo":"112455","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659fed1640970707a12ff265","659fed1640970707a12ff266","5e709252878c28a047393b56","659fed1640970707a12ff267","659fed1640970707a12ff268","659fed1640970707a12ff269","659fed1640970707a12ff26a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc32","mniswId":"13966","title":"Materials and Design","issn":"0264-1275","eissn":"1873-4197","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"f1dd2bfa-0a4b-42bb-a055-f054e3162498"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659fed1640970707a12ff264","year":"2023","number":"235","documentHash":"acb6e9a1-4be6-4bc6-981f-060d4b460069"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059252726"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659ff30f40970707a1308e5a","name":"Kannan","lastName":"Govindan","documentHash":"ebfd85a2-ef47-4b30-a32b-8abf59a071f5"},{"objectId":"659ff30f40970707a1308e59","name":"Peng","lastName":"He","documentHash":"ebd33e90-0633-452a-94dd-8f5a0a4687e9"},{"objectId":"659ff30f40970707a1308e58","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"deb5138b-cefe-43ac-92d7-1edeeb2fef8f"},{"objectId":"659ff30f40970707a1308e57","name":"Tong-Yuan","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"7d67fb68-92f5-48be-96a4-1f6ca03f5ce9"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"659ff30f40970707a1308e55","doi":"10.1016/j.omega.2022.102791","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0305048322001979?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Alliance strategy in an online retailing supply chain: Motivation, choice, and equilibrium","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we investigate the alliance strategy in an Online Retailing Supply Chain (ORSC).

The no alliance model as a benchmark is developed to characterize the alliance motivation for each supply chain member. Afterwards, we identify the optimal alliance strategy and the final alliance equilibrium. The results show that the manufacturer always has motivations to form an alliance with each of other two members, while the retailer and the platform may form an alliance only when the agency rate is relatively low. Moreover, under certain conditions, all supply chain members could achieve a win-win-win result in the manufacturer-retailer and manufacturer-platform alliance models, but fall into a lose-lose-lose situation in the retailer-platform alliance model. Additionally, it is interesting that a higher agency rate makes the retailer more profitable when the platform and manufacturer enter into an alliance. Finally, we find that each of the three alliance models may be the final equilibrium, which is largely dependent on channel competition and the agency rate."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"115","pagesFromTo":"102791","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659ff30f40970707a1308e57","659ff30f40970707a1308e58","659ff30f40970707a1308e59","659ff30f40970707a1308e5a","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790da","mniswId":"15383","title":"Omega","issn":"0305-0483","documentHash":"74384257-286c-478d-a901-18f3bbc054d5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"659ff30f40970707a1308e56","year":"2023","volume":"115","documentHash":"700ff882-8025-4747-9321-4e4444f990c8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059286596"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"}],"objectId":"659fdf2740970707a12e8233","doi":"10.1145/3613207","publicUri":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3613207","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Electricity Consumption by ICT: Facts, trends, and measurements","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper considers key issues surrounding energy consumption by information and communication technologies (ICT), which has been steadily growing and is now attaining approximately 10% of the worldwide electricity consumption with a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions.

To analyze the complex dynamic relationship between metro energy consumption and its influencing factors and provide a reference for metro energy conservation control, this paper uses the monthly energy consumption, passenger flow and operating distance statistical data for Wuhan Metro Line 2 from 2018 to 2019. First, metro energy consumption and its influencing factors are qualitatively analyzed and identified. Then, based on cointegration theory and an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, a correlation hypothesis between metro energy consumption and its influencing factors is constructed, and a method for analyzing the influencing factors of metro energy consumption is proposed. The total energy consumption of a metro (TEC), train traction energy consumption (TTEC), environmental control energy consumption (ECEC), station lighting energy consumption (SLEC), station equipment energy consumption (SEEC) and the operating distance (OD) and passenger flow (PF) variables are analyzed. Using cointegration and an impulse response function, the dynamic relationships between the various energy consumption factors and operating distance and passenger flow are evaluated. The results show that there are substantial differences in the effects of OD and PF and their degree of influence on metro energy consumption. (1) OD affects mainly TTEC and TEC. The degree of influence of OD on TTEC reaches 97.8%, and the degree of influence of OD on TEC reaches 65.9%. (2) PF affects mainly ECEC and SEEC, and the degrees of influence of PF on ECEC and SEEC are 32.2% and 41.3%, respectively. (3) Considering that OD is the key factor affecting TTEC and TEC, train marshaling schemes, train running intervals and train stopping scheme optimization countermeasures are proposed, which can provide decision support for metro energy consumption management and control."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"263","pagesFromTo":"125965","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659ff3e540970707a13097b7","659ff3e540970707a13097b8","659ff3e540970707a13097b9","659ff3e540970707a13097ba","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aaa","mniswId":"5674","title":"Energy","issn":"0360-5442","eissn":"1873-6785","documentHash":"978bb110-bd49-46de-bf9c-ebfebe5d7bb6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bc8d904097075486295dd7","year":"2023","volume":"263","documentHash":"9f86f3a1-02ed-4fb4-aac5-106f064b21c4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059287122"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659ff03540970707a1304a7b","name":"Kannan","lastName":"Govindan","documentHash":"9de7ed70-69e8-4f7e-b3f0-463edf5fa5b7"},{"objectId":"659ff03540970707a1304a7a","name":"Qin","lastName":"Su","documentHash":"fc1df992-aef7-4b74-a47d-5562a5918cea"},{"objectId":"659ff03540970707a1304a79","name":"Lu","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"593b6f6e-7aa2-484b-9e2d-93e7416f7ed2"},{"objectId":"659ff03540970707a1304a78","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"696d90d4-f0cd-49e7-9ecd-d5becb0b524b"},{"objectId":"659ff03540970707a1304a77","name":"Zhu-Jun","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"f35700d9-9aae-431a-9286-d8d3ae420376"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"659ff03540970707a1304a75","doi":"10.1016/j.jik.2023.100425","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2444569X2300121X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Blockchain adoption in sustainable supply chains for Industry 5.0: A multistakeholder perspective","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Industry 5.0 has introduced a novel interpretation of sustainable supply chains (SSCs) that emphasizes the importance of building a transparent and trustworthy network that can be continuously monitored and controlled through stakeholder collaboration as well as the use of advanced, intelligent machinery. The ultimate goal of SSCs is to meet specific economic, social, and environmental standards. The implementation of blockchain technology can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and security of the information exchanged among stakeholders in SSCs. However, these stakeholders inevitably possess varying informational advantages and exhibit divergent perspectives regarding the adoption of blockchain technology. This paper thus aims to examine the impediments to the adoption of blockchain technology in the context of SSCs with the goal of promoting blockchain adoption. To achieve this objective, this study analyzes the barriers to blockchain adoption from the perspectives of various stakeholders in SSCs and constructs a barrier severity assessment model that utilizes group decision-making methods to integrate all stakeholders’ attitudes. This study employs the PEEST (political, economic, environmental, social, and technological) framework to identify 27 barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology. Subsequently, an expertise-based group decision-making approach is used to quantify the prominence of various barriers according to various types of stakeholders. The results indicate that the five most intense barriers are storage constraints, insufficient economic incentives, high integration costs, a lack of functional appeal, and ambiguity regarding data disclosure and public data management regulations. This research makes novel theoretical and practical contributions, as it takes an empirical and all-encompassing approach to identifying obstacles to the adoption of blockchain technology and provides valuable insights for policymakers and practitioners to reference in overcoming these

challenging task, chiefly due to the limitations that are imposed by the hardware devices or platforms on which they operate, as well as due to the heterogeneous non-functional requirements that they need to exhibit. Modern embedded systems need to be energy efficient and dependable, whereas their maintenance costs should be minimized, in order to ensure the success and longevity of their application. Being able to build embedded software that satisfies the imposed hardware limitations, while maintaining high quality with respect to critical non-functional requirements is a difficult task that requires proper assistance. To this end, in the present paper, we present the SDK4ED Platform, which facilitates the development of embedded software that exhibits high quality with respect to important quality attributes, with a main focus on energy consumption, dependability, and maintainability. This is achieved through the provision of state-of-the-art and novel quality attribute-specific monitoring and optimization mechanisms, as well as through a novel fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making mechanism for facilitating the selection of code refactorings, which is based on trade-off analysis among the three main attributes of choice. Novel forecasting techniques are also proposed to further support decision making during the development of embedded software. The usefulness, practicality, and industrial relevance of the SDK4ED platform were evaluated in a real-world setting, through three use cases on actual commercial embedded software applications stemming from the airborne, automotive, and healthcare domains, as well as through an industrial study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quality analysis platform that focuses on multiple quality criteria, which also takes into account their trade-offs to facilitate code refactoring selection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5e709245878c28a047392d1a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677697d5fdbe833e69561f10","677697d5fdbe833e69561f11","677697d5fdbe833e69561f12","677697d5fdbe833e69561f13","677697d5fdbe833e69561f14","677697d5fdbe833e69561f15","677697d5fdbe833e69561f16","677697d5fdbe833e69561f17","677697d5fdbe833e69561f18","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","5e709245878c28a047392d1a","677697d5fdbe833e69561f19","677697d5fdbe833e69561f1a","677697d5fdbe833e69561f1b","677697d5fdbe833e69561f1c","6325312975234038513dfa2e","677697d5fdbe833e69561f1d","677697d5fdbe833e69561f1e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454772ab","mniswId":"2190","title":"Automated Software Engineering","issn":"0928-8910","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"242d5440-d7a6-4290-8a2a-33b1aad3f307"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677697d5fdbe833e69561f0f","year":"2024","volume":"31","number":"2","documentHash":"f6973e83-6de9-4359-b4af-12c2795fa51b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060215968"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Domańska","uuid":"4A1A11F10A925F650E6B59202EE7CBE9E2A25C68AF861B8CB2D7FF318E2B00DA7F4C678616ADC0C8082C8C1B0A3575CEC53207B122F0FC1DABD0F41341DD6884","orcidId":"0000-0002-1935-8358","documentHash":"f852ee1c-d3c4-48f8-9ff9-17b3e049a012"}],"objectId":"67769591fdbe833e6955f871","doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2024.112621","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0950705124012553?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Similarity-driven adversarial testing of neural networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among the most important algorithms of computer vision and the artificial intelligence-based systems, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Such attacks can cause dangerous consequences in real-life deployments. Consequently, testing of the artificial intelligence-based systems from their perspective is crucial to reliably support human prediction and decision-making through computation techniques under varying conditions. While proposing new effective attacks is important for neural network testing, it is also crucial to design effective strategies that can be used to choose target labels for these attacks. That is why, in this paper we propose a novel similarity-driven adversarial testing methodology for target label choosing. Our motivation is that CNNs, similarly to humans, tend to make mistakes mostly among categories they perceive similar. Thus, the effort to make models predict a particular class is not equal for all classes. Motivated by this, we propose to use the most and least similar labels to the ground truth according to different similarity measures to choose the target label for an adversarial attack. They can be treated as best- and worst-case scenarios in practical and transparent testing methodologies. As similarity is one of the key components of human cognition and categorization, the approach presents a shift towards a more human-centered security testing of deep neural networks. The obtained numerical results show the superiority of the proposed methods to the existing strategies in the targeted and the non-targeted testing setups."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709245878c28a047392d1a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"305","pagesFromTo":"112621","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","5e709245878c28a047392d1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c3e","mniswId":"13330","title":"Knowledge-Based Systems","issn":"0950-7051","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c69b74f5-7df3-4f50-90c2-af810e823ba7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67769591fdbe833e6955f872","year":"2024","volume":"305","documentHash":"a0fa67ac-5d57-4d4c-8ac3-2946d08b6cd0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060216159"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67765ebbfdbe833e6950b931","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Czekalski","documentHash":"f170675c-8739-426a-99fa-8029e8490102"},{"objectId":"67765ebbfdbe833e6950b930","name":"Valery","lastName":"Nkemeni","documentHash":"6e9cb0a9-5525-41fe-874b-49e3d8f50c92"},{"objectId":"67765ebbfdbe833e6950b92f","name":"Pradeep","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"3b04f40c-f6e9-4064-9ef6-1b869db947c7"},{"objectId":"67765ebbfdbe833e6950b92e","name":"Sapana","lastName":"Sharma","documentHash":"9d861844-750a-43ac-97bc-18f673302673"},{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","name":"Godlove","lastName":"Kuaban","uuid":"EC7E7F9A13DA2FF8F55E44B4B99C3C2F1E000A81058C127DFD5262D301424BA1EA9459DEA4307FD055980254A4F03934B883B243B8F00D784E1B548726F9EF79","documentHash":"caa3d804-e4e6-493c-b7ad-e9ff4795b04e"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aadf1","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pecka","uuid":"CD3126CF436556230E190C14D876165CE97E5CB026EFE0D979E00544C254F31335A8106E7245B6C7579FF5EC54F36E976F955B187611926AD8266DA7457838CF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5743-2216","documentHash":"39b09c59-f4d5-4fd2-8cbf-a1971523489b"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391c36","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Czachórski","uuid":"A483917DFB05C13B3CC94DF456E6128ACF8BD637835BC0306F79D369DDCDBA7F8529DBB5A66F4BE6825EE0956A0D7038F58013290F56C3BFC403BDC9392C532F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7158-0258","documentHash":"fe637cf9-0b07-4c39-ab13-913318c62788"}],"objectId":"67765ebbfdbe833e6950b92d","doi":"10.3389/fenrg.2024.1399371","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2024.1399371/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Energy performance of self-powered green IoT nodes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) partly depends on the successful design and deployment of IoT nodes that can operate for several years without any service outage and the need to replace their energy storage systems (ESSs) (e.g., battery, capacitor, or supercapacitor) when all the stored energy is depleted or when the cycle life of the ESSs is reached. Replacing batteries in the case of large-scale IoT networks and nodes located in places that are hard to reach is very challenging and costly, requiring the design of IoT nodes that can operate for several years without the need for human intervention. One such example is the deployment of IoT nodes in large agricultural fields (for soil or crop monitoring) or a long-distance pipeline (for pipeline monitoring). In this paper, we investigated the practical implications of imposing energy-saving thresholds on the energy performance metrics of green IoT nodes. We propose an energy packet-based model for the evaluation of the energy performance of a green IoT node with the possibility of switching the node to energy-saving regimes on the fly when the energy content of the ESS reaches defined thresholds. Configuring single or multiple thresholds improves the energy performance of the node significantly (e.g., increases the lifetime of the node and reduces the probability of service outage and energy wastage), and the value of the threshold(s) should be carefully chosen. The energy performance of the IoT node can also be improved by dimensioning the energy harvesting system to ensure that the node operates for several years without running out of energy (e.g., maximizing the lifetime of the nodes and minimizing the probability of service outage and energy wastage)"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","5e709236878c28a047391c36","5e70937d878c28a0473aadf1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","5e709236878c28a047391c36","6325312975234038513dfa2e","5e70937d878c28a0473aadf1","67765ebbfdbe833e6950b92e","67765ebbfdbe833e6950b92f","67765ebbfdbe833e6950b930","67765ebbfdbe833e6950b931"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1af","mniswId":"6839","title":"Frontiers in Energy Research","issn":"2296-598X","eissn":"2296-598X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"c2550196-dd6c-498a-84e9-74f16ef6afb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674eec5dfdbe832d4f45aa63","year":"2024","volume":"12","documentHash":"54d5966b-7f25-410f-b3ba-9eeffd3b3904"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060298558"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Domańska","uuid":"4A1A11F10A925F650E6B59202EE7CBE9E2A25C68AF861B8CB2D7FF318E2B00DA7F4C678616ADC0C8082C8C1B0A3575CEC53207B122F0FC1DABD0F41341DD6884","orcidId":"0000-0002-1935-8358","documentHash":"f852ee1c-d3c4-48f8-9ff9-17b3e049a012"}],"objectId":"67769734fdbe833e69561562","doi":"10.1016/j.engappai.2024.109377","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0952197624015355?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Extracting coarse-grained classifiers from large Convolutional Neural Networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Coarse-grained classification and classification at different hierarchy levels are important in many engineering applications. Conventional approaches include post-inference aggregation of fine-grained predictions or multi-task learning with its disadvantages: necessity to incorporate post-prediction mechanisms, possible mistakes between unrelated categories when generic fine-grained models are used, and the need of training multi-task models with joint procedures. To overcome them, this paper proposes a novel method for extracting coarse-grained classifiers from large Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on fine-grained tasks with no additional training. Leveraging the knowledge transfer capabilities of CNNs and acknowledging that a model proficient in a challenging task should inherently address easier, hierarchically related problems, the approach finds and aggregates available representatives of coarse-grained classes within existing fine-grained models. Unlike conventional approaches, the proposed technique aggregates the fine-grained model’s weights and not its predictions. As a result, a new coarse-grained model is obtained with the same feature extractor as the original model. The original and new models can be used to create a multi-output model without the multi-task learning. The method eliminates additional post-prediction mechanisms and limits the mistakes between unrelated categories. It can be used with three strategies to find the sets of fine-grained classes for weight aggregation. They are based on external WordNet knowledge or internal network knowledge. Two of the methods leverage the concepts of semantic and visual similarity. Experimental results with MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50V2, EfficientNetV2B0 and ConvNeXt-Small trained on ImageNet demonstrate up to 98% accuracy in the coarse-grained classification, which is superior to the post-prediction aggregation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709245878c28a047392d1a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"138","pagesFromTo":"109377","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","5e709245878c28a047392d1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477abd","mniswId":"5708","title":"Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","issn":"0952-1976","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"19ed2b1b-ccc4-460e-b276-71b61c0ab49b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67769734fdbe833e69561563","year":"2024","volume":"138","documentHash":"c48be850-ab74-4c62-b0be-556c5cdc6f92"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060338829"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"647aa5a940e3ff42bff526fa","name":"Nur","lastName":"Keleşoğlu","uuid":"D59647366C1FF9E63DAB878D3EB74FEFA951802715704139C356BD4609506928F241672EF22B5E6899EB602D696772E145C8805A64ECCE4475A8BE5945F66961","documentHash":"8a952bfe-cca4-406b-9d05-2c871fb433c9"},{"objectId":"5e7093df878c28a0473b2554","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sobczak","uuid":"4282A9260F1F46D49DC9D7EAC610C79996D3DB3378DA22548901CD9C56CBA9A8190DCEFAF8504F2BEED80F89197DB5FF536F9947D24C42A34D80AAE71914320C","documentHash":"9c3f439e-95b1-49b5-91cc-64040c13de01"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6790f5d8fdbe835da552df54","doi":"10.3390/app142310844","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/23/10844/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"ZigBeeNet: Decrypted Zigbee IoT Network Traffic Dataset in Smart Home Environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The number of smart homes is increasing steadily. One of the first technologies that comes to mind when talking about smart homes is Zigbee, which stands out for its low cost, low latency, low power consumption, and mesh networking capabilities. One of the key features of Zigbee is the encryption of payloads within its frames for security purposes. However, being able to decrypt this payload is crucial for fully understanding its operation and for purposes such as testing the network’s security. Therefore, in this paper, we present the decrypted Zigbee IoT Network Traffic dataset, ZigBeeNet. We captured packets using Wireshark in real time from a smart home with 15 Zigbee devices over 20 days and saved them in pcap files. Additionally, we used a key extraction method to obtain the network key, decrypt the payload data, and analyze the characteristic features of network traffic, which we present in this paper. ZigBeeNet will be useful in wider areas than existing datasets with its ability to support network security research, pattern analysis, network performance analysis, and Zigbee traffic generator.

In such conditions, sharp fluctuations in the volume of traffic with regulated requirements for the quality of service are inevitable. Note that 5G operates in the millimeter range. Accordingly, the quality of traffic service is affected both by the number of subscribers simultaneously initiating requests from one sector of coverage, and by the appearance of obstacles opaque to radio radiation in the space between the subscriber device and the base station. Effective smoothing of 5G traffic fluctuations, taking into account these disturbing factors, is an urgent task. The goal of this research is to evaluate the service quality parameters in a target area characterized by a specific user density. It takes into account that if the declared QoS requirements for connection speed for users in a network segment deployed within the licensed frequency range for 5G are not met, they can utilize a network segment deployed in the unlicensed high-frequency range for 5G under conditions of free competition. The metric being studied is the probability of session loss in the licensed network segment and the achievable transmission speed in the unlicensed network segment. Based on this, a method for assessing the density of base station deployment in the unlicensed network segment necessary to support the specified user density in the licensed network segment with defined QoS guarantees in terms of bandwidth is formalized. The experiment results showed that the probability of losing sessions with regulated requirements for the quality of service in both network segments, in addition to the base station placement density and subscriber devices, is significantly affected by the minimum data transfer rate, the intensity of obstacles, and the value of the Contention Window."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"e39825","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","6790f922fdbe835da5533195","6790f922fdbe835da5533196"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c2a4","mniswId":"7504","title":"Heliyon","issn":"2405-8440","eissn":"2405-8440","documentHash":"70f70987-7e3b-4241-9b3b-c4bb0901a1ce"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6729d590fdbe837837670f3d","year":"2024","volume":"10","number":"21","documentHash":"1c447375-a87e-402a-8af9-6438325934b3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060407406"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790fbe1fdbe835da553f403","name":"Victoria","lastName":"Vysotska","documentHash":"7e524665-8d96-4dd4-9d59-f3a2d3da10c9"},{"objectId":"6790fbe1fdbe835da553f402","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Muzychuk","documentHash":"39e9c01e-0b4f-4073-a6c8-d07f4c8b22c5"},{"objectId":"6790fbe1fdbe835da553f401","name":"Valerii","lastName":"Sokurenko","documentHash":"5803d678-e2d9-4542-807c-5942b8e28692"},{"objectId":"6790fbe1fdbe835da553f400","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Vladov","documentHash":"e0c425b9-06e7-464c-8213-ca97a82da495"},{"objectId":"651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","name":"Viacheslav","lastName":"Kovtun","uuid":"9FC62B6CAFD057D03E6804B3F80616C02A8D90918E4C8860CB76DF6E0D495E2CFBF9B48C39D339CD5EE3E10A5B4FC53850D3BFF0F25D48826EEEEEAAE921D9DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7624-7072","documentHash":"f9a3daf0-7063-4e84-974c-0517698c246d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6790fbe1fdbe835da553f3ff","doi":"10.3390/electronics13152952","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/15/2952/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Helicopter Turboshaft Engine Residual Life Determination by Neural Network Method","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A neural network method has been developed for helicopter turboshaft engine residual life determination, the basis of which is a hierarchical system, which is represented in neural network model form, consisting of four layers, which determines the numerical value of the residual life. To implement a hierarchical system, a justified multilayer perceptron is used. A multilayer perceptron training algorithm has been developed, which, by introducing an initial parameter to the output layer, yields a prediction accuracy of up to 99.3%, and the adaptive Adam training rate ensures an accuracy of up to 99.4% in helicopter turboshaft engine residual life determination. A method for constructing a degradation curve has been developed that takes into account both the parameter predictions and similarities with past patterns, allowing you to determine the range of possible values of the residual life estimate, with a probability of up to 95%. The article considers an example of solving the task of determining the thermally stressed state of helicopter turboshaft engine compressor turbine blades and assessing their residual life. A computational experiment was carried out to determine the residual life of helicopter turboshaft engine compressor turbine blades, and the results, with 160 training epochs, recorded an accuracy of 99.3%, with a reduction in losses from 2.5% to 0.5% thanks to training process optimization by applying an adaptive training rate. The comparative analysis results showed that use of the multilayer perceptron as a hierarchical system gives better results than the classical RBF network and the least squares method. The first and second types of error were reduced by 2.23 times compared to the RBF network and by 4.74 times compared to the least squares method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"2952","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6790fbe1fdbe835da553f400","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","6790fbe1fdbe835da553f401","6790fbe1fdbe835da553f402","6790fbe1fdbe835da553f403"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics","issn":"2079-9292","eissn":"2079-9292","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"84e7903c-f300-44fa-a9fd-204491284c02"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b0e5a3fdbe8318803f9bc0","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"15","documentHash":"6c8d4f34-5ce5-48dc-aa60-0bb2ef97bf1c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060410226"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790ff2ffdbe835da554629a","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Kovtun","documentHash":"d7a13aa0-25bd-48b5-8b77-ab61b167b7d9"},{"objectId":"651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","name":"Viacheslav","lastName":"Kovtun","uuid":"9FC62B6CAFD057D03E6804B3F80616C02A8D90918E4C8860CB76DF6E0D495E2CFBF9B48C39D339CD5EE3E10A5B4FC53850D3BFF0F25D48826EEEEEAAE921D9DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7624-7072","documentHash":"f9a3daf0-7063-4e84-974c-0517698c246d"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"},{"objectId":"5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Połys","uuid":"ADE4B07DB1C8B5BA8A18065ADE4F3B183CC049C5C42CF8C2C6FA17441262138F448972AFEFBFC90EE7C93E8F4F04D93F0FDC14D693FA020625F944B58B7255A3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2794-3450","documentHash":"2adc629f-ac82-4ca8-81f7-f834dd4071e7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6790ff2ffdbe835da5546299","doi":"10.3390/electronics13071180","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/7/1180/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Assessment of Communication Resource Allocation by the Transmission Control Protocol for the Target Virtual Connection under Competitive Conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The mathematical framework presented in this article focuses on the controlled-transmission protocol’s asynchronous process of bandwidth allocation for the target virtual connection implemented under competition for communication resources.

A fundamental feature of the author’s formulation of the extreme problem is that it takes into account not only the points of potential placement of base stations but also the possibility of selecting instances of stations to be placed at a specific point from a defined excess set, as well as the aspect of inseparable interaction of placed 5G base stations within the framework of SON. The formulation of this extreme problem is brought to the form of a specific combinatorial model. The article proposes an adapted branch-and-bounds method, which allows the process of synthesis of the architecture of a linearly oriented segment of a 5G network to select the best options for the placement of base stations for further evaluation of the received placement plans in the metric of defined performance indicators. As the final stage of the synthesis of the optimal plan of a linearly oriented wireless network segment based on the sequence of the best placements, it is proposed to expand the parametric space of the design task due to the specific technical parameters characteristic of the 5G platform. The article presents a numerical example of solving an instance of the corresponding extremal problem. It is shown that the presented mathematical apparatus allows for the formation of a set of optimal placements taking into account the size of the non-coverage of the target area. To calculate this characteristic parameter, both exact and two approximate approaches are formalized. The results of the experiment showed that for high-dimensional problems, the approximate approach allows for reducing the computational complexity of implementing the adapted branch-and-bounds method by more than six times, with a slight loss of accuracy of the optimal solution. The structure of the article includes Section 1 (introduction and state-of-the-art), Section 2 (statement of the research, proposed models and methods devoted to the research topic), Section 3 (numerical experiment and analysis of results), and Section 4 (conclusions and further research)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"e0299000","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","6790fe64fdbe835da5542b60","6790fe64fdbe835da5542b61"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","eissn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"fcfcc06e-e7b2-4412-a89f-df94326b9f49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6614eb124097075b47757146","year":"2024","volume":"19","number":"4","documentHash":"c6f4ce8b-4325-4f79-8af7-aacf0b9fbf65"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060410683"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790fb2afdbe835da553e76e","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Rudyk","documentHash":"09f1d408-d8d3-4411-bf17-802ba7e329cd"},{"objectId":"6790fb2afdbe835da553e76d","name":"Ihor","lastName":"Arseniuk","documentHash":"b0d1c08d-e6ac-4400-a128-7966019ceedd"},{"objectId":"6790fb2afdbe835da553e76c","name":"Mariia","lastName":"Baraban","documentHash":"fd15c21f-be0c-4aeb-850a-e7020022a662"},{"objectId":"6790fb2afdbe835da553e76b","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Baraban","documentHash":"cb65b4e3-c4c7-4989-93dd-31422fc3d5d7"},{"objectId":"6790fb2afdbe835da553e76a","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Semenov","documentHash":"56b45398-8b3c-4006-a640-c75b23b9edeb"},{"objectId":"651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","name":"Viacheslav","lastName":"Kovtun","uuid":"9FC62B6CAFD057D03E6804B3F80616C02A8D90918E4C8860CB76DF6E0D495E2CFBF9B48C39D339CD5EE3E10A5B4FC53850D3BFF0F25D48826EEEEEAAE921D9DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7624-7072","documentHash":"f9a3daf0-7063-4e84-974c-0517698c246d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6790fb2afdbe835da553e769","doi":"10.3390/electronics13163173","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/16/3173/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Development and Validation of a Mathematical Model for Pyroelectric Temperature Measurement Sensors for Application in Mobile Robotic Systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A pyroelectric temperature sensor for measuring human body temperature with increased accuracy and speed for application in mobile robotic systems has been developed.

This framework presents an interrupt access control scheme that exhibits survivability characteristics important to mission-critical applications. Analytically, the author's concept is represented by an irreversible Markov process, for which a system of equilibrium equations and stationary probabilities are defined. Based on the latter, a qualitative metric was formulated, which included such indicators as the average number of requests accepted for service in the 5 G cluster, the probability of losing an incoming request, and the average volume of network resource units used in the 5 G cluster. For the single input data that characterizes a real NS 5 G cluster, a comparison of the author's and known competing access control schemes in terms of formulated qualitative metrics is implemented. The obtained results showed that the author's concept prevails over the competitor in the range of low loads.

Recent works in this area are connected with turbo codes, which have a special ability to provide error correction characteristics of the information transmission close to theoretically obtained values. Besides, they are used for television (DVB-RCS, DVB-RCT), wireless local networks (WiMAX), software-defined radio systems, mobile (3G, 4G, Inmarsat) and space (CCSDS) communications etc. In this article is presented the crypto coding system based on turbo codes with secret keys used by interleavers. All calculations are performed during data encoding, which reduces the computational complexity of data pre-encryption. The necessary mathematical apparatus was presented, the security level of the communication system was estimated, a simulation of the error correction characteristics was performed, and multimedia information was processed. The working characteristics of the classical and proposed turbo codecs do not differ statistically. The results can be used in communication systems for various functional purposes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"330-335","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","679100d0fdbe835da5548658"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c31a","mniswId":"7859","title":"ICT Express","issn":"2405-9595","eissn":"2405-9595","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"82977085-98a6-4dcb-b24c-716c524796cb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679100d0fdbe835da5548657","year":"2024","volume":"10","number":"2","documentHash":"bd658efe-a92c-4d1a-a3fc-471219a06261"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060411062"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abc53","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Marjasz","uuid":"E8D6AC5A29FA294ED1BEE9D77C42213DF5440A192232E8879796967716E7FAF87CE88C81304AD79357C7E16CF0050973AACB8A99DAEA4927F24D37EEFB4F91EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9187-0009","documentHash":"933c3234-e315-4184-995f-a25ed49ce8b9"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"},{"objectId":"5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Połys","uuid":"ADE4B07DB1C8B5BA8A18065ADE4F3B183CC049C5C42CF8C2C6FA17441262138F448972AFEFBFC90EE7C93E8F4F04D93F0FDC14D693FA020625F944B58B7255A3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2794-3450","documentHash":"2adc629f-ac82-4ca8-81f7-f834dd4071e7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"667458004097075086acfbb5","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-64824-9","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64824-9.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A comprehensive algorithm for vertical positioning in multi-building environments as an advancement in indoor floor-level detection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The proliferation of smartphones has catalyzed diverse services, mainly focusing on indoor localization to determine users’ and devices’ positions within buildings. Despite decades of exploration, the seamless integration of wireless technologies in tracking devices and users has become pivotal in various sectors, including health, industry, disaster management, building operations, and surveillance. Extensive research in laboratory and industrial settings, particularly in wireless sensor networks and robotics, has informed indoor localization techniques. This paper, referencing surveys and original literature reviews, proposes an innovative indoor location system amalgamating GPS and barometer readings. GPS identifies entry through doors, while barometer readings facilitate accurate floor-level tracking. The integration promises continuous real-time location updates, enhancing security, navigation, and emergency response. Notably, the algorithm is infrastructure-independent, relying on the smartphone’s barometer, and versatile, detecting elevator travel when Wi-Fi AP or LTE signals are available. Results indicate high accuracy, with building entry exceeding 93%, elevator recognition achieving 75% sensitivity and 97% specificity, and floor change detection surpassing 95% sensitivity and nearly 98% specificity (which translates to nearly 97% accuracy). This comprehensive solution, emphasizing the critical role of precise vertical positioning, signifies an advancement in tracking within urban structures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709384878c28a0473abc53","5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709384878c28a0473abc53","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Floor-level recognition","Indoor vertical positioning","Barometer","GPS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060413845"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67935d26fdbe835f61f50607","name":"Marek","lastName":"Żukowski","documentHash":"90a5f739-f766-4c66-84c6-a2abcdf6bca3"},{"objectId":"67935d26fdbe835f61f50606","name":"Jay","lastName":"Lawrence","documentHash":"6a0e3c40-5e0b-40fa-9b7c-ec6a8a8c4453"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b801b","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Markiewicz","uuid":"CF3FD531656CD4DF38F706826D9BD7D0BA31670DE45089891F2FA771A842BDD2B256857387AE07D85AA706BE630717B1F7268C2640B6865F6A31AA6E287822DA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8983-9077","documentHash":"f75c36be-5bdb-4ebb-a964-5358d933ceb5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67935d26fdbe835f61f50604","doi":"10.1007/s10701-024-00784-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10701-024-00784-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Comment on Aurélien Drezet’s Defense of Relational Quantum Mechanics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aurélien Drezet has attempted in Found.

Then, the recommendation was given based on recommender system algorithms using patient and caregiver ratings and the knowledge obtained from drug specifications and interactions. Sentiment analysis was employed by natural language processing approaches in pre-processing, along with neural network-based methods and recommender system algorithms for modelling the system. Patient conditions and medicine features were used to make two models based on matrix factorization. Then, we used drug interaction criteria to filter drugs with severe or mild interactions with other drugs.\nWe developed a deep learning model for recommending drugs using data from 2304 patients as a training set and 660 patients as our validation set. We used knowledge from drug information and combined the model's outcome into a knowledge-based system with the rules obtained from constraints on taking medicine.\nResults\nOur recommendation system can recommend an acceptable combination of medicines similar to the existing prescriptions available in real life. Compared with conventional matrix factorization, our proposed model improves the accuracy, sensitivity, and hit rate by 26 %, 34 %, and 40 %, respectively. In addition, it improves the accuracy, sensitivity, and hit rate by an average of 31 %, 29 %, and 28 % compared to other machine learning methods. We have open-sourced our implementation in Python.\nConclusion\nCompared to conventional machine learning approaches, we obtained average accuracy, sensitivity, and hit rates of 31 %, 29 %, and 28 %, respectively. Compared to conventional matrix factorisation our proposed method improved the accuracy, sensitivity, and hit rate by 26 %, 34 %, and 40 %, respectively. However, it is acknowledged that this is not the same as clinical accuracy or sensitivity, and more accurate results can be obtained by gathering larger datasets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709425878c28a0473b71ae"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"157","pagesFromTo":"102981","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6793729afdbe835f61f66436","6793729afdbe835f61f66437","6793729afdbe835f61f66438","6793729afdbe835f61f66439","6793729afdbe835f61f6643a","5e709425878c28a0473b71ae","6793729afdbe835f61f6643b","6793729afdbe835f61f6643c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771e2","mniswId":"1819","title":"Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","issn":"0933-3657","documentHash":"8277864d-7c59-444a-9b62-6a5bacbe07a8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6793729afdbe835f61f66435","year":"2024","volume":"157","documentHash":"073f7ea6-e0e0-428f-aa24-2bda0b31c0c8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060420359"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679397defdbe835f61f914ea","name":"George Q.","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"b96e7e1e-0507-47dd-a4ec-164cab12126e"},{"objectId":"679397defdbe835f61f914e9","name":"Ioannis","lastName":"Brilakis","documentHash":"aab7db39-2fa6-435a-ac2a-f610195a493e"},{"objectId":"679397defdbe835f61f914e8","name":"Waishan","lastName":"Qiu","documentHash":"d85952c7-b772-4293-8051-fa4487338673"},{"objectId":"679397defdbe835f61f914e7","name":"Ray Y.","lastName":"Zhong","documentHash":"ac1da97f-a2c1-4ef9-89cd-3bcc3e9c5244"},{"objectId":"679397defdbe835f61f914e6","name":"Shuxuan","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"b30c99b8-406e-4bd9-a811-43608d78693a"},{"objectId":"679397defdbe835f61f914e5","name":"Shuaiming","lastName":"Su","documentHash":"bba8827c-98f7-4681-b2c5-6400735a4bba"},{"objectId":"679397defdbe835f61f914e4","name":"Yishuo","lastName":"Jiang","documentHash":"1638fc5b-b185-432b-9421-8e2e67827d59"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679397defdbe835f61f914e2","doi":"10.1016/j.dibe.2024.100512","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2666165924001935?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Digital twin-enabled synchronized construction management: A roadmap from construction 4.0 towards future prospect","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Information and automation technologies play a pivotal role in achieving cyber-physical integration within Construction 4.0.

Hence synchronization emerges as a crucial factor for orchestrating and sustaining harmonious relationships among multiple entities or activities within a delimited spatial-temporal framework. This ensures seamless and aligned coordination throughout dynamic processes. Therefore, this paper presents a strategic roadmap for the synchronized construction management, derived from a thorough analysis of fundamental elements in Construction 4.0, aimed at advancing the current construction management practices. Moreover, to articulate this synchronization approach systematically, an Orthogonally Synchronized Digital Twin (SDT) model with regular expression is formulated, built upon the proposed roadmap for reshaped construction management. This study provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the construction industry, including architects, engineers, project managers, and policymakers. The findings guide decision-making on digital twin adoption in construction, supporting practitioners to enhance efficiency and improve outcomes, offering a roadmap for industry advancement towards human-centrality, sustainability, and resilience. Future research should focus on validating the proposed roadmap and SDT model in real-world scenarios, exploring synergies between AI and digital twins, and investigating advanced technologies for holistic smart cities management."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"100512","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679397defdbe835f61f914e4","679397defdbe835f61f914e5","679397defdbe835f61f914e6","679397defdbe835f61f914e7","679397defdbe835f61f914e8","5e709252878c28a047393b56","679397defdbe835f61f914e9","679397defdbe835f61f914ea"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb791","mniswId":"29954","title":"Developments in the Built Environment","eissn":"2666-1659","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3db81d2a-6ac1-4622-b19d-2e8331dc22c6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679397defdbe835f61f914e3","year":"2024","volume":"19","documentHash":"0bbf439d-cc48-44cc-a926-c70b102c94fd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060420454"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cbe","name":"Vedran","lastName":"Dunjko","documentHash":"b4691a9b-7c62-486b-8206-6bf4ad458229"},{"objectId":"67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cbd","name":"Yash J","lastName":"Patel","documentHash":"eefdecbd-b868-4af6-8c7d-ffa8c9f34f22"},{"objectId":"67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cbc","name":"Onur","lastName":"Danaci","documentHash":"57c44d9e-1d26-4fc0-99d8-c0d01cbcf3d6"},{"objectId":"67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cbb","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Ostaszewski","documentHash":"6a898267-7e54-4884-9447-484afa4c793e"},{"objectId":"67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cba","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Bedełek","documentHash":"e2a68b89-7112-488a-b0d7-101de96d1848"},{"objectId":"66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","name":"Akash ","lastName":"Kundu ","uuid":"70EF4FF1C1BF816CC3B984BCD37EA6A8D6FD08B7B5F083C04D729C4496000CCD839F3A895088F8E4A8A66892E390213313379D4319F9CE4E542CE870D22450B5","documentHash":"8452fc8c-3054-495d-a245-09e1edeca4ad"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cb8","doi":"10.1088/1367-2630/ad1b7f","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ad1b7f","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Enhancing variational quantum state diagonalization using reinforcement learning techniques","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The variational quantum algorithms are crucial for the application of NISQ computers. Such algorithms require short quantum circuits, which are more amenable to implementation on near-term hardware, and many such methods have been developed. One of particular interest is the so-called variational quantum state diagonalization method, which constitutes an important algorithmic subroutine and can be used directly to work with data encoded in quantum states. In particular, it can be applied to discern the features of quantum states, such as entanglement properties of a system, or in quantum machine learning algorithms. In this work, we tackle the problem of designing a very shallow quantum circuit, required in the quantum state diagonalization task, by utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). We use a novel encoding method for the RL-state, a dense reward function, and an ε-greedy policy to achieve this. We demonstrate that the circuits proposed by the RL methods are shallower than the standard variational quantum state diagonalization algorithm and thus can be used in situations where hardware capabilities limit the depth of quantum circuits. The methods we propose in the paper can be readily adapted to address a wide range of variational quantum algorithms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"13034","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cba","67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cbb","67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cbc","67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cbd","67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cbe","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479023","mniswId":"15036","title":"NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS","issn":"1367-2630","eissn":"1367-2630","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f10391e0-9b8c-49bb-bafe-a9e73f36c116"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67935f6dfdbe835f61f52cb9","year":"2024","volume":"26","number":"1","documentHash":"c116cdf4-1382-4c76-9fac-27ac3ce9bf47"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060420469"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67935a87fdbe835f61f47007","name":"Kezhong","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"c2c0b6d0-a63e-4276-8a53-feae4579c9a8"},{"objectId":"64473b2a40e3ff4630d19a9b","name":"Yuting","lastName":"Ma","uuid":"E0ECA31AA2CC7B59A55635E0F79E28AAD156CC9541416187B907D8F80B6C246931E4E9A29DC8C55FB3F2BE868C58D2C76C64C24A4EE6224BF4E5699F944024DC","documentHash":"6e5891ba-b37f-429a-ba0b-6d74521b51f6"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67935a87fdbe835f61f47005","doi":"10.3390/s24061850","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/6/1850/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Impact of IoT System Imperfections and Passenger Errors on Cruise Ship Evacuation Delay","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cruise ships and other naval vessels include automated Internet of Things (IoT)-based evacuation systems for the passengers and crew to assist them in case of emergencies and accidents. The technical challenges of assisting passengers and crew to safety during emergencies include various aspects such as sensor failures, imperfections in the sound or display systems that are used to direct evacuees, the timely selection of optimum evacuation routes for the evacuees, as well as computation and communication delays that may occur in the IoT infrastructure due to intense activities during an emergency. In addition, during an emergency, the evacuees may be confused or in a panic, and may make mistakes in following the directions offered by the evacuation system. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to analyze the effect of two important aspects that can have an adverse effect on the passengers’ evacuation time, namely (a) the computer processing and communication delays, and (b) the errors that may be made by the evacuees in following instructions. The approach we take uses simulation with a representative existing cruise ship model, which dynamically computes the best exit paths for each passenger, with a deadline-driven Adaptive Navigation Strategy (ANS). Our simulation results reveal that delays in the evacuees’ reception of instructions can significantly increase the total time needed for passenger evacuation. In contrast, we observe that passenger behavior errors also affect the evacuation duration, but with less effect on the total time needed to evacuate passengers. These findings demonstrate the importance of the design of passenger evacuation systems in a way that takes into account all realistic features of the ship’s indoor evacuation environment, including the importance of having high-performance data processing and communication systems that will not result in congestion and communication delays."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","64473b2a40e3ff4630d19a9b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1850","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64473b2a40e3ff4630d19a9b","6325312975234038513dfa2e","67935a87fdbe835f61f47007"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060420508"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6793961bfdbe835f61f90c07","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","documentHash":"992a6ed1-2429-4cb9-a88b-755ed3dcd5b2"},{"objectId":"6793961bfdbe835f61f90c06","name":"Kwai-Sang","lastName":"Chin","documentHash":"5757d6f9-8d78-4de3-8288-97d0d7423781"},{"objectId":"6793961bfdbe835f61f90c05","name":"Qin","lastName":"Su","documentHash":"a9ac6348-395c-48ba-8ac7-026847e3079c"},{"objectId":"6793961bfdbe835f61f90c04","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"ed0a31d7-07a3-437b-a935-696c139d7790"},{"objectId":"6793961bfdbe835f61f90c03","name":"Zhu-Jun","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"3ef2fac4-1dab-4bd8-ac68-6f77e74268f5"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"6793961bfdbe835f61f90c01","doi":"10.1007/s10479-023-05698-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10479-023-05698-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Enhancing the sustainability and robustness of critical material supply in electrical vehicle market: an AI-powered supplier selection approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In light of the burgeoning electric vehicle market, the demand for lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) is on the rise.

We have developed a comprehensive system for evaluating sustainable performance, encompassing three vital dimensions: economic, social and environmental contexts. Then, we introduced a pioneering approach known as the multi-criteria material supplier selection (MCMSS) methodology which amalgamates multi-criteria decision-making techniques with artificial intelligence to effectively generate sustainability performance of suppliers and identify the most suitable supplier, out of all alternatives. Eventually, the supply of four key materials of LiBs is used as illustrative examples to verify the feasibility and rationality of the proposed MCMSS.

The manufacturing of semiconductors requires production in an electronic clean room. Choosing the right honeycomb structural material (HSM) can maximize the efficiency and operation of the electronic clean room. Nonetheless, selecting the optimal HSM for electronics clean rooms requires balancing tradeoffs between conflicting criteria. This study aims to develop a comprehensive evaluation criteria system for proper HSM selection. We propose a multi-criteria decision support framework based on the notion of basic uncertain linguistic information and an integrated approach that combines the Bayesian best-worst method technique with the Elimination Et Choix Traduisant la Realité (ELECTRE) III method. The proposed framework is used to address the HSM selection problem faced by a cross-functional team who are responsible for the design and construction of an electronics clean room. The results of the case study show that construction cost and clean ventilation capacity criteria are very important and that Sheet Molding Compound straight cylinders, a subtype of HSM, stand out from the crowd of materials. The proposed model was further subjected to sensitivity and comparative analyses to compare the current model with several existing methods to validate its advantages and confirm its validity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"85","pagesFromTo":"108703","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67939e1afdbe835f61f958ef","67939e1afdbe835f61f958f0","67939e1afdbe835f61f958f1","67939e1afdbe835f61f958f2","67939e1afdbe835f61f958f3","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c723","mniswId":"10360","title":"Journal of Building Engineering","issn":"2352-7102","eissn":"2352-7102","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"13b5e847-5288-4683-af2f-f81a223e277d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67939e1afdbe835f61f958ee","year":"2024","volume":"85","documentHash":"5b0fbb5e-579f-4028-a051-43c65aadea34"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060420543"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Strzoda","uuid":"B0D6BFD33F8756550BC38B6185859322A184B3218CD98302394D0F3F0656FFC9ABA9C0B7A0D1DF0937FAD3533FAC8C4EC0A7208C4C29B23D42E7C222AC2040EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3994-1428","documentHash":"de4a5946-337f-4f96-9f61-e50ef06171cd"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"}],"objectId":"6793a7d4fdbe835f61f9c419","doi":"10.3390/s24113348","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/11/3348/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A Nature-Inspired Approach to Energy-Efficient Relay Selection in Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Despite the ability of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks to offer extended range, they encounter challenges with coverage blind spots in the network. This article proposes an innovative energy-efficient and nature-inspired relay selection algorithm for LoRa-based LPWAN networks, serving as a solution for challenges related to poor signal range in areas with limited coverage. A swarm behavior-inspired approach is utilized to select the relays’ localization in the network, providing network energy efficiency and radio signal extension. These relays help to bridge communication gaps, significantly reducing the impact of coverage blind spots by forwarding signals from devices with poor direct connectivity with the gateway. The proposed algorithm considers critical factors for the LoRa standard, such as the Spreading Factor and device energy budget analysis. Simulation experiments validate the proposed scheme’s effectiveness in terms of energy efficiency under diverse multi-gateway (up to six gateways) network topology scenarios involving thousands of devices (1000–1500). Specifically, it is verified that the proposed approach outperforms a reference method in preventing battery depletion of the relays, which is vital for battery-powered IoT devices. Furthermore, the proposed heuristic method achieves over twice the speed of the exact method for some large-scale problems, with a negligible accuracy loss of less than 2%."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","5e709444878c28a0473b94d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"3348","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-8220","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"91062cb9-24b0-4df6-9558-eaa12e105cea"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66714b0f40970745515fe272","year":"2024","volume":"24","number":"11","documentHash":"46b74725-f68e-4131-8662-190b40534566"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060420587"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6793a2eafdbe835f61f98743","name":"Jun","lastName":"Hu","documentHash":"598c2c6c-5a27-43d6-a748-ba34023002f1"},{"objectId":"6793a2eafdbe835f61f98742","name":"Yue","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"f9533cdc-088c-4722-9e98-5f3214fbc74d"},{"objectId":"6793a2eafdbe835f61f98741","name":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"977420f0-76b5-4cf9-8aec-37f3d1ab160d"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"6793a2eafdbe835f61f9873f","doi":"10.1080/09640568.2024.2390573","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09640568.2024.2390573","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Does digital economy development benefit low-carbon transition: evidence based on urban carbon lock-in","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The carbon lock-in phenomenon coincides with urban growth due to the latter’s significant reliance on fossil fuels with high carbon content.

The findings indicate that the retailer's inclination to voluntarily share information and the most effective approach are significantly influenced by the interplay between the supplier's recycling efficiency and the manufacturer's nonlinear production cost. Specifically, in the context of production diseconomy, it is commonly observed that the retailer can derive advantages by engaging in information sharing with a supplier who possesses a high recycling efficiency. In contract, the retailer would share the information when the recycling efficiency is high or the production economy coefficient is large. Otherwise, no sharing strategy can be considered as the optimal choice.

This paper establishes a generalizable framework for BDT maturity assessment that can offer insights into BDT maturity standards to construction practitioners to create effective strategies for the diffusion, development, and maturation of BDT."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"59","pagesFromTo":"102245","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6793a6abfdbe835f61f9bcd1","6793a6abfdbe835f61f9bcd2","6793a6abfdbe835f61f9bcd3","6793a6abfdbe835f61f9bcd4","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e82","mniswId":"425","title":"ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS","issn":"1474-0346","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"3102572b-64c8-46c2-8c5e-bb29811ae1ad"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6793a6abfdbe835f61f9bcd0","year":"2024","volume":"59","documentHash":"99df2797-cd70-4ffc-92bb-0763ef6fa1bd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060421151"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678fa3fcfdbe835856baf72b","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Mrozek","documentHash":"9c1eaca1-133f-47ce-8d56-3fbf457f9ace"},{"objectId":"678fa3fcfdbe835856baf72a","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Pokuciński","documentHash":"11259c9a-7e8f-467d-9868-9eea9ee7314c"},{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"678fa3fcfdbe835856baf729","doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2024.09.432","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1877050924024724?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Finding the Perfect Cut: Selection of the Best Cutting Point in Equirectangular Panoramas for Object Detection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Analyzing equirectangular imagery becomes increasingly important due to its expanding utilization in numerous domains. With their wide field of view and unique format, they create novel opportunities and challenges for object detection algorithms. Training on rectilinear data, which is better accessible than panoramic data, results in low accuracy on equirectangular images. Therefore, it is important to propose new dataset preparation methodologies that allow to fully utilize the potential of the size-constrained, relatively unpopular and niche equirectangular datasets. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for the selection of the Best Cutting Point that can be used to create datasets aimed at facilitating the model’s training and testing. This approach is used to choose the meridian from which the sphere is unfolded during the transformation from a 3D spatial figure into a 2D fat image. Our target is to eliminate the disadvantages of the existing cutting methods: the time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective character of a manual technique and frequent distortions in the spatial placement of object features common for a random cutting method. It does that by automatically finding the best cutting point along the horizontal axis to preserve the integrity of objects relevant to the detection task, either keeping them intact or minimizing losses. To evaluate the method, we use an available dataset and also propose a new dataset called EquiB&B. The numerical results show that the datasets created with the proposed approach can facilitate the training of detection models for equirectangular data. They also show the potential of the method for building practical testing methodologies involving best- and worst-case scenarios to introduce more explainability and transparency to testing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"246","pagesFromTo":"519-528","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574195a","mniswId":"1113","fullName":"International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bb65bc19-2aab-4b61-9a0e-d6b41e5b1e74"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"674dbb38fdbe8324c66cf254","startDate":"2024-09-11","endDate":"2024-09-13","fullName":"28th International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems (KES 2024)","shortName":"KES 2024","city":"Sevilla","country":"ES","website":"http://kes2024.kesinternational.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"88ec3a20-c57a-4f4e-af08-c271f6c6a78d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678fa3fcfdbe835856baf72a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","678fa3fcfdbe835856baf72b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e710e5046e0fb0001bb6a1d","title":"Procedia Computer Science","eissn":"1877-0509","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/procedia-computer-science/","documentHash":"3c8e416f-2852-455f-83a1-3b8733fb1938"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674997c2fdbe8325166615b7","year":"2024","volume":"246","documentHash":"06538876-a98c-423b-a8a7-07ec387a900a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060470444"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790dda0fdbe835da54d3e97","name":"Miltiadis","lastName":"Siavvas","documentHash":"69c8fc95-9e30-4d33-91df-e945869ca634"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"5f532814752340073806a95f","name":"Mert","lastName":"Nakip","uuid":"6EE14383BEC5E308B4B31DB96075B5B9D11B8A3380D47274C583232C87DFE62BA1A38BDA3547E4792533BA246FBB798E501DC0CB82FB2CDB3128BF0BF7CAC8CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6723-6494","documentHash":"d9b43af6-35d8-4aeb-b4af-c25f660650fa"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-08-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6790dda0fdbe835da54d3e96","doi":"10.1016/j.cie.2024.110453","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0360835224005746?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"System-wide vulnerability of multi-component software","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In software systems comprised of many interconnected components, the vulnerability of each component will affect the vulnerability of other components and of the system as a whole.

The present work addresses this problem with a novel System-Wide Vulnerability Assessment (SWVA) framework for interconnected software components, based on an Associated Random Neural Network (ARNN) that estimates the system-wide vulnerability of all software components from known local vulnerabilities of individual components, and from their interconnections. The ARNN uses a problem-specific weight initialization, and learns from existing software system examples with a gradient-based deep learning algorithm. The ARNN is then used to assess the vulnerability of hitherto unseen software systems. The performance of the proposed ARNN-based SWVA framework is evaluated and compared against several well-known machine learning techniques on 13 different versions of a real-world software system with up to 11 components. The experimental results show the superior performance of the ARNN achieving above 85% median accuracy and good high scalability with respect to the number of connected software components."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"196","pagesFromTo":"110453","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","6790dda0fdbe835da54d3e97","5f532814752340073806a95f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777b0","mniswId":"4264","title":"Computers and Industrial Engineering","issn":"0360-8352","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c070b466-6462-4131-8673-2864cac73704"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060477722"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679102cafdbe835da554a39c","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kempa","documentHash":"ca7b02f6-743b-49a8-a341-22f9afcc0309"},{"objectId":"679102cafdbe835da554a39b","name":"Saad","lastName":"Aldosary","documentHash":"6dde1d97-ca4b-4392-9927-6d12d6ef9854"},{"objectId":"679102cafdbe835da554a39a","name":"Mohammed","lastName":"Al-Maitah","documentHash":"2df5b0e0-95aa-4719-ba11-62c8f78510a6"},{"objectId":"679102cafdbe835da554a399","name":"Viacheslav","lastName":"Kovtun","documentHash":"70767df0-7399-4f3b-b1e1-c1fca1c2adfd"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-08-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679102cafdbe835da554a397","doi":"10.1016/j.csbj.2024.08.017","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2001037024002770?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Entropy-extreme model for predicting the development of cyber epidemics at early stages","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The approaches used in biomedicine to analyze epidemics take into account features such as exponential growth in the early stages, slowdown in dynamics upon saturation, time delays in spread, segmented spread, evolutionary adaptations of the pathogen, and preventive measures based on universal communication protocols. All these characteristics are also present in modern cyber epidemics. Therefore, adapting effective biomedical approaches to epidemic analysis for the investigation of the development of cyber epidemics is a promising scientific research task. The article is dedicated to researching the problem of predicting the development of cyber epidemics at early stages. In such conditions, the available data is scarce, incomplete, and distorted. This situation makes it impossible to use artificial intelligence models for prediction. Therefore, the authors propose an entropy-extreme model, defined within the machine learning paradigm, to address this problem. The model is based on estimating the probability distributions of its controllable parameters from input data, taking into account the variability characteristic of the last ones. The entropy-extreme instance, identified from a set of such distributions, indicates the most uncertain (most negative) trajectory of the investigated process. Numerical methods are used to analyze the generated set of investigated process development trajectories based on the assessments of probability distributions of the controllable parameters and the variability characteristic. The result of the analysis includes characteristic predictive trajectories such as the average and median trajectories from the set, as well as the trajectory corresponding to the standard deviation area of the parameters’ values. Experiments with real data on the infection of Windows-operated devices by various categories of malware showed that the proposed model outperforms the classical competitor (least squares method) in predicting the development of cyber epidemics near the extremum of the time series representing the deployment of such a process over time. Moreover, the proposed model can be applied without any prior hypotheses regarding the probabilistic properties of the available data."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"593-602","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679102cafdbe835da554a399","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","679102cafdbe835da554a39a","679102cafdbe835da554a39b","679102cafdbe835da554a39c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bdd6","mniswId":"4201","title":"Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal","issn":"2001-0370","eissn":"2001-0370","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"738bd37b-b741-4781-ad95-c62f0113f334"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679102cafdbe835da554a398","year":"2024","volume":"24","documentHash":"d8e72587-2b35-4dc6-84a5-093cf0f89d7b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060478034"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790e9c0fdbe835da5503e2f","name":"Baran Can","lastName":"Gül","documentHash":"b16d89ec-874a-4dac-8a59-c82b9d689e39"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"5f532814752340073806a95f","name":"Mert","lastName":"Nakip","uuid":"6EE14383BEC5E308B4B31DB96075B5B9D11B8A3380D47274C583232C87DFE62BA1A38BDA3547E4792533BA246FBB798E501DC0CB82FB2CDB3128BF0BF7CAC8CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6723-6494","documentHash":"d9b43af6-35d8-4aeb-b4af-c25f660650fa"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-09-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6790e9c0fdbe835da5503e2d","doi":"10.1016/j.iot.2024.101340","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2542660524002816?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"DISFIDA: Distributed Self-Supervised Federated Intrusion Detection Algorithm with online learning for health Internet of Things and Internet of Vehicles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Networked health systems are often the victims of cyberattacks with serious consequences for patients and healthcare costs, with the Internet of Things (IoT) being an additional prime target. In future systems we can imagine that the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) will also be used for conveying patients for diagnosis and treatment in an integrated manner. Thus the medical field poses very significant and specific challenges since even for a single patient, several providers may carry out tests or offer healthcare services, and may have distinct interconnected sub-contractors for services such as ambulances and connected cars, connected devices or temporary staff providers, that have distinct confidentiality requirements on top of possible commercial competition. On the other hand, these distinct entities can be subject to similar or coordinated attacks, and could benefit from each others’ cybersecurity experience to better detect and mitigate cyberattacks. Thus the present work proposes a novel Distributed Self-Supervised Federated Intrusion Detection Algorithm (DISFIDA), with Online Self-Supervised Federated Learning, that uses Dense Random Neural Networks (DRNN). In DISFIDA learning data is private, and neuronal weights are shared among Federated partners. Each partner in DISFIDA combines its synaptic weights with those it receives other partners, with a preference for those weights that have closer numerical values to its own weights which it has learned on its own. DISFIDA is tested with three open-access datasets against five benchmark methods, for two relevant IoT healthcare applications: networks of devices (e.g., body sensors), and Connected Smart Vehicles (e.g., ambulances that transport patients). These tests show that the DISFIDA approach offers 100% True Positive Rate for attacks (one percentage point better than comparable state of the art methods which attain 99%) so that it does better at detecting attacks, with 99% True Negative Rate similar to state-of-the-art Federated Learning, for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"101340","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","6790e9c0fdbe835da5503e2f","5f532814752340073806a95f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb7e2","mniswId":"30035","title":"Internet of Things","issn":"2543-1536","eissn":"2542-6605","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"828b0ced-09b7-48fd-885f-f92e2869c276"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6790e9c0fdbe835da5503e2e","year":"2024","volume":"28","documentHash":"ff633302-0374-4395-8095-0afe69d9cd7a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060478379"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67939ec4fdbe835f61f961f4","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"6a505ed2-a288-467e-b2ee-fd18f3dd8328"},{"objectId":"67939ec4fdbe835f61f961f3","name":"Yan","lastName":"Su","documentHash":"f70c9c1b-355a-4b3b-96c5-77af89bcc028"},{"objectId":"67939ec4fdbe835f61f961f2","name":"Jian-Peng","lastName":"Chang","documentHash":"50d1c6c8-3ba6-440a-95cb-f873bd463790"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"67939ec4fdbe835f61f961f0","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2024.120425","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0020025524003384?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Evaluating potential quality of e-commerce order fulfillment service: A collective intelligence-driven approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"E-commerce order fulfillment service (E-COFS) plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer behavior in online marketplaces.

The proposed framework unfolds in three stages: (1) evaluating potential effectiveness of an E-COFS through quantifying stakeholders’ potential satisfaction from the E-COFS plan tailored by its provider, (2) evaluating its potential feasibility by quantifying the potential performance of the E-COFS quality management system (E-COFS-QMS) built by the provider on supporting the plan, and (3) integrating the above two parts to gauge the potential quality of the E-COFS. Building upon this framework, this paper then designs a novel quantitative model. Specifically, this model adopts the linguistic subjective judgment representation method and introduces basic uncertain linguistic information to achieve computing with words. Multiple stakeholders within e-commerce sellers are tasked with articulating their requirements, their preferences and expectations, and consensus reaching process is conducted to obtain the acceptable consensus among these stakeholders. Multiple experts from various domains are tasked with giving their subjective judgements on the performances of E-COFS and E-COFS-QMS, and a method of weighting individual judgments, which respects the reliabilities of individual judgements and the overall similarity in knowledge structures among the experts, is adopted to effectively tap into collective intelligence. Finally, a case study is conducted to validate the validity and feasibility of the proposed quantitative model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"666","pagesFromTo":"120425","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67939ec4fdbe835f61f961f2","67939ec4fdbe835f61f961f3","5e709252878c28a047393b56","67939ec4fdbe835f61f961f4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d5","mniswId":"8327","title":"Information Sciences","issn":"0020-0255","documentHash":"b9c71651-384b-4100-ac35-4c92ec9de0fa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67939ec4fdbe835f61f961f1","year":"2024","volume":"666","documentHash":"56dc7d79-3d60-4ffc-8201-773112f6e2c8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060487210"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6793a0e0fdbe835f61f97690","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","documentHash":"a15c52fb-12b0-40bb-86e3-202422d7c2e8"},{"objectId":"6793a0e0fdbe835f61f9768f","name":"Ya-Qiang","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"a38f021d-73b2-43b0-955c-fc727e48f01e"},{"objectId":"6793a0e0fdbe835f61f9768e","name":"Chong-Ze","lastName":"Liang","documentHash":"a8911dcd-72e4-47cd-a35b-e6272de2ca5b"},{"objectId":"6793a0e0fdbe835f61f9768d","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"a8de112c-5858-49e9-8b4d-d37f5c9bd27a"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"6793a0e0fdbe835f61f9768b","doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2023.102096","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1566253523004128?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Dynamic collective opinion generation framework for digital transformation barrier analysis in the construction industry","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The absence of a reliable, dynamic evaluation system has impeded early-stage industrial research progress, particularly in the digital transformation of the construction industry. Moreover, existing research studies rarely explore the impact of digitalt transformation barriers considering the interplays among them. This paper aims to introduce an innovative framework to generate dynamic collective opinions for barrier analysis in such context. The proposed dynamic collective opinion generation framework comprises three key components: Collective Opinion Generation, Prediction with Expert Advice (PEA), and Social Network Analysis. Its goal is to provide dependable decision support when subjective evaluation data from experts is available. Initially, a bi-objective optimization model generates the initial barrier weight vector. The PEA incorporates a loss function to measure the deviation between aggregated probablity density function and actual observed data, updating the weight vector over time. Next, an influence network covering all barriers is established. Node significance is evaluated through metrics like degree centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality. The gravity model based on three metrics is used to determine interrelationships among barriers, resulting in a weight vector capturing these interplays. The two weight vectors are combined with Nash equilibrium, yielding the ultimate weight vector for barriers. The effectiveness of the proposed dynamic collective opinion generation framework is showcased through a case study on China Construction Third Bureau. Results indicate that talent structure notably influences construction companies' digital transformation. Additionally, market structure and strategic position significantly impact digital transformation in this industry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"103","pagesFromTo":"102096","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6793a0e0fdbe835f61f9768d","6793a0e0fdbe835f61f9768e","6793a0e0fdbe835f61f9768f","6793a0e0fdbe835f61f97690","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d0","mniswId":"8320","title":"Information Fusion","issn":"1566-2535","documentHash":"cd0269a3-9596-445a-8e0c-f38a77fea379"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6793a0e0fdbe835f61f9768c","year":"2024","volume":"103","documentHash":"66f2a9e4-5f5d-413f-a12a-7b49a6ccf9e1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060487374"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67939f90fdbe835f61f969d3","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"eaf43d79-836e-404d-9567-1663f3ce1df7"},{"objectId":"67939f90fdbe835f61f969d2","name":"Gang","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"a1d79315-0e78-432a-871c-2b3901983cb8"},{"objectId":"67939f90fdbe835f61f969d1","name":"Zhi-Peng","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"da441f35-425f-4bf3-b3a4-d314766887bb"},{"objectId":"67939f90fdbe835f61f969d0","name":"Sheng-Hua","lastName":"Xiong","documentHash":"50879f20-93fd-4069-a7cb-0b8d3a4302b4"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"67939f90fdbe835f61f969ce","doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2024.120376","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0020025524002895?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Prediction of airport runway settlement using an integrated SBAS-InSAR and BP-EnKF approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The prediction of surface settlement occupies a crucial role in achieving effective catastrophe prevention and mitigation, as well as facilitating the maintenance of airport runways.

The Small Baseline Subset Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology is employed to derive the settlement time series on the runway of Kangding Airport. Moreover, three sites with high coherence within the primary settlement region are employed to assess the dependability of the model after the expansion of the data by cubic spline interpolation. The findings of the study indicate that both the BP-EnKF and BP models exhibit favorable outcomes in predicting airport runway settlement. However, following the alteration of data caused by external environmental influences, the BP-EnKF model has superior adaptability to variations in data.

The research results firstly indicate that the optimal online pricing ratio is significantly influenced by the creation effort cost coefficient of the restaurant or vlogger, as well as the potential market scale. The optimal creation effort in different channel is mainly related to the revenue sharing rate and the vlogger influence. Secondly, the restaurant prefers to build her own short video channel when the potential market scale is higher and the platform's commission rate is lower. By contrast, the restaurant opts to introduce the third-party vlogger short video channel when both the signing fee for vlogger and commission fee for platform are lower.

However, the traditional reliability estimation for complex structures is generally computationally expensive. This study proposes a novel and time-saving active learning (AL) approach to predict the structural time-variant response and calculate the reliability under extreme wind loads based on improved Query-by-Dropout-Committee (QBDC), Deep Learning (DL) and Probability Density Evolution Method (PDEM). To establish an effective training set, the load sample pool from the turbulent wind field is constructed by the number theory method (NTM). Then a DL surrogate model, aimed to simulate the excitation-response relationship of the structure, is well-trained from data calculated by the Finite Element Method (FEM) under the workflow of the improved QBDC-based AL approach. Lastly, the structural responses predicted by the surrogate model are used to solve the Generalized Density Evolution Equation (GDEE) to obtain the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the structural response. The dynamic reliability can be gained using absorbing boundary condition. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, an ABM in China is taken as a case study. It is found that (1) The external trusses of the platform are weak positions under the horizontal wind loads. It is suggested to append the longitudinal (windward direction) trusses to reduce the local stress and deformation. (2) Under turbulent wind loads with the average speed of 40 m/s, the maximum structural response of the ABM will exceed the threshold value and the reliability is 0.932. (3) The reliability calculation error derived by the proposed approach and the traditional PDEM is within 0.5 % in this study, while the computational efficiency of the AL approach is 77.08 % higher than that of the traditional PDEM. The novelty lies in the proposed active learning approach that can easily obtain the stochastic response and dynamic reliability of the ABM, where the analysis workflow not only has a low computational cost but also maintains a high calculation accuracy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"244","pagesFromTo":"109927","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6793a01efdbe835f61f96d9d","6793a01efdbe835f61f96d9e","6793a01efdbe835f61f96d9f","6793a01efdbe835f61f96da0","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f3","mniswId":"17139","title":"RELIABILITY ENGINEERING & SYSTEM SAFETY","issn":"0951-8320","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"5da55e3d-6547-4f79-a942-2d63a0457404"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060487653"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679371a4fdbe835f61f65669","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Korzekwa","documentHash":"780bd413-b1a8-4cbf-b84a-7aa0c2d868ad"},{"objectId":"679371a4fdbe835f61f65668","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kukulski","documentHash":"b555de7d-b771-4dc6-83e3-cc5e22ed013a"},{"objectId":"679371a4fdbe835f61f65667","name":"Christopher T.","lastName":"Chubb","documentHash":"35cbdc13-d5eb-4775-985c-3b8187cf904c"},{"objectId":"679371a4fdbe835f61f65666","name":"Fereshte","lastName":"Shahbeigi","documentHash":"2069ed51-1fb9-4d3b-bf82-fb547790e227"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawela","uuid":"068B730D2C136A32A8BA02EE7CD80A8C260FDD4556CF79F5C2F70EDDF891933ACE74BCB5A2F5F4BDC3024342BFF8AE78616CB1C0A435CA6477DA4C1A6F40E51B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0476-7132","documentHash":"0edf79c6-1d52-4bb1-a0da-0af3724cb1c1"}],"objectId":"679371a4fdbe835f61f65665","doi":"10.22331/q-2024-07-10-1404","publicUri":"https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2024-07-10-1404/pdf/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Quantum-embeddable stochastic matrices","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The classical embeddability problem asks whether a given stochastic matrix T, describing transition probabilities of a d-level system, can arise from the underlying homogeneous continuous-time Markov process. Here, we investigate the quantum version of this problem, asking of the existence of a Markovian quantum channel generating state transitions described by a given T. More precisely, we aim at characterising the set of quantum-embeddable stochastic matrices that arise from memoryless continuous-time quantum evolution. To this end, we derive both upper and lower bounds on that set, providing new families of stochastic matrices that are quantum-embeddable but not classically-embeddable, as well as families of stochastic matrices that are not quantum-embeddable. As a result, we demonstrate that a larger set of transition matrices can be explained by memoryless models if the dynamics is allowed to be quantum, but we also identify a non-zero measure set of random processes that cannot be explained by either classical or quantum memoryless dynamics. Finally, we fully characterise extreme stochastic matrices (with entries given only by zeros and ones) that are quantum-embeddable"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa43c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"1404","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679371a4fdbe835f61f65666","679371a4fdbe835f61f65667","679371a4fdbe835f61f65668","5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","679371a4fdbe835f61f65669"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d018","mniswId":"16923","title":"Quantum","issn":"2521-327X","eissn":"2521-327X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"9f86b1af-c370-4a2d-9cd0-07f2b5088441"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cdefd74097074ca0b915d7","year":"2024","volume":"8","documentHash":"b8c59cb9-b50f-4903-8a69-3d383d50b2cd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060487827"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67939c9ffdbe835f61f94b69","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"060a6170-f05b-43bb-8045-8561d75017c2"},{"objectId":"67939c9ffdbe835f61f94b68","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","documentHash":"a1f513f0-4a4a-4c62-9070-6568aa5d39a9"},{"objectId":"67939c9ffdbe835f61f94b67","name":"Lin","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"3944ed1e-3118-477b-896d-67004a9b9e7b"},{"objectId":"67939c9ffdbe835f61f94b66","name":"Yanfang","lastName":"Ma","documentHash":"96999b9e-2264-4a8c-b8c2-082bc2c593bd"},{"objectId":"67939c9ffdbe835f61f94b65","name":"Qiurui","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"86a4e6ed-059a-403b-a625-62c0cf005029"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"67939c9ffdbe835f61f94b64","doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2024.102423","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S156625352400201X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Artificial intelligence for production, operations and logistics management in modular construction industry: A systematic literature review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has garnered significant attention within the modular construction industry, emerging as a prominent frontier development trend.

However, the adoption of DT within the construction industry remains notably lagging, and small and medium-sized construction enterprises (SMCEs), constrained by limited resources, antiquated technologies, and constrained risk tolerance compared to large enterprises, encounter heightened impediments in undertaking DT. Current research on DT in the construction industry focuses predominantly on large enterprises or the industry holistically. These studies allocate relatively diminished focus to the imprecision of expert opinions and the impact of expert behavioral factors on decision outcomes. We construct a barriers examination framework aimed at ranking the barriers for DT in SMCEs. The proposed framework comprises two pivotal components: (1) the technical, organizational, and environmental barriers for DT in SMCEs; (2) an enhanced collective opinion generation paradigm driven by the social-welfare and confidence optimizing approach. Following the proposed framework, experts are tasked with assessing 14 barriers based on 5 levels of importance. The probability theory approach is applied to model expert opinions as probability distribution functions (PDFs) to reduce the inherent imprecision of expert opinions. The proposed social-welfare and confidence optimizing approach is utilized for aggregating individual PDFs to generate collective PDFs representing the importance level of each barrier. An empirical survey on SMCEs in Wuhan proves the feasibility and validity of the proposed barriers examination framework and indicates that the largest barrier to implement DT for SMCEs in Wuhan is the lack of standards and regulations, followed by the lack of clear strategic planning. The study not only summarizes the barriers for DT in SMCEs, but also adopts the social-welfare and confidence optimizing approach to improve the objectivity and reliability of the collective opinion, therefore, the conclusion can provide a reference for SMCEs to implement DT."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"663","pagesFromTo":"120312","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6793a087fdbe835f61f96f82","6793a087fdbe835f61f96f83","6793a087fdbe835f61f96f84","6793a087fdbe835f61f96f85","6793a087fdbe835f61f96f86","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d5","mniswId":"8327","title":"Information Sciences","issn":"0020-0255","documentHash":"b9c71651-384b-4100-ac35-4c92ec9de0fa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6793a087fdbe835f61f96f81","year":"2024","volume":"663","documentHash":"e6c31b34-59f8-4acd-83dd-3f1a11d800b7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060487837"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678faca1fdbe835856bd1d0f","name":"Oliver","lastName":"Gasser","documentHash":"6406dacb-45e9-4cff-9c1e-555d08dc86f4"},{"objectId":"678faca1fdbe835856bd1d0e","name":"Lars","lastName":"Prehn","documentHash":"083f825f-8666-49ce-a72b-4c5e4672c21c"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa996","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Foremski","uuid":"3F142788B22876477B322FE36FF95BA33005C5C6FB092A26A40673EE15D65AA3538B2A3B9B84909EEE83B4A547D99AB115124CB1470F1485EBD0614344CCD717","orcidId":"0000-0003-1187-4793","documentHash":"532652e1-ff41-4b03-9fdd-32d00f6cc916"}],"objectId":"678faca1fdbe835856bd1d0d","doi":"10.1145/3634737.3657000","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3634737.3657000","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Kirin: Hitting the Internet with Distributed BGP Announcements","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Internet is a critical resource in the daily life of billions of users. To support the growing number of users and their increasing demands, operators continuously scale their network footprint---e.g., by joining Internet Exchange Points (IXPs)---and adopt relevant technologies---such as IPv6---which provides a vastly larger address space than its predecessor.\nIn this paper, we revisit prefix de-aggregation attacks in the light of these two changes and introduce Kirin---an advanced BGP prefix de-aggregation attack that announces millions of IPv6 routes via thousands of IXP connections to overflow the memory of routers within remote ASes. Kirin's highly distributed nature allows it to bypass traditional route-flooding defense mechanisms, such as per-session prefix limits or route flap damping.\nWe analyze Kirin's theoretical feasibility by formulating it as a mathematical optimization problem, test for practical hurdles by deploying enough infrastructure to perform a micro-scale Kirin attack using 4 IXPs, and validate our assumptions via BGP data analysis, real-world measurements, and router testbed experiments. Despite its low deployment cost, we find that Kirin may inject lethal amounts of routes into the routers of thousands of ASes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa996"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"19-34","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621b878c2877157415d7","mniswId":"61","fullName":"Asia Conference on Information, Computer and Communications Security","shortName":"AsiaCCS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"13f8608b-a8eb-4fc0-ab9b-0e1f981412a1"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"678fab31fdbe835856bcd5dc","startDate":"2024-07-01","endDate":"2024-07-05","fullName":"ASIA CCS '24: 19th ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security","shortName":"ASIA CCS '24","city":"Singapore","country":"SG","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"0e6652f7-0c89-4d86-a831-ff30528e1f18"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678faca1fdbe835856bd1d0e","5e70937a878c28a0473aa996","678faca1fdbe835856bd1d0f"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"678fac79fdbe835856bd1caf","title":"ASIA CCS '24: Proceedings of the 19th ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security","year":2024,"isbn":"979-8-4007-0482-6","translation":false,"documentHash":"43750011-4f39-4171-bab1-9f3e69730b39"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060533926"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790d2d9fdbe835da54bde6f","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Hendzel","documentHash":"0b9a5921-0f3f-4e8d-8091-8a86166effb4"},{"objectId":"6790d2d9fdbe835da54bde6e","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Stępniak","documentHash":"af03aa61-d846-4da6-8b40-d55f5c866b8f"},{"objectId":"6790d2d9fdbe835da54bde6d","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kukulski","documentHash":"2655e331-7a67-4d7c-bef6-5b6bd4de4a5e"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Gardas","uuid":"3C1048715375037F9EE2B99F8CFAC2669B8EC38A3E356582DC5ACEEEFB48E40873FCFA5211D02B422339B025B376B6DCAFB77641E9A3875258E54FF2EAD5C259","orcidId":"0000-0002-1454-1591","documentHash":"4f5c5866-335d-4b37-886c-e252534aa3b4"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawela","uuid":"068B730D2C136A32A8BA02EE7CD80A8C260FDD4556CF79F5C2F70EDDF891933ACE74BCB5A2F5F4BDC3024342BFF8AE78616CB1C0A435CA6477DA4C1A6F40E51B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0476-7132","documentHash":"0edf79c6-1d52-4bb1-a0da-0af3724cb1c1"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Puchała","uuid":"084E5F6A60B0C0CA41B364C281E70B8FFF17CAB5C42C464CF3B473E5DDDE7CF4F75350AFE021EEFC95F81444AEB0EDF8B955A7569D9FAC1A7DC77CAD370DD038","orcidId":"0000-0002-4739-0400","documentHash":"a6454553-3823-42b4-904b-d14ce1638536"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6790d2d9fdbe835da54bde6c","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-75148-z","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-75148-z.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Local certification of unitary operations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this work, we analyze the local certification of unitary quantum channels, which is a natural extension of quantum hypothesis testing.

Our result indicates connection of the local certification problem with a product numerical range of unitary matrices. We show that the optimal local strategy does not need usage of auxiliary systems and requires only single round of one-way classical communication.

Nonlinear dynamic models, most commonly the SIR model, are widely used to describe such processes. The description of the studied process obtained using this model is sensitive to the initial conditions set and the quality of tuning the controlled parameters based on the results of operational observations, which are inherently uncertain. This article proposes a transition to a stochastic interpretation of the controlled parameters of the SIR model and the introduction of additional stochastic parameters that represent the variability of operational data measurements. The process of estimating the probability density functions of these parameters and noises is implemented as a strict optimization problem. The resulting mathematical apparatus is generalized in the form of two versions of the entropy-extremal adaptation of the SIR model, which are applied to forecast the spread of a cyber epidemic. The first version is focused on estimating the SIR model parameters based on operational data. In contrast, the second version focuses on stochastic modelling of the transmission rate indicator and its impact on forecasting the studied process. The forecasting result represents the average trajectory from the set of trajectories obtained using the authors’ models, which characterize the dynamics of compartment I. The experimental part of the article compares the classical Least Squares method with the authors’ entropy-extremal approach for estimating the SIR model parameters based on etalon data on the spread of the most threatening categories of malware cyber epidemics. The empirical results are characterized by a significant reduction in the Mean Absolute Percentage Error regarding the etalon data over the prediction interval, which proves the adequacy of the proposed approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"100572","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679101dffdbe835da55492dd","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","679101dffdbe835da55492de","679101dffdbe835da55492df","679101dffdbe835da55492e0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfbe","mniswId":"5485","title":"Egyptian Informatics Journal","issn":"1110-8665","eissn":"2090-4754","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0fa39667-c50f-410a-a63b-222c916b01f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679101dffdbe835da55492dc","year":"2024","volume":"28","documentHash":"2051943d-186b-476e-b165-81dfb437d56b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060541236"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790d100fdbe835da54bb1d0","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Deffner","documentHash":"86bf64ac-c528-4670-a04e-c9aa22a597f6"},{"objectId":"6790d100fdbe835da54bb1cf","name":"Akram","lastName":"Touil","documentHash":"3de7082d-27af-4039-a087-f04f8e05a1b0"},{"objectId":"6790d100fdbe835da54bb1ce","name":"Devjyoti","lastName":"Tripathy","documentHash":"dbd09582-0541-4e01-aaa7-7513ec3da901"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Gardas","uuid":"3C1048715375037F9EE2B99F8CFAC2669B8EC38A3E356582DC5ACEEEFB48E40873FCFA5211D02B422339B025B376B6DCAFB77641E9A3875258E54FF2EAD5C259","orcidId":"0000-0002-1454-1591","documentHash":"4f5c5866-335d-4b37-886c-e252534aa3b4"}],"objectId":"6790d100fdbe835da54bb1cd","doi":"10.1063/5.0199335","publicUri":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/cha/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0199335/19870479/043121_1_5.0199335.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Quantum information scrambling in two-dimensional Bose–Hubbard lattices","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It is a well-understood fact that the transport of excitations throughout a lattice is intimately governed by the underlying structures.

The FSR approach augments norm based smoothing term into an - combination, facilitating the integration of regularization into the SVR method, thereby enhancing generalization with minimal computational load. We evaluate the performance of Hybrid FSR-SVR using two distinct datasets covering indoor and forest fires, benchmarking against 15 machine learning models, including state-of-the-art techniques, such as Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network (rTPNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Gradient Boosting. Our findings demonstrate that Hybrid FSR-SVR effectively assesses the risk of forest fire, enabling early preventive measures. Notably, it achieves a remarkable accuracy of 0.95 for forest fire detection and ranks third with 0.88 accuracy for indoor fire detection. Importantly, it exhibits computation times significantly lower – by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude – than the majority of compared techniques.

The research aim is the substantiation of the helicopter turboshaft engine’s mathematically reconfigured automatic control system in the event of the failure of a standard sensor, which will ensure the helicopter turboshaft engine’s stable operation under failure conditions, minimizing the impact on engine control and performance. A theorem was developed and proven concerning the reconfiguration of the helicopter turboshaft engine’s automatic control system structure, defining the system’s new mathematical form using nonlinear thermogas-dynamic parameters. A method was proposed to determine the values of these parameters that keep the reconfigured control system stable. This method uses numerical optimization to find the best thermogas-dynamic parameters to ensure system stability. Experimental results showed that for slow changes, using parameters from the previous step works best, while for fast changes, restarting is more effective due to significant differences in the system states. The accuracy of the proposed mathematical model for the reconfigured control system was confirmed through mean square error analysis (within 0.4% and 0.77% under white noise), regression analysis (with a determination coefficient of 0.986), and cross-validation (with a metric deviation from the maximum mean square error of 3.88%)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej

The article presents a mathematical apparatus that allows the average service duration of an information message during its transfer from the terminal to the WiMax-1/2 base station to be estimated. Unlike analogues, the presented concept adequately describes the investigated process for any number of terminals, taking into account both the queuing effect on their side and the functioning of the cumulative query transmission mechanism inherent in WiMax-1/2 technology. Therefore, the proposed mathematical apparatus, describing the process of servicing an information message, takes into account both the average duration accompanied by potential collisions in the process of sending a request for the allocation of communication resources for its transmission to the base station, and the average duration of the information message's stay in the terminal queue. Experimental studies demonstrated the adequacy of the proposed mathematical apparatus for describing the investigated process. The experimental section also formulates the optimization problem of the investigated process resulting from the management of competitive access parameters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"7","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","67924d06fdbe830e6d93db67","67924d06fdbe830e6d93db68"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d264","mniswId":"18022","title":"Royal Society Open Science","issn":"2054-5703","eissn":"2054-5703","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6f4c786b-2ed7-4570-9643-08e546511567"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67924d06fdbe830e6d93db66","year":"2024","volume":"11","number":"7","documentHash":"9a5e9c2d-84fc-4f24-b8d9-b614e65bc278"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060544857"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679398d6fdbe835f61f91e63","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"39cb72cc-b71c-4c04-ae16-bc76f23baed9"},{"objectId":"679398d6fdbe835f61f91e62","name":"Kannan","lastName":"Govindan","documentHash":"caffd7cf-cd6d-49bb-b136-1d5d4f90a38c"},{"objectId":"679398d6fdbe835f61f91e61","name":"Muhammet","lastName":"Deveci","documentHash":"67c8b0c5-5e6f-4ea5-a2f2-3b1ae5815277"},{"objectId":"679398d6fdbe835f61f91e60","name":"Qin","lastName":"Su","documentHash":"bcd6bc94-946d-4e8b-ac4a-358d38979c06"},{"objectId":"679398d6fdbe835f61f91e5f","name":"Yangyang","lastName":"Sun","documentHash":"c429c7e6-4541-4029-ad5d-9832399e32d2"},{"objectId":"679398d6fdbe835f61f91e5e","name":"Zhu-Jun","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"c2e02aaf-5f11-47a4-80bc-2604906bb111"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"679398d6fdbe835f61f91e5d","doi":"10.1007/s10726-024-09877-x","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10726-024-09877-x.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Smart Contract Application in Resisting Extreme Weather Risks for the Prefabricated Construction Supply Chain: Prototype Exploration and Assessment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The increasing frequency of extreme weather (EW) events has created significant vulnerabilities in the normal operations of the prefabricated construction supply chain (PCSC).

Additionally, it identifies 28 potential barriers affecting smart contract adoption in the PCSC using the Technology-Organization-Environment framework. Furthermore, the paper presents a multi-objective optimization-based group decision-making method to assess the feasibility of smart contract adoption in the PCSC. An online survey was then conducted among 50 stakeholders from various links of the PCSC to gather insights into smart contract adoption. The results indicate that stakeholder awareness of smart contracts and the current corporate level are the most influential factors in decision-making.

Once a new process arrives, log files are collected by monitoring the Event Tracing for Windows facility as well as listing the executables of the active process for violation detection. The proposed approach significantly reduces detection time and minimizes resource consumption by adopting parallel computing (programming), where the main software (Master) divides the work, organizes the process of searching for artifacts, and distributes tasks to several agents. A dataset of 17411 malware samples is used in the assessment of the new approach. It provided satisfactory and reliable results in dealing with at least six different process injection techniques including classic DLL injection, reflective DLL injection, process hollowing, hook injection, registry modifications, and .NET DLL injection. The detection accuracy rate has reached with a false-positive rate of . Moreover, the accuracy was monitored in the case of launching several malwares using different process injection techniques simultaneously, and the detector was able to detect them efficiently.

These problems are known to be NP-hard, given the numerous restrictions of traffic nature. With the recent advances in quantum technologies, quantum annealing has become an alternative method to solve such optimization problems. To use quantum annealing, the problem needs to be encoded in quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) or higher-order binary optimization (HOBO) formulation that can be recast as a QUBO. This paper introduces QUBO and HOBO representations for rescheduling problems of railway traffic management; the latter is a new approach up to our knowledge. This new approach takes into account not only the single-track lines but also the double- and multi-track lines, as well as stations composed of tracks and switches. We consider the conditions of minimal headway between trains, minimal stay on stations, track occupation, and rolling stock circulation. Furthermore, a hybrid quantum-classical procedure is presented that includes rerouting. We demonstrate the proof of concept implementation on the D-Wave Quantum Processing Unit and D-Wave hybrid solver.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709385878c28a0473abcaf"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","61454f299543c7051ff01cf2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-33","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709385878c28a0473abcaf","5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","61454f299543c7051ff01cf2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547948f","mniswId":"16926","title":"Quantum Information Processing","issn":"1570-0755","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"08e2fa9a-fe30-4bf8-b883-996bc3595b32"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zmiany w trasowaniu pociągów","zmiany w rozkładzie jazdy pociągów","optymalizacja binarna wyższego rzędu","hybrydowa procedura kwantowo-klasyczna","wyżarzacz D-Wave"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["railway rescheduling","D-Wave annealer","higher-order binary optimization","quantum-classical hybrid procedurę","railway rerouting"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747088288041"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","name":"Godlove","lastName":"Kuaban","uuid":"EC7E7F9A13DA2FF8F55E44B4B99C3C2F1E000A81058C127DFD5262D301424BA1EA9459DEA4307FD055980254A4F03934B883B243B8F00D784E1B548726F9EF79","documentHash":"caa3d804-e4e6-493c-b7ad-e9ff4795b04e"},{"objectId":"63bff3dd40970702a6693f75","name":"Mathias","lastName":"Evina","documentHash":"5cf88f40-b042-47d2-b98b-8f5f03f88c08"},{"objectId":"63bff3dd40970702a6693f74","name":"John Ngagsi","lastName":"Ngah","documentHash":"8df71fe0-daae-4ad3-90b7-2c0e68396326"},{"objectId":"63bff3dd40970702a6693f73","name":"Julius Kewir","lastName":"Tangka","documentHash":"206164a5-9351-4781-9fa5-9014673f691c"}],"objectId":"63bff3dd40970702a6693f6f","doi":"10.14738/aivp.104.12621","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.14738/aivp.104.12621","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Comparative Analysis of the Vibrational Response of a Homemade Helicopter Main Rotor Blade Profiles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper investigates the dynamics of homemade helicopter wooden and aluminum sheet rotor blades. The rotors are articulated and their blades are rigid. The main rotor implementation takes into account flap, lag, and feather degrees of freedom for each of the equispaced blades as well as their dynamic couplings. Transmitted vibrations due to the rotating rotor blades on the body structure (fuselage) are studied. This work presents an aerodynamic model of main rotor blades that allows us to analyse vibrational transmissions on the fuselage (body) of the craft. Vibrations in helicopters is a common problem which involves complex interactions between the inertial, structural and aerodynamic loads, especially in homemade helicopters. The major source of vibrations in helicopters is the main rotor. The efficiency and stability of the main rotor blades is determined by the magnitudes of the predominant frequencies they produce. These vibrations affect the functionality, durability of the engine component parts, increase maintenance frequency (cost), and cause structural failures. The aerodynamic model has been built up using blade element theory. The aerodynamic load creates vibrations on the homemade helicopter and these are analyzed on the fuselage by using a short time Fourier transform that brings out the vibrational spectrum.

As a result, a stationary distribution of the size of the sliding window was obtained both for the resulting semi-Markov process and for nested Markov chains, etc. A recursive approach to the calculation of the mentioned stationary distribution is formalized. This approach is characterized by linear computational complexity. Based on the obtained stationary distribution of the size of the sliding window, a distribution function is formulated that characterizes the bandwidth of the communication channel between the entities specified in the research object. Using the resulting mathematical apparatus, the Window Scale parameter of the TCP Westwood+ protocol was tuned.

In an ordinary 5G smart city cluster, Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) and enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) traffic types prevail. The formation of an effective QoS policy for such an object (taking into account the potentially active slicing technology) is an urgent problem. As a baseline, this research considers a Quality of Service (QoS) policy with constraints for context-defined URLLC and eMBB classes of incoming requests. Evaluating the QoS policy instance defined within the framework of the basic concept requires the formalization of both a complete qualitative metric and a computationally efficient mathematical apparatus for its calculation. The article presents accurate and approximate methods of calculating such quality parameters as the probability of loss of typed requests and the utilization ratio of the communication resource, which depend on the implementation of the estimated QoS policy. At the same time, the original parametric space includes both fixed characteristics (amount of available communication resources, load according to request classes) and controlled characteristics due to the specifics of the implementation of the basic QoS concept. The paper empirically proves the adequacy of the presented mathematical apparatus for evaluating the QoS policy defined within the scope of the research. Also, in the proposed qualitative metric, a comparison of the author’s concept with a parametrically close analogue (the well-known QoS policy scheme, which takes into account the phenomenon of reservation of communication resources), determined taking into account the reservation of communication resources, was made. The results of the comparison testify in favour of the superiority of the author’s approach in the proposed metrics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"e0295252","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","6734826afdbe8361a578c1bd","6734826afdbe8361a578c1be"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","eissn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"fcfcc06e-e7b2-4412-a89f-df94326b9f49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65815e664097076c14b669fc","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"18","number":"12","documentHash":"73603b96-0c53-498c-bba4-96a1a969376b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747088288349"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","name":"Akash ","lastName":"Kundu ","uuid":"70EF4FF1C1BF816CC3B984BCD37EA6A8D6FD08B7B5F083C04D729C4496000CCD839F3A895088F8E4A8A66892E390213313379D4319F9CE4E542CE870D22450B5","documentHash":"8452fc8c-3054-495d-a245-09e1edeca4ad"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"639703b640970751e82884d0","doi":"10.1002/andp.202200026","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/andp.202200026","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Transparency and Enhancement in Fast and Slow Light in\n            <i>q</i>\n            ‐Deformed Optomechanical System","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nonclassical phenomena can be enhanced by introducing q-deformation in optomechanical systems. This motivates investigation of the optical response in a q-deformed linearly coupled optomechanical system. The system consists of two deformed cavities that are linearly coupled to the motion of mechanical mirrors, and the cavities are coupled to each other by transmission strength parameter. This study shows that compared to non-deformed cases, the deformed system exhibits more rapid phase transition at the positions of transparency windows, causing stronger and enhanced fast and slow light phenomena. Moreover, in the region , the optomechanical system results in gain. Additionally, for a fixed deformation of cavities, by tuning the tunneling strength and optomechanical coupling, one can observe a delay and advancement in probe field in the order of milliseconds and even above milliseconds for fine-tuning of the coupling parameters. Finally, the bridge between mathematical and physical models is built by assuming the deformation to be a primitive root of unity, which indicates a class of anyon models. These results demonstrate that q-deformation provides a novel method for manipulating and significantly enhancing optical phenomena not only in arbitrarily deformed optomechanical systems but also in anyon models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"534","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2200026","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547703d","mniswId":"1159","title":"ANNALEN DER PHYSIK","issn":"0003-3804","eissn":"1521-3889","documentHash":"b804f77c-ff34-4832-a9cd-db049de79ca0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639703b640970751e82884d1","year":"2022","volume":"534","number":"8","documentHash":"be29e442-a6be-4dba-b261-77afd53242d7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747174869602"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61b6be387523402a58cb071d","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Łaskarzewski ","uuid":"86EB4935FA7120A3AC092A39CE9E3339D95D9CEA6D3588FE6D805E4A485B202B865BF5355B541E28457C67A6B5EEE92142CD874B9F8D18F5122D0CB75084AE07","documentHash":"0fd63262-06fe-4187-8306-91db64669664"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Strzoda","uuid":"B0D6BFD33F8756550BC38B6185859322A184B3218CD98302394D0F3F0656FFC9ABA9C0B7A0D1DF0937FAD3533FAC8C4EC0A7208C4C29B23D42E7C222AC2040EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3994-1428","documentHash":"de4a5946-337f-4f96-9f61-e50ef06171cd"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d4","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Książek","uuid":"D89949D0F75B67CE9F451472DB19F0A6BF6D7F2F2606150E9584C9AD3B6D03C289B6EBD4439677FD75526EDC2F4B4445D9A69DDC82967012B66F54FA88F553A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0201-6220","documentHash":"b61af690-ba0e-4f43-8e0c-7952ac630f87"},{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abc53","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Marjasz","uuid":"E8D6AC5A29FA294ED1BEE9D77C42213DF5440A192232E8879796967716E7FAF87CE88C81304AD79357C7E16CF0050973AACB8A99DAEA4927F24D37EEFB4F91EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9187-0009","documentHash":"933c3234-e315-4184-995f-a25ed49ce8b9"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Głomb","uuid":"67B5DF4EBEF036D7B1861B26A48C3ABE0E65A55A852DCAAEEF5DFCD3DEF99C6112C878B3A303C0B2F361D1FD7CAE0F6524E3EE80853F54592EC6A1FEE1A7D1B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0215-4674","documentHash":"f96d93e7-9254-4b2f-8620-8a6cffc11fbb"}],"objectId":"6390d5e1409707120cd09d9d","doi":"10.1145/3544561","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1145/3544561","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Energy-Aware Algorithm for Assignment of Relays in LP WAN","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Low-Power Wide-Area Networks allow maintaining connectivity with devices over a distance of a few\nkilometres.

The procedure is developed by combining Choi–Jamiołkowski isomorphism with the variational hybrid quantum–classical procedure for matrix diagonalization. We compare the introduced procedure with the scheme based on the standard bounds for the similarity between quantum operations by analysing its action on random quantum channels.

Its applications spread far beyond physic due to its deep relation to various combinatorial optimization problems, such as travelling salesman or protein folding. Sophisticated new methods for solving Ising instances rely on quantum annealing, which is a paradigm of quantum computation. However, commercially available quantum annealers are still prone to errors, and their ability to find low energetic states is limited. This naturally calls for a post-processing procedure to correct errors. As a proof-of-concept, this work combines the recent ideas revolving around the DIRAC architecture with the Chimera topology and applies them in a real-world setting as an error-correcting scheme for D-Wave quantum annealers. Our preliminary results show how to correct states output by quantum annealers using reinforcement learning. Our approach exhibits excellent scalability, as it can be trained on small instances. However, its performance on the Chimera graphs is still inferior to Monte Carlo methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603db3fe9543c711bc6e9ddf","5e70947c878c28a0473be29c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603db3fe9543c711bc6e9ddf","5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"261-268","conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157418c4","mniswId":"952","fullName":"International Conference on Computational Science","shortName":"ICCS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"9690889e-bedf-4a40-a0bf-ea4bccddb401"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"659ea3c74097076c14407e1f","startDate":"2022-06-21","endDate":"2022-06-23","fullName":"International Conference on Computational Science","shortName":"ICCS","city":"Londyn","country":"GB","website":"https://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2022/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"eec963cc-c2b8-4b6e-abf1-dc390f6b54aa"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947c878c28a0473be29c","603db3fe9543c711bc6e9ddf","5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Quantum error correction\nQuantum annealing\nDeep reinforcement learning\nGraph neural networks"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747174869726"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674f47a0fdbe8357173e5763","name":"Jonas","lastName":"Šaparauskas","documentHash":"21b75936-54f4-43fc-86d0-cea1ef44c7e0"},{"objectId":"674f47a0fdbe8357173e5762","name":"Liang","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"eb42891b-129c-4cae-a0d5-518c3a8faeee"},{"objectId":"674f47a0fdbe8357173e5761","name":"Peikun","lastName":"Su","documentHash":"5fba5acf-0f31-4449-b757-56408d867f89"},{"objectId":"674f47a0fdbe8357173e5760","name":"Sai","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"1a2ca574-b520-4de2-af25-7b1c65cc48e9"},{"objectId":"674f47a0fdbe8357173e575f","name":"Zhipeng","lastName":"Qi","documentHash":"c61965e1-f06a-43d0-af61-c24aec66efca"},{"objectId":"674f47a0fdbe8357173e575e","name":"Xuhui","lastName":"Cong","documentHash":"2576b763-5802-476f-b9c6-2bef61e33b06"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"},{"objectId":"5e70924c878c28a047393567","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Górecki","uuid":"310562023B91962FE5C564E8F355F2659FBF20F89EF5480480A187225AD9D98727C754998C8AEDDB2D075890058E82517A9CFB4D91DC40C61D37C05C0AA8E120","orcidId":"0000-0001-6829-3127","documentHash":"4d82a47a-8b97-4c32-a314-e4099b2dbafe"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"659fef0040970707a1302d68","doi":"10.3390/land12101886","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Ecological Welfare Performance Evaluation and Spatial–Temporal Difference Evolution of Blue Economic Zones: A Case Study of the Blue Economic Zone of Shandong Peninsula","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de37","uid":"b-PdnZEwPPqnj7lgYIEYVlw","uuid":"ad77ae28-a912-4f87-8be3-40ac466442c8","name":"Politechnika Bydgoska im.

Some solvers can already leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In our study, we utilize D-Wave hybrid solvers that implement classical heuristics with potential assistance from a quantum processing unit. This hybrid methodology performs comparably to existing classical solvers. However, due to the proprietary nature of the software, the precise contribution of quantum computation remains unclear. Our analysis focuses on a practical, business-oriented scenario: scheduling AGVs within a factory constrained by limited space, simulating a realistic production setting. Our approach maps a realistic AGVs problem onto one reminiscent of railway scheduling and demonstrates that the AGVs problem is better suited to quantum computing than its railway counterpart, the latter being denser in terms of the average number of constraints per variable. The main idea here is to highlight the potential usefulness of a hybrid approach for handling AGVs scheduling problems of practical sizes. We show that a scenario involving up to 21 AGVs, significant due to possible deadlocks, can be efficiently addressed by a hybrid solver in seconds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603db3fe9543c711bc6e9ddf","5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["603db3fe9543c711bc6e9ddf","678f99cbfdbe835856b9f692","678f99cbfdbe835856b9f693","5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","678f99cbfdbe835856b9f694","5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f","678f99cbfdbe835856b9f695","5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747174876364"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790cf34fdbe835da54b7b4f","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Deffner","documentHash":"cf0c0e30-3810-4c86-b2f0-1a06f2eac8b3"},{"objectId":"62f5bb287523404ea24196c9","name":"Zakaria","lastName":"Mzaouali","uuid":"F6786D8FAFEB1590A4572D63333632D3AF3D0FD86B2B6285A253BF93468195EB7FE92109876DB2F36615388F3F4E36575282E0BB9951E0D1BE53D77F62349F0D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3948-1318","documentHash":"9ab4aadd-3d07-4513-8357-6969c254ebea"},{"objectId":"603db3fe9543c711bc6e9ddf","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Śmierzchalski","uuid":"727C37B361CF5288ED9A3B97F967929EF639F853B80C7E114B0CC7C3AFA2A90ACA96E6DD0D0E20DE78E963EF5EF1A9E83FC3293F0ECFF3306E9646CB094DEFBA","documentHash":"611577de-b211-4c43-b680-f0e4063abbe8"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Gardas","uuid":"3C1048715375037F9EE2B99F8CFAC2669B8EC38A3E356582DC5ACEEEFB48E40873FCFA5211D02B422339B025B376B6DCAFB77641E9A3875258E54FF2EAD5C259","orcidId":"0000-0002-1454-1591","documentHash":"4f5c5866-335d-4b37-886c-e252534aa3b4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6790cf34fdbe835da54b7b4e","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-55314-z","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55314-z.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Efficiency optimization in quantum computing: balancing thermodynamics and computational performance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate the computational efficiency and thermodynamic cost of the D-Wave quantum annealer under reverse-annealing with and without pausing.

Our results, which are reproducible, provide strategies for optimizing the performance and energy consumption of quantum annealing systems employing reverse-annealing protocols."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603db3fe9543c711bc6e9ddf","62f5bb287523404ea24196c9","5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["603db3fe9543c711bc6e9ddf","62f5bb287523404ea24196c9","6790cf34fdbe835da54b7b4f","5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747174876501"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67939d4cfdbe835f61f9503c","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","documentHash":"69c657d5-166b-4e29-a12e-29e4b61d8570"},{"objectId":"67939d4cfdbe835f61f9503b","name":"Luis","lastName":"Martínez","documentHash":"b1090a4c-74af-4901-a4c9-81aee8b8b3c5"},{"objectId":"67939d4cfdbe835f61f9503a","name":"Jiang-Hong","lastName":"Zhu","documentHash":"f53ee919-2d83-4fc3-8a80-c88359553107"},{"objectId":"67939d4cfdbe835f61f95039","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"e12d35d3-cd79-407d-b65d-65a7dd77282d"},{"objectId":"67939d4cfdbe835f61f95038","name":"Qiang","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"23336ce9-8c4d-4a5f-b494-027590506303"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"67939d4cfdbe835f61f95036","doi":"10.1007/s10726-023-09870-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10726-023-09870-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Concept Design Evaluation of Sustainable Product–Service Systems: A QFD–TOPSIS Integrated Framework with Basic Uncertain Linguistic Information","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The product–service system (PSS) is a strategic design approach proposed to address sustainability in socio-economic systems amidst rapid industrialization and transition. Evaluating the concept design of a PSS is a crucial and initial step prior to implementation. This study presents an innovative framework for evaluating concept designs of sustainable PSS based on a well-defined evaluation index system via integrating quality function deployment (QFD) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) while accommodating extended basic uncertain linguistic information (EBULI). Specifically, a QFD-based framework is first developed to identify the requirements of various stakeholders and then to establish the multi-dimensional criteria for evaluating sustainable PSS. Then, a House of Quality-based relationship matrix is introduced to determine the weights of criteria more accurately. Further, an adaptive consensus-reaching process method based on an expert weighting optimization model is proposed to ensure a collective outputs recognized by multiple involved stakeholders. Finally, an improved EBULI-based TOPSIS method is presented to determine the priority ranking of alternative sustainable PSS concepts. A case study on a car-sharing PSS project demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of the proposed QFD–TOPSIS integrated approach under EBULI settings. The alternative PSS concept design, which demonstrates relatively good performance in criteria of high importance, is selected as the most suitable option. Moreover, relevant comparative and sensitivity analyses reveal that the proposed approach exhibits superiorities in appropriate criteria elicitation, accurate weights determination, and high consensus ranking outputs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"469-511","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67939d4cfdbe835f61f95038","67939d4cfdbe835f61f95039","67939d4cfdbe835f61f9503a","67939d4cfdbe835f61f9503b","67939d4cfdbe835f61f9503c","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e7c","mniswId":"7344","title":"GROUP DECISION AND NEGOTIATION","issn":"0926-2644","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c8b7b93d-e31f-41f1-b1ef-3d0b88473117"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67939d4cfdbe835f61f95037","year":"2024","volume":"33","number":"3","documentHash":"fcfa64bf-efc0-4537-8846-9e2a2a5d1d6c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747174880006"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Domino","uuid":"CA9728FF4DE4C64ED7452CC84E2C9FA5A4B954B211AB6AC7375C427567DA859A9FA7C2633E6FDD3147DA0343C6BEBE5E46B83E70571CF5120C82D77C5745B899","orcidId":"0000-0001-7386-5441","documentHash":"ea82a803-78b7-40f1-84a6-a858acb10900"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390773","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Sochan","uuid":"FCBE686154940D0F682D63C534B478B5AF4EA7ABB34772B42E78A6EFEDD6AC04571CBA2D41DA4A0C1422CDF639CBD4BA81B8B4FE35EA54CD46D10AE19E479157","orcidId":"0000-0001-5803-0278","documentHash":"627de2e3-0438-49b5-a5ff-617b8f68ac0d"}],"objectId":"678f9febfdbe835856ba825f","doi":"10.1016/j.jocs.2024.102509","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1877750324003028?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Analytical assessment of workers’ safety concerning direct and indirect ways of getting infected by dangerous pathogen","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Developing safety policies to protect large groups of individuals working in indoor environments from disease spread is an important and challenging task. To address this issue, we investigate the scenario of workers becoming infected by a dangerous airborne pathogen in a near-real-life industrial environment. We present a simple analytical model based on observations made during the recent COVID-19 pandemic and business expectations concerning worker protection. The model can be adapted to address other epidemic or non-epidemic threats, including hazardous vapors from industrial processes. In the presented model, we consider both direct and indirect modes of infection. Direct infection occurs through direct contact with an infected individual, while indirect infection results from contact with a contaminated environment, including airborne pathogens in enclosed spaces or contaminated surfaces. Our analysis utilizes a simplified droplet/aerosol diffusion model, validated by droplet spread simulations. This model can be easily applied to new scenarios and has modest computational requirements compared to full simulations. Thus, it can be implemented within an automated protection ecosystem in an industrial setting, where rapid assessment of potential danger is required, and calculations must be performed almost in real-time. We validate general research findings on disease spread using a simple agent-based model. Based on our results, we outline a set of countermeasures for infection prevention, which could serve as the foundation for a prevention policy suited to industrial scenarios."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390773","5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"85","pagesFromTo":"102509","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","5e709224878c28a047390773","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454785b8","mniswId":"10621","title":"Journal of Computational Science","issn":"1877-7503","documentHash":"5197f283-d6b4-44a0-bc32-9caad9aa5f54"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f9febfdbe835856ba8260","year":"2025","volume":"85","documentHash":"58f96995-4513-4433-99c1-4451c6733ec0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747174887483"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61b6be387523402a58cb071d","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Łaskarzewski ","uuid":"86EB4935FA7120A3AC092A39CE9E3339D95D9CEA6D3588FE6D805E4A485B202B865BF5355B541E28457C67A6B5EEE92142CD874B9F8D18F5122D0CB75084AE07","documentHash":"0fd63262-06fe-4187-8306-91db64669664"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"}],"objectId":"6821a4a2fdbe8356e5779edb","doi":"10.15199/59.2024.4.47","publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/publikacja-150436-2024-4.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"EFEKTYWNOŚĆ SCHEMATU KOMUNIKACJI LICZNIKÓW MEDIÓW W PROCESIE ZDALNEGO ODCZYTU OBCHODZONEGO","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Liczniki mediów coraz częściej wyposażane są w możliwość zdalnego odczytu wskazań.

The article proposes a multi-sectional calibration (MSC) method incorporating a median filtration (MF) phase to enhance the measurement accuracy of 2D LiDAR. The investigation focused on identifying the optimal window width for the MF module among a selection of 2D LiDAR systems. The division of the complete measurement range into sections resulted in a significant enhancement in sensitivity to deviations in measurements. The efficacy of the proposed method is evidenced by its ability to enhance accuracy in distance measurements by up to 89% for the optimal window width.

In order to carry out the analysis, we processed 68 videos that contained over 33,000 vehicles. The median compliance with the Move Over law was 42.5% and varied heavily depending on diverse factors. This study makes two key contributions: first, it introduces an automated deep learning-based system that detects and evaluates Move Over law compliance by leveraging object detection and tracking technologies. Second, it presents a large-scale, multi-state compliance assessment, providing new empirical insights into driver behavior across various incident conditions. These findings offer a data-driven foundation for refining Move Over laws, enhancing public awareness efforts, and improving enforcement strategies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709373878c28a0473aa030","5e7092db878c28a04739e2df"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"2011","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092db878c28a04739e2df","6823404dfdbe834501633cef","6823404dfdbe834501633cf0","6823404dfdbe834501633cf1","6823404dfdbe834501633cf2","5e709373878c28a0473aa030"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"976d1e86-5dd0-4e19-9276-7114f4dea573"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747174902640"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68233c75fdbe83450161e50a","name":"Zheng","lastName":"Yan","documentHash":"8b4bc7e0-05cc-49df-819e-d56de2d1849f"},{"objectId":"68233c75fdbe83450161e509","name":"Jiahe","lastName":"Lan","documentHash":"52a0b44f-9128-462e-8936-70209f78b2ea"},{"objectId":"68233c75fdbe83450161e508","name":"Zhaozheng","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"062ef5ad-00ae-4a1d-8bca-74eeaf4ccaf9"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"}],"objectId":"68233c75fdbe83450161e506","doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2025.103248","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1566253525003215?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Backdoor attacks and defense mechanisms in federated learning: A survey","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that enables the collaborative training of machine learning models by multiple entities. However, FL is vulnerable to various potential risks, especially backdoor attacks. A backdoor attack aims to implant hidden backdoors into a global model by compromising one or more clients and making them provide poisoned model updates. Consequently, the global model misclassifies inputs with triggers as adversary-desired classes/labels while performing well on benign inputs. Despite its severity, existing literature lacks a comprehensive review on backdoor attacks and their defense mechanisms of FL, especially for vertical FL. This paper comprehensively reviews and evaluates recent advances in backdoor attacks and defense mechanisms on FL. We first introduce foundational concepts about FL, backdoor attacks, and defense mechanisms, along with their respective security models. Then, we propose two sets of evaluation criteria that a sound backdoor attack and a defense mechanism should meet, respectively. After that, we provide taxonomies of existing backdoor attacks and defense mechanisms of FL and review them by employing the proposed criteria to evaluate their pros and cons. We also explore a positive application of backdoors in FL, i.e., backdoor-based watermarking. Finally, we discuss a number of open issues and suggest promising future research directions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"123","pagesFromTo":"103248","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68233c75fdbe83450161e508","68233c75fdbe83450161e509","68233c75fdbe83450161e50a","6325312975234038513dfa2e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d0","mniswId":"8320","title":"Information Fusion","issn":"1566-2535","documentHash":"cd0269a3-9596-445a-8e0c-f38a77fea379"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68233c75fdbe83450161e507","year":"2025","volume":"123","documentHash":"458c538d-0a42-4594-9339-db1606460a2d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747174902730"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aadf0","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Luchowski","uuid":"5EA0EDDD43E6A5D8BA9D803F7B8947DFB88C2A02C09F164C23C678C3B0FE42850BD6644B1CF2ACFCC265CC28F31553EA7041C78BD1E072CBBB5FA35C6EE70341","orcidId":"0000-0002-9104-9365","documentHash":"9407807f-bcfc-490e-a457-9a46706b00b9"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa9de","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tomaka","uuid":"EF9E78E1C270E857B6E9FB35F35A7D6A7E2AD570511B137E67B0C02EBE37FA01BEF2465519C1963F0F0B17F9F44D4C3C0B2B64B6AB0F9C9082F375157525EEB8","orcidId":"0000-0001-9371-7788","documentHash":"eb711ea6-639f-4952-a871-229f0a082d14"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa3d2","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"E3D24B6A5C01404811271B9409004C30CEF27B269279C11F33661E241358397FCC27AAE784C6A864CADDD6B00DB2DA85780AEFB8B935CD942534D850CF6DE056","orcidId":"0000-0003-0380-8411","documentHash":"9b05653a-732f-4e28-813e-63b890464eb3"},{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a6ff4","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Pojda","uuid":"72E1BB0C20942E5276B391BC9FC3527C53E4316DD7FB4204DD1132E0791E97B745444518A8EBEB6E33BFA4ED4FEDC0A313E9A4B5F3671BBBE55EEDB12C6D8DA6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1397-5267","documentHash":"cf6f32f0-97fe-435a-961a-cbb717f6abec"}],"objectId":"68233d7afdbe834501627679","doi":"10.1016/j.softx.2025.102093","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352711025000603?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"dpVision: Environment for multimodal images","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The dpVision (data processing for vision) software framework offers a flexible, open source platform for implementing and testing various data and image processing algorithms.

Thus, substantial research has been conducted to identify optimum task allocation schemes in this context using non-linear optimization, machine learning, and market-based algorithms. Prior work has mainly focused on two methodologies: (i) formulating non-linear optimizations that lead to NP-hard problems, which are processed via heuristics, and (ii) using AI-based formulations, such as reinforcement learning, that are then tested with simulations. These prior approaches have two shortcomings: (a) there is no guarantee that optimum solutions are achieved, and (b) they do not provide an explicit formula for the fraction of tasks that are allocated to the different servers to achieve a specified optimum. This paper offers a radically different and mathematically based principled method that explicitly computes the optimum fraction of jobs that should be allocated to the different servers to (1) minimize the average latency (delay) of the jobs that are allocated to the edge servers and (2) minimize the average energy consumption of these jobs at the set of edge servers. These results are obtained with a mathematical model of a multiple-server edge system that is managed by a task distribution platform, whose equations are derived and solved using methods from stochastic processes. This approach has low computational cost and provides simple linear complexity formulas to compute the fraction of tasks that should be assigned to the different servers to achieve minimum latency and minimum energy consumption."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"502","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747174907634"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67dd31d3fdbe8306d0d825e6","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Konieczny","documentHash":"507d0603-5732-4fea-a32f-eb92c624c0b3"},{"objectId":"67dd31d3fdbe8306d0d825e5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Gawlak","documentHash":"15853caf-65ad-48ca-a486-b79256a85588"},{"objectId":"5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Domino","uuid":"CA9728FF4DE4C64ED7452CC84E2C9FA5A4B954B211AB6AC7375C427567DA859A9FA7C2633E6FDD3147DA0343C6BEBE5E46B83E70571CF5120C82D77C5745B899","orcidId":"0000-0001-7386-5441","documentHash":"ea82a803-78b7-40f1-84a6-a858acb10900"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"}],"objectId":"67dd31d3fdbe8306d0d825e4","doi":"10.1016/j.jrtpm.2025.100517","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2210970625000149?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Statistical analysis of geoinformation data for increasing railway safety","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The impact of rail transport on the environment is one of the crucial factors for the sustainable development of this form of mass transport.

The implementation of the proposed model does not require advanced knowledge of data mining and can be applied even in less developed railway systems with small IT support. Furthermore, we have discovered unusual patterns of accidents while considering the number of trains and their speed and time at particular geographical locations of the railway network. We test the developed approach using data from southern Poland, compromising wildlife habitats and one of the most urbanised regions in Central Europe, based on this we conclude that our model is best suited to railway lines that pass through varying types of landscape."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","pagesFromTo":"100517","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67dd31d3fdbe8306d0d825e5","67dd31d3fdbe8306d0d825e6","5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e330","mniswId":"24332","title":"Journal of Rail Transport Planning & Management","issn":"2210-9706","eissn":"2210-9714","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"63d7bea3-4aa0-416e-a9b3-7b98497f2648"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261656467"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68243e78fdbe836c41b20bf0","name":"Oleh","lastName":"Yasniy","documentHash":"b6046d27-8d07-4398-a7ce-6dd177906a04"},{"objectId":"68243e78fdbe836c41b20bef","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Kovtun","documentHash":"c9bd1e81-1bb6-49b0-884c-0d6d8dd31446"},{"objectId":"651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","name":"Viacheslav","lastName":"Kovtun","uuid":"9FC62B6CAFD057D03E6804B3F80616C02A8D90918E4C8860CB76DF6E0D495E2CFBF9B48C39D339CD5EE3E10A5B4FC53850D3BFF0F25D48826EEEEEAAE921D9DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7624-7072","documentHash":"f9a3daf0-7063-4e84-974c-0517698c246d"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"}],"objectId":"68243e78fdbe836c41b20bed","doi":"10.1016/j.eij.2024.100598","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1110866524001610?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"The quality of service assessment of eMBB and mMTC traffic in a clustered 5G ecosystem of a smart factory","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Industry 4.0 demands seamless integration of smart factories with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), reliant on robust communication infrastructure. Leveraging 5G’s support for enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), massive Machine Type Communication (mMTC), and Network Slicing (NS), this study explores quality of service assurance within a clustered 5G ecosystem of a smart factory. The article proposes two new multi-parameter scenarios for allocating the entire channel pool between different types of requests (mMTC, eMBB) for the model of an integrated open 5G cluster. The scenario with isolation does not allow channel reassignment between requests of different types or originating zones (handover or from the coverage area of the target 5G cluster), while the virtual scenario allows such reassignment. It is shown that using these scenarios, the stationary distribution of probabilities of states of the corresponding two-dimensional Markov chains has a multiplicative form. An information technology has been developed to calculate QoS indicators for different types of requests using these channel allocation scenarios. Studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of using one or another access strategy depending on the loads on the 5G cluster. Based on the proposed mathematical apparatus, the information technology enables finding the optimal scenario for channel allocation, as well as calculating the parameters’ values for such a scenario."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"100598","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","68243e78fdbe836c41b20bef","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","68243e78fdbe836c41b20bf0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfbe","mniswId":"5485","title":"Egyptian Informatics Journal","issn":"1110-8665","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"eec4f23f-1216-4f15-bbc5-255eac934a09"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68243e78fdbe836c41b20bee","year":"2025","volume":"29","documentHash":"983a95bb-b61a-4a48-b700-1e358c90f4de"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261656581"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"637d93b9752340568b01c328","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kołodziej","uuid":"9B8D74E38B1125EA9C5D142193B9741FAF6B3D68BB8531826C36C642DEF5DC53DDBBD84A776293B8BE6850D5D9E7B131B575C8917C17F8F480D25A09EF8558DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-2329-107X","documentHash":"e118187c-62ef-4b9c-bce2-3ccc43779c81"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa031","name":"Michał","lastName":"Romaszewski","uuid":"794BD3547A8C73952F65D57A0FD3FF33B13690959E9AE28F002050B9026AF3C5143015AF3D68A11D34922CD16D0846F6C5095BBBD497B639C920863DF2126982","orcidId":"0000-0002-8227-929X","documentHash":"06589218-e8d0-4a53-9e39-8d8ccfadb95c"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa030","name":"Michał","lastName":"Cholewa","uuid":"47699C878B3AD5E38C0A505FC84A47A065643A57A3D8A402D2BA6D348CBACF7B7FAFDC34C006484FAB36434989FA5EDAFF39AF29A82591DADA599F2EA2E4FBCE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6549-1590","documentHash":"9afc1c06-2697-4a7a-a02d-3e833155f6ab"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Głomb","uuid":"67B5DF4EBEF036D7B1861B26A48C3ABE0E65A55A852DCAAEEF5DFCD3DEF99C6112C878B3A303C0B2F361D1FD7CAE0F6524E3EE80853F54592EC6A1FEE1A7D1B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0215-4674","documentHash":"f96d93e7-9254-4b2f-8620-8a6cffc11fbb"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e2df","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sekuła","uuid":"4EE2A1C1D1971C9F29B1CA7AFE788537C7875D3B9B07D6D4C18CD4C501713E59AA1D7D5EFAACFA397A504A2C03AF692C51CAB48F3D44C4143C703058C7B174A8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4599-1077","documentHash":"0e268f39-07db-4ad7-bee1-741b6b8de059"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-03-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67e3f674fdbe832ee373ca7c","doi":"10.2478/jaiscr-2025-0014","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jaiscr-2025-0014","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Through the Thicket: A Study of Number-Oriented LLMS Derived from Random Forest Models","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper introduces a novel approach to training Large Language Models (LLMs) using knowledge transfer from a Random Forest (RF) ensemble. By converting RF decision paths into natural language, this method enhances both the classification accuracy and explanation capabilities of LLMs. Our approach integrates three preprocessing techniques: Relation Encoding, Integer Normalisation, and Verbal Description of Values, tailored for numerical data, improving the model’s ability to interpret structured inputs effectively. Leveraging RF’s ensemble properties, we generate rule-based explanations that can be objectively validated, offering a cost-effective alternative to human evaluations. Experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate high classification accuracy highlighting the potential of our framework for numerical and structured data applications. This study also contributes to Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) by providing LLMs with structured, objectively verifiable explanations, making them more accessible and interpretable for

In this work, to overcome these challenges, we utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) in the QAS algorithm, analyzing their efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the probability of success is 2× to 5× higher than MLPs. In noisy environments, KAN outperforms MLPs in fidelity when approximating these states, showcasing its robustness against noise. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating curriculum reinforcement learning with a KAN structure. This facilitates a more efficient design of parameterized quantum circuits by reducing the number of required 2-qubit gates and circuit depth. Further investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66f22428ece3980cc880b75f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","682447fffdbe836c41b2f334","682447fffdbe836c41b2f335"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c063","mniswId":"5894","title":"EPJ Quantum Technology","issn":"2196-0763","eissn":"2196-0763","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"c2628a87-2d8b-4c2f-b0e6-153848371597"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661322"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7e","name":"Liz","lastName":"Varga","documentHash":"e24957cb-7410-4be8-9748-67946ece38e6"},{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7d","name":"Yuchun","lastName":"Tang","documentHash":"adef8fee-9991-4d86-832f-a5d438f5adb4"},{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7c","name":"Jingquan","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"00837972-3b34-4dc8-aec2-0dd2126642a5"},{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7b","name":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Sun","documentHash":"26060ee5-55a4-49f4-b0af-9733e2ba67a0"},{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7a","name":"Taiyi","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"ac506965-918a-48d1-bdf4-06558e704a32"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da78","doi":"10.1016/j.tre.2024.103939","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1366554524005301?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Resilience-based transportation system planning optimization through dedicated autonomous vehicle lanes configuration","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During the transition phase when connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist on the road, it is essential to devise scientific lane management strategies for CAVs in enhancing the operational efficiency of the transportation system (TS). It is worth noting that most current studies do not incorporate the resilience requirements of the TS to effectively respond to seismic events in the planning process. In this study, a novel resilience-based planning optimization methodology through dedicated autonomous vehicle lanes (DAVLs) configuration is proposed in the form of bi-level structure. The optimal configuration scheme for generating DAVLs in the upper level has the optimization objective of minimizing the overall impedance of the TS while meeting the system’s resilience constraints. In terms of the lower level, it quantifies the TS’s functions, fully considering the impact of CAVs on the time value, fuel consumption, and link flow capacity. In order to balance the optimization performance and computational costs, a heuristic algorithm combining genetic algorithms and successive averaging method are integrated to solve the proposed bi-level programming model effectively. On this basis, the proposed methodology adopts a real-world large-scale transportation network regarding deterministic and stochastic earthquake damage scenarios. The sensitivity analysis outcomes show that the market penetration of CAVs and the predefined system resilience threshold have different mechanisms of actions on the optimal configuration strategy of DAVLs and the system performance of TS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"194","pagesFromTo":"103939","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7a","68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7b","68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7c","68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7d","68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7e","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799bd","mniswId":"19745","title":"Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","issn":"1366-5545","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3a81d976-2079-4dc1-a37d-5becee2e8c25"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da79","year":"2025","volume":"194","documentHash":"e33aa9f7-07ee-4a6b-b1dc-dcd26fe29d74"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661481"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Domańska","uuid":"4A1A11F10A925F650E6B59202EE7CBE9E2A25C68AF861B8CB2D7FF318E2B00DA7F4C678616ADC0C8082C8C1B0A3575CEC53207B122F0FC1DABD0F41341DD6884","orcidId":"0000-0002-1935-8358","documentHash":"f852ee1c-d3c4-48f8-9ff9-17b3e049a012"}],"objectId":"68244365fdbe836c41b258d0","doi":"10.1016/j.neunet.2025.107425","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0893608025003041?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"What is the doggest dog?

The theory assumes that the degree of membership in a basic-level category is graded. As a result, some concepts are perceived as more central (typical) than others. The most typical category is called a prototype. It can be perceived as the clearest example of a category, reflecting the redundancy structure of the category as a whole. Its inverse is called an anti-prototype. Reasonable perception of prototypes and anti-prototypes is important for accurate projection of the world structure onto the class space and more human-like world perception beyond simple memorization. That is why it is beneficial to study deep models from the perspective of prototype theory. To enable it, we propose 3 methods that return the prototypes and anti-prototypes perceived by deep networks for a specific basic-level category. Additionally, one of our methods allows to visualize the centrality of objects. The results on a wide range of 42 networks trained on ImageNet (Convolutional Networks, Vision Transformers, ConvNeXts and hybrid models) reveal that the networks share the typicality perception to a large extent and that this perception does not lie so far from the human one. We release the dataset with per-network prototypes and anti-prototypes resulting from our work to enable further research on this topic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709245878c28a047392d1a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"188","pagesFromTo":"107425","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","5e709245878c28a047392d1a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478fc3","mniswId":"14920","title":"NEURAL NETWORKS","issn":"0893-6080","eissn":"1879-2782","documentHash":"9f84b11c-9598-4e68-9646-8a99b66e6c4d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68244365fdbe836c41b258d1","year":"2025","volume":"188","documentHash":"f15a108d-dd03-42f3-819f-7454288e6c9b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661562"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68245d24fdbe836c41b52460","name":"Limao","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"fab4dbd0-05bb-47f0-84f4-5416ef0316d9"},{"objectId":"68245d24fdbe836c41b5245f","name":"Qiong","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"2cfb4859-da7b-466d-b9c0-4430741fde23"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"68245d24fdbe836c41b5245d","doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2025.113163","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1568494625004740?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Network extension planning towards resilient urban critical infrastructures using deep reinforcement learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As cities continue to grow, expanding metro networks becomes essential for optimizing urban transportation efficiency.

This study proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to discover the optimal planning strategy for metro network extension. The model integrates multi-source data into the reward function while customizing the state and action spaces to reflect the unique characteristics of metro networks. A policy network is developed using an Encoder-Decoder framework, with the parameters being updated by an Actor-Critic framework based on policy gradient. A comprehensive performance index is proposed to evaluate the vulnerability and service capacity of planned networks.

Recent advances in quantum computing (QC) offer compelling approaches to address these multifaceted issues by enabling significantly faster and more precise optimization. This paper systematically reviews and synthesizes existing QC research in the supply chain context, particularly focusing on quantum algorithms that target the PCSCM lifecycle. Our analysis identifies three key domains: production, inventory, and transportation, in which QC can outperform classical methods, as evidenced by enhanced scheduling flexibility and cost minimization. However, our findings also highlight crucial bottlenecks, including quantum hardware limitations, organizational readiness gaps, and a lack of specialized interdisciplinary talent. We propose a framework of strategies to guide QC adoption, such as specialized algorithm development, collaborative research partnerships, and standardized data protocols. These insights offer promising future directions for leveraging QC to streamline operations and boost sustainability in the prefabricated construction sector."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"120","pagesFromTo":"103043","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682460dafdbe836c41b58ade","682460dafdbe836c41b58adf","682460dafdbe836c41b58ae0","682460dafdbe836c41b58ae1","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d0","mniswId":"8320","title":"Information Fusion","issn":"1566-2535","documentHash":"cd0269a3-9596-445a-8e0c-f38a77fea379"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"682460dafdbe836c41b58add","year":"2025","volume":"120","documentHash":"138d0a64-08d2-46f8-8690-ee0597cfcfad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661753"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68245e01fdbe836c41b52dd1","name":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"c1b2110a-6564-4c54-a8b7-527ad6041939"},{"objectId":"68245e01fdbe836c41b52dd0","name":"Yuan","lastName":"Cao","documentHash":"ce049b62-c124-4502-baf4-07452780a389"},{"objectId":"68245e01fdbe836c41b52dcf","name":"Qiping","lastName":"Geoffrey Shen","documentHash":"76342706-ce42-4f5e-bdde-1e3e6ba15d42"},{"objectId":"68245e01fdbe836c41b52dce","name":"Hongyu","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"cb25053c-6186-4e92-b929-7ada22ceb9be"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"68245e01fdbe836c41b52dcc","doi":"10.1016/j.inffus.2024.102705","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1566253524004834?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Dynamic prediction and optimization of tunneling parameters with high reliability based on a hybrid intelligent algorithm","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, a hybrid intelligent framework comprising Bayesian optimization (BO), gradient boosting with categorical features (CatBoost) and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) was proposed to support multiobjective optimization of shield construction parameters without large sample datasets, improve the shield performance, and ensure reliable and interpretable results. First, with the use of the specific tunneling energy, advancing speed and cutter wear as objective functions, a BO-CatBoost prediction model for shield construction parameters and various objectives was constructed, and the key influencing factors were identified via the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. Then, a BO-CatBoost-NSGA-III model was developed to obtain Pareto solutions under different scenarios involving the adjustment of the key influencing factors. Finally, adopting the Wuhan Metro as the background, the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of the constructed algorithm were verified. The results indicated that (1) the developed BO-CatBoost algorithm is superior to 9 other algorithms. The R2 values of the proposed approach were 0.976 and 0.901–0.976 on the test set.

It also explores the structural characteristics and influencing factors of the spatial network of pollution reduction and carbon reduction synergies within the ZWC cluster. Results show the following: (1) During the research period, the synergistic effect of pollution reduction and carbon reduction is strengthened due to improvements in pure technical efficiency, a reduction in disparities between cities, and the gradual optimization of spatial patterns. (2) Jinan, Qingdao, and Weihai occupy dominant core positions within the collaborative network. The relationship between the provincial capital and the Jiaodong Economic Circle is well-balanced, while the Lunan Economic Circle exhibits a strong outward orientation, although with limited reciprocal feedback. (3) Geographic proximity, public attention, and differences in information technology foster the formation of the spatial relationship network, while government support disparities demonstrate the opposite effect. Economic disparities have a relatively considerable impact on relational promotion, whereas the influence of industrial structure is comparatively negligible. Based on the above conclusions, this study proposes strategies to enhance the synergistic effects of pollution reduction and carbon emission reduction in ZWC clusters by strengthening “zero waste” management and technology application, thereby optimizing the collaborative network of ZWCs and reinforcing multifactor cooperation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"493","pagesFromTo":"144924","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682459fffdbe836c41b4b22d","682459fffdbe836c41b4b22e","682459fffdbe836c41b4b22f","682459fffdbe836c41b4b230","682459fffdbe836c41b4b231","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547855e","mniswId":"10492","title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","issn":"0959-6526","websiteLink":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-cleaner-production","documentHash":"8fb282e3-22f1-4e4e-9063-80626b129c56"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67bf25a7fdbe83322782a5e0","year":"2025","volume":"493","documentHash":"37de75ac-a57c-423e-b380-6105e4d1fdc1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261664657"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd3b054097077ac1defc46","name":"Marco","lastName":"Tomamichel","documentHash":"54b3b9d5-3b59-4f2f-add7-38a823c62b7d"},{"objectId":"5e7093ca878c28a0473b0e23","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Korzekwa","uuid":"C9DB741845A6F142E0EAAD1FC161B6FCBAA0E2BB7A52AE357274A979E7220677421D14D60F6F74437979635D2D315E9E051B4C4844F0DACD6D507266AD2972E3","documentHash":"d3b2efac-98bc-40b4-9b84-ba083beaa2af"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Puchała","uuid":"084E5F6A60B0C0CA41B364C281E70B8FFF17CAB5C42C464CF3B473E5DDDE7CF4F75350AFE021EEFC95F81444AEB0EDF8B955A7569D9FAC1A7DC77CAD370DD038","orcidId":"0000-0002-4739-0400","documentHash":"a6454553-3823-42b4-904b-d14ce1638536"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b78c","name":"Karol","lastName":"Życzkowski","uuid":"7E81CF9B5BE81A84B5E097CD448924E7BA290A0270D614E442BF00AACA3AC2EA6A0CE72E3D4312E9EA69C62DC06B085C1C828FDDF9930A3A349F39FD98E45A10","orcidId":"0000-0002-0653-3639","documentHash":"4f4463d2-b044-4e30-8bbb-e0f21de4827f"}],"objectId":"623b02782467f02a86c54559","doi":"10.1109/tit.2022.3157440","publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/298424","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Encoding classical information into quantum resources","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We introduce and analyse the problem of encoding classical information into different resources of a quantum state. More precisely, we consider a general class of communication scenarios characterised by encoding operations that commute with a unique resource destroying map and leave free states invariant. Our motivating example is given by encoding information into coherences of a quantum system with respect to a fixed basis (with unitaries diagonal in that basis as encodings and the decoherence channel as a resource destroying map), but the generality of the framework allows us to explore applications ranging from super-dense coding to thermodynamics. For any state, we find that the number of messages that can be encoded into it using such operations in a one-shot scenario is upper bounded in terms of the information spectrum relative entropy between the given state and its version with erased resources. Furthermore, if the resource destroying map is the twirling channel over some unitary group, we find matching one-shot lower bounds as well. In the asymptotic setting where we encode into many copies of the resource state, our bounds yield an operational interpretation of resource monotones such as the relative entropy of coherence and its corresponding relative entropy variance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ca878c28a0473b0e23"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","uid":"bWWUVYe-Cljroqid25B6Vkw","uuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","name":"Centrum Fizyki Teoretycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b9878c28a04739b78c"],"parentId":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","parentUuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","rootId":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","rootUuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"4518 - 4530","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b9878c28a04739b78c","64cd3b054097077ac1defc46","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","5e7093ca878c28a0473b0e23"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478000","mniswId":"7987","title":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issn":"0018-9448","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7db237e3-5601-4c8c-8243-92d3ed9bad30"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quantum mechanics","quantum entanglement","encoding"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654625074"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6322f36940970742d92aff22","name":"Cuneyt","lastName":"Guzelis","documentHash":"97cc2bf9-ed51-4eb2-a9cd-f843af604344"},{"objectId":"6322f36940970742d92aff21","name":"Cennet","lastName":"Kocabiyik","documentHash":"f81e7d49-7276-4ac6-a062-58769e25a4a8"},{"objectId":"6322f36940970742d92aff20","name":"Arda","lastName":"Asut","documentHash":"21f85ff6-6cb9-4ce6-893a-056f8a47c3d1"},{"objectId":"5f532814752340073806a95f","name":"Mert","lastName":"Nakip","uuid":"6EE14383BEC5E308B4B31DB96075B5B9D11B8A3380D47274C583232C87DFE62BA1A38BDA3547E4792533BA246FBB798E501DC0CB82FB2CDB3128BF0BF7CAC8CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6723-6494","documentHash":"d9b43af6-35d8-4aeb-b4af-c25f660650fa"}],"objectId":"6322f36940970742d92aff1f","doi":"10.23919/eleco54474.2021.9677670","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9677617/9677567/09677670.pdf?arnumber=9677670","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Smart Home Demand Response System based on Artificial Neural Networks Augmented with Constraint Satisfaction Heuristic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Distributing the peak load and alleviating grid stress by considering hourly electricity prices are some of the main research problems for current smart grid systems. This paper deals with the scheduling problem of home appliances' operating hours in smart grids, which aims to achieve minimum cost in user-defined operation intervals. To this end, scheduling via Artificial Neural Networks Augmented with Constraint Satisfaction Heuristic (ANN-AH) method that emulates the operation of the optimization for smart home demand response is developed. Our results show that a home demand response via ANN-AH achieves close to optimal performance with 10 times lower execution time than the optimal scheduling. These results suggest that the ANN-AH based demand response is highly successful and practical, and it is promising for future applications in micro-grid and decentralized renewable energy systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"6321cb0a40970747dec1b341","fullName":"International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering","shortName":"ELECO","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"5f9e42ef-35ed-4162-a5ef-73b50d0230cc"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6321cbcc40970747dec1cf04","startDate":"2021-11-25","endDate":"2021-11-27","fullName":"13th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering","shortName":"ICEEIT 2021","city":"Bursa","country":"TR","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"d75596af-91e6-4a13-b381-9061ca0e63ca"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f532814752340073806a95f","6322f36940970742d92aff20","6322f36940970742d92aff21","6322f36940970742d92aff22"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"6321cedb40970747dec25d67","doi":"10.23919/eleco54474.2021","title":"13th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering (ELECO)","year":2022,"translation":false,"documentHash":"9f066c12-01ef-4ed7-97e3-cb5b071ed7a5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["demand response","optimization","artificial neural network","scheduling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654639870"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"639c748c40970732711995ac","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Deffner","documentHash":"d1673bf5-0c44-495c-a81f-4f193d518a95"},{"objectId":"639c748c40970732711995ab","name":"Marcus V.

As charged particles traverse the detector, they leave signals of their passage. The problem of track reconstruction is to recover the original trajectories from these signals. This challenging data analysis task will become even more demanding as the luminosity of future accelerators increases, leading to collision events with a more complex structure. We identify four fundamental routines present in every local tracking method and analyze how they scale in the context of a standard tracking algorithm. We show that for some of these routines we can reach a lower computational complexity with quantum search algorithms. Although the found quantum speedups are mild, this constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigorous evidence of a quantum advantage for a high-energy physics data processing task."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa430"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"105","issue":"7","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["627902d84097077547ea7df6","627902d84097077547ea7df7","627902d84097077547ea7df8","627902d84097077547ea7df9","5e709375878c28a0473aa430","627902d84097077547ea7dfb","627902d84097077547ea7dfc","627902d84097077547ea7dfd","627902d84097077547ea7dfe","627902d84097077547ea7dff","627902d84097077547ea7e00","627902d84097077547ea7e01","627902d84097077547ea7e02"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479267","mniswId":"16090","title":"Physical Review D","issn":"2470-0010","eissn":"2470-0029","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c4ad087c-2a98-4f00-9fed-5eff56e9a8a5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654679058"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c006b140970702a66c1549","name":"Luis","lastName":"Martinez","documentHash":"9927acbb-e49b-4b9a-bd6a-86bcba974829"},{"objectId":"63c006b140970702a66c1548","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","documentHash":"028d355f-d80b-4917-9532-be963347c9c4"},{"objectId":"63c006b140970702a66c1547","name":"Rosa M.","lastName":"Rodriguez","documentHash":"7293b5dc-8eb8-4ed6-8948-eb0c97e305d8"},{"objectId":"63c006b140970702a66c1546","name":"Xuan","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"3f7a31c2-98ab-437c-a60b-bf3db72467eb"},{"objectId":"63c006b140970702a66c1545","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"ee25652f-96c7-4dca-a69a-20a65edc161a"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"63c006b140970702a66c1543","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2022.3179594","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/91/9967417/09786680.pdf?arnumber=9786680","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Expertise-Structure and Risk-Appetite-Integrated Two-Tiered Collective Opinion Generation Framework for Large-Scale Group Decision Making","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The generation of collective preference assessments occupies a critical position in deriving accurate and reliable alternative rankings in the context of large-scale group decision making (LSGDM). In general, the collective opinion generation framework entails the following three phases, which are clustering analysis, weighting clusters, and preference aggregation. However, the clustering of experts has been frequently based on preference similarities among them without taking into account individual opinions in which knowledge elicitation plays a crucial role. The traditional collective opinion generation framework suffering from this drawback may result in unreliable decision outcomes. To this end, we propose an expertise-structure and risk-appetite-integrated two-tiered collective opinion generation framework to address this concern. The first tier of the two-tiered collective opinion generation framework divides the entire expert group into several subgroups based on individual expertise structures, which are extracted from hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS)-based preference assessments, and it then weighs the resulting clusters in accordance with the overall expertise levels. The second-tier clusters the first-tier subgroups conditioned on the indicator of individual assessment similarities and gathers the generated subgroup preference constructs in the use of the risk appetite-oriented power average operator. In addition, the notion of proportional HFLTSs was introduced to manifest collective evaluations in second-tier subgroups to eliminate information loss and distortion. The effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed collective opinion generation algorithm are eventually illustrated by a case study and a comparison analysis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"5496-5510","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c006b140970702a66c1545","63c006b140970702a66c1546","63c006b140970702a66c1547","63c006b140970702a66c1548","63c006b140970702a66c1549","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ff6","mniswId":"7978","title":"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS","issn":"1063-6706","eissn":"1941-0034","documentHash":"47996af0-a0bc-478f-a264-4e1e5ee24081"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c006b140970702a66c1544","year":"2022","volume":"30","number":"12","documentHash":"d2915319-e3b2-4650-b933-6c768e7d488f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654697957"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c00fc240970702a66d5cdf","name":"Kannan","lastName":"Govindan","documentHash":"4d804f07-8929-4572-9998-650151304331"},{"objectId":"63c00fc240970702a66d5cde","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"0ee4ecee-269e-4106-84f8-0df183ecbc7a"},{"objectId":"63c00fc240970702a66d5cdd","name":"Lu","lastName":"Xiao","documentHash":"312ee50a-3fc2-4237-8461-d957124867ca"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"63c00fc240970702a66d5cdb","doi":"10.1109/tem.2022.3167160","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/17/4429834/09770409.pdf?arnumber=9770409","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effects of Online Consumer Reviews on a Dual-Channel Closed-Loop Supply Chain With Trade-In","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To study the effects of online consumer reviews (OCRs) on a dual-channel closed-loop supply chain and the manufacturer's trade-in authorization strategy, we construct four Stackelberg game models with or without OCRs under two scenarios, i.e., whether the retailer is authorized to determine the retail channels trade-in rebate or not. Results show that under both scenarios, incorporating OCRs will increase the overall prices as well as the profits of the manufacturer and the total supply chain only when the OCRs are sufficiently positive, which is always harmful to the retailer. Authorization of the retailer to trade-in will increase the retailer's profit. When the quality belief reflected by OCRs is increasing, it becomes more harmful for the manufacturer to authorize the retailer to trade-in: when OCRs are not available, the manufacturer can benefit from authorizing the retailer to trade-in; when OCRs are available and lower than certain thresholds, authorization of the retailer to trade-in can benefit the manufacturer; and when OCRs are sufficiently positive, it is more profitable for the manufacturer not to authorize the retailer to trade-in.

These techniques forecast the traffic generation patterns of individual IoT devices in the coverage area of an IoT gateway and schedule the Medium Access Control (MAC)-layer resources at the gateway in advance based on these forecasts. Although predictive solutions have achieved high network performance, a key problem is that their performance depends highly on the performance of forecasters. In this article, to minimize the effects of forecasting errors on the performance of predictive networks, we develop a subspace-based forecasting algorithm called “Motion On a Subspace under Adaptive Learning rate (MOSAL).” First, our algorithm trains a forecaster by minimizing the performance loss of an IoT network based on the emulation of an Application-Specific Error Function (ASEF) by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Second, the algorithm moves close to a subspace of the forecasting errors while aiming to maximize network throughput. Our results show that MOSAL achieves a throughput performance that surpasses the performance of commonly used standard gradient descent training algorithms at a reasonable execution time. These results open the way to the deployment of predictive solutions at IoT gateways in practice in the near future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"24634-24646","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f532814752340073806a95f","63c7fade4097076eb37d4541","63c7fade4097076eb37d4542","63c7fade4097076eb37d4543"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fd0","mniswId":"7933","title":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issn":"1530-437x","eissn":"1558-1748","websiteLink":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7361","documentHash":"e29d1703-f32c-4dbb-874e-c312c6c3b3c0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c7fade4097076eb37d4540","year":"2022","volume":"22","number":"24","documentHash":"55a00c1a-c648-4688-8887-e43464c3476b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654698226"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c7dd214097076eb37a4388","name":"Karl","lastName":"Sigman","documentHash":"c3c2ab14-3f8a-4425-8211-5e3cc24d61b5"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"}],"objectId":"63c7dd214097076eb37a4387","doi":"10.1109/icc45855.2022.9839054","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9837954/9838246/09839054.pdf?arnumber=9839054","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"IoT Traffic Shaping and the Massive Access Problem","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"IoT gateways aim to meet the deadlines and QoS needs of packets from as many IoT devices as possible, though this can lead to a form of congestion known as the Massive Access Problem (MAP).

Under this model, since it is implied that IoT device traffic cannot be predicted, only reactive MAC-layer protocols in which the network responds to the current traffic are viable. In contrast, recent work has demonstrated that the traffic generated by an individual IoT device can be predictable, thus enabling predictive network protocols at the MAC layer. In this paper, we investigate information-theoretic bounds on the predictability of IoT traffic of individual devices. To this end, first, we compare the performance achieved by the following state-of-the-art forecasters on individual IoT device traffic: Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) as well as MLP under feature selection based on Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Auto-Correlation Function (ACF). Second, we quantify the gap between the performance of these forecasters against information-theoretic bounds as follows: For IoT devices that generate a fixed number of bits at each generation instance, we measure the gap between the forecasting accuracy and the information-theoretic bound established by Fano’s inequality on the probability of correct prediction. Our empirical results show that existing forecasting schemes perform close to the information-theoretic bound in this case. For IoT devices that generate a variable number of bits, we measure the gap between the Mean Square Error (MSE) and the estimation-theoretic counterpart to Fano’s inequality. Our empirical results show that the performance of existing forecasting schemes is far from the information-theoretic bound in this case. This work motivates the machine learning community to develop forecasting schemes that approach information-theoretic bounds. Furthermore, this work is expected to impact the development of predictive MAC-layer protocols that exploit these bounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"55602-55615","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f532814752340073806a95f","63231ce040970742d930542c","63231ce040970742d930542d","63231ce040970742d930542e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f9e","mniswId":"7872","title":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/access","issn":"2169-3536","eissn":"2169-3536","documentHash":"f5093a18-7cfd-4ec5-822e-c99cc838a475"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6268e87c4097070159845896","year":"2022","volume":"10","documentHash":"b7fbd0db-ff50-471c-a991-8afc83a1dda5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654701621"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"649ab65b409707195f0236d8","name":"Filip B.","lastName":"Maciejewski","documentHash":"8015d2fb-65ed-4237-869c-2be187493509"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Puchała","uuid":"084E5F6A60B0C0CA41B364C281E70B8FFF17CAB5C42C464CF3B473E5DDDE7CF4F75350AFE021EEFC95F81444AEB0EDF8B955A7569D9FAC1A7DC77CAD370DD038","orcidId":"0000-0002-4739-0400","documentHash":"a6454553-3823-42b4-904b-d14ce1638536"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a72a5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Oszmaniec","uuid":"93BCA83A52CC970812777EF1009A06EFA1BF261D549A394974D04AF0C17502D73F7A8A4FE43A27362F8EFEB89F1232D65E2200E0E698F6B7C14FF587634D31BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4946-6835","documentHash":"1e6a92a0-c6d3-4b88-a054-55d9c193d06e"}],"objectId":"649ab65b409707195f0236d7","doi":"10.1109/tit.2023.3250100","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/18/10155402/10064700.pdf?arnumber=10064700","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Exploring Quantum Average-Case Distances: Proofs, Properties, and Examples","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this work, we present an in-depth study of average-case quantum distances introduced in Maciejewski et al. (2022). The average-case distances approximate, up to the relative error, the average Total-Variation (TV) distance between measurement outputs of two quantum processes, in which quantum objects of interest (states, measurements, or channels) are intertwined with random quantum circuits. Contrary to conventional distances, such as trace distance or diamond norm, they quantify average-case statistical distinguishability via random quantum circuits. We prove that once a family of random circuits forms an δ -approximate 4-design, with δ=o(d−8) , then the average-case distances can be approximated by simple explicit functions that can be expressed via simple degree two polynomials in objects of interest. For systems of moderate dimension, they can be easily explicitly computed – no optimization is needed as opposed to diamond norm distance between channels or operational distance between measurements. We prove that those functions, which we call quantum average-case distances, have a plethora of desirable properties, such as subadditivity w.r.t. tensor products, joint convexity, and (restricted) data-processing inequalities. Notably, all distances utilize the Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) norm, which provides this norm with a new operational interpretation. We also provide upper bounds on the maximal ratio between worst-case and average-case distances, and for each of them, we provide an example that saturates the bound. Specifically, we show that for each dimension d this ratio is at most d12,d,d32 for states, measurements, and channels, respectively. To support the practical usefulness of our findings, we study multiple examples in which average-case quantum distances can be calculated analytically."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","uid":"bWWUVYe-Cljroqid25B6Vkw","uuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","name":"Centrum Fizyki Teoretycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a72a5"],"parentId":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","parentUuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","rootId":"5e709190878c28a04737e97e","rootUuid":"eff87f52-7504-44aa-aabc-f524f64383f5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"69","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"4600-4619","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["649ab65b409707195f0236d8","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","5e709352878c28a0473a72a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478000","mniswId":"7987","title":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issn":"0018-9448","documentHash":"9d8328ee-6b40-4cbe-86bc-7e2d280b2139"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649aadba409707195f01a43a","year":"2023","volume":"69","number":"7","documentHash":"5e0e742a-73dc-44e7-b93c-4947bc51ce6a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654714015"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6357da464097072c1fa31165","name":"Ilknur","lastName":"Tepe","documentHash":"756eb630-e1dd-46ab-8bee-774513f3e3cd"},{"objectId":"6357da464097072c1fa31164","name":"Zeki","lastName":"Seskir","documentHash":"b0d4b76c-e326-47af-87e7-3609da0058c7"},{"objectId":"61454f299543c7051ff01cf2","name":"Özlem","lastName":"Salehi Köken","uuid":"1BB864961AD1BECAA93CE2DA320078B3E414A265EC5D68F29DE1741522DCEA349BDDB4F25FBE838F8E7F9A2FEF2DBF9F89C28CB843E92C036CA8CD80223402E3","documentHash":"b5f48943-137b-482a-9b7f-9d2442249283"}],"objectId":"6357da464097072c1fa31162","doi":"10.1109/te.2021.3078552","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/13/9701848/09439191.pdf?arnumber=9439191","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Computer Science-Oriented Approach to Introduce Quantum Computing to a New Audience","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"educational approach for introducing quantum computing\nto a wider audience is highlighted.

We show that Fd=1−Θ(1N2) for arbitrary but fixed dimension d. In addition to that, we compared various learning schemes for d=2. We observed that the learning scheme based on deterministic port-based teleportation is asymptotically optimal but performs poorly for low N. In particular, we discovered a parallel learning scheme, which despite its lack of asymptotic optimality, provides a high value of the fidelity for low values of N and uses only two-qubit entangled memory states."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e709448878c28a0473b9a2d","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","5e709444878c28a0473b94d5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"106","issue":"5","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709444878c28a0473b94d5","5e709448878c28a0473b9a2d","5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479263","mniswId":"16085","title":"Physical Review A","issn":"2469-9926","eissn":"2469-9934","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"54b87290-dbb9-4444-b60a-e639b708ae87"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654730388"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb1c","name":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Soudris","documentHash":"d063b3e5-59a9-4712-86c9-fa54ef01bba7"},{"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb1b","name":"Dionysios","lastName":"Kehagias","documentHash":"29f21c71-9de6-4c9e-9f94-9724e0cf53b8"},{"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb1a","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Chatzigeorgiou","documentHash":"86da9909-0111-420f-8250-d09d30dc6cd0"},{"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb19","name":"Apostolos","lastName":"Ampatzoglou","documentHash":"0302f8ee-91cd-43f6-8794-7bb09215fe3a"},{"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb18","name":"Lazaros","lastName":"Papadopoulos","documentHash":"2defb59b-b41b-443a-b6ad-b4d6a25f1789"},{"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb17","name":"Christos P.","lastName":"Lamprakos","documentHash":"9b364584-3bcc-42a7-8c29-4fc9f840e4ab"},{"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb16","name":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Tsoukalas","documentHash":"97ec2c12-2495-4332-b160-cf6d1d907d3b"},{"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb15","name":"Miltiadis","lastName":"Siavvas","documentHash":"973129f5-6200-4a4d-9f07-a329ec629682"},{"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb14","name":"Charalampos","lastName":"Marantos","documentHash":"65f0611b-1102-4ed9-aece-9ee97e3f20ec"},{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"},{"objectId":"5e7094b3878c28a0473c1ebe","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Boryszko","uuid":"2E13E8A53D97650595F49AC13A40399F0C9593568357ADF3334D3F18B9723D498D4D28A7B5FB1DFCA9556B0F4E2FFE6912F1D3514089AA579C0152FB4B888BB7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7645-0943","documentHash":"a9e8173e-165d-4e03-a5d6-6cf9194f8add"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Domańska","uuid":"4A1A11F10A925F650E6B59202EE7CBE9E2A25C68AF861B8CB2D7FF318E2B00DA7F4C678616ADC0C8082C8C1B0A3575CEC53207B122F0FC1DABD0F41341DD6884","orcidId":"0000-0002-1935-8358","documentHash":"f852ee1c-d3c4-48f8-9ff9-17b3e049a012"}],"objectId":"6311fcef409707352b6bbb13","doi":"10.23919/date54114.2022.9774586","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9774496/9774497/09774586.pdf?arnumber=9774586","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"SDK4ED: One-click platform for Energy-aware, Maintainable and Dependable Applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Developing modern secure and low-energy applications in a short time imposes new challenges and creates the need of designing new software tools to assist developers in all phases of application development.

In this paper, we develop a novel algorithm, which we call “Multi-Channel\nSubset Iteration with Minimal Loss in Available Capacity” (MC-SIMLAC), for multi-channel joint\nforecasting-scheduling. Our multi-channel scheduling algorithm iterates over subsets of all of the\nbursts of IoT device traffic and selects channel-slot pairs by targeting the minimization of loss in to-\ntal available capacity. In this regard, our algorithm contrasts sharply with Multi-Channel Look Ahead\nPriority based on Average Load (MC-LAPAL), which is the best-performing heuristic that has been\ndeveloped so far for multi-channel JFS. In the general case, our algorithm outperforms MC-LAPAL,\nespecially when wireless links operate in the power-limited regime and the number of devices is\nlarge. For the special case of identical channels, our algorithm achieves a performance that is closer\nthan MC-LAPAL to that of the optimal scheduler. Furthermore, we prove that the time complexity\nand the space complexity of MC-SIMLAC in the worst case are polynomial in each of the system\nparameters, which indicates practical feasibility. These results pave the way to the widespread use of\nmulti-channel joint forecasting-scheduling at IoT gateways in the near future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6321c4a940970747dec0e154","6321c4a940970747dec0e155","5f532814752340073806a95f","6321c4a940970747dec0e156","6321c4a940970747dec0e157"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e3ef","mniswId":"24541","title":"Journal of Wireless Mobile Networks, Ubiquitous Computing, and Dependable Applications","issn":"2093-5374","eissn":"2093-5382","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"026f63f0-0ddb-402f-913b-612564a70cde"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654743099"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","name":"Akash ","lastName":"Kundu ","uuid":"70EF4FF1C1BF816CC3B984BCD37EA6A8D6FD08B7B5F083C04D729C4496000CCD839F3A895088F8E4A8A66892E390213313379D4319F9CE4E542CE870D22450B5","documentHash":"8452fc8c-3054-495d-a245-09e1edeca4ad"},{"objectId":"63245a304097076a532b352f","name":"Zoltán","lastName":"Zimborás","documentHash":"9dd89f52-484d-42ac-92e8-52b6d908a1d6"},{"objectId":"61b6be387523402a58cb072e","name":"Ludmila  ","lastName":"Botelho ","uuid":"524597516C57E7FC8C2C71662169580586B1395273442F15F09C10C3E48890DCFBCCF5FBD130C9C7B1EC35C29FFB10C94CE737633840C02B147E6872EFC1164D","documentHash":"5fedaf18-ab6c-4c4c-9d37-c8961ddb1f1e"},{"objectId":"61454f299543c7051ff01cf2","name":"Özlem","lastName":"Salehi Köken","uuid":"1BB864961AD1BECAA93CE2DA320078B3E414A265EC5D68F29DE1741522DCEA349BDDB4F25FBE838F8E7F9A2FEF2DBF9F89C28CB843E92C036CA8CD80223402E3","documentHash":"b5f48943-137b-482a-9b7f-9d2442249283"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa430","name":"Adam","lastName":"Glos","uuid":"36560034A39468FB258FD97A695698C29235FFCDC7F0417AAD29FCDC2B0FB7F17F23E2B39ED7962591350FFC3DFFE2D4F376983D82B9FA2F8D9CF67DD037C8F3","orcidId":"0000-0001-6320-7699","documentHash":"aff4e283-b1a9-4fe9-99f8-51bad4fe7a10"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"}],"objectId":"63245a304097076a532b352d","doi":"10.1103/physreva.105.022441","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevA.105.022441","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Error mitigation for variational quantum algorithms through mid-circuit measurements","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms require novel paradigms of error mitigation. To obtain noise-robust quantum computers, each logical qubit is equipped with hundreds or thousands of physical qubits. However, it is not possible to use memory-consuming techniques for current quantum devices having at most hundreds or thousands of physical qubits on their own. For specific problems, valid quantum states have a unique structure as in the case of Fock states and W states where the Hamming weight is fixed, and the evolution takes place in a smaller subspace of the full Hilbert space. With this preknowledge, some errors can be detected during the evolution of the circuit, by filtering the states not obeying the pattern through postselection. In this paper, we present mid-circuit postselection schemes for frequently used encodings such as one-hot, binary, gray, and domain-wall encoding. For the particular subspace of one-hot states, we propose a method that works by compressing the full Hilbert space to a smaller subspace, allowing projecting to the desired subspace without using any ancilla qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for the quantum alternating operator ansatz algorithm. Our method is particularly suitable for the currently available hardware, where measuring and resetting are possible, but classical conditional operators are not."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","5e709375878c28a0473aa430","61454f299543c7051ff01cf2","61b6be387523402a58cb072e","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"105","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61b6be387523402a58cb072e","5e709375878c28a0473aa430","66f22428ece3980cc880b75f","5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","61454f299543c7051ff01cf2","63245a304097076a532b352f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479263","mniswId":"16085","title":"Physical Review A","doi":"","issn":"2469-9926","eissn":"2469-9934","websiteLink":"www.aps.org","documentHash":"4d50f193-e5c2-4eed-9906-916af0be6d90"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63245a304097076a532b352e","year":"2022","volume":"105","number":"2","documentHash":"3cd4ab70-75ea-4bc3-99c0-776a2afceed0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654746129"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c00ec040970702a66d42ae","name":"Luis","lastName":"Martinez","documentHash":"bb984160-c008-4c43-9269-daca48dd0704"},{"objectId":"63c00ec040970702a66d42ad","name":"Witold","lastName":"Pedrycz","documentHash":"666a4f6d-80b5-4b25-a9ef-c7aa47f37911"},{"objectId":"63c00ec040970702a66d42ac","name":"LeSheng","lastName":"Jin","documentHash":"2c539354-52e9-41d0-b867-5c89d6a8e10e"},{"objectId":"63c00ec040970702a66d42ab","name":"Zhu-Jun","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"461733fd-42fb-4a1b-9c9b-79e698942a84"},{"objectId":"63c00ec040970702a66d42aa","name":"Zhen-Song","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"b637b12b-803b-400f-a76d-51b4f6ba0991"},{"objectId":"63c00ec040970702a66d42a9","name":"Jian-Peng","lastName":"Chang","documentHash":"89c57dc1-f3c5-4e23-abca-985e97472832"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"objectId":"63c00ec040970702a66d42a7","doi":"10.1109/tfuzz.2022.3185680","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/91/4358784/09804739.pdf?arnumber=9804739","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessing the Spatial Synergy Between Integrated Urban Rail Transit System and Urban Form: A BULI-Based MCLSGA Model With Wisdom of Crowds","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Spatially synergizing the Urban Rail Transit (URT) network integrated with its feeder transit system and the urban form plays an important role in improving the effectiveness of URT in mitigating traffic congestion, reducing air pollution, optimizing urban spatial structure, etc. This paper mainly focuses on assessing the spatial synergy between the two parts by specifying the assessment criteria based on reviews on the relevant literatures, and developing a novel multi-criteria large-scale group assessment (MCLSGA), in which basic uncertain linguistic information (BULI), as an extended form of fuzzy linguistic approach, is used to model and process the subjective assessment information (Assess-Inf) elicited by experts. In order to alleviate the computing complexity, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is introduced to cluster the Assess-Inf given by a huge number of experts as per the organizers’ expected discrimination level on reliability-related Assess-Inf. A method for weighting the clusters is then proposed to control the roles played by the items of the Assess-Inf respectively representing each cluster and having different reliability levels in their fusing process to tap into wisdom of crowds (WOC) while accommodating the organizers’ trust level in the reliability-related Assess-Inf given by experts. Afterwards, the best worst method (BWM) is extended to the BULI-based large-scale group assessment context with the aim of accurately weighting the criteria by drawing on WOC.

Can Scrum, one of the Agile Project Management frameworks, be effectively used in managing a Design-Build construction project during the design and the construction phase? This study covers the adaptations necessary to apply Scrum to a Design-Build construction project and conducts a case study where Scrum was applied to part of a Design-Build construction project. The outcomes from this study show that the implementation of Scrum in a Design-Build construction project potentially leads to better cost and schedule control, along with superior communication amongst multiple stakeholders.

In many cases, we have a lack in all the positions but there is enough data to calculate position with the use of the multilateration. Our research proves that the order in which we calculate the positions with multilateration matters. We consider a network with mobile and stationary devices which are represented in the form of a graph with calculated distances as edges. Our contribution to solving the problem of indoor localization is true-range multilateration with a node sorting approach (TriSort). We based our research on an existing problem of smartphone localization in an enclosed indoor space using the BLE connection. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a simulator. The distances are calculated using the BLE signal level estimation. We use the Genetic Algorithm commonly used for such problems to assess our TriSort approach. We compare the results of both methods according to obtained errors and their processing times, showing that the proposed TriSort method provides a minimal decrease in accuracy compared to global optimization (below 14 %), with almost four orders of magnitudes lower complexity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f70"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157417aa","mniswId":"652","fullName":"IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications","shortName":"HPCC","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"5abf465a-e656-4612-9e71-902fbadd13b8"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"655372c340970760943121e1","startDate":"2022-12-18","endDate":"2022-12-20","fullName":"24th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing & Communications","shortName":"HPCC 2022","city":"Hainan","country":"CN","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"e1f6771b-17ab-4f60-9f41-88fcbe8c5976"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f70","5e7092ba878c28a04739ba55"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"655495bc4097076913e1444f","doi":"10.1109/hpcc/dss/smartcity/d57074.2022","title":"2022 IEEE 24th Int Conf on High Performance Computing & Communications; 8th Int Conf on Data Science & Systems","year":2022,"url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10074610/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"06e699a9-62b3-4f01-9212-9bae4793d697"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654760443"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"639c7276409707327119687a","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Deffner","documentHash":"7889dec1-bdcc-4645-9d80-47deca8a8ab5"},{"objectId":"639c72764097073271196879","name":"Marcus V.

Yet quantum annealing is still very much in its infancy, with suboptimal applicability. For instance, to date it is still an open question which annealing protocol causes the fewest diabatic excitations for a given eigenspectrum, and even whether there is a universally optimal strategy. Therefore, in this paper, we report analytical and numerical studies of the diabatic excitations arising from nonlinear protocols applied to the transverse field Ising chain, the exactly solvable model that serves as a quantum annealing playground. Our analysis focuses on several driving schemes that inhibit or facilitate the dynamic phases discussed in a previous work. Rather remarkably, we find that the paradigmatic Kibble-Zurek behavior can be suppressed with “pauses” in the evolution, both for crossing and for stopping at the quantum critical point of the system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"105","issue":"5","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["639c72764097073271196877","639c72764097073271196878","639c72764097073271196879","5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f","639c7276409707327119687a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479263","mniswId":"16085","title":"Physical Review A","doi":"","issn":"2469-9926","eissn":"2469-9934","websiteLink":"www.aps.org","documentHash":"4d50f193-e5c2-4eed-9906-916af0be6d90"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ed03114097072188633ded","year":"2022","volume":"105","number":"5","documentHash":"8581cebb-af4d-4682-a856-16ed32e1bfc2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654767959"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61b6be387523402a58cb071d","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Łaskarzewski ","uuid":"86EB4935FA7120A3AC092A39CE9E3339D95D9CEA6D3588FE6D805E4A485B202B865BF5355B541E28457C67A6B5EEE92142CD874B9F8D18F5122D0CB75084AE07","documentHash":"0fd63262-06fe-4187-8306-91db64669664"},{"objectId":"61b6be387523402a58cb0710","name":"Artur","lastName":"Frankiewicz ","uuid":"77F74D3BD26CADD7FB6D1192896DAA31EAB172DD28A8BDDC2EAA273E4DEBD7BBDD367E5E9F1509AEF44B05A34412A49C6A6B9B77807AFB2F5E143490E93D96FB","documentHash":"2332fd85-cddf-450b-bb72-23f0995d4e31"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Strzoda","uuid":"B0D6BFD33F8756550BC38B6185859322A184B3218CD98302394D0F3F0656FFC9ABA9C0B7A0D1DF0937FAD3533FAC8C4EC0A7208C4C29B23D42E7C222AC2040EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3994-1428","documentHash":"de4a5946-337f-4f96-9f61-e50ef06171cd"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"}],"objectId":"63a5817740970715e70b823b","doi":"10.1109/iwcmc55113.2022.9824317","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9823957/9824097/09824317.pdf?arnumber=9824317","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Measurements and Analysis of Large Scale LoRa Network Efficiency","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The LoRa networks allow building long-range and low power wireless networks using a star of stars topology, with multiple gateways serving low-cost devices. We present the measurements obtained in an urban environment from two independent real-life network topologies located in two Polish cities. These topologies consist of about 6400 and 4400 location points and included more than eight mln data points. We focus on the variability of RSSI (Received Signal Strength Index), SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio), probability of packet delivery, and these measures' dependence on distance. We also present an estimated path loss derived from the measurement data. The analysis shows significant variability of packet delivery probability and the RSSI. Approximately 65% of the population provides > 80% packet delivery probability in setup A, and 85% of the population provides > 80% packet delivery probability in setup B. The calculated path loss model is slightly more pessimistic than shown by most studies, as at longer distances, the measured SNR and RSSI are higher than the actual average since all transmissions with RSSI lower than gateway sensitivity (reception threshold) are not considered in the analysis as there is no data recorded. We also compare the measurements with simulated path loss, showing that commonly used simulation models may overestimate the path loss for larger distances."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","5e709444878c28a0473b94d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621b878c2877157415be","mniswId":"34","fullName":"ACM International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","shortName":"IWCMC","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"59b6478e-6335-477b-829e-55d5893507c2"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63a5805940970715e70b7d6b","startDate":"2022-05-30","endDate":"2022-06-03","fullName":"2022 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)","shortName":"IWCMC","city":"Dubrovnik","country":"HR","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"51db5103-51ee-420b-88d7-ea79a2249b9b"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","61b6be387523402a58cb071d","61b6be387523402a58cb0710"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"63a580f540970715e70b805c","doi":"10.1109/iwcmc55113.2022","title":"2022 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)","year":2022,"translation":false,"documentHash":"986701a9-baa4-44f4-bc04-8cd6b9f71824"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654768036"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","name":"Godlove","lastName":"Kuaban","uuid":"EC7E7F9A13DA2FF8F55E44B4B99C3C2F1E000A81058C127DFD5262D301424BA1EA9459DEA4307FD055980254A4F03934B883B243B8F00D784E1B548726F9EF79","documentHash":"caa3d804-e4e6-493c-b7ad-e9ff4795b04e"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391c36","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Czachórski","uuid":"A483917DFB05C13B3CC94DF456E6128ACF8BD637835BC0306F79D369DDCDBA7F8529DBB5A66F4BE6825EE0956A0D7038F58013290F56C3BFC403BDC9392C532F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7158-0258","documentHash":"fe637cf9-0b07-4c39-ab13-913318c62788"}],"objectId":"649a9680409707195f00a096","doi":"10.1109/mascots56607.2022.00019","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/10053683/10053699/10053785.pdf?arnumber=10053785","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Modelling Energy Changes in the Energy Harvesting Battery of an IoT Device","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The complexity of battery-powered autonomous devices such as Internet of Things (IoT) nodes or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and the necessity to ensure an acceptable quality of service, reliability, and security, have significantly increased their energy demand.

Many machine learning based Attack Detectors are typically trained to identify specific types attacks, and the training of such algorithms to cover several types of attacks may be excessively time consuming. This paper shows that G-Networks, which are queueing networks with product form solution and special customers such as negative customers and triggers, can be trained just with “non-attack” traffic, can accurately detect several different attack types. This is established with a special case of G-Networks with triggerred customer movement. A DARPA attack and non-attack traffic repository is used to train and test the the G-Network, yielding comparable or clearly better accuracy than most known attack detection techniques."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741b69","mniswId":"1771","fullName":"Symposium Model Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunications Systems","shortName":"MASCOTS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bdbb827c-3544-4471-a6a3-83cc65bda9a5"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"649a90aa409707195f0080e6","startDate":"2022-10-18","endDate":"2022-10-20","fullName":"30th International Symposium on the Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","shortName":"MASCOTS 2022","city":"Nicea","country":"FR","website":"https://mascots22.iitis.pl/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"062f1211-bf92-4254-8622-e248da9228fb"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"649a923e409707195f008bb6","doi":"10.1109/mascots56607.2022","title":"2022 30th International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","year":2022,"url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10053683/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"54d20157-8a71-4411-a243-d95fb65c893f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654775086"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63e317397523404b9db5e47c","name":"Mohammed","lastName":"Nasereddin","uuid":"041624FA30E3FAAA7B6C5737D839C641B66271D29E8701882227136CE75D43651DE92EB54047773700E2AA7C39F79C3B89ABC9090A9875655E20A225367F4D2E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3740-9518","documentHash":"4233f532-e079-478e-8aa0-c8c434980aa6"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"5f532814752340073806a95f","name":"Mert","lastName":"Nakip","uuid":"6EE14383BEC5E308B4B31DB96075B5B9D11B8A3380D47274C583232C87DFE62BA1A38BDA3547E4792533BA246FBB798E501DC0CB82FB2CDB3128BF0BF7CAC8CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6723-6494","documentHash":"d9b43af6-35d8-4aeb-b4af-c25f660650fa"}],"objectId":"659fc33540970707a12ae962","doi":"10.1109/lcn58197.2023.10223358","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/10223299/10223313/10223358.pdf?arnumber=10223358","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Measurement Based Evaluation and Mitigation of Flood Attacks on a LAN Test-Bed","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The IoT is vulnerable to network attacks, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can provide high attack detection accuracy and are easily installed in IoT Servers.

Therefore, when an intelligent system fails, it is usually difficult to troubleshoot the problems. Among others, these issues can be caused by incorrect decisions of the CNN classifier. The other reason can be selective “blindness” of the CNN - caused by an insufficient generalization of the convolutional feature extractor. To better understand the CNN decisions, methods from the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) family have been introduced. In contrast to CAM techniques, which focus on the model's predictions (thus a classifier), we propose a simple yet informative way to visualize network activation - Network Activation Mapping (NAM). Our method targets the most important part of the CNN - a convolutional feature extractor. Opposed to CAM methods, NAM is class-and classifier-independent and provides insight into what the neural network focuses on during the feature extraction process and what features it finds the most prominent in the examined image. Due to the classifier-independence, it can be used with all CNN models. In our experiments, we demonstrate how the performance of a convolutional feature extractor can be preliminarily evaluated using NAM. We also present results obtained for a simple NAM-based visual attention mechanism, which allows us to filter out less informative regions of the image and facilitates the decision making process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709245878c28a047392d1a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157417c8","mniswId":"685","fullName":"IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks","shortName":"IJCNN","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"cae70e2e-da66-4fc4-b7f9-454ff427bde6"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"633adc8e4097076a06412016","startDate":"2022-07-18","endDate":"2022-07-23","fullName":"International Joint COnference on Neural Networks 2022","shortName":"IJCNN 2022","city":"Padwa","country":"IT","website":"https://wcci2022.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"5afaa2b9-a4f9-4c92-8ba0-331a30eef32d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","5e709245878c28a047392d1a"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"633af2944097076a06428b9e","doi":"10.1109/ijcnn55064.2022.9892926","title":"2022 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-7281-8671-9","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9891857/proceeding","translation":false,"documentHash":"c5a253cb-b0f4-4230-830a-100d34114270"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654782813"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","name":"Godlove","lastName":"Kuaban","uuid":"EC7E7F9A13DA2FF8F55E44B4B99C3C2F1E000A81058C127DFD5262D301424BA1EA9459DEA4307FD055980254A4F03934B883B243B8F00D784E1B548726F9EF79","documentHash":"caa3d804-e4e6-493c-b7ad-e9ff4795b04e"},{"objectId":"63bd6ef24097073596a38e6a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Czekalski","documentHash":"fb46d629-c8b9-4e49-bbb7-0d4c5cbfa002"},{"objectId":"63bd6ef24097073596a38e69","name":"Rakesh","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"497d8b49-4541-4493-9ae9-d0031db11f52"},{"objectId":"63bd6ef24097073596a38e68","name":"Bhavneet","lastName":"Singh Soodan","documentHash":"9023fd1e-e045-4b52-9b48-f97af13d4f8e"}],"objectId":"63bd6ef24097073596a38e67","doi":"10.1109/icecet52533.2021.9698583","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9698246/9698247/09698583.pdf?arnumber=9698583","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Analysis of the Performance of a Cloud Computing Processing Queue with Correlated Reneging of Tasks and Resubmission","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by the packets that constitute a cloud computing task does not only depend on the performance of the cloud computing network infrastructure at the data centre but also on the performance of the access networks and the internet core networks traversed by the packets before the task is fully submitted to the cloud computing or processing servers for execution or processing. Sometimes, some of the tasks that are submitted and are waiting in queues to be processed could be removed from the queues without being processed (task reneging or dropping). Removing tasks from the queue could result from the user's impatience, missing execution deadline, security reasons, or an active queue management strategy. The reneged or dropped tasks could be resubmitted depending on the reason for which it was dropped. The resubmission of tasks decreases QoS and increases the energy consumption overhead as more energy is required to transport the resubmitted tasks through the access, core, and data centre networks.

It offers high-speed computing, storage, and ICT resources on demand. One of the significant challenges in cloud computing is the impact of impatient users or request (task) reneging. When a request has been compromised, missed its execution deadline, or depends on other rejected ones, it must be removed from the queue without being processed. The reneging or removal of tasks from queues may trigger the reneging or removal of other tasks that depend of them. We refer to this reneging of requests from the load balancing or computing queues as correlated reneging. We presented the performance analysis of a network of queues that constitute a queueing model of a simplified cloud computing infrastructure. We show the relationship between the load, delay, and probability of buffer saturation (blocking probability). It is seen that at about 80% utilization, a small increase in utilization (due to a small increase in the arrival rate Δλ for a fixed service rate μ) in a sharp increase in the delay experienced by the tasks, and on the probability of task rejection or blocking."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709221878c28a047390588"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65387daa40e3ff51d520310e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-7","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709221878c28a047390588","65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","67850090fdbe831a380b2131","67850090fdbe831a380b2132"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"63c0037140970702a66bb521","doi":"10.1109/iceccme55909.2022","title":"International Conference on Electrical, Computer, Communications and Mechatronics Engineering (ICECCME 2022), 16-18 November 2022, Male, Maledives","year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-6654-7095-7","url":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCME55909.2022","translation":false,"documentHash":"7888fc6b-d23a-41c0-9931-122f57c999cc","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7fc","mniswId":"26900","name":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","documentHash":"b80f2dd5-e346-440a-b828-4712b50be331"}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["analiza wydajności","przetwarzanie w chmurze","infrastruktura centrum danych","planowanie zadań","renegocjacja zadań","odrzucanie zadań"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["performance analysis","cloud computing","data centre infrastructure","tasks scheduling","tasks reneging","tasks dropping"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654783044"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"5f532814752340073806a95f","name":"Mert","lastName":"Nakip","uuid":"6EE14383BEC5E308B4B31DB96075B5B9D11B8A3380D47274C583232C87DFE62BA1A38BDA3547E4792533BA246FBB798E501DC0CB82FB2CDB3128BF0BF7CAC8CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6723-6494","documentHash":"d9b43af6-35d8-4aeb-b4af-c25f660650fa"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"659fc17840970707a12ac38a","doi":"10.1109/access.2023.3297977","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/10005208/10189862.pdf?arnumber=10189862","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"IoT Network Cybersecurity Assessment With the Associated Random Neural Network","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper proposes a method to assess the security of an n device, or IP address, IoT network by simultaneously identifying all the compromised IoT devices and IP addresses. It uses a specific Random Neural Network (RNN) architecture composed of two mutually interconnected sub-networks that complement each other in a recurrent structure, called the Associated RNN (ARNN). For each of the n devices or IP addresses in the IoT network, two distinct neurons of the ARNN advocate opposite views: compromised or not compromised. The fully interconnected 2n neuron ARNN structure of paired neurons learns offline from ground truth data. Thus rather than requiring a separate attack detector at each network node, the ARNN offers a single overall attack detector that observes the incoming traffic at each node, learns about the interdependencies between network nodes, and formulates a recommendation for each device or IP address in an IoT network. The ARNN weight initialization and learning algorithm are discussed, and the ARNN performance is evaluated using real attack data, and compared against several learning and testing techniques. Results are obtained both for off-line learning with ground truth data, and for on-line incremental learning using a simplified average metric measured from incoming packet traffic. Comparisons with the best state-of-the-art techniques show that the ARNN significantly outperforms previously known approaches."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"85501-85512","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f9e","mniswId":"7872","title":"IEEE Access","issn":"2169-3536","eissn":"2169-3536","documentHash":"3fa3b710-ff56-41c7-baa4-ec6501935943"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d3d5e24097071d34c3a432","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"11","documentHash":"22d0b1e3-82bf-487b-95b5-bfed977052ab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654783138"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"},{"objectId":"5e7093df878c28a0473b2554","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sobczak","uuid":"4282A9260F1F46D49DC9D7EAC610C79996D3DB3378DA22548901CD9C56CBA9A8190DCEFAF8504F2BEED80F89197DB5FF536F9947D24C42A34D80AAE71914320C","documentHash":"9c3f439e-95b1-49b5-91cc-64040c13de01"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Domańska","uuid":"4A1A11F10A925F650E6B59202EE7CBE9E2A25C68AF861B8CB2D7FF318E2B00DA7F4C678616ADC0C8082C8C1B0A3575CEC53207B122F0FC1DABD0F41341DD6884","orcidId":"0000-0002-1935-8358","documentHash":"f852ee1c-d3c4-48f8-9ff9-17b3e049a012"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a047390508","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Cupek","uuid":"49F5619DB16AE41942973063BDEEF96D2F7EF03C31C09E8E605688900ABBA604980B0C2F2E127F5E07163F3EA377CBD47192CE62BBB640F873C2CB6958470654","orcidId":"0000-0001-8479-5725","documentHash":"e2ed564d-e0fc-4da5-9589-3579740738ac"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a047390504","name":"Adam","lastName":"Domański","uuid":"E47230942281738711E10BF79CEF4DBA65494F523B2655755D086E6EA25A7230BFB3DEC1344FE4D3EAD9CD41C5FD301B4A4CBD8DF2A29623E82B4FD4599F2279","orcidId":"0000-0002-9452-8361","documentHash":"620b64f2-685e-419c-a479-7bc9bc52921a"}],"objectId":"63f8be9940970709927656d1","doi":"10.1109/bigdata55660.2022.10020817","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10020817","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Real-time testing of vision-based systems for AGVs with ArUco markers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Automated Ground Vehicles (AGVs) use deep-learning-based vision systems to perceive the surrounding environment and extract relevant information about it. Although deep learning models offer high capabilities, they require large amounts of data to be properly trained and tested. Testing is especially important when off-the-shelf models are used by the AGVs - to examine whether they can meet the demands of complex environments such as the production halls of automated factories. One area of such perception algorithms is object recognition. To test such systems, we propose a solution based on ArUco fiducial markers used for automatic labeling of objects. Our solution can be used to test deep learning systems in real time directly on a robot. Our solution requires minimal interference with the environment and additional infrastructure - the desired objects only need to be marked with a marker printed on a home printer. Therefore, the presented testing procedure can be used for testing of AGVs in real-life environments during a real ride from an actual robot perspective. Data gathered during the online testing can be used for the offline comparison of the accuracy of different deep learning models. Although we focus on the online and offline testing in our study, we also incorporated a marker masking procedure. Therefore, the resulting datasets may also be used for training."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709221878c28a047390504","5e709221878c28a047390508"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709245878c28a047392d1a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"6290-6298","conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"61b9ae66ad204581b62ebbdc","mniswId":"2226","fullName":"IEEE International Conference on Big Data","shortName":"BigData","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"858b1922-0572-4e19-8e54-fa3cb1a81f43"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65bb9e4f4097076263f9b92d","startDate":"2022-12-17","endDate":"2022-12-20","fullName":"2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data","shortName":"[BigData]","city":"Osaka","country":"JP","website":"https://omega.polsl.pl/info/conference/WUTdd3b75364fe8469e9cfbee9d3bb1b2c8/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"eec263be-117e-463b-8a1b-7a177e092a1c"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709221878c28a047390504","5e709221878c28a047390508","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","5e7093df878c28a0473b2554","5e709245878c28a047392d1a"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zautomatyzowany pojazd kierowany","AGV","testowanie","głębokie uczenie","rozpoznawanie obiektów","automatyczne etykietowanie"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["automated guided vehicle","AGV","testing","deep learning","object recognition","automatic labeling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654789353"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709448878c28a0473b9a2d","name":" Ryszard ","lastName":"Kukulski ","uuid":"5F0ABDAECBA20A903838DAB8FA2E1FAD7075FE9E5CCC193659603B065DA18CD642725DC100682AA3596285001D8FCC139456037F5FFC11B1ACB7E044F287B0A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-9171-1734","documentHash":"5457b986-05ee-4ab5-a15e-d001c8d011bf"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawela","uuid":"068B730D2C136A32A8BA02EE7CD80A8C260FDD4556CF79F5C2F70EDDF891933ACE74BCB5A2F5F4BDC3024342BFF8AE78616CB1C0A435CA6477DA4C1A6F40E51B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0476-7132","documentHash":"0edf79c6-1d52-4bb1-a0da-0af3724cb1c1"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Puchała","uuid":"084E5F6A60B0C0CA41B364C281E70B8FFF17CAB5C42C464CF3B473E5DDDE7CF4F75350AFE021EEFC95F81444AEB0EDF8B955A7569D9FAC1A7DC77CAD370DD038","orcidId":"0000-0002-4739-0400","documentHash":"a6454553-3823-42b4-904b-d14ce1638536"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"649aadba409707195f01a439","doi":"10.1109/tit.2023.3254054","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/18/10155402/10063938.pdf?arnumber=10063938","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"On the Probabilistic Quantum Error Correction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Probabilistic quantum error correction is an error-correcting procedure which uses postselection to determine if the encoded information was successfully restored.

We show that for some noise channels, the initial information has to be encoded into a mixed state to maximize the probability of successful error correction. Finally, the probabilistic error-correcting procedure offers an advantage over the deterministic procedure. Reducing the probability of successful error correction allows for correcting errors generated by a broader class of noise channels. Significantly, if the errors are caused by a unitary interaction with an auxiliary qubit system, we can probabilistically restore a qubit state by using only one additional physical qubit."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e709448878c28a0473b9a2d","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"69","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"4620-4640","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709448878c28a0473b9a2d","5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478000","mniswId":"7987","title":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issn":"0018-9448","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7db237e3-5601-4c8c-8243-92d3ed9bad30"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649aadba409707195f01a43a","year":"2023","volume":"69","number":"7","documentHash":"5e0e742a-73dc-44e7-b93c-4947bc51ce6a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654803040"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658d6b2f40970713760c9f8d","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Słabicki","documentHash":"cdb69bf0-536d-49cc-9e66-46bfe8cbd7ab"},{"objectId":"658d6b2f40970713760c9f8c","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Nowak","documentHash":"6101e6cd-f562-463d-a460-8f639c136141"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f70","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gorawski","uuid":"F64751F846D433E08F9D664E4CD00CCCA130788F51C3C510116D0E540B84EAD69BA34F56F3E185677108D538091648337F564A32B012AA9EF61752F90550E785","orcidId":"0000-0002-0953-9593","documentHash":"81ae92c4-2d6c-4111-93a4-3434f2676d3a"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"}],"objectId":"658d6b2f40970713760c9f8b","doi":"10.1109/iwcmc58020.2023.10183073","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/10182387/10182368/10183073.pdf?arnumber=10183073","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Efficient Universal Indoor Multicharacteristic Propagation model for indoor environments","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Accurate indoor radio propagation modelling is a well-known problem that researchers tend to solve in many ways. Related methods differ in terms of accuracy and complexity. The article’s contribution is a new stochastic propagation model, Universal Indoor Multicharacteristic Propagation (UIMP), which results are statistically consistent with those measured in a real environment. The model could be used to verify real- world applications due to the low computational complexity and high accuracy level compared to state-of-the-art methods. This method can be especially beneficial for the efficient modelling of complex environments shared by many users using discrete events simulations (DES) based on a series of measurements in a real environment. In the article, we describe the method and present how to establish the model. The motivation was to develop an efficient method for use in an actual application: using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal to estimate the position of users in indoor environments – the use of the proposed UIMP model allowed for a reliable assessment of the developed functionalities. Therefore we also present how the model was used to evaluate an example, real functionality, showing that the use of simplified models may falsify the assessment of the analyzed method and may lead e.g. to incorrect implementation assumptions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f70"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621b878c2877157415be","mniswId":"34","fullName":"ACM International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","shortName":"IWCMC","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"59b6478e-6335-477b-829e-55d5893507c2"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"658d601c40970713760b56cc","startDate":"2023-06-19","endDate":"2023-06-23","fullName":"2023 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","shortName":"IWCMC","city":"Marrakesh","country":"MA","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"6c74622d-cda7-461a-a817-fe9a5710f852"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658d6b2f40970713760c9f8c","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","658d6b2f40970713760c9f8d","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f70"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"658d616f40970713760b7495","doi":"10.1109/iwcmc58020.2023","title":"2023 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)","year":2023,"translation":false,"documentHash":"03e2b638-60c7-4dcd-8671-204881f51607"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654910151"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"5f532814752340073806a95f","name":"Mert","lastName":"Nakip","uuid":"6EE14383BEC5E308B4B31DB96075B5B9D11B8A3380D47274C583232C87DFE62BA1A38BDA3547E4792533BA246FBB798E501DC0CB82FB2CDB3128BF0BF7CAC8CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6723-6494","documentHash":"d9b43af6-35d8-4aeb-b4af-c25f660650fa"}],"objectId":"67348badfdbe8361a579be88","doi":"10.1109/lanman58293.2023.10189812","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/10189413/10189414/10189812.pdf?arnumber=10189812","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Real-Time Cyberattack Detection with Offline and Online Learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents several novel algorithms for real-time cyberattack detection using the Auto-Associative Deep Random Neural Network.

UDP Floods are often included in attacks to overwhelm Supply Chains and the IoT through congestion that paralyzes their ability for timely Attack Detection and Mitigation. Thus this paper proposes an architecture that protects a connected Server using a Smart Quasi-Deterministic Transmission Policy Forwarder at its input. This Forwarder shapes the incoming traffic, sends it to the Server without increasing the overall packet delay, and avoids Server congestion. The relevant theoretical background is reviewed, and measurements during a UDP Flood Attack are provided to compare the Server performance, with and without the Forwarder. It is seen that during a UDP Flood Attack, the Forwarder protects the Server from congestion, allowing it to effectively identify Attack Packets. Congestion at the Forwarder is rapidly eliminated with \"drop\" commands generated by the Forwarder, or sent by the Server to the Forwarder."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","63e317397523404b9db5e47c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"379-386","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574182c","mniswId":"790","fullName":"International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","shortName":"TrustCom","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"1978c263-90f9-4f56-ab41-0d35dd2f4f88"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"67234b85fdbe8307b0e01649","startDate":"2023-11-01","endDate":"2023-11-03","fullName":"22nd International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications","shortName":"TrustCom 2023","city":"Exter","country":"GB","website":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TrustCom60117.2023","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"015b07dc-7701-406d-afe1-fe4274316769"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","63e317397523404b9db5e47c"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"67234b85fdbe8307b0e01648","doi":"10.1109/trustcom60117.2023","title":"2023 IEEE 22nd International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications :","year":2023,"translation":false,"documentHash":"6e3faf2c-f224-44a0-8a0a-d72212b42912"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654916993"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658d61e740970713760b8097","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Madej","documentHash":"bf3e2cab-60bf-4bea-9964-fdcb2f4f6a38"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Strzoda","uuid":"B0D6BFD33F8756550BC38B6185859322A184B3218CD98302394D0F3F0656FFC9ABA9C0B7A0D1DF0937FAD3533FAC8C4EC0A7208C4C29B23D42E7C222AC2040EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3994-1428","documentHash":"de4a5946-337f-4f96-9f61-e50ef06171cd"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Głomb","uuid":"67B5DF4EBEF036D7B1861B26A48C3ABE0E65A55A852DCAAEEF5DFCD3DEF99C6112C878B3A303C0B2F361D1FD7CAE0F6524E3EE80853F54592EC6A1FEE1A7D1B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0215-4674","documentHash":"f96d93e7-9254-4b2f-8620-8a6cffc11fbb"}],"objectId":"658d61e740970713760b8096","doi":"10.1109/iwcmc58020.2023.10183185","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/10182387/10182368/10183185.pdf?arnumber=10183185","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Link failure prediction in LoRa networks","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Low-Power Wide-Area Networks allow long-range communication with Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The LoRa (Long Range) is one of the most widely used LP WAN technologies thanks to unlicensed bands, extensive availability of lowcost transceivers and the standardized LoRaWAN networking stack. The messages in LP WANs are rarely extended (e.g. few times a day). The radio link characteristics may change significantly between two consecutive data transmissions due to changes in interference level, collisions with other transmissions or the presence of obstacles on the radio wave transmission path. It makes it very hard to estimate the optimal transmission parameters and delays the detection of any problems in the transmission. We investigate the problem of prediction of the link state, namely the prediction if a packet transmitted by a LoRa arrives at the gateway. We analyze the time sequence of packets delivered to LoRa gateways from a city-wide telemetry network, consisting of 15 gateways and more than 1 mln data points. We evaluate two prediction methods, based on moving averages of received signal strength (RSSI) measurements and using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Using a time series of 20 days, it is possible to achieve the specificity and sensitivity of the prediction above 0.6 with the SVM method. The mean accuracy of the SVM method is approximately 0.6. Using the comparison of RSSI moving averages, we could predict the link failure with a lower sensitivity, but very high specificity - e.g. prediction of 10% of link breaks with 91% specificity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","5e709444878c28a0473b94d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621b878c2877157415be","mniswId":"34","fullName":"ACM International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","shortName":"IWCMC","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"59b6478e-6335-477b-829e-55d5893507c2"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"658d601c40970713760b56cc","startDate":"2023-06-19","endDate":"2023-06-23","fullName":"2023 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","shortName":"IWCMC","city":"Marrakesh","country":"MA","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"6c74622d-cda7-461a-a817-fe9a5710f852"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709444878c28a0473b94d7","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","658d61e740970713760b8097"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"658d616f40970713760b7495","doi":"10.1109/iwcmc58020.2023","title":"2023 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (IWCMC)","year":2023,"translation":false,"documentHash":"03e2b638-60c7-4dcd-8671-204881f51607"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654920955"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658d688740970713760c6a4a","name":"Veronique","lastName":"Defonte","documentHash":"b97dfec3-ff49-470a-8555-9cb2f9948831"},{"objectId":"658d688740970713760c6a49","name":"Guillaume","lastName":"Pasero","documentHash":"57d60242-f960-4e46-9699-1f91f4040b20"},{"objectId":"658d688740970713760c6a48","name":"Mickaël","lastName":"Savinaud","documentHash":"d5af2eac-0452-4406-b55a-f5395fe6252f"},{"objectId":"658d688740970713760c6a47","name":"Matthijs","lastName":"Van Waveren","documentHash":"8c9aaa15-0ced-4d0e-94bb-e9b4f04faeee"},{"objectId":"658d688740970713760c6a46","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Gawron","documentHash":"e81a0e57-d3d2-4f64-a128-24910c076f5b"},{"objectId":"658d688740970713760c6a45","name":"Pierre-Marie","lastName":"Brunet","documentHash":"e5d70e4b-0572-4a58-8427-a1f73cabbc46"},{"objectId":"658d688740970713760c6a44","name":"Orphee","lastName":"Faucoz","documentHash":"4f2f0a6e-5b44-4208-9ff5-fc3a7c33a0a6"},{"objectId":"658d688740970713760c6a43","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sadowski","documentHash":"ad9f1859-01d5-4660-93e3-3a2a85a55ff0"},{"objectId":"6024b9df9543c7744e88f35a","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Jałowiecki","uuid":"A7FAB60E6C1FC74D992B19737C00296A00416BAF2D837CC088C734A67D25945A1B539E21EAEF2505564B250158FD9EBC8A4F1D5C62DAFD5B55A0A0FD716312CA","documentHash":"2da1cf2d-eb70-4dfd-b3dd-3118d027acbd"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Gardas","uuid":"3C1048715375037F9EE2B99F8CFAC2669B8EC38A3E356582DC5ACEEEFB48E40873FCFA5211D02B422339B025B376B6DCAFB77641E9A3875258E54FF2EAD5C259","orcidId":"0000-0002-1454-1591","documentHash":"4f5c5866-335d-4b37-886c-e252534aa3b4"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawela","uuid":"068B730D2C136A32A8BA02EE7CD80A8C260FDD4556CF79F5C2F70EDDF891933ACE74BCB5A2F5F4BDC3024342BFF8AE78616CB1C0A435CA6477DA4C1A6F40E51B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0476-7132","documentHash":"0edf79c6-1d52-4bb1-a0da-0af3724cb1c1"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Głomb","uuid":"67B5DF4EBEF036D7B1861B26A48C3ABE0E65A55A852DCAAEEF5DFCD3DEF99C6112C878B3A303C0B2F361D1FD7CAE0F6524E3EE80853F54592EC6A1FEE1A7D1B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0215-4674","documentHash":"f96d93e7-9254-4b2f-8620-8a6cffc11fbb"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Puchała","uuid":"084E5F6A60B0C0CA41B364C281E70B8FFF17CAB5C42C464CF3B473E5DDDE7CF4F75350AFE021EEFC95F81444AEB0EDF8B955A7569D9FAC1A7DC77CAD370DD038","orcidId":"0000-0002-4739-0400","documentHash":"a6454553-3823-42b4-904b-d14ce1638536"}],"objectId":"658d688740970713760c6a42","doi":"10.1109/igarss52108.2023.10282125","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/10281394/10281399/10282125.pdf?arnumber=10282125","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Hyper-Spectral Image Classification Using Adiabatic Quantum Computation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Supervised machine learning techniques are widely used for hyper-spectral images segmentation. A typical simple scheme of classification of such images probabilistically assigns a label to each individual pixel omitting information about pixel surroundings. In order to achieve better classification results for real world images one has to agree the local label obtained from the classifier with the classes of pixel neighborhood. A popular way to do it is through a probabilistic graphical model, where label distributions for individual pixels are mapped into a graph of neighborhood relations. One way to realize this approach is to use Ising models, where class probability is mapped to spin energy and class-class interaction is mapped to the spins coupling. By finding low energy states of such an Ising model we can perform post-processing of segmented images. In this work we present how this postprocessing can be implemented using a quantum annealer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","6024b9df9543c7744e88f35a","5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157417c7","mniswId":"683","fullName":"IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","shortName":"IGARSS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6163d972-92b7-428f-9562-a090006648f3"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"658d675840970713760c42e0","startDate":"2023-07-16","endDate":"2023-07-21","fullName":"IGARSS 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","shortName":"IGARSS 2023","city":"Pasadena","country":"US","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"6ac93b5d-394c-4fdb-af2b-1c97258ed97d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f","5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","658d688740970713760c6a43","5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","6024b9df9543c7744e88f35a","5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","658d688740970713760c6a44","658d688740970713760c6a45","658d688740970713760c6a46","658d688740970713760c6a47","658d688740970713760c6a48","658d688740970713760c6a49","658d688740970713760c6a4a"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"658d682640970713760c5fbf","doi":"10.1109/igarss52108.2023","title":"IGARSS 2023 - 2023 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","year":2023,"isbn":"979-8-3503-2010-7","translation":false,"documentHash":"a7abac39-921d-43b9-a495-391be4f103c4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654921089"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67582faffdbe8357174e15e7","name":"Kryspin","lastName":"Musioł","documentHash":"f47d82b4-98e0-46e5-8878-89e9c24b501c"},{"objectId":"67582faffdbe8357174e15e6","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Madej","documentHash":"86b488f4-103e-43ae-a985-d59c4b3edb2b"},{"objectId":"67582faffdbe8357174e15e5","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Koral","documentHash":"43c45ae3-defe-4b97-bbaa-9b41bf9caa4a"},{"objectId":"637d93b9752340568b01c328","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kołodziej","uuid":"9B8D74E38B1125EA9C5D142193B9741FAF6B3D68BB8531826C36C642DEF5DC53DDBBD84A776293B8BE6850D5D9E7B131B575C8917C17F8F480D25A09EF8558DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-2329-107X","documentHash":"e118187c-62ef-4b9c-bce2-3ccc43779c81"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f70","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gorawski","uuid":"F64751F846D433E08F9D664E4CD00CCCA130788F51C3C510116D0E540B84EAD69BA34F56F3E185677108D538091648337F564A32B012AA9EF61752F90550E785","orcidId":"0000-0002-0953-9593","documentHash":"81ae92c4-2d6c-4111-93a4-3434f2676d3a"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa031","name":"Michał","lastName":"Romaszewski","uuid":"794BD3547A8C73952F65D57A0FD3FF33B13690959E9AE28F002050B9026AF3C5143015AF3D68A11D34922CD16D0846F6C5095BBBD497B639C920863DF2126982","orcidId":"0000-0002-8227-929X","documentHash":"06589218-e8d0-4a53-9e39-8d8ccfadb95c"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa030","name":"Michał","lastName":"Cholewa","uuid":"47699C878B3AD5E38C0A505FC84A47A065643A57A3D8A402D2BA6D348CBACF7B7FAFDC34C006484FAB36434989FA5EDAFF39AF29A82591DADA599F2EA2E4FBCE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6549-1590","documentHash":"9afc1c06-2697-4a7a-a02d-3e833155f6ab"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Głomb","uuid":"67B5DF4EBEF036D7B1861B26A48C3ABE0E65A55A852DCAAEEF5DFCD3DEF99C6112C878B3A303C0B2F361D1FD7CAE0F6524E3EE80853F54592EC6A1FEE1A7D1B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0215-4674","documentHash":"f96d93e7-9254-4b2f-8620-8a6cffc11fbb"},{"objectId":"5e709220878c28a0473903a3","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Koral","uuid":"7D359D72F1A05FF454D05617E3AE92125C1284D9C32D5D64456A115631D5E84CBFB999F9A780C030879287DF0DEA1C4BC56C8B32979B8A0943CCA10EFBEC6809","orcidId":"0000-0002-6316-1261","documentHash":"46b516b0-e722-4a24-965d-cd2b14c1990f"}],"objectId":"67582faffdbe8357174e15df","doi":"10.1109/jsen.2024.3413889","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566594","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"'Just one more sensor is enough' - iterative water leak localization with physical simulation and a small number of pressure sensors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this article, we propose an approach to leak localisation in a complex water delivery grid with the use of data from physical simulation (e.g. EPANET software). This task is usually achieved by a network of multiple water pressure sensors and analysis of the so-called sensitivity matrix of pressure differences between the network’s simulated data and actual data of the network affected by the leak. However, most algorithms using this approach require a significant number of pressure sensors – a condition that is not easy to fulfil in the case of many less equipped networks. Therefore, we answer the question of whether leak localisation is possible by utilising very few sensors but having the ability to relocate one of them. Our algorithm is based on physical simulations (EPANET software) and an iterative scheme for mobile sensor relocation. The experiments show that the proposed system can equalise the low number of sensors with adjustments made for their positioning, giving a very good approximation of leak’s position both in simulated cases and real-life example taken from BattLeDIM competition L-Town data."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709220878c28a0473903a3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","637d93b9752340568b01c328","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f70","5e709373878c28a0473aa030","5e709373878c28a0473aa031"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"24299-24307","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709373878c28a0473aa030","5e709373878c28a0473aa031","5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","637d93b9752340568b01c328","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f70","67582faffdbe8357174e15e5","5e709220878c28a0473903a3","67582faffdbe8357174e15e6","67582faffdbe8357174e15e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fd0","mniswId":"7933","title":"IEEE Sensors Journal","issn":"1530-437X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3b9ba5c4-ee9a-4ada-9f3c-718ff7f26faf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["lokalizacja usterek","system dystrybucji","symulacja cyfrowa","diagnostyka modelowa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["distribution system","locating faults","digital simulation","model-based diagnosis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654940665"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678505abfdbe831a380b2b60","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Wojciechowski","documentHash":"a3c01f43-6f1a-437f-b952-f669a58321c7"},{"objectId":"678505abfdbe831a380b2b5f","name":"Marcel","lastName":"Król","documentHash":"7fd9de6e-a27a-455f-973f-a6239f5d84f0"},{"objectId":"678505abfdbe831a380b2b5e","name":"Marta","lastName":"Szczygieł","documentHash":"cb9ee69a-790a-437b-b81f-7955c8b2161e"},{"objectId":"5fabc8b8085dcb5a2b98d9c0","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Biernacki","uuid":"21026063F6F4D2725476385DF3C2311157662A7B18E2499BFE1F1AA3132E0135E3BA574429FC2054A26CFE9EE615D2BFD641F0281F02CD88F1A4CB06FB4E6C1E","documentHash":"126ba05d-0aeb-4129-8bad-320bc65dc4bf"},{"objectId":"5e7093df878c28a0473b2555","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Szyguła","uuid":"9675FADA68C9EDE5F93409862B05F1BD4A44552921012A86218EB0DBFD34AC0B88BB0A93731050D10C77DD24C22BF71986A558AEF876D17F543B3C45A2203438","orcidId":"0000-0002-5728-6105","documentHash":"a5bc1ebf-3521-4db5-892a-a9c35a9e55a5"},{"objectId":"5e7093df878c28a0473b2552","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Marek","uuid":"3E7AFC43041CE0DFFE04BF4D67A076FCECE76A22D1B57A3B4CF954FE5A3D092EDB859DBDD2BAD6A6F2016D3F9FA64F7D2679EC73E66399565EB96B2B56781CD5","orcidId":"0000-0002-4074-8502","documentHash":"31258a2b-3b43-45b0-abb8-627dd89e7d33"},{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abb12","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paszkuta","uuid":"F2EFA5714ACC05D12AEC6FD992EC72B5BEF12912BFCB74777D5335C99E440C47A5E73ADF79921C9E9856264264FFAF3DBE3426342DA7456183105012709AA477","orcidId":"0000-0002-7136-0797","documentHash":"d6c0e980-391a-4eb9-aeb4-3de61c8bab10"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a047390504","name":"Adam","lastName":"Domański","uuid":"E47230942281738711E10BF79CEF4DBA65494F523B2655755D086E6EA25A7230BFB3DEC1344FE4D3EAD9CD41C5FD301B4A4CBD8DF2A29623E82B4FD4599F2279","orcidId":"0000-0002-9452-8361","documentHash":"620b64f2-685e-419c-a479-7bc9bc52921a"}],"objectId":"6772a9bcfdbe831a388d756c","doi":"10.1109/bigdata59044.2023.10386672","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10386672","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"General concepts in swarm of drones control: analysis and implementation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the presented paper, detailed schematics and descriptions concerning communication in the context of swarm drone control are introduced.

For example, incorporating Gabor filters - a mathematical representation of the responses in the mammalian primary visual corte-into CNNs has been shown to boost CNN performance in terms of accuracy. Motivated by the ability of Gabor filters to increase the performance of CNNs and the importance of proposing diverse analytical tools to facilitate CNN evaluation and modeling, we proposed a novel three-step methodology specially crafted to systematically analyze and evaluate vision CNNs in terms of the similarity of their first-layer filters to Gabor filters. It is based on direct similarity measurements, and also indirect measurements of similarity through the impact of filter replacement on performance (accuracy) and security (resilience to adversarial attacks). The methodology demonstrates great potential for the areas of explainability, evaluation and modeling of CNN filter responses. Our results showed that all first-layer filters formed in the examined CNNs are highly similar or almost identical to Gabor filters, which was confirmed by our direct and indirect measurements. The security-related experiment further showed that although the filter replacement does not fully protect the network against the perturbations from the baseline model, it can slightly improve its resilience suggesting potential practical implications for security.

The decision and analysis of E-Nose systems often enabled by Machine Learning (ML) models that are trained offline using existing datasets. However, despite their potential, offline training efforts often prove intensive and may still fall short in achieving high generalization ability and specialization for considered application. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the e-rTPNN decision system, which leverages the Recurrent Trend Predictive Neural Network (rTPNN) combined with online transfer learning. The recurrent architecture of the e-rTPNN system effectively captures temporal dependencies and hidden sequential patterns within E-Nose sensor data, enabling accurate estimation of trends and levels. Notably, the system demonstrates the ability to adapt quickly to new data during online operation, requiring only a small offline dataset for initial learning. We evaluate the performance of the e-rTPNN decision system in two domains: beverage quality assessment and medical diagnosis, using publicly available wine quality and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) datasets, respectively. Our evaluation indicates that the proposed e-rTPNN achieves decision accuracy exceeding 97 % while maintaining low execution times. Furthermore, comparative analysis against established Machine Learning (ML) models reveals that the e-rTPNN decision system consistently outperforms these models by a significant margin in terms of accuracy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"71442-71452","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67936d72fdbe835f61f61ab2","5f532814752340073806a95f","67936d72fdbe835f61f61ab3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f9e","mniswId":"7872","title":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/access","issn":"2169-3536","eissn":"2169-3536","documentHash":"f5093a18-7cfd-4ec5-822e-c99cc838a475"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a5637d4097071df0271cfb","year":"2024","volume":"12","documentHash":"0a9a618f-6148-42cb-8ded-d191069c9649"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654954634"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790ed63fdbe835da550f72c","name":"Baran Can","lastName":"Gül","documentHash":"a08a8492-ac9c-4caf-bc2f-bbeda6959714"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"5f532814752340073806a95f","name":"Mert","lastName":"Nakip","uuid":"6EE14383BEC5E308B4B31DB96075B5B9D11B8A3380D47274C583232C87DFE62BA1A38BDA3547E4792533BA246FBB798E501DC0CB82FB2CDB3128BF0BF7CAC8CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6723-6494","documentHash":"d9b43af6-35d8-4aeb-b4af-c25f660650fa"}],"objectId":"6790ed63fdbe835da550f72b","doi":"10.1109/mascots59514.2023.10387644","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/10387536/10387538/10387644.pdf?arnumber=10387644","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Decentralized Online Federated G-Network Learning for Lightweight Intrusion Detection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cyberattacks are increasingly threatening net-worked systems, often with the emergence of new types of unknown (zero-day) attacks and the rise of vulnerable devices. uch attacks can also target multiple components of a Supply Chain, which can be protected via Machine Learning (ML)-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, the need to learn large amounts of labelled data often limits the applicability of ML-based IDSs to cybersystems that only have access to private local data, while distributed systems such as Supply Chains have multiple components, each of which must preserve its private data while being targeted by the same attack To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel Decentralized and Online Federated Learning Intrusion Detection (DOF-ID) architecture based on the G-Network model with collaborative learning, that allows each IDS used by a specific component to learn from the experience gained in other components, in addition to its own local data, without violating the data privacy of other components. The performance evaluation results using public Kitsune and Bot-loT datasets show that DOF -ID significantly improves the intrusion detection performance in all of the collaborating components, with acceptable computation time for online learning."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741b69","mniswId":"1771","fullName":"Symposium Model Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunications Systems","shortName":"MASCOTS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bdbb827c-3544-4471-a6a3-83cc65bda9a5"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"67238179fdbe8307b0e28e6c","startDate":"2023-10-16","endDate":"2023-10-18","fullName":"31st International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","shortName":"MASCOTS 2023","city":"Stony Brook","country":"US","website":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MASCOTS59514.2023","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"b49604f0-82a1-46ae-b929-cb47e3a22d5e"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f532814752340073806a95f","6790ed63fdbe835da550f72c","6325312975234038513dfa2e"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"67238179fdbe8307b0e28e6b","doi":"10.1109/mascots59514.2023","title":"2023 31st International Symposium on Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems : MASCOTS : Stony Brook, NY, USA 16-18 October 2023 : proceedings","year":2023,"translation":false,"documentHash":"eade7f60-26ce-4a03-b384-3158220bc868"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654954974"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790d454fdbe835da54c02df","name":"Orphée","lastName":"Faucoz","documentHash":"15b4e5f6-6177-44e2-a29f-d8139cd744c4"},{"objectId":"6790d454fdbe835da54c02de","name":"Pierre-Marie","lastName":"Brunet","documentHash":"28ec3e65-aa17-489f-98ae-be242937c783"},{"objectId":"6790d454fdbe835da54c02dd","name":"Mickaël","lastName":"Savinaud","documentHash":"78675de3-9970-4339-b0b7-053e35fc10ca"},{"objectId":"6790d454fdbe835da54c02dc","name":"Guillaume","lastName":"Pasero","documentHash":"832a6a6a-8fbb-4c85-b137-276a86d86fba"},{"objectId":"6790d454fdbe835da54c02db","name":"Clément","lastName":"Forray","documentHash":"c332e84a-551f-47e8-b91f-f7231952fe45"},{"objectId":"6790d454fdbe835da54c02da","name":"Matthijs","lastName":"Van Waveren","documentHash":"a1831b3f-b506-4838-b1c6-6b4c3fb48eec"},{"objectId":"6790d454fdbe835da54c02d9","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sadowski","documentHash":"8bce81bf-0b59-4cf6-b937-427f1c86bfef"},{"objectId":"6790d454fdbe835da54c02d8","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Gawron","documentHash":"c60cd27b-db01-4fb8-a1f4-5cab50bb17b8"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d9f","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Gardas","uuid":"3C1048715375037F9EE2B99F8CFAC2669B8EC38A3E356582DC5ACEEEFB48E40873FCFA5211D02B422339B025B376B6DCAFB77641E9A3875258E54FF2EAD5C259","orcidId":"0000-0002-1454-1591","documentHash":"4f5c5866-335d-4b37-886c-e252534aa3b4"},{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa43c","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawela","uuid":"068B730D2C136A32A8BA02EE7CD80A8C260FDD4556CF79F5C2F70EDDF891933ACE74BCB5A2F5F4BDC3024342BFF8AE78616CB1C0A435CA6477DA4C1A6F40E51B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0476-7132","documentHash":"0edf79c6-1d52-4bb1-a0da-0af3724cb1c1"},{"objectId":"5e70935f878c28a0473a85b1","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Głomb","uuid":"67B5DF4EBEF036D7B1861B26A48C3ABE0E65A55A852DCAAEEF5DFCD3DEF99C6112C878B3A303C0B2F361D1FD7CAE0F6524E3EE80853F54592EC6A1FEE1A7D1B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0215-4674","documentHash":"f96d93e7-9254-4b2f-8620-8a6cffc11fbb"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a84ca","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Puchała","uuid":"084E5F6A60B0C0CA41B364C281E70B8FFF17CAB5C42C464CF3B473E5DDDE7CF4F75350AFE021EEFC95F81444AEB0EDF8B955A7569D9FAC1A7DC77CAD370DD038","orcidId":"0000-0002-4739-0400","documentHash":"a6454553-3823-42b4-904b-d14ce1638536"}],"objectId":"6790d454fdbe835da54c02d7","doi":"10.1109/igarss53475.2024.10642960","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/10640349/10640352/10642960.pdf?arnumber=10642960","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"What Could be Achieved with a Million Qubits Quantum Annealer in Remote Sensing?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We discuss the applicability of large quantum annealers for the purpose of processing Remote Sensing images.

While individual digital technologies have received some focus, comprehensive evaluations and recommendations concerning digital transformation remain scarce. Maturity assessment models comprehensively evaluate an organization's state, but construction enterprises have lacked emphasis on assessing digital transformation maturity. This study aims to develop a framework evaluating construction enterprises' digital transformation maturity degree. The framework comprises a digital transformation maturity assessment model facilitating expert individual assessments and an assessment method based on the optimized fairness-aware collective opinion generation paradigm generating collective assessments. The model explores digital transformation's influencing factors to construct a hierarchical model with dimensions, indicators, and levels.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies comparing the costs of traditional construction and 3DP across various stages, from design to waste disposal. Therefore, this study investigates the overall cost of traditional and 3DP construction, considering both off-site and on-site 3DP techniques. Mathematical models are developed to analyse costs, including research and development (R&D), Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC), transportation, warehousing, setup installation, printing and on-site assembling processes, waste disposal, and environmental costs. Real-time case studies have been investigated to validate the feasibility and practicality of the models. The comparative analysis revealed that the design stage cost of 3DP is 19 times higher than those of traditional construction due to significant investments in R&D. Off-site 3DP incurs higher logistics costs primarily due to holding costs. Nevertheless, it becomes a more viable option for small-scale projects (less than 35t for the considered cases), like printing architectural elements, as the expense of delivering printed components to the construction site is lower compared to transporting bulky 3DP equipment and raw materials. On-site 3DP presents a competitive alternative to traditional construction methods, both for individual projects and large-scale developments. The findings of this research provide valuable insights that can help the construction industry optimize cost-effectiveness and enhance efficiency in construction practices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741a19","mniswId":"1358","fullName":"International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction","shortName":"ISARC","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"04447571-85fd-40bc-959c-079d2cb3c86e"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6793a42ffdbe835f61f9b363","startDate":"2024-06-03","endDate":"2024-06-07","fullName":"41st International Symposium Automation and Robotics in Construction","shortName":"ISARC 2024","city":"Lille","country":"FR","website":"https://www.iaarc.org/isarc-2024","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"7e6a6f06-7b7f-4396-b366-080328392f3c"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6793a4c5fdbe835f61f9b479","6793a4c5fdbe835f61f9b47a","6793a4c5fdbe835f61f9b47b","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"6793a49afdbe835f61f9b424","doi":"10.22260/isarc2024/0001","title":"2024 Proceedings of the 41st ISARC, Lille, France","year":2024,"translation":false,"documentHash":"ef4b499b-ef3d-43fa-a581-5a79d83d8705"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654955208"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67934dc4fdbe835f61f2da4c","name":"Krzysztof Adam","lastName":"Cyran","documentHash":"542e4bb1-0d20-49db-8e06-60a31a01c1a3"},{"objectId":"67934dc4fdbe835f61f2da4b","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Skurowski","documentHash":"fb2a0db5-9fee-4d8e-a903-159eb4487779"},{"objectId":"67934dc4fdbe835f61f2da4a","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Wereszczyński","documentHash":"698d3b22-b434-42fa-aa59-e1f21897b4c7"},{"objectId":"67934dc4fdbe835f61f2da49","name":"Onyeka Josephine","lastName":"Nwobodo","documentHash":"76119f6a-2a1f-4606-9ea7-91c3f3da5a29"},{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","name":"Godlove","lastName":"Kuaban","uuid":"EC7E7F9A13DA2FF8F55E44B4B99C3C2F1E000A81058C127DFD5262D301424BA1EA9459DEA4307FD055980254A4F03934B883B243B8F00D784E1B548726F9EF79","documentHash":"caa3d804-e4e6-493c-b7ad-e9ff4795b04e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67934dc4fdbe835f61f2da48","doi":"10.1109/access.2024.3498444","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/6287639/10380310/10752958.pdf?arnumber=10752958","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"An Adaptation of Fitts’ Law for Performance Evaluation and Optimization of Augmented Reality (AR) Interfaces","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"There is growing widespread adoption of augmented reality in tech-driven industries and sectors of society, such as medicine, gaming, flight simulation, education, interior design and modelling, entertainment, construction, tourism, repair and maintenance, public safety, agriculture, and quantum computing. However, ensuring smooth and intuitive interactions with augmented objects is challenging, requiring practical performance evaluation and optimization models to assess and improve users’ experiences with AR-enhanced systems. In this paper, we apply Fitts’ Law to model and predict interaction task difficulty with objects distributed across four spatial quadrants. We use genetic optimization algorithms to fine-tune Fitts’ Law parameters, achieving a model that significantly enhances predictive accuracy. Our optimized model demonstrates an approximately 40% reduction in interaction task difficulty across all quadrants, leading to a more ergonomic and intuitive user interface. This study contributes to the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field by offering a refined metric for evaluating and optimizing AR interfaces and addressing the unique challenges of three-dimensional interaction environments.

One of the key problems in this domain is Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which uses standard smartphone sensors to understand and recognize user movements. While HAR exhibits high potential in this area, its persistent challenge is to differentiating between similar activities, whose occurrences can often lead to misclassification and reduced quality of applications. To tackle this problem, we employ specialized classifiers and use them in a hierarchical manner instead of using monolith multi-class models. We propose HierAct - a Hierarchical model that solves the multi-class human activity recognition problem. We also release a new HAR dataset - EduAct - (https://github.com/iitis/HierAct-Dataset) focused on activities that could be used to create game-like educational applications.Our results show that the performance of the proposed model is substantially better than other state-of-the-art machine learning models.

They are also used in different domains of smart cities to process and analyze large amounts of image data, which is crucial for intelligent decision-making. CNNs trained on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, possess remarkable image classification abilities. As it takes a lot of time and computational resources to train models on such datasets, we propose a solution to reuse these models in the area of smart-cities. We call our approach the model recycling, as it uses the existing versatile knowledge of ImageNet-trained networks for resource conservation and faster deployment of applications in the smart-city domains. For that purpose, we utilize the semantic connections between ImageNet categories to determine the sets of classes that can be used to create specialized classification models for smart transportation, shopping and education with no additional training. We present a methodology to extract such specialized models from generic CNNs trained on ImageNet.

However, the existing collective opinion generation approaches fail to model the behavioral characteristics associated with individuals, and thus, cannot reflect the fairness concerns among them when they consciously or unconsciously incorporate their judgments on the fairness level of distribution into the formulations of individual opinions. In this study, we propose a multiobjective optimization-driven collective opinion generation approach that generalizes the bi-objective optimization-based PDF aggregation paradigm. In doing so, we adapt the notion of fairness concern utility function to characterize the influence of fairness inclusion and take its maximization as an additional objective, together with the criteria of consensus and confidence levels, to achieve in generating collective opinion. The formulation of fairness concern is then transformed into the congregation of individual fairness concern utilities in the use of aggregation functions. We regard the generalized extended Bonferroni mean (BM) as an elaborated framework for aggregating individual fairness concern utilities. In such way, we establish the concept of BM-type collective fairness concern utility to empower multiobjective optimization-driven collective opinion generation approach with the capacity of modeling different structures associated with the expert group with fairness concern. The application of the proposed fairness-aware framework in the maturity assessment of building information modeling demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of multiobjective optimization-driven approach for generating collective opinion when accomplishing complicated assessment and evaluation tasks with data scarcity"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"53","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"5729-5741","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67347ce9fdbe8361a57857d8","67347ce9fdbe8361a57857d9","67347ce9fdbe8361a57857da","67347ce9fdbe8361a57857db","67347ce9fdbe8361a57857dc","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478021","mniswId":"8021","title":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics : Systems","issn":"2168-2216","documentHash":"8d43d933-3e5d-418c-a9df-27c5199a5aaf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67347ce9fdbe8361a57857d7","year":"2023","volume":"53","number":"9","documentHash":"5efced6f-f05b-431c-abae-6458b9610e23"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655033611"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67347ec5fdbe8361a5789a7e","name":"Pradeep","lastName":"Singh","documentHash":"c8a39918-a0cd-4c73-a2e7-9f1570004657"},{"objectId":"67347ec5fdbe8361a5789a7d","name":"Bhavneet Singh","lastName":"Soodan","documentHash":"a49edc08-388a-4910-aa36-6ad303265ee6"},{"objectId":"67347ec5fdbe8361a5789a7c","name":"Rakesh","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"3e631e5b-e91e-43a7-bfdb-a4826074903f"},{"objectId":"67347ec5fdbe8361a5789a7b","name":"Sapana","lastName":"Sharma","documentHash":"8579e04a-a921-4194-a4d8-a7a7b1c9a54a"},{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","name":"Godlove","lastName":"Kuaban","uuid":"EC7E7F9A13DA2FF8F55E44B4B99C3C2F1E000A81058C127DFD5262D301424BA1EA9459DEA4307FD055980254A4F03934B883B243B8F00D784E1B548726F9EF79","documentHash":"caa3d804-e4e6-493c-b7ad-e9ff4795b04e"}],"objectId":"67347ec5fdbe8361a5789a79","doi":"10.1504/ijsem.2023.10054965","publicUri":"http://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/full/10.1504/IJSEM.2023.10054965","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Performance and cost evaluation of an adaptive queuing system with customer reneging and retention: steady-state and transient analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Customers are often required to wait when they arrive at service facilities and see the servers are busy, or when they find other customers who arrived earlier waiting. The longer customers wait, the more dissatisfied they are likely to be and may leave the queue without receiving service (reneging). The objective of the service provider is to improve the quality of service in order to minimise the possibility of customer reneging since it increases cost and reduces revenue. Therefore, a trade-off between performance and cost should be considered when designing, planning and reducing the queues at service facilities. In this paper, we propose an adaptive queuing model with the retention of reneging customers. We derive the steady-state and transient-state performance parameters, and also discuss performance and cost evaluation.

In the case of distributed control of multi-zone objects with the mutual influence of zones, the problem is complicated by changes in the operating modes of local control systems (LCS) due to the failures of elements of the systems of neighboring zones. This, in turn, leads to a change in their failure rates. In this work, the functional dependability model of the decentralized distributed control system for multi-zone objects was developed and investigated. The model is obtained in the form of an inhomogeneous Markov chain of the system states caused by failures of elements of LCS. The probabilities of transitions between states are described by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations and additional equations that describe the relationship between the parameters of neighboring zones and the corresponding LCS. The impact of Data Transmission System (DTS) overload, controller failures, sensor failures, and DTS failures on the probability of the zones’ state exceeding the permissible limits was studied. The functional safety assessment model of decentralized control of multi-zone objects, proposed in the previous works of the author was used for the theoretical analysis. Verification of the theoretical model is achieved through simulation, leveraging a library of modules developed by the authors on the Scilab/Xcos platform. The simulation showed that the “cascade failures” process is probable for multi-zone objects with coordinated control according to a global criterion and a strong connection between the parameters of the zones, which leads to the rapid loss of functional dependability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"95736-95749","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67924e32fdbe830e6d93e4f2","67924e32fdbe830e6d93e4f3","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6","5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f9e","mniswId":"7872","title":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/access","issn":"2169-3536","eissn":"2169-3536","documentHash":"f5093a18-7cfd-4ec5-822e-c99cc838a475"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a5637d4097071df0271cfb","year":"2024","volume":"12","documentHash":"0a9a618f-6148-42cb-8ded-d191069c9649"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655040601"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa3d2","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Żarski","uuid":"E3D24B6A5C01404811271B9409004C30CEF27B269279C11F33661E241358397FCC27AAE784C6A864CADDD6B00DB2DA85780AEFB8B935CD942534D850CF6DE056","orcidId":"0000-0003-0380-8411","documentHash":"9b05653a-732f-4e28-813e-63b890464eb3"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-09-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67935e22fdbe835f61f51b82","doi":"10.1109/access.2024.3459424","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/6287639/10380310/10679116.pdf?arnumber=10679116","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Multi-Step Feature Fusion for Natural Disaster Damage Assessment on Satellite Images","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Quick and accurate assessment of the damage state of buildings after natural disasters is crucial for undertaking properly targeted rescue and subsequent recovery operations, which can have a major impact on the safety of victims and the cost of disaster recovery.

We introduce a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) module that performs feature fusion at multiple network levels between pre- and post-disaster images in the horizontal and vertical directions of CNN network. An additional network element – Fuse Module – was proposed to adapt any CNN model to analyze image pairs in the issue of pair classification.

The approach is experimentally evaluated on public datasets and compared with well-known machine learning and deep learning models, showing that this SSID framework is very useful and advantageous as an accurate and online learning DL-based IDS for IoT systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"5668-5683","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477ffe","mniswId":"7986","title":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","issn":"1556-6013","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e4f51c51-95c3-4bd2-8fba-001a24a40094"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"671239d1fdbe836b555df993","year":"2024","volume":"19","documentHash":"04624b51-f236-40ee-9055-c4fbae0d4431"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655040832"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61b6be387523402a58cb0710","name":"Artur","lastName":"Frankiewicz ","uuid":"77F74D3BD26CADD7FB6D1192896DAA31EAB172DD28A8BDDC2EAA273E4DEBD7BBDD367E5E9F1509AEF44B05A34412A49C6A6B9B77807AFB2F5E143490E93D96FB","documentHash":"2332fd85-cddf-450b-bb72-23f0995d4e31"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f70","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gorawski","uuid":"F64751F846D433E08F9D664E4CD00CCCA130788F51C3C510116D0E540B84EAD69BA34F56F3E185677108D538091648337F564A32B012AA9EF61752F90550E785","orcidId":"0000-0002-0953-9593","documentHash":"81ae92c4-2d6c-4111-93a4-3434f2676d3a"},{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abc53","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Marjasz","uuid":"E8D6AC5A29FA294ED1BEE9D77C42213DF5440A192232E8879796967716E7FAF87CE88C81304AD79357C7E16CF0050973AACB8A99DAEA4927F24D37EEFB4F91EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9187-0009","documentHash":"933c3234-e315-4184-995f-a25ed49ce8b9"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grochla","uuid":"12AB2EB200B9660443157CCC4B17BA6908CA2D1EAA11B2A738744EDED6C008EDCBFF02A644FADCC358E635490FFF91320DC7B900162BE7683D9E917A8988F27B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-4790","documentHash":"140f881d-b8da-47a5-b66f-2a06cef10d8f"}],"objectId":"6790f148fdbe835da551e4e8","doi":"10.23919/ifipnetworking62109.2024.10619861","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/10619708/10619055/10619861.pdf?arnumber=10619861","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Comparative Analysis of Energy Consumption in Simulated LoRa Water Meter Reconfiguration vs. Real-world Readings","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Detecting water leaks in distribution networks is crucial for conserving resources and preventing infrastructure damage.

This technique, the Adaptive-Quasi-Deterministic Transmission Policy (AQDTP) is a special case of “traffic shaping” which involves delaying some packets at the points of origin to alleviate congestion at the routers. One nice feature of AQDTP is that it loses no packets and allows an infinite buffer. In this work, to clarify the approach in a general queueing theory framework, and to move beyond the original telecommunications application, we frame these potential delays as time spent at a café by customers before proceeding to a service facility. We first present some sample-path results that significantly refine and expand upon what was shown in previous work, and then present further results under a general stationary ergodic stochastic framework. In the sample-path realm, we give conditions that ensure AQDTP will not change the total delay and sojourn time of any customer as compared to what that customer would have experienced if there was no café; but we also prove that AQDTP can never reduce the total delay. The difference is that, under AQDTP, some of that delay is spent at the café instead of in the queue/line at the service facility. In a stochastic framework, our focus is on stability and constructing proper stationary versions of the model. Under i.i.d. assumptions we dig deeper by proving Harris recurrence of an underlying two-dimensional Markov process, and explicitly find positive recurrent regeneration points."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-7","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741b69","mniswId":"1771","fullName":"Symposium Model Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunications Systems","shortName":"MASCOTS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bdbb827c-3544-4471-a6a3-83cc65bda9a5"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"67768c1efdbe831a38b97444","startDate":"2024-10-21","endDate":"2024-10-23","fullName":"32nd International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","shortName":"MASCOTS’24","city":"Kraków","country":"PL","website":"https://mascots24.iitis.pl/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"c5ba4ec1-2996-451c-ba38-5d0eec053f9b"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6790d93bfdbe835da54cc448","6325312975234038513dfa2e","6790d93bfdbe835da54cc449"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"677693c0fdbe833e6955e3c9","doi":"10.1109/mascots64422.2024","title":"2024 32nd International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","year":2024,"translation":false,"documentHash":"0b3819e3-f9b7-460f-980c-8f75dca96b9c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655052857"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6785008afdbe831a380b2099","name":"Sapana","lastName":"Sharma","documentHash":"fed4c9ea-d2b6-4ab8-bc55-57eea0c7af87"},{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","name":"Godlove","lastName":"Kuaban","uuid":"EC7E7F9A13DA2FF8F55E44B4B99C3C2F1E000A81058C127DFD5262D301424BA1EA9459DEA4307FD055980254A4F03934B883B243B8F00D784E1B548726F9EF79","documentHash":"caa3d804-e4e6-493c-b7ad-e9ff4795b04e"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391c36","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Czachórski","uuid":"A483917DFB05C13B3CC94DF456E6128ACF8BD637835BC0306F79D369DDCDBA7F8529DBB5A66F4BE6825EE0956A0D7038F58013290F56C3BFC403BDC9392C532F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7158-0258","documentHash":"fe637cf9-0b07-4c39-ab13-913318c62788"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a047390588","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Czekalski","uuid":"7A4CA7AB885E20154EFB08771386BC959F00DEA05556B5D7B726C71F7442F3F3BA66BDD97D78C7218520361E6B9021C56953A745118217DA08DEA69968E5FF2E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3110-3603","documentHash":"7de36d11-1b33-4c62-8f51-9c91e37adf39"}],"objectId":"6785008afdbe831a380b2095","doi":"10.1109/ciees58940.2023.10378778","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10378778","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"A Markov model for a self-powered Green IoT device with state-dependent energy consumption","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The growing concerns about the resource sustainability and environmental impact of deploying billions or trillions of IoT devices in the various sectors of society or economy have given rise to an energy research field known as Green-IoT (G-IoT).

This paper presents a Markov model for a self-powered Green IoT device with state-dependent energy consumption. The model evaluates the energy performance of a self-powered Green IoT device. We derive the probability distribution of the energy content of the battery, including the probability that the energy stored in the battery is completely depleted and the density of the lifetime of the IoT device. We investigate the influence of some design parameters on the results. Introducing the threshold at which the device is forced to enter an energy-saving regime significantly increases a G-IoT device's lifetime. Apart from deploying energy-efficient mechanisms to increase the lifetime of a G-IoT device, integrating an efficient energy harvesting system into the device will increase its lifetime and reduce the frequency of battery replacement."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709221878c28a047390588"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","5e709236878c28a047391c36"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-7","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","5e709236878c28a047391c36","6325312975234038513dfa2e","6785008afdbe831a380b2099","5e709221878c28a047390588"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"66139d7940970762638be754","doi":"10.1109/ciees58940.2023","title":"IEEE International Conference on Communications, Information, Electronic and Energy Systems.

The results show that UDP Flood attacks can be mitigated with the proposed IDPS, allowing the system to continue routine operations, and resume communications when the attack ends."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","63e317397523404b9db5e47c","5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-4","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741b69","mniswId":"1771","fullName":"Symposium Model Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunications Systems","shortName":"MASCOTS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bdbb827c-3544-4471-a6a3-83cc65bda9a5"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"67768c1efdbe831a38b97444","startDate":"2024-10-21","endDate":"2024-10-23","fullName":"32nd International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems","shortName":"MASCOTS’24","city":"Kraków","country":"PL","website":"https://mascots24.iitis.pl/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"c5ba4ec1-2996-451c-ba38-5d0eec053f9b"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63e317397523404b9db5e47c","6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"]},"proceedings":{"objectId":"677693c0fdbe833e6955e3c9","doi":"10.1109/mascots64422.2024","title":"2024 32nd International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS)","year":2024,"translation":false,"documentHash":"0b3819e3-f9b7-460f-980c-8f75dca96b9c"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655052975"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790da41fdbe835da54cf438","name":"Zheng","lastName":"Yan","documentHash":"989bca39-749c-4430-acd6-1091f53a6d54"},{"objectId":"6790da41fdbe835da54cf437","name":"Yijia","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"f2af1d89-a94d-49a5-9792-ee76d7b87c9e"},{"objectId":"6790da41fdbe835da54cf436","name":"Guoliang","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"f3a77fc0-3fec-4466-9f24-4bc00a01688b"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"}],"objectId":"6790da41fdbe835da54cf434","doi":"10.1109/mce.2024.3485257","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/5962380/9085929/10731562.pdf?arnumber=10731562","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Is ChatGPT Trustworthy Enough? a Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"ChatGPT, as an advanced model that seamlessly integrates into diverse digital interactions, shows great potential to enhance the performance of consumer technology and reshape its landscape. The critical question of its trustworthiness and associated challenges becomes increasingly prominent. However, the literature still lacks a thorough review to study its trust. This comprehensive review explores whether ChatGPT is trustworthy enough by navigating the multifaceted realm of large language models, placing a significant focus on its exemplar model, ChatGPT. Our exploration traverses the complex interplay of factors impacting user trust, including trust in ChatGPT itself and trust in its utilization and dissemination. By delving into insightful perspectives on the ChatGPT trustworthiness regarding a set of evaluation criteria including fundamental properties, subjective properties, security and privacy, we find that ChatGPT is far from trustworthy based on related literature review. This paper sheds light on the weakness of ChatGPT trust and provides the trajectory of future development in the realm of large language models."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6790da41fdbe835da54cf436","6790da41fdbe835da54cf437","6790da41fdbe835da54cf438","6325312975234038513dfa2e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c323","mniswId":"7885","title":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine","issn":"2162-2248","eissn":"2162-2256","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"48958d52-d87d-4d4e-bd70-742ed34e9b4f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6790da41fdbe835da54cf435","year":"2024","documentHash":"b50f7a7f-ad61-45c3-b579-8d90000c305b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655052977"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678fa82ffdbe835856bc9ca7","name":"Santiago E.","lastName":"Conant-Pablos","documentHash":"7557e9da-ca94-4e45-a249-fd572f7419de"},{"objectId":"678fa82ffdbe835856bc9ca6","name":"Jorge M.","lastName":"Cruz-Duarte","documentHash":"5ed07655-8dd8-419e-8278-69e1c107d15a"},{"objectId":"678fa82ffdbe835856bc9ca5","name":"Gustavo","lastName":"de Jesús Machado-Guillén","documentHash":"540a7b63-88f0-401e-9578-368b8eed2c25"},{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"}],"objectId":"678fa82ffdbe835856bc9ca4","doi":"10.1109/cec60901.2024.10611993","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/10609966/10611750/10611993.pdf?arnumber=10611993","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Harnessing Machine Learning for Reliable Weather Forecasting: Meteorological Impact on Sustainable Energy in Monterrey","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, we assess the performance of var-ious machine learning algorithms in weather forecasting for Monterrey, Mexico, a large metropolitan area with a mountain-influenced semi-arid climate whose geographical features significantly hinder weather prediction.

However, the construction community has paid little attention to PC innovation, especially networked innovation. This study aims to gain deep insights into what impacts the formation and dynamics of a prefabricated construction innovation network (PCIN). With the uptake of PC facing serious obstacles in China, networked innovation can break the technical constraints while also containing the risks in individual innovation.\nDesign/methodology/approach\n\nThe research design follows a sequential mixed methodology of qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis. It first conceptualizes the PCIN based on the quadruple helix model and formulates a corresponding system dynamics model based on causality analysis. After validating the PCIN model using empirical data, simulations are carried out using Vensim PLE software. Finally, this study identifies key factors that promote the formation of PCIN in China through sensitivity analysis.\nFindings\n\nThe results show that PC predicts a continuous increase in practice as of 2030. The tested drivers all positively influence the formation of the PCIN, with market demand and risk sharing having the greatest influence, followed by competitive pressure, profit government support, scientific and technological advancement and collaborative innovation strategy.\nOriginality/value\n\nThe study makes three major contributions. First, it provides a novel angle for a deeper understanding of the PC innovation. Second, it proposes a new approach for probing the formation and dynamics of the PCIN. Finally, it offers a theoretical reference for promoting the formation of innovation networks and the development of PC."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6793a1f3fdbe835f61f9826f","6793a1f3fdbe835f61f98270","6793a1f3fdbe835f61f98271","6793a1f3fdbe835f61f98272","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c028","mniswId":"5711","title":"Engineering Construction and Architectural Management","issn":"0969-9988","eissn":"1365-232X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"47240a98-2ca3-4d95-900f-f7cbe8c0b2b2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6793a1f3fdbe835f61f9826e","year":"2024","documentHash":"1842d639-9129-4c7e-92b5-ff3f5babcb6c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655055607"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67dd4164fdbe831b59ae35ed","name":"Jia-Hao","lastName":"Syu","documentHash":"bfaaa413-9645-46b7-b6f7-672d80c9bab4"},{"objectId":"643e00a940e3ff4630cf9918","name":"Jerry Chun-Wei","lastName":"Lin","uuid":"1E794448DCDED24F7A5DD3CBBEFE4B9F9B036301DB17A143A03EF6C28A40C6BE1EC6B0DFBC7725ECE50CE736BD76C7B170C4FC862BD0496377025EFFA5AD24E3","documentHash":"1321d26d-adbb-4bbe-acbe-bdc8e8cf73b3"},{"objectId":"5fabc8b8085dcb5a2b98d9c0","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Biernacki","uuid":"21026063F6F4D2725476385DF3C2311157662A7B18E2499BFE1F1AA3132E0135E3BA574429FC2054A26CFE9EE615D2BFD641F0281F02CD88F1A4CB06FB4E6C1E","documentHash":"126ba05d-0aeb-4129-8bad-320bc65dc4bf"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a047396a47","name":"Adam","lastName":"Ziębiński","uuid":"DF22CE5B507282F24EE54BD609F343D68188168309D18F9D4A9AAFD42A4D946344DBBAC7F7503602BB108CB0694AAC82D6A593552C62E8AC54DB1585EAC5C8C5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4554-6667","documentHash":"0e0812a3-303d-4653-bb42-9f789ad690f4"}],"objectId":"67dd4164fdbe831b59ae35eb","doi":"10.1109/bigdata59044.2023.10386524","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The calibration of single beam distance sensors based on machine learning methods","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Smart cities require the use of many different types of sensors to make the communication, and distance sensors are one of the most commonly used elements in transportation systems and related infrastructures.

High precision is essential for proper operation, long-term use, and safety in machine-to-machine or machine-to-human interactions. This paper presents a comparison of the accuracy of distance measurements for two commercially available single-beam LiDARs and two ultrasonic sensors. The aim of the research was to develop a calibration method in order to improve the accuracy of distance sensors. Based on the collected distance measurements, the sensors were calibrated using selected machine learning algorithms.

Such attacks often include packet Floods that impair the QoS of the networks and Gateways and even impede the Gateways’ capability to carry out AD. Thus, this article first evaluates these effects using system measurements during Flood attacks. It then demonstrates how a smart quasi-deterministic policy forwarder (SQF) at the entrance of the Gateway can regulate the incoming traffic to ensure that the Gateway supports the AD to operate promptly during an attack. Since Flood attacks create substantial packet backlogs, we propose a novel adaptive attack mitigation (AAM) system that is activated after an attack is detected to dynamically sample the incoming packet stream, determine whether the attack is continuing, and also drop batches of packets at the input to reduce the effects of the attack. The AAM is designed to minimize a cost function that includes the sampling overhead and the cost of lost benign packets. We show experimentally that the Optimum AAM approach is effective in mitigating attacks and present theoretical and experimental results that validate the proposed approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","63e317397523404b9db5e47c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"4701-4714","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","63e317397523404b9db5e47c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c327","mniswId":"7900","title":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","issn":"2327-4662","eissn":"2327-4662","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8a7d4c9c-c6b8-44c2-b7bc-d66ffa95f3c4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67e12370fdbe833fcf555872","year":"2025","volume":"12","number":"5","documentHash":"ca4732ec-85f2-4f24-b8c6-75fdfb4668ac"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655077683"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Domańska","uuid":"4A1A11F10A925F650E6B59202EE7CBE9E2A25C68AF861B8CB2D7FF318E2B00DA7F4C678616ADC0C8082C8C1B0A3575CEC53207B122F0FC1DABD0F41341DD6884","orcidId":"0000-0002-1935-8358","documentHash":"f852ee1c-d3c4-48f8-9ff9-17b3e049a012"}],"objectId":"681dee47fdbe83601a7235ad","doi":"10.1109/bigdata59044.2023.10386834","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/10385234/10386078/10386834.pdf?arnumber=10386834","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"NetSat: Network Saturation Adversarial Attack","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Deep Convolutional Neural Networks can be fooled with imperceptible image perturbations. This negatively affects the security of intelligent systems. It is especially important for applications, in which security is crucial, such as Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) and production systems. A great majority of adversarial attacks target the classification layer of the network. These attacks focus only on changing the prediction, but it is also beneficial to corrupt the deep data representations. It can result in higher confusion of neural networks, which is important for more in-depth security testing. Classifier-independent attacks could be used in the future to test other types of networks frequently used in industry, production and AGVs, e.g. object detectors. In this paper, we present Network Saturation Attack (NetSat) - a novel classifier-independent, white-box, non-targeted adversarial attack. It aims to ‘saturate’ the final convolutional feature maps with introduced patterns and thus - make the network unable to provide reasonable predictions. Classifier-independence results in samples with predictions further away from the true label and high flexibility of the method. To assess its harmfulness, we propose Dissimilarity Metric (DM). It describes how far is the predicted label from the true one in the class space. The proposed methods, due to their simplicity, flexibility and practicality, are suitable for testing of real-life systems.

Among others, it is used in computer vision for object recognition, and in natural language processing for the masked language modeling. All of these tasks are crucial for modern automatic and semi-automatic production facilities powered by Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), because they enable intelligent inspection, maintenance log analysis and operation control. Especially in such safety-critical domains, in which humans and machines often coexist, it is crucial to provide new methods that could help us understand the operation of these black-boxes. That is why we present a novel visual-analytic methods that can be used to examine how networks perceive relations/similarities between the known classes. Our methods operate solely on the trained models and do not require any data samples. They can also reveal some quality issues in the training datasets and indicate low model accuracy. Our methods are suitable for generic vision and language models, but can also be used in transfer learning scenarios. To empirically validate our approach in such a scenario, we conduct experiments on a state-of-the-art mobile vision model - MobileNetV2 - fine-tuned for vehicle classification.

Following this motivation, we introduce Hamiltonian-oriented homotopy QAOA (HOHo-QAOA), a heuristic method for combinatorial optimization using QAOA, based on classical homotopy optimization. The method consists of a homotopy map that produces an optimization problem for each value of the interpolating parameter. Therefore, HOHo-QAOA decomposes the optimization of QAOA into several loops, each using a mixture of the mixer and the objective Hamiltonian for cost function evaluation.

A questionnaire survey was conducted to gather expert opinions from the 3DP industry, followed by the application of Structural Equation Modeling and interviews for hypothesis testing and validation. In order to demonstrate the practicality of the suggested framework, a case study was undertaken on a full-scale residential building constructed using 3D printing in Germany. The results demonstrate that the finalized conceptual framework can assist in strategic decision-making to enhance the implementation of 3DP technology in specific projects and across the construction industry.

Addressing such challenges has become the focus of many researchers. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of several key issues related to ubiquitous sensing to aid in detecting MDD. Specifically, this article analyzes existing methodologies and feature extraction algorithms used to detect possible MDD through digital phenotyping from smartphone data. In particular, five types of features are summarized and explained, namely, location, movement, rhythm, sleep, and social and device usage.

Thus this paper presents a novel System-Wide Vulnerability Assessment (SWVA) framework based on Machine Learning, that can be frequently activated to assess the vulnerability of interconnected software components over edge systems. The performance of the SWVA framework is illustrated by assessing the vulnerability of 13 versions of a real-world 11 component software system, and comparing the ARNN results against the well-known ML models MLP, KNN, and Lasso. The results show the superior performance of SWVA, offering over 85% median accuracy and good scalability as the number of connected software components increases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","5f532814752340073806a95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"39","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"108-114","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2e","6821eb5afdbe8356e57d60eb","5f532814752340073806a95f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fc8","mniswId":"7922","title":"IEEE NETWORK","issn":"0890-8044","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"976db909-e6b6-4b3d-977f-a9448e0f5961"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6821eb5afdbe8356e57d60ea","year":"2025","volume":"39","number":"2","documentHash":"a4ad084a-1628-477a-a3d3-c70949371d4d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655094023"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68233b41fdbe83450161aadd","name":"Krzysztof A.","lastName":"Cyran","documentHash":"1b5ce58f-43f2-47df-900a-26e9a1d40cbb"},{"objectId":"68233b41fdbe83450161aadc","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Wereszczynski","documentHash":"a7407335-39c2-45cf-81af-9cd1ff962fdc"},{"objectId":"68233b41fdbe83450161aadb","name":"Valery","lastName":"Nkemeni","documentHash":"11cb8a31-55fe-4a04-91ec-c26433e6e142"},{"objectId":"68233b41fdbe83450161aada","name":"Onyeka J.","lastName":"Nwobodo","documentHash":"6bc2048f-d041-4317-9f4b-3e0610a590d8"},{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","name":"Godlove","lastName":"Kuaban","uuid":"EC7E7F9A13DA2FF8F55E44B4B99C3C2F1E000A81058C127DFD5262D301424BA1EA9459DEA4307FD055980254A4F03934B883B243B8F00D784E1B548726F9EF79","documentHash":"caa3d804-e4e6-493c-b7ad-e9ff4795b04e"}],"objectId":"68233b41fdbe83450161aad8","doi":"10.1109/tc.2025.3566901","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/12/4358213/10985765.pdf?arnumber=10985765","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"A Hybrid Adaptive Filter for Head Tracking in Augmented Reality (AR)-based Flight Simulators","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a novel approach for head tracking in augmented reality (AR) flight simulators using an adaptive fusion of Kalman and particle filters. This fusion dynamically balances the strengths of both algorithms, leveraging Kalman filters for computational efficiency and particle filters for handling non-linearities based on real-time factors such as sensor noise and head movement patterns. Our method demonstrates superior tracking precision and reduced latency, making it particularly effective for immersive pilot training in AR-based flight simulations. While focused on flight simulation, our approach holds high potential for broader applications in other AR and virtual reality (VR) environments where precise, real-time head tracking is crucial. These results provide actionable design guidance for developers optimizing tracking systems in environments that require fast response times and high accuracy. Future extensions of this research could explore the generalization of our approach across diverse AR applications, including human-computer interaction (HCI), medical simulations, and gaming."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65387daa40e3ff51d520310e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68233b41fdbe83450161aada","65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","68233b41fdbe83450161aadb","68233b41fdbe83450161aadc","68233b41fdbe83450161aadd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fe9","mniswId":"7963","title":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","issn":"0018-9340","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"479b5d4d-e120-4014-88b0-8ac7bf0323c0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68233b41fdbe83450161aad9","year":"2025","documentHash":"7c629ac0-f512-4384-b495-4967f23c34a0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655094091"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68233e87fdbe83450162e606","name":"Zheng","lastName":"Yan","documentHash":"e23ad975-3fd0-42c0-a1b3-de4dccfd23a0"},{"objectId":"68233e87fdbe83450162e605","name":"Jie","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"2233d56d-01b4-4d60-8b15-9b49d840f6eb"},{"objectId":"68233e87fdbe83450162e604","name":"Tingxi","lastName":"Luo","documentHash":"4cb62318-c79f-4873-ba4e-2ecfc204b116"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2e","name":"Erol","lastName":"Gelenbe","uuid":"A1531F8E2965B1D0B04E49D729C7F45AFDCB30DACD5DA8495603AB0136AED5F2BBC8EE4F5B488C468703C235421693C3A30A0AA3C25064AB571CCCC1A7EC2B20","documentHash":"8e4c859c-1526-4b76-9a53-71f71641e614"}],"objectId":"68233e87fdbe83450162e602","doi":"10.1109/mnet.2025.3551068","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx8/65/7593428/10925363.pdf?arnumber=10925363","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Graph Neural Networks for Trust Evaluation: Criteria, State-of-the-Art, and Future Directions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The process of quantifying trust considers the factors that affect it, which can be applied to identify malicious behavior, reduce uncertainty, and facilitate decision-making. Traditional trust evaluation methods based on statistics and reasoning, rely heavily on domain knowledge, which limits their practical applications. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a new Machine Learning (ML) paradigm that can revolutionize the evaluation of trust, by modeling relationships as graphs to simplify relevant data and automating end-to-end evaluation. Thus, a variety of GNN-based trust evaluation models have been developed for different applications. However, there is still a gap in the literature regarding a review on these advances with discussion about remaining challenges. To bridge this gap, we conduct the first review on GNN-based trust evaluation. We first propose a set of criteria in terms of trust-related attributes, correctness, functionality, and overhead. Then, we propose a taxonomy of existing GNN-based trust evaluation models, followed by a review using the proposed criteria to analyze their pros and cons. A quantitative analysis of the recent cutting-edge models is also provided. Based on the review and experimental results, we identify key challenges and suggest future research directions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68233e87fdbe83450162e604","68233e87fdbe83450162e605","68233e87fdbe83450162e606","6325312975234038513dfa2e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fc8","mniswId":"7922","title":"IEEE NETWORK","issn":"0890-8044","eissn":"1558-156X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"30af3f4d-343d-494e-b2b3-90710ccfebc6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68233e87fdbe83450162e603","year":"2025","documentHash":"5af9bdb7-46af-4c12-806e-92e6fa9695e8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655094493"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"682c50f6fdbe83156241d8f4","name":"Nikola","lastName":"Bešinović","documentHash":"2176dd1e-ca4b-45d0-9645-0497630eb27c"},{"objectId":"682c50f6fdbe83156241d8f3","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Krawiec","documentHash":"454aea5d-5b62-489e-ba4e-2edd55742250"},{"objectId":"682c50f6fdbe83156241d8f2","name":"Mátyás","lastName":"Koniorczyk","documentHash":"7bcff3b7-f07a-49c0-b7f5-5d7753f12c9c"},{"objectId":"61b6be387523402a58cb072e","name":"Ludmila  ","lastName":"Botelho ","uuid":"524597516C57E7FC8C2C71662169580586B1395273442F15F09C10C3E48890DCFBCCF5FBD130C9C7B1EC35C29FFB10C94CE737633840C02B147E6872EFC1164D","documentHash":"5fedaf18-ab6c-4c4c-9d37-c8961ddb1f1e"},{"objectId":"5e70946c878c28a0473bcc1a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Domino","uuid":"CA9728FF4DE4C64ED7452CC84E2C9FA5A4B954B211AB6AC7375C427567DA859A9FA7C2633E6FDD3147DA0343C6BEBE5E46B83E70571CF5120C82D77C5745B899","orcidId":"0000-0001-7386-5441","documentHash":"ea82a803-78b7-40f1-84a6-a858acb10900"}],"objectId":"682c50f6fdbe83156241d8f0","doi":"10.1016/j.jrtpm.2025.100521","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2210970625000186?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Solving rescheduling problems in heterogeneous urban railway networks using hybrid quantum–classical approach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We address the applicability of a hybrid quantum–classical heuristics for practical railway rescheduling management problems.

The mechanism uses distributed communication, where drones share information about their positions and planned trajectories to predict and avoid collisions. The proposed mechanism enables drones to autonomously cooperate and maintain safe distances in complex scenarios. It is based on the concept of repulsion vectors. The avoidance response is determined by the level of immersion in the protective sphere of obstacles, including other drones. The advantage of the algorithm lies in its simplicity and low computational complexity, allowing it to be used even in small and inexpensive drones. The algorithm was tested in a developed simulation environment, created to handle swarms of over 20 drones and to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed solution. Two scenarios were analyzed: (i) two swarms, each with nine drones, flying on a collision course; (ii) a swarm of 25 drones changing formation. The results showed that the mechanism is effective in avoiding collisions, maintaining safe distances and adapting to changing conditions. The proposed mechanism represents a significant advancement in swarm coordination, offering a robust and scalable solution for real-world applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fabc8b8085dcb5a2b98d9c0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1141","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["680f6a8cfdbe83659c86307a","5fabc8b8085dcb5a2b98d9c0","680f6a8cfdbe83659c86307b","680f6a8cfdbe83659c86307c","680f6a8cfdbe83659c86307d","680f6a8cfdbe83659c86307e","680f6a8cfdbe83659c86307f","680f6a8cfdbe83659c863080"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747865980536"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659fb2d540970707a1291830","name":"Germán","lastName":"Vidal","documentHash":"3df19b60-27ef-4cb1-a642-2392dce350b6"},{"objectId":"659fb2d540970707a129182f","name":"Irek","lastName":"Ulidowski","documentHash":"afc0d3a1-ceba-406f-9597-de820a74fa04"},{"objectId":"659fb2d540970707a129182e","name":"Iain","lastName":"Phillips","documentHash":"2f458eea-49ed-46f0-b034-c8e16bd63b73"},{"objectId":"659fb2d540970707a129182d","name":"Claudio Antares","lastName":"Mezzina","documentHash":"3e3f1c43-72dd-4d07-ba60-ddf270e60749"},{"objectId":"659fb2d540970707a129182c","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Lanese","documentHash":"7ab8ae19-46ad-41c2-b08b-8efe5c4298c7"},{"objectId":"659fb2d540970707a129182b","name":"Robert","lastName":"Glück","documentHash":"950e6b3d-022d-406c-bf9f-d085c11fbc2c"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a85c8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"6ABE028B429746E75B9EC583A913E9D235F3C4E04BFA0014569AB32D9CBA0134018B842F651620F8DCD7D896EE3554BB8E24B50560C065A97D27F17EE083FDF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8790-101X","documentHash":"2c77c026-eec3-4aa7-89d5-2d278e812544"}],"objectId":"659fb2d540970707a129182a","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-38100-3_3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-38100-3_3","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Towards a Taxonomy for Reversible Computation Approaches","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Reversible computation is a paradigm allowing computation to proceed not only in the usual, forward direction, but also backwards.

Also, it has found applications in areas as different as low-power computing, debugging, simulation, robotics, database design, and biochemical modeling. Thus, while the broad idea of reversible computation is the same in all the areas, it has been interpreted and adapted to fit the various settings.

Utilizing numerical experiments, the study analyzes the influence of vacation duration, initial buffer state, arrival intensity, and processing rate on the departure process. This enables the understanding of system recovery dynamics, particularly in how critical infrastructures can be optimized for resilience against disruptions. Results reveal significant dependencies between these parameters and the transient behaviour of the queueing system. Notably, the service speed parameter demonstrates the most substantial influence on the mean number of processed packets, followed by the arrival rate. Conversely, variations in vacation duration and initial packet count exhibit comparatively minor effects on system behaviour. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of departure processes in finite-buffer queue systems with batch arrivals and multiple vacation policies, offering implications for system optimization, performance enhancement strategies, and resilience assessment in the face of potential system failures or disasters"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709384878c28a0473abc53"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709384878c28a0473abc53","682342a7fdbe8345016470d3","651f712a40e3ff22d348dce6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677fc7b7fdbe831a91d64526","year":"2025","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"41689a60-19d6-4a7b-b2cc-eed6fe48f85b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747952398612"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67850ac4fdbe831a380b4f7d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kukuczka","documentHash":"51649486-53c4-4327-9ba2-804665bebf26"},{"objectId":"65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","name":"Godlove","lastName":"Kuaban","uuid":"EC7E7F9A13DA2FF8F55E44B4B99C3C2F1E000A81058C127DFD5262D301424BA1EA9459DEA4307FD055980254A4F03934B883B243B8F00D784E1B548726F9EF79","documentHash":"caa3d804-e4e6-493c-b7ad-e9ff4795b04e"},{"objectId":"617373a97523400564d23048","name":"Onyeka","lastName":"Nwobodo","uuid":"305B3EB1428FCBABD0BD01BC47EE5348AD6F52A6EFA689C0D0ED1152071041DFA6A00C813329F0E9B2448326B0A1B908EB907F79DF4E918D5F65DE22488C0AE5","documentHash":"4aabdb37-9fe3-4d60-bfe5-dc1d5c45cd1e"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad051","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Wereszczyński","uuid":"6221E82AB2F14AAD100CAFC7AEF267C069CCC9F2A684F5C75272D7A6FBB5CA67F4CEC33F1E8C7D0B37A7744CA733DE49F7E67CF8D03C30C1420931B219B8387D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1686-472X","documentHash":"e0ee0201-895a-4c15-afdc-dc0e45ecc006"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a047390518","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Cyran","uuid":"64C3CD054FCE9AC3368DC942EF5858C91A15F89F42B9A708DF272FB904BADB614ADFFEF9F53242168A2BFDA4EBBE01AEDCEB2EA7AA7DF6E5EB38347E177915FC","orcidId":"0000-0003-1789-4939","documentHash":"a805aad6-4e4c-441a-a63e-b251c355cb05"}],"objectId":"6784f6a0fdbe831a380ad2be","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-63783-4_16","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-63783-4_16","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Analysis of marker and SLAM-based tracking for advanced augmented reality (AR)-based flight simulation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Augmented reality (AR)-based flight simulation reshapes how pilots are trained, offering an immersive environment where commercial and fighter pilots can be trained at low cost with minimal use of fuel and safety concerns. This study conducts a pioneering comparative analysis of marker-based tracking and SLAM technologies within the Microsoft HoloLens 2 platform, mainly focusing on their efficacy in landing manoeuvre simulations. Our investigation incorporates an experimental setup where marker-based tracking overlays interactive video tutorials onto a simulated cockpit, enhancing the realism and effectiveness of landing procedures. The experiment demonstrates that marker-based systems ensure high precision within 5 cm and 15 cm from the HoloLens 2 camera, proving indispensable for procedural training that requires exact overlay precision. Conversely, the native SLAM algorithm, while lacking the same level of precision, offers flexibility and adaptability by accurately mapping the cockpit and superimposing virtual information in dynamic, markerless conditions. The study juxtaposes these technologies, revealing a trade-off between precision and adaptability, and suggests an integrative approach to leverage their respective strengths. Our findings provide pivotal insights for developers and training institutions to optimize AR flight simulation training, contributing to advanced, immersive pilot training programs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709221878c28a047390518","617373a97523400564d23048","5e709392878c28a0473ad051","67850ac4fdbe831a380b4f7d"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65387daa40e3ff51d520310e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"208-222","conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157418c4","mniswId":"952","fullName":"International Conference on Computational Science","shortName":"ICCS","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"9690889e-bedf-4a40-a0bf-ea4bccddb401"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6684f348fdbe83043b595588","startDate":"2024-07-02","endDate":"2024-07-04","fullName":"24th International Conference on Computational Science – ICCS 2024","shortName":"ICCS 2024","city":"Malaga","country":"ES","website":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-63778-0","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"b6f8816d-c612-4d89-87be-8f3320d3dd62"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["617373a97523400564d23048","5e709392878c28a0473ad051","5e709221878c28a047390518","65387daa40e3ff51d520310e","67850ac4fdbe831a380b4f7d"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748558093312"}]
