Here, an account of these new developments is given and placed in reference to earlier pivotal works that underpin the field. First, we discuss new approaches to the synthesis of new triptycenes. Progress in the regioselective synthesis of sterically demanding systems is discussed. The application of triptycenes in catalysis is also presented. Next, progress in the understanding of the relations between triptycene structures and their properties is discussed. The unique properties of triptycenes in the liquid and solid states are elaborated. Unique interactions, which involve triptycene molecular scaffolds, are presented. Molecular interactions within a triptycene unit, as well as between triptycenes or triptycenes and other molecules, are also evaluated.

However, the effect of electrode-pore-size distribution on their energy storage properties remains unclear. Here, we develop a model for the charging of electrical double layers inside a cylindrical pore for arbitrary pore size. We assume small applied potentials and perform a regular perturbation analysis to predict the evolution of electrical potential and ion concentrations in both the radial and axial directions. We validate our perturbation model with direct numerical simulations of the Poisson–Nernst–Planck equations, and obtain quantitative agreement between the two approaches for small and moderate potentials. Our analysis yields two main characteristic features of arbitrary pore size: (i) a monotonic decrease of the charging timescale with an increase in relative pore size (pore size relative to Debye length); (ii) large potential changes for overlapping double layers in a thin transition region, which we approximate mathematically by a jump discontinuity. We quantify the contributions of electromigration and charge diffusion fluxes, which provide mechanistic insights into the dependence of charging timescale and capacitance on pore size. We develop a modified transmission circuit model that captures the effect of arbitrary pore size and demonstrate that a time-dependent transition-region resistor needs to be included in the circuit. We also derive phenomenological expressions for average effective capacitance and charging timescale as a function of pore-size distribution. We show that the capacitance and charging timescale increase with smaller average pore sizes and with smaller polydispersity, resulting in a gain of energy density at a constant power density. Overall, our results advance the mechanistic understanding of electrical-double-layer charging."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709459878c28a0473bb067"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"198-213","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61dd4ac92467f047f39fd809","61dd4ac92467f047f39fd80b","5e709459878c28a0473bb067"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547979e","mniswId":"18664","title":"Soft Matter","issn":"1744-683X","eissn":"1744-6848","documentHash":"bbdb4708-4eef-4305-9152-1191418727e5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dd4ac92467f047f39fd80e","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"1","documentHash":"67f6f711-b312-49b6-bfe2-0868ae47c923"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057975772"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d81ed92467f030c1a2b724","name":"Poul Erik","lastName":"Hansen","orcidId":"0000-0003-4751-9910","documentHash":"9d8ac18c-e25a-46f7-9a87-fc7cd601990a"},{"objectId":"61d81ed92467f030c1a2b723","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Waluk","orcidId":"0000-0001-5745-583X","documentHash":"8583ec67-2bc3-4d82-913e-e4685edf6dca"},{"objectId":"61d81ed92467f030c1a2b722","name":"Fritz","lastName":"Duus","documentHash":"cf95a4ff-1c80-4f6b-b428-d7d8a212d8c6"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfad1","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Pietrzak","uuid":"E8DF04DDCA10F855E190706F16473F2B981BC9AA81EE0C3B070AB01793F51E14AD955B1BE8F2FE714F6EABFE19FB821C719E12438C3ECD3B6BD5A272D1E02B74","orcidId":"0000-0002-0419-5613","documentHash":"17531e24-84bb-4e32-b43f-456e7518d073"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af747","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Buczyńska","uuid":"C7CB8B5B63E47FC0C996C50F10AC067F95EFF2BBF4ACBCAFE56AEC10BAC190F58A3C924B3A96B366E0BA22A937029E66FDB9699C9B75B4B3A53A04356B2BE533","orcidId":"0000-0003-0142-2128","documentHash":"414a36fd-4b65-460b-935a-387c9cf8a3d9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2021-12-23","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61d81ed92467f030c1a2b71f","doi":"10.1039/d1ra09020h","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/RA/D1RA09020H","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Photoinduced and ground state conversions in a cyclic β-thioxoketone","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The photochemistry of a cyclic beta-thioxoketone (2-methyl-1-(2-thioxycyclohexyppropan-1-one (MTPO)) is investigated by NMR, UV, and IR experiments supported by DFT calculations.

This is followed by a transfer of the isopropyl methine proton onto the carbonyl carbon resulting in yet another enethiol isomer (4).

Understanding this behavior is essential for the optimal design of supercapacitors. Herein, we perform constant-potential molecular dynamics simulations to reveal asymmetric features of porous supercapacitors and their effects on capacitance and charging dynamics. Our simulations show that, counterintuitively, charging dynamics can be fast in pores providing slow ion diffusion and vice versa. Unlike electrodes with single-size pores, multi-pore electrodes show overcharging and accelerated co-ion desorption, which can be attributed to the subtle interplay between the dynamics and charging mechanisms. We find that capacitance and charging dynamics correlate with how the ions respond to an applied cell voltage in the cathode and anode. We demonstrate that symmetrizing this response can help boost power density, which may find practical applications in supercapacitor optimization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"95-104","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61db38632467f06059371bb7","61db38632467f06059371bb8","61db38632467f06059371bb9","61db38632467f06059371bbb","5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f0f6","mniswId":"27808","title":"Green Energy & Environment","issn":"2096-2797","eissn":"2468-0257","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3d8908e0-9e8c-47fb-acad-0398453ef4af"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61db38632467f06059371bbd","year":"2022","volume":"7","number":"1","documentHash":"66289799-9888-41c3-a202-77caae25d2db"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058021603"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602f6ea29543c7410626f49a","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Cędrowski","uuid":"58693ED5AC7A8E4A4430788A7E0F9903B8CFC75C4B58A3082B4F66B61E9856BB858C32D357D51FD7D509148E1D01F3DF6C3C51E1AB38796344DF4D22D44D09E6","documentHash":"7172b5ea-7601-4792-b4dd-ed1430b6a7fa"},{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6c1a","name":"Kajetan","lastName":"Dąbrowa","uuid":"7FD6A0CDFAC426F893391E900551CAF333A2D8D446A1EFFCE02FB1873739E85849EC0494281470E6498AA5065FC7DEC5CCA1FA6B457B1708DFD7AD06BF4CFABB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7767-5303","documentHash":"2d287c47-6252-46a3-ba42-7173308e4ae2"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"ZIMNICKA","uuid":"A55C0BB9A722626ED739F12F4A22CDE94CB1EC75940370352BA67451BC7314661DB3D1A87480093FDCC4D5E9D484F65E0D59586A06E48D96DBAE154A187AC197","orcidId":"0000-0001-5078-4374","documentHash":"fb860716-0b74-492f-b357-d38392a505cd"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739afe8","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ceborska","uuid":"CB30641AAF77DFA8E639793BDC2762D222CFD4DBE0666125F3E8142124E0954730F2AB4F572C86CA324225062A2B0720740FFB1DEF0C822882B617A9CCC6DE01","orcidId":"0000-0001-5555-771X","documentHash":"adb472dc-10c5-4156-9d5f-86262530e9c4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-11-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"61de9d872467f0772e42e2bd","doi":"10.1016/j.molstruc.2021.131904","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022286021020263?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Hydrogen-bonded supramolecular assemblies of folic acid with simple hexoses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Simple D-hexoses such as D-glucose, D-mannose, and D-galactose were found to form supramolecular complexes with folic acid (FA) in phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS, pH 7.4) and in the gas phase.

enzyme-like properties, are a promising alternative to natural enzymes. In particular, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs, with the general formula MX2, where M represents a transition metal and X is a chalcogen element)-based nanozymes have demonstrated exceptional potential in the healthcare and diagnostic sectors. TMDCs have different enzymatic properties due to their unique nano-architecture, high surface area, and semiconducting properties with tunable band gaps. Furthermore, the compatibility of TMDCs with various chemical or physical modification strategies provide a simple and scalable way to engineer and control their enzymatic activity. Here, we discuss recent advances made with TMDC-based nanozymes for biosensing and therapeutic applications.

Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, has recently emerged as a powerful technology in optoelectronic devices for the prediction of various properties and rational design of materials. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been at the centre of attraction owing to their outstanding photophysical properties and rapid development in solar cell application. Therefore, the application of ML in the field of MHPs is also getting much attention to optimize the fabrication process and reduce the cost of processing. Here, we comprehensively reviewed different applications of ML in the designing of both MHP absorber layers as well as complete perovskite solar cells (PSCs). At the end, the challenges of ML along with the possible future direction of research are discussed. We believe that this review becomes an indispensable roadmap for optimizing materials composition and predicting design strategies in the field of perovskite technology in the future.

A sufficiently high constant potential was applied to the working electrode to commence the initiator decomposition that resulted in gelation. Under hydrodynamic conditions, this initiation allowed preparing different morphology microgels at room temperature. Importantly, neither heating nor UV-light illumination was needed to initiate the polymerization. Moreover, thin films of the cross-linked gel were anchored on different core substrates, including silica and magnetic nanoparticles. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy imaging confirmed the microgel particles' and films' irregular shape and porous structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated that the core coating with the microgel film was successful. Dynamic light scattering measured the micrometer size of gel particles with different combinations of acrylic monomers. Thermogravimetric analysis and the first-derivative thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the microgels' thermal stability of different compositions was different. Fourier-transform infrared and C-13 NMR spectroscopy showed successful copolymerization of the main, functional, and cross-linking monomers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","6153cfa99543c7051ff01dbe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"4","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"452-462","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","6153cfa99543c7051ff01dbe","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f09d","mniswId":"27716","title":"ACS Applied Polymer Materials","eissn":"2637-6105","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e5c49000-93d8-4d9b-b7a8-58ef76a365db"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"624d887e2467f063114e32bd","year":"2022","volume":"4","number":"1","documentHash":"a14dbe3e-bc1b-4334-a849-d8039e4fdc34"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058092395"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"624d87b02467f063114e315e","name":"Hung-Yin","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"e4c2288d-53c2-4d1b-bece-a7777ed5da3c"},{"objectId":"624d87b02467f063114e315b","name":"Chu-Yun","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"468547e8-3eb3-498a-9707-79ed425e689b"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","name":"Piyush","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"E13DBE297A73F2ACA1DA7F32D373EDA5FB882AC5C4DDE593B81140BAD5BD6DA80677830414B610AFC144957EF4E20FF1A8CC4A4F5367FEC382ACC689DAE8CD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-7729-8314","documentHash":"d3733567-ec08-40ae-9d79-439c8d659f9e"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kałęcki","uuid":"9A55E22434DE512B22E198C0B70313B1365F26049E72E1BEBEFB40B80D4C4235D1A7C0767203F64C4058B1644E52242BC2E4377385480C13AED4B622364A7FC1","orcidId":"0000-0002-4286-2085","documentHash":"f71fc73f-c75c-4cde-bb90-86a86989d73c"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Borowicz","uuid":"D63B2D1CBAA9D153E2BD617283D505E334189960BF43C306B6800911E131A1DC46163DC826D5DBC9591F08210F55027FACEF450EFC439AC7D859B7E08287470B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6440-3568","documentHash":"a3264215-d1bb-4319-b51d-735971fa60f0"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7a","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Iskierko","uuid":"9FCFC93AE5A50E69179361D4EAE7782CD6D7F261518C22DBFF7486EF3D98E9191E307D8B0847C381D5BC32C36FD404E41FE293B3A42EBB96B4C4265C760D751E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3141-6626","documentHash":"544e1c71-88f8-4bcb-97f9-fc88d9795770"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff4b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Noworyta","uuid":"8C310206E42F55B812232B3EBF76443A9FDA17420C33C5B6AF767DE0B155C9253089E21C7DD54147D5DFC80566C7E17F99C332200C11E4D2172D349C9F2FC241","orcidId":"0000-0002-9883-1288","documentHash":"224120f6-17a8-4e7c-beb0-2b733bd0bcb8"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d37f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bartołd","uuid":"8D5C3D45BA4E8774ACCA1DD862DE5BE65F03FF42A7A9F500D763B0C25B5C1EFBF57C3B0925AA5DADCA7E2B940CE1F72783841AE4101CA911241FEC21E8554B45","documentHash":"d57e10bd-4c7b-44f0-bb12-8fc4b2b137af"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Kutner","uuid":"4DB1E113A4C8683FB6BC69134920B86E44C946E3D21F32F5F6CE1483179976E11B16608F3E02B532633CFF5B5216E4C96C7B94090438FDEA74135F1AE4F3BCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-5170","documentHash":"71f3755a-d420-46be-bb05-d5ea4b0bfa7c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"624d87b02467f063114e3155","doi":"10.1016/j.bios.2022.114203","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0956566322002433?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Molecularly imprinted polymer-based extended-gate field-effect transistor (EG-FET) chemosensor for selective determination of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) protein","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A conducting molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film was integrated with an extended-gate field-effect transistor (EG-FET) transducer to determine epitopes of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) protein biomarker of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) selectively. Most suitable epitopes for imprinting were selected with Basic Local Alignment Search Tool software. From a pool of MMP-1 epitopes, the two, i.e., MIAHDFPGIGHK and HGYPKDIYSS, the relatively short ones, most promising for MMP-1 determination, were selected, mainly considering their advantageous outermost location in the protein molecule and stability against aggregation. MIPs templated with selected epitopes of the MMP-1 protein were successfully prepared by potentiodynamic electropolymerization and simultaneously deposited as thin films on electrodes. The chemosensors, constructed of MIP films integrated with EG-FET, proved useful in determining these epitopes even in a medium as complex as a control serum. The limit of detection for the MIAHDFPGIGHK and HGYPKDIYSS epitope was ~60 and 20 nM, respectively.

Pigs and other wild and domestic animals are reservoirs for these bacteria. Infection is usually spread to humans by ingestion of contaminated food. Yersiniosis is considered a rare disease, but recent studies indicate that it is overlooked in the diagnostic process therefore the infections with this bacterium are not often identified. Reliable diagnosis of Yersiniosis by culturing is difficult due to the slow growth of the bacteria easily overgrown by other more rapidly growing microbes unless selec-tive growth media is used. Phage adhesins recognizing bacteria in a specific manner can be an excellent diagnostic tool, es-pecially in the diagnosis of pathogens difficult for culturing. In this study, it was shown that Gp17, the tail fiber protein (TFP) of phage φYeO3-12, specifically recognizes only the pathogenic <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i> serotype O:3 (YeO:3) bacteria. The ELISA test used in this work confirmed the specific interaction of this protein with YeO:3 and demonstrated a promising tool for developing the pathogen recognition method based on phage adhesins."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dead","uid":"byot1zGR6DaDBaUruYE9Eyg","uuid":"264294d6-d6d7-4b7e-93b6-8f267f0a455e","name":"Instytut Immunologii i Terapii Doświadczalnej im.

Cyclin D2 knockout (cD2-KO) mice exhibit reduced numbers of new hippocampal neurons; however, the proliferation deficiency and the dysregulation of adult neurogenesis in the SVZ required further investigation. In this report, we characterized the differentiation potential of each subpopulation of the SVZ neural precursors in cD2-KO mice. The number of newly generated cells in the SVZs was significantly decreased in cD2-KO mice compared to wild type mice (WT), and was not accompanied by elevated levels of apoptosis. Although the number of B1-type quiescent precursors (B1q) and the overall B1-type activated precursors (B1a) were not affected in the SVZ neurogenic niche, the number of transit-amplifying progenitors (TaPs) was significantly reduced. Additionally, the subpopulations of calbindin D28k and calretinin interneurons were diminished in the olfactory bulbs of cD2-KO mice. Our results suggest that cyclin D2 might be critical for the proliferation of neural precursors and progenitors in the SVZ-the transition of B1a into TaPs and, thereafter, the production of newly generated interneurons in the olfactory bulbs. Untangling regulators that functionally modulate adult neurogenesis provides a basis for the development of regenerative therapies for injuries and neurodegenerative diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

In the proposed procedure, oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes were used both as components and oxidant agents in the formed composite material, which eliminated the use of conventional oxidizing agents such as ferric chloride. The properties and morphology of composite materials depend on the synthesis conditions, such as monomer concentration, synthesis time and synthesis temperature. The composite material is much more stable at high temperatures than pristine polyazulene. Additionally, the electrochemical performance of composite materials is better than that of pure polymeric materials. The highest specific capacitance of the ox-MWCNT/PAZ composite equals 381 F gPAZ−1. This value is approximately 5 times higher than the specific capacitance of pristine polyazulene. This high value results from the larger surface area of the composite material and its easier penetration by counterions of the supporting electrolyte during the oxidation process. Apart from the traditional doping process by counterions, the composite material is additionally codoped by hexafluorophosphate anions of the supporting electrolyte, which form hydrogen bonds with surface hydroxyl groups of ox-MWCNTs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f82d","uid":"baM7_bWGivADreGHZOXP9TA","uuid":"f30e0713-62f4-48d4-adfd-229566974a34","name":"Wydział Chemii (od 1.10.2019 r.)","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709213878c28a04738f86f","5e709213878c28a04738f865","5e709213878c28a04738f867","5e709213878c28a04738f870","5e709213878c28a04738f869"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709490878c28a0473bf93e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"169","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"20572","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709213878c28a04738f869","5e709213878c28a04738f867","5e709213878c28a04738f870","5e709213878c28a04738f865","5e709213878c28a04738f86f","5e709490878c28a0473bf93e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b23","mniswId":"12888","title":"JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY","issn":"0013-4651","documentHash":"720db308-b0bb-4cfd-88fd-4d13ffa9a083"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"622754fd2467f06c17656299","year":"2022","volume":"169","number":"2","documentHash":"bb7d9df3-d283-450a-854b-f2af6ec9af09"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058120490"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6284954640970712d1b31b51","name":"Kasim","lastName":"Ocakoglu","documentHash":"0b53ade5-7e9a-49a9-8138-600f1d7d6b5b"},{"objectId":"6284954640970712d1b31b4d","name":"C.

Recently, a powerful approach based on the electrografting of diazonium salts has attracted a great deal of attention due to its numerous technological advantages. Several studies on graphene-based materials reveal that the covalent attachment of aryl groups via the above approach could lead to additional beneficial properties of this versatile material. Here, we developed the covalently linked metalorganic wires on two transparent, cheap, and conductive materials: fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and FTO/single-layer graphene (FTO/SLG). The wires are terminated with nitrilotriacetic acid metal complexes, which are universal molecular anchors to immobilize His6-tagged proteins, such as biophotocatalysts and other types of redox-active proteins of great interest in biotechnology, optoelectronics, and artificial photosynthesis. We show for the first time that the covalent grafting of a diazonium salt precursor on two different electron-rich surfaces leads to the formation of the molecular wires that promote p-doping of SLG concomitantly with a significantly enhanced unidirectional cathodic photocurrent up to 1 μA cm–2. Density functional theory modeling reveals that the exceptionally high photocurrent values are due to two distinct mechanisms of electron transfer originating from different orbitals/bands of the diazonium-derived wires depending on the nature of the chelating metal redox center. Importantly, the novel metalorganic interfaces reported here exhibit minimized back electron transfer, which is essential for the maximization of solar conversion efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f082","uid":"b9SXTF1Zzo_eiHN0JX9AfyA","uuid":"951ff117-fef4-4ad2-81fa-149f6095a5a7","name":"Centrum Nowych Technologii UW","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af7be","5e709358878c28a0473a7a31","5e7094ba878c28a0473c2b25","5e7094d0878c28a0473c46b9","5e7094ee878c28a0473c72cf","5e709359878c28a0473a7d68","6284954540970712d1b31b48"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","uid":"b6BkjFeIM7Ot5q0lVE0xCWg","uuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz -

Towards these directions and within the concept of circular (bio)economy, the development of efficient and sustainable catalytic processes is of paramount importance. Within this context, the design of novel catalysts play a key role, with carbon-based nanocatalysts (CnCs) representing one of the most promising class of materials. In this review, a wide range of CnCs utilized for biomass valorization towards valuable chemicals production, and for environmental remediation applications are summarized and discussed. Emphasis is given in particular on the catalytic production of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) from cellulose or starch-rich food waste, the hydrogenolysis of lignin towards high bio-oil yields enriched predominately in alkyl and oxygenated phenolic monomers, the photocatalytic, sonocatalytic or sonophotocatalytic selective partial oxidation of 5-HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran (DFF) and the decomposition of organic pollutants in aqueous matrixes. The carbonaceous materials were utilized as stand-alone catalysts or as supports of (nano)metals are various types of activated micro/mesoporous carbons, graphene/graphite and the chemically modified counterparts like graphite oxide and reduced graphite oxide, carbon nanotubes, carbon quantum dots, graphitic carbon nitride, and fullerenes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c34db59543c72336544454","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","5fc4b6f2085dcb1e6ae0b8c3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1679","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4b6f2085dcb1e6ae0b8c3","62c426e24097077bbdbf2507","62c426e24097077bbdbf2508","60c34db59543c72336544454","62c426e24097077bbdbf250a","62c426e24097077bbdbf250b","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","62c426e24097077bbdbf250d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f54","mniswId":"14744","title":"Nanomaterials","issn":"2079-4991","eissn":"2079-4991","documentHash":"96ecbef2-792b-444c-a82a-48b91bb0e235"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62beccfa4097077f6df0209d","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"12","number":"10","documentHash":"9148d92b-1b2e-49a0-b1fa-0c3eae4c4c5e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058146264"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeed","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Fiałkowski","uuid":"1C26E79E9EB8F34650F31105B6CF183CD092FEC5FF6880B2BE0052C47B15B5DCFC9882182D7FA3313C72FCBC5B1AE2D3E1915CED064C74CD21663F9D21F32AAB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1529-2539","documentHash":"8aa183e2-f661-4718-bf0e-a59b7091f68f"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Bończak","uuid":"C9CF64DD69F437F68ADC88042449758EDAB0FBFED5919D083B81D041CD3175B9BC73BF8CE3BD3EED7552EAC50D2AF5BA1D0980E854B77D4C1C7A5C1D2261D966","orcidId":"0000-0002-6581-7420","documentHash":"21268306-0066-4e34-8b95-4b97a81ec913"}],"objectId":"62c587b54097074de2285155","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c00084","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c00084","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Donor–Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts for Stimuli-Responsive Self-Assembly of Gold Nanoparticles into Semiconducting Thin Films","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recent advancements in materials science andchemistry allowed the creation of intelligent, programmablematerials. The stimuli-responsive substances are the mostprominent candidates for developing sophisticated nanomachinery.Especially, photo- and thermoresponsive systems have gainedmuch attention in recent years as elegant solutions for drugtransportation, information storage, biomaterials, and materialengineering. However, to this day, only a limited number ofmolecular domains display triggered and reversible self-organ-ization at the water-oil interface. Among various substancesfunctionalized with responsive moieties, the donor-acceptorStenhouse adduct (DASA) stands out as an exciting but poorly explored tool in the toolbox of materials science. After beingilluminated with a green light, the compound changes its coloration and polarity. This state can be reversed by increasing thetemperature. The study presents the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated with a DASA-containing ligand that canundergo on-demand, light-triggered, and thermoreversible self-organization at the water-oil interface. The layer of the nanoparticleslocked at the interface can be successfully cross-linked, either by a dithiol molecule or via copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azidecycloaddition (CuAAC). The latter option results in a composite with semiconducting properties. The research has the potential toimpact the delivery systems for catalysis and the development of programmable materials with electroactive properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeed"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"126","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"7096-7106","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffe0ead49b31ccece8421","title":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry.

However, N. sicca triggers a lesser effect than does N. gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, N. gonorrhoeae and N. sicca invoke distinct effects on the expression of genes (JUNB, FOSB, NFKB1, NFKBIA) encoding protein components of AP-1 and NF-kappa B transcription factors. We have also shown that the infection of epithelial cells by N. gonorrhoeae leads to significant overexpression of the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including MALAT1, ERICD, and RP11-510N19.5. This effect was not identified for N. sicca. In conclusion, data on the expression of lncRNAs and cytokine secretion in response to Neisseria spp. exposure indicate new directions for research on Neisseria host interactions and can provide further insights into virulence of not only pathogenic, but also commensal Neisseria spp."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fae2146085dcb5a2b98da14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7a4b","5fae2146085dcb5a2b98da14","5e709358878c28a0473a7bbd","5e709356878c28a0473a78ba"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"394","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fae2146085dcb5a2b98da14","5e709358878c28a0473a7a4b","5e709356878c28a0473a78ba","5e709358878c28a0473a7bbd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ceb6734097070a2ca4e995","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"4","documentHash":"0c982c56-9170-44af-9998-93818bf97b0b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058152690"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62e3a4a14097075e45d76bca","name":"Olga","lastName":"García Mancheño","orcidId":"0000-0002-7578-5418","documentHash":"375f3c6e-d267-48dc-a595-599e3008d25e"},{"objectId":"62e3a4a14097075e45d76bc8","name":"Vesna","lastName":"Milovanović","orcidId":"0000-0002-4297-7042","documentHash":"cb2d7ca8-10e0-40e3-ae0c-78501bd15f15"},{"objectId":"62e3a4a14097075e45d76bc7","name":"Niklas","lastName":"Lohmann","documentHash":"650686ab-39ba-4a23-abfe-411e1ed2c635"},{"objectId":"5f7fe1bf085dcb410a25ec01","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Piekarski","uuid":"F5E5FF3A1CB51FD4777481F2CA371F5634ADD22BE871796D8307482FB0308E27466B3E2B140F852481D5E1CE107FCDA3D209FE62D7107653F16582C8944B0EFF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1220-1902","documentHash":"c3744f05-548e-438a-9713-94d5cf27c6e4"}],"objectId":"62e3a4a14097075e45d76bc5","doi":"10.1039/d2ob00101b","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/OB/D2OB00101B","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Metal-free oxoammonium salt-mediated C(sp<sup>3</sup>)–H oxidative Ugi-azide multicomponent reaction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this work, an efficient oxidative C(sp3\n)–H Ugi-azide multicomponent reaction of cyclic benzylic amines\nto the corresponding α-tetrazolo compounds using a TEMPO salt as mild hydride abstractor-type oxidant\nis reported.

The morphological characterization using SEM images revealed that the composite had a heterogeneous flaky, plate-like surface appearance. Based on N-2 adsorption experiments and compared to the pristine biochar, the composite showed an increased specific surface area by 1.5 folds. The three-parameter Redlich Peterson isotherm model and two-parameter Temkin isotherm model were best fitted with R-2 = 0.998 and 0.997, respectively, both for the pristine biochar and the MSW-BC-MMT composite. Additionally, the kinetics was best described using the pseudo-second-order model, suggesting that OTC adsorption onto the composite takes place via chemisorption. A capacity of 233 mg g(-1) was observed for the MSW-BC-MMT, which is suggested to be predominantly governed by pi-pi electron donor-acceptor interactions, electrostatic attraction and surface complexation. As evidenced by FTIR results, OTC was presumed to be adsorbed via hydrogen bonding as well. The value addition of MSW by producing MSW-derived biochar is considered a favorable solution for solid waste management. Therefore, the production of the MSW-BC-MMT composite becomes useful due to its significance in acting as a simultaneous MSW management technique and a low-cost material for antibiotic OTC remediation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4b6f2085dcb1e6ae0b8c3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62e3d13d4097075e45d89e2b","62e3d13d4097075e45d89e2c","62e3d13d4097075e45d89e2d","5fc4b6f2085dcb1e6ae0b8c3","62e3d13d4097075e45d89e2f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb872","mniswId":"30179","title":"Sustainable Environment","issn":"2765-8511","eissn":"2765-8511","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"134ced0d-9e01-4e7e-8641-5457e4d0336c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e3d13d4097075e45d89e31","year":"2022","volume":"8","number":"1","documentHash":"0fd914e3-8b4f-4e86-91e6-ec6bc69a4156"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058162849"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"605d8c6e9543c745d80e5a88","name":"Frantisek","lastName":"Muzika","uuid":"A6D1238F4C2294DD23E90518DBE59F6DD4A87C5D40E0CEA5179C1CD2B8B435401248D08565D31854A8336D099C42C060A0DA9F0EFE21A95C557785D4E708BA20","orcidId":"0000-0001-9711-0385","documentHash":"268e5e69-31d7-4e3d-afa7-90a8a2a4a03c"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Górecki","uuid":"5C1C88BEF5066E9C3874BDB6264294C1392BD86C12A9F48FB84DCDF91ECC0D7892866EA7D364E14630DDA5138F0746E07B789269886028DCDB2ABF6BD86EA9B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4574-0083","documentHash":"95958b83-8129-419e-8027-969462b967a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62f0eb2d40970731f3eb5bbf","doi":"10.1007/s11144-022-02171-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11144-022-02171-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Identification of the best medium for experiments on chemical computation with Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction and ferroin-loaded Dowex beads","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Our study is focused on identification of the best medium for future experiments on information processing with Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction proceeding in Dowex beads with immobilized catalyst inside. The optimum medium should be characterized by long and stable nonlinear behavior, mechanical stability and should allow for control with electric potential. We considered different types of Dowex ion-exchange resins, bead distributions and various initial concentrations of substrates: malonic acid and 1,4-cyclohexanedione. The electric potential on platinum electrodes, stabilized by a potentiostat is used to control medium evolution. A negative electric potential generates activator species HBrO2 on the working electrode according to the reaction: BrO3- + 2e(-) + 3H(+) -> HBrO2 + H2O, while positive electric potential attracts inhibitor species Br- to the proximity of it. We study oscillation amplitude and period stability in systems with ferroin loaded Dowex 50W-X2 and Dowex 50W-X8 beads during experiments exceeding 16 h. It has been observed, that the above mentioned resins generate a smaller number of CO2 bubbles close to the beads than Dowex 50W-X4, which makes Dowex 50W-X2 and Dowex 50W-X8 more suitable for applications in chemical computing. We report amplitude stability, oscillation frequency, merging and annihilation of travelling waves in a lattice of Dowex 50W-X8 beads (mesh size 50-100) in over 19 h long experiments with equimolar solution of malonic acid and 1,4-cyclohexanedione. This system looks as a promising candidate for chemical computing devices that can operate for a day."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","605d8c6e9543c745d80e5a88"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"135","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1187-1209","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["605d8c6e9543c745d80e5a88","5e7092b4878c28a04739b050"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794d0","mniswId":"17046","title":"Reaction Kinetics Mechanisms and Catalysis","issn":"1878-5190","eissn":"1878-5204","documentHash":"dac27cd0-18e5-42b5-85cb-0a9f8e8f6a4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f0eb2d40970731f3eb5bc0","year":"2022","volume":"135","number":"3","documentHash":"cf9f0f1d-5e24-4d36-8274-63efebcb6ca7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058165538"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a60","name":"Neerish","lastName":"Revaprasadu","documentHash":"5f05edf9-c3cf-4873-b81f-90bafca6bf0d"},{"objectId":"62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5f","name":"Ram K.","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"7973c43f-507c-4661-a2e6-4af71841275b"},{"objectId":"62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5e","name":"Wang","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"58a637b9-567a-4bfe-be87-4c7a99eeb761"},{"objectId":"62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5d","name":"Felipe M.","lastName":"de Souza","documentHash":"45787df9-147f-436d-90b9-59ee4ca9f95d"},{"objectId":"62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5c","name":"Siphamandla C.","lastName":"Masikane","documentHash":"e252d002-7710-4b9c-9ee5-0c2a463db9ef"},{"objectId":"62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5b","name":"Gwaza E.","lastName":"Ayom","documentHash":"de842cc8-75d8-4871-af4e-ffe503e9ea30"},{"objectId":"6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","name":"Malik","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"3F14D6BD4340633067804C270812A937F4E92325031BE1176142856E397CDDA3DE8C90CE8CB58D3FB67D87C91202A989955940DCCDD0BEF387B162A98B900235","orcidId":"0000-0002-3316-041X","documentHash":"b5f5ad91-b181-4281-9e6e-7bd70d906091"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-01-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a59","doi":"10.1039/d1se01866c","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/SE/D1SE01866C","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Phase transformations in the nickel phosphide system induced by transition-metal doping and their electro-catalytic study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nickel phosphide exists in various compositions, and the synthesis of pure-phase nickel phosphides is of immense interest due to their wide scale applications in different electrocatalytic reactions. We report the facile synthesis of nickel phosphides and rare transition metal-induced phase transformations within this system. Phase selective synthesis of pure Ni2P or Ni5P4 was achieved by decomposition of nickel acetate tetrahydrate Ni(AC)(2)center dot 4H(2)O in optimized mixed solvent systems, i.e., in tri-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO)/tri-n-octylphosphine (TOP) or hexadecylamine (HDA)/TOP, respectively, by hot injection route. The doping of 5% Cu or Mn in either of the nickel phosphide phases yielded a mixture of phases (Ni2P/Ni5P4). However, increasing the Cu or Mn content to 10% resulted in the complete transformation of phase, i.e., from Ni2P to pure Ni5P4 and vice versa. Lattice stress and size of incorporated dopants, as well as the nature of surfactants employed, were discussed as probable causes of these rare phase transformations. Moreover, in order to establish structure-activity relationship, we studied the comparative effect of transition metal dopants in both nickel rich and nickel deficient phases. Therefore, initially formed and transformed phosphides were investigated as electrocatalysts for overall water splitting and supercapacitance. NiP-5 (Ni2P formed on 10% Cu doping of Ni5P4) delivered a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with the lowest overpotential of 146 mV among all samples for HER while NiP-3 (Ni5P4 formed from Ni2P on 10% Cu doping) similarly required the least overpotential of 276 mV for the OER at the same current density. NiP-2 (pristine Ni5P4) had the highest calculated specific capacitance of 1325 F g(-1) at 2 A g(-1). These phase transformations resulted in better catalytic activity and stability as well as reaction kinetics indicating suitability in practical water splitting technologies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1319-1331","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5b","6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5c","62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5d","62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5e","62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5f","62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a60"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d419","mniswId":"19181","title":"Sustainable Energy Fuels","eissn":"2398-4902","websiteLink":"http://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/sustainable-energy-fuels/","documentHash":"604c5cf6-4bd5-4981-99f0-7f4b5dc53b75"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f0ed7940970731f3eb9a5a","year":"2022","volume":"6","number":"5","documentHash":"d1fc94cb-97ef-4158-91f2-98f3ec92de43"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058165895"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f0c3e840970731f3ea84cb","name":"Enrique","lastName":"Lomba","documentHash":"c0886d2a-219c-4cfc-9fc6-c36e3f42e0c4"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c59f1","name":"Carolina","lastName":"Cruz Cardona","uuid":"98D7DB49E536A49A977472CF15295322AB29430A735C89E41ED88C49BFFFD06D854581DAC1B7C34635D940F994D36D45F325D7F9122A2E698C8C798E02216440","orcidId":"0000-0002-6319-0740","documentHash":"c2ac3db7-51a0-4a82-85e9-b1b27f16ed7b"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","name":"Alina","lastName":"Ciach","uuid":"520AD5EF74AF15FA81FB18147E92D695E358B38A5F90389DF9A11C3C3623C0214250CFB548E34846D53DBA21ED79955D9F88250356F8AFEBD6A696B7263A658B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5556-401X","documentHash":"630645e8-c7ee-4652-a5a0-a0da6ec79d79"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-01-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62f0c3e840970731f3ea84ca","doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2021.117078","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S016773222101802X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Capacitance response and concentration fluctuations close to ionic liquid-solvent demixing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate the concentration fluctuations in a simple model of electrolyte (two positively and negatively charged Lennard-Jones spheres in a solution of an uncharged Lennard-Jones liquid) confined between electrodes formed by parallel graphene layers. Using constant potential molecular dynamics simulations and extensive constant charge simulations the effect of the proximity to the demixing transition on the electric double layers is analyzed and compared to the results of our continuum mean field theory. In agreement with our previous theoretical findings, we observe a considerable enhancement of the capacitance when temperature is lowered approaching the demixing transition for dilute ionic solutions. This enhancement is less visible when the ionic concentration is increased. Moreover, we observe the new shape of the capacitance, with a maximum at potential of zero charge, and symmetric maxima for positive and negative voltages. (c) 2021 The Authors.

In the present study, the excited-state dynamics of the E-alpha and E-beta isomers of a representative furylfulgide is modelled with the use of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, a pattern recognition algorithm is employed in order to automatically identify relaxation pathways, and to quantify the photoproduct distributions. The simulation results indicate that, despite differing only in the orientation of the furyl group, the two isomers show markedly different photochemical behaviour. The predominant E-alpha isomer undergoes photocyclisation with a quantum yield (QY) of 0.27 +/- 0.10. For this isomer, the undesired E -> Z photoisomerisation around the central double bond represents a minor side reaction, with a QY of 0.09 +/- 0.07. In contrast, the minority E-beta isomer, which is incapable of photocyclisation, undergoes efficient E -> Z photoisomerisation, with a QY as high as 0.56 +/- 0.14.

Late stages of such transitions, >1 ms, have been thoroughly studied. Yet, the initial ones are a matter of speculations. Here, we present the first observation of a sub-nanosecond stage of the coil-to-globule transition of poly (vinyl methyl ether), PVME, in water. Experiments: The detection of an early stage of the coil-to-globule transition has been possible thanks to a novel experimental approach - time-resolved elastic light scattering study, following an ultrafast temperature jump. We identified a molecular process active in the observed stage of the transition with use of broadband dielectric spectroscopy. Findings: In the experiment's time window, from a few ps to around 600 ps, we observed an increase in the light scattering intensity 300-400 ps after the temperature jump that heated the sample above its lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The observed time coincides with the time of segmental relaxation of PVME, determined by broadband dielectric spectroscopy in the temperature range of the LCST of the PVME/water mixture. This coincidence strongly suggests that the observed herein stage of coil-to-globule transition is the rapid formation of local nuclei along the polymer chain. Those nuclei may grow and aggregate in later stages of the process, which are out of our experimental time window. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Namely, the phase with a heavier hydrogen isotope, deuterium, has a higher critical temperature. Hydrides and deuterides of palladium have intensively been studied both experimentally and theoretically, but the origin of the isotope effect has not been established with certainty. The commonly accepted explanation is that the effect is likely to be due to the strong anharmonicity of the optical hy-drogen vibrations, which was considered to be responsible for the large deviation of the ratio of the fun-damental optical frequencies omega(H)/omega(D) = 1.51 from the harmonic value root 2 approximate to 1.41. In the present paper, powder samples of MoH1.1(1) and MoD1.07(3) were synthesized under a hydrogen/deuterium pressure of several gigapascals and studied by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) at ambient pressure and T = 10 K. The INS study demonstrated that optical vibrations of H atoms in MoH1.1 and D atoms in MoD1.07 are harmonic and the ratio of fundamental optical frequencies omega(H)/omega(D) = 1.44 is close to the harmonic value root 2 approximate to 1.41. This shows that anharmonicity is not a necessary condition for the presence of the inverse isotope effect. The MoD1.07 sample was additionally studied by neutron diffraction (ND) at ambient pressure and T = 100 K. In agree-ment with previous ND results for MoH1.2, the ND study of MoD1.07 showed that deuterium atoms occupied almost all octahedral interstitial sites in its hexagonal close-packed metal lattice and formed a NiAs-type crystal structure with the composition close to MoD. The overstoichiometric composition MoD1.07 of the deuteride is likely to result from a small fraction D/Mo similar to 0.07 of deuterium atoms partially occupying the tetrahedral interstices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921c878c28a0473900de"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"893","pagesFromTo":"162299","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["620cf2472467f01217ae34f4","620cf2472467f01217ae34f5","620cf2472467f01217ae34f6","620cf2472467f01217ae34f7","620cf2472467f01217ae34f8","620cf2472467f01217ae34f9","620cf2472467f01217ae34fa","620cf2472467f01217ae34fb","5e70921c878c28a0473900de"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478447","mniswId":"10084","title":"Journal of Alloys and Compounds","issn":"0925-8388","eissn":"1873-4669","documentHash":"12751826-2db5-44f0-bb8c-52b7f797beab"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34fe","year":"2022","volume":"893","documentHash":"fbdafb51-0a5e-453c-a313-dae5465c2d49"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058185915"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc935a","name":"Seckin","lastName":"Akin","orcidId":"0000-0001-9852-7246","documentHash":"aa5c9d97-9b99-4d35-933c-a7d981d7f7d4"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc9359","name":"Soumitra","lastName":"Satapathi","documentHash":"25a1f6ee-4f0a-4f3d-8dc4-14cb9349d906"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc9358","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Wlazło","documentHash":"abfb77c6-dedf-4e3b-9460-5fed194b6d99"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc9357","name":"Grzegorz Piotr","lastName":"Kołodziej","documentHash":"3ce0f6a3-2b8c-4710-95ef-f463c17d7f03"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc9355","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kot","documentHash":"ed5c596e-45a2-462e-8a3c-8feaf4c9c665"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc9354","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"b7c9abb0-e7a7-4382-955b-da0c698a7e08"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc9353","name":"Mohammad Mahdi","lastName":"Tavakoli","documentHash":"3f357fa5-c8ed-4b83-8644-51c4e38ebdd2"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc9350","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Szawcow","documentHash":"7290cf4e-4026-4324-a76d-b8b430c6f3df"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc934f","name":"Belkis","lastName":"Surucu","documentHash":"39f4c539-624f-476b-a129-4c7a1c9e178e"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc934e","name":"Veysel","lastName":"Ozkaya","documentHash":"4204684f-c8aa-43a8-9889-bf15e35f52c1"},{"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc934d","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Ostapko","documentHash":"e2620546-7c3c-4599-a784-17c7055378cb"},{"objectId":"60c301819543c723365439a6","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kruszyńska","uuid":"1F777AE05B68F47FCB90C9A543F50BFADEBC0C3E7A9D7AA41EEB4E98CFFF0E76E48911F3C0127FF5F1468ED98ECD75CF002FD533653E74BB57F4D6DC0AC1710C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5325-2496","documentHash":"62db7d6e-9c42-40c2-9924-e11570becb39"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Nikiforow","uuid":"E166453BA6868F48895D87A86E6702843A623A59A84923A7C78B7FFBB992983C7D95FE6E5E79D29AB2127112DC3887B27E8FB1E44DE4688F1367FD5EA5783F74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6135-8514","documentHash":"c96f36f3-357e-4938-9d4c-83e71d392895"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-15","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62c3dab24097077bbdbc934b","doi":"10.1002/admi.202200575","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/admi.202200575","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Atomic Layer Engineering of Aluminum‐Doped Zinc Oxide Films for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been considered as an efficient method to deposit high quality and uniform thin films of various electron transport materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, the effect of deposition sequence in the ALD process of aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) films on the performance and stability of PSCs is investigated. Particularly, the surface of AZO film is terminated by diethylzinc (DEZ)/H2O (AZO-1) or trimethylaluminum (TMA)/H2O pulse (AZO-2), and investigated with surface-sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy technique. It is observed that AZO-2 significantly enhances the thermal stability of the upcoming methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI(3)) layer and facilitates charge transport at the interface as evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopes and favorable interfacial band alignment. Finally, planar-type PSC with AZO-2 layer exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 18.09% with negligible hysteresis and retains 82% of the initial efficiency after aging for 100 h under ambient conditions (relative humidity 40 +/- 5%).

The code porousGasificationFoam integrates gas flow through a porous media with the models of heterogeneous (drying, gasification, pyrolysis, solid combustion, precipitation) and homogeneous (gas combustion) chemical reactions. Inside porous media transport equations are formulated applying the spatial averaging methodology. The mass and enthalpy transfer between solid and gas phases is suitable for systems out of the thermal equilibrium. The convection and radiation modes of the heat transfer are included for gas and solid phases, and the immersed boundary technique is applied for the porous media inside the computational domain. We validate the elements of the model against a set of experimental and theoretical results. Amongst them, Thermogravimetric Analysis experiments of thermal conversions of two wooden particles: one of millimeter size the other of centimeter size. Simulations feature reaction schemes and physical parameters established in the literature. We show the influence of the porous media size on the gasification process.

The standard solid-state fabrication of ZTO requires prolonged heat treatment of zinc oxide and stannic oxide powders at around 1000 degrees C. The biggest drawback of this process is the evaporation of zinc oxide during the synthesis. We report an innovative and efficient mechanochemically supported solid-state approach to Li-doped ZTO synthesis with the implementation of a low-melting lithium hydroxide sintering aid, which offers a significant lowering of the sintering temperature down to 850 degrees C and time to 90 min, maintaining the high quality of the resulting Lidoped ZTO materials. The effect of sintering temperatures in the range 850-900 degrees C on photoluminescence characteristics of the ZTO materials was studied, and the PL spectra well corroborate with the XPS data and the presence of O as well as Zn or Sn vacancies. The band gap value of the resulting ZTO materials oscillated around 3.6 eV. Moreover, a comprehensive spectroscopic and microscopic examination of the optimized Li-doped ZTO materials provided more profound insight into its vacancy-mediated formation via liquid-phase sintering and its gradual advancement in the low-temperature regime of 850-900 degrees C. Additionally, the surface analysis of the selected highest quality materials enabled the determination of the Zn diffusion from the Li-doped ZTO lattice to its surface, expanding the knowledge of the diffusion-evaporation process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","5e709349878c28a0473a6788","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","5e709389878c28a0473ac382"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"4","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"2253-2263","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709389878c28a0473ac382","5e709349878c28a0473a6788","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","62c2ae0d40970721cb8ed606"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850c976","mniswId":"28924","title":"ACS Applied Electronic Materials","issn":"2637-6113","websiteLink":"https://pubs.acs.org/page/aaembp/about.html","documentHash":"1bac7638-ec49-4a56-a9f7-bef74b1a32e6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c2ae0d40970721cb8ed608","year":"2022","volume":"4","number":"5","documentHash":"4825c492-4748-477a-bc36-43009cda7d96"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058193044"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c2b91140970721cb8f3f5d","name":"Arnulf","lastName":"Rosspeintner","documentHash":"42edacfe-05c5-4796-a8de-65feeb09e518"},{"objectId":"62c2b91140970721cb8f3f5c","name":"Anatoly I.","lastName":"Ivanov","documentHash":"64b435cf-0ced-4c6e-99fc-ce31de8179db"},{"objectId":"62c2b91140970721cb8f3f5b","name":"Alexey E.","lastName":"Nazarov","documentHash":"2b15f6a8-2c31-46a5-9890-f6f5a15f49e1"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0046","name":"Gonzalo","lastName":"Angulo Nunez","uuid":"E991038FAEA399EEBBC94BA760C95F0B6034BA084D328F930A193ECE507D3E28360BA145ABF14AE563A0C356A6D4C62DAF2943DB392983D49B4A0272548A6954","orcidId":"0000-0002-6484-1795","documentHash":"5a0f1cd3-66e1-419a-a012-22e46e598522"}],"objectId":"62c2b91140970721cb8f3f59","doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2022.119387","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0167732222009254?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Full relaxation dynamics recovery from ultrafast fluorescence experiments by means of the stochastic model: Does the solvent response dynamics depend on the fluorophore nature?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An approach to analysing time-resolved fluorescence spectra has been developed for dyes with non-parabolic free energy curves of the excited and ground states. It incorporates the description of the solvent relaxation and redistribution/relaxation of intramolecular high-frequency vibrations proceeding in parallel with the pumping. The approach has been applied to simulate spectra of covalently linked perylene-dimethylaniline (PD) in a series of solvents of different polarity. The developed approach combined with the achieved temporal resolution of the modern fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy is shown to provide a possibility to disentangle the relaxation of high-frequency vibrations and the dynamics of the solvent. In this compound the reorganization of both intramolecular vibrations and the solvent strongly affects the absorption and fluorescence spectra so that their influence on spectral dynamics is highly entangled. The comparison of fluorescence spectral dynamics of two dyes, coumarin 153 and PD, shows that the solvation dynamics depend on the fluorophore. The fitting of simulated fluorescence spectral dynamics of PD to the experimental data enables us to determine the solvent relaxation function of hexane."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b0046"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"360","pagesFromTo":"119387","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c2b91140970721cb8f3f5b","62c2b91140970721cb8f3f5c","62c2b91140970721cb8f3f5d","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0046"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788ad","mniswId":"11911","title":"Journal of Molecular Liquids","issn":"0167-7322","eissn":"1873-3166","documentHash":"be68a988-b1a2-4170-9777-f821874d753b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62a0398640970773ce997428","year":"2022","volume":"360","documentHash":"a2c34e38-8336-423e-906d-a4a87078b213"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058193119"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62cc01cf409707746ec6642c","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Bondarchuk","documentHash":"644c6e0f-7558-48c5-b825-19bbd1d0e02f"},{"objectId":"62cc01cf409707746ec6642b","name":"Alec P.","lastName":"LaGrow","documentHash":"ea01a7ce-9d64-48a4-a3b3-99909aa8b63c"},{"objectId":"60c34db59543c72336544454","name":"Abdul","lastName":"Qayyum","orcidId":"0000-0001-6026-8568","documentHash":"7e7a227c-e346-4335-ac23-16aec0f4042b"},{"objectId":"5fc4b6f2085dcb1e6ae0b8c3","name":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Giannakoudakis","uuid":"EF7A9B541B546414AC99804FF7756D3398515753227A5640A461BE05B80210E972A5A20423DCF52E80F4AAFD513AD043C600959BDF4FE208E8324086AF858E8C","documentHash":"38ec48bc-cd6c-4461-ab65-1bd1cbf05429"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Łomot","uuid":"9AD36137223F2722603D98969D279F5AB25CDBFDC76A5D950100F7F869850EC0FF7080AD835DF490058317885BB46E2FA8C68ECFF5811377F69FFFD0A2288626","orcidId":"0000-0003-3663-1122","documentHash":"15b687f0-a174-44c7-97e5-cebe3bb751ea"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62cc01cf409707746ec66427","doi":"10.1016/j.catcom.2022.106406","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1566736722000115?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"High-frequency sonication for the synthesis of nanocluster-decorated titania nanorods: Making a better photocatalyst for the selective oxidation of monoaromatic alcohol","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The designing and synthesis of novel photocatalysts are the most important parts, with TiO2-based materials to be consider as prosperous candidates for the selective photo-oxidation of aromatic alcohol.

We have prepared homo- and hetero-dichalcogenoimidodiphosphinate [(EE ' PiPr2NH)] (E, E '= Se, Se; S, S; S, Se) complexes ofmanganese and copper through metathetical reactions. The X-ray single crystal structure of[Mn{(SePiPr2)2N}2]1revealed a triclinic crystal system, with a MnSe4core unit, whereas thecrystal structure determination of [Mn{(SPiPr2)(SePiPr2)N}2]2indicated a triclinic crystal system with a Mn(S/Se)2unit. Bothmetal centers are tetrahedral, with two deprotonated bidentate ligands forming the coordination sphere. The free ligand was foundto exhibit a gauche configuration in the solid state. The energies of the various rotamers of dithio-analogue were studied by DFTcalculations. The decomposition behavior of complexes with homo- and heterochalcogenides was investigated, and the complexeswere employed as single-source precursors to generate manganese and copper chalcogenides through solvent-less melt reactionsbetween 500 and 550 degrees C. The deposited powders were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM), energy dispersive analysis of X-ray (EDAX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and elemental mapping.MnS, MnSe2, and MnSSe phases were obtained from the decomposition of respective manganese complexes. In contrast, thedecomposition of copper-based complexes yielded Cu2-xSe and the sulfur-doped Cu3Se2phase from seleno- and mixed thio/seleno-complexes of Cu, respectively. The morphology ranged from random sheet-like structures to agglomerated platelets, while theselected area electron diffraction (SAED) revealed the crystalline nature of the materials.

Elimination of charge trapping is the primary motivation for energy transport improvement in polymer semiconductors serving as interconnections in molecular electronics. With this in mind, we prepared molecular wires based on structurally privileged ortho substituted Ni(2+)salens, offering the molecular structure facilitating its linear electropolymerization growth inside the confined space of a silica matrix containing vertical channels that are 2 nm in diameter. We noticed that the analogical embedment of ortho unsubstituted poly(Ni(2+)salen)s was not possible. Thus, we used quantum chemical calculations utilizing density functional theory to explain this phenomenon. Hence, we succeeded in recognizing structure-property relationships of Ni(2+)salens governing their local electropolymerization ability inside vertical nanochannels. Isolation of polymer chains allowed us to gain insight into the intrinsic properties of Ni(2+)salen polymers creating a better understanding of their charge transport and polymerization mechanisms. The prepared molecular wires exhibited improved electronic properties evidenced by electrochemical measurements revealing the energetically favored charge transporting polymer forms and the increased ratio between anodic and cathodic charges. Furthermore, we directly evidenced the presence of a Ni(2+)salen polymer inside silica nanochannels using high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with very low-energy argon ion beam sputtering, as well as using atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","5e709409878c28a0473b5395"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"9287-9300","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709409878c28a0473b5395","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","62c3f6694097077bbdbd6949","62c3f6694097077bbdbd694a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547884c","mniswId":"11755","title":"JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C","issn":"2050-7526","eissn":"2050-7534","websiteLink":"http://www.rsc.org/MaterialsC","documentHash":"2bbe5caa-4278-418a-a9af-de6cd3cf981e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c3f6b04097077bbdbd6ad4","year":"2022","volume":"10","number":"24","doi":"","documentHash":"a4c89f14-06f4-41f3-8776-d7c799b22f73"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058196860"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c3ffc74097077bbdbde031","name":"H.

This system represents wet soft-granular matter - a class of granular materials in which the grains are soft and wetted by thin fluid films-with other examples including wet granular hydrogels or foams. In contrast to wet granular matter with rigid grains (e.g., wet sand), studied previously, the deformability of the grains raises the number of available metastable states and facilitates rearrangements which allow for reorganization and self-assembly of the system under external drive, e.g., applied via viscous forces. We use a co-flow configuration to generate a variety of unique low-dimensional regular granular patterns, intermediate between 1D and 2D, ranging from linear chains and chains with periodically occurring folds to multi-chains and segmented structures including chains of finite length. In particular, we observe that the partially folded chains self-organize via limit cycle of displacements and rearrangements occurring at a frequency self-adapted to the rate of build-up of compressive strain in the chain induced by the viscous forces. Upon weakening of the capillary arrest of the droplets, we observe spontaneous fluidization of the quasi-solid structures and avalanches of rearrangements. We identify two types of fluidization-induced instabilities and rationalize them in terms of a competition between advection and propagation. While we use aqueous droplets as the grains we demonstrate that the reported mechanisms of adaptive self-assembly apply to other types of soft granular systems including foams and microgels. We discuss possible application of the reported quasi-1D compartmentalized structures in tissue engineering, bioprinting and materials science."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4c0b","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","5e70929c878c28a047399068"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1801-1818","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4c0b","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","5e70929c878c28a047399068","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","62c3ffc74097077bbdbde031"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547979e","mniswId":"18664","title":"SOFT MATTER","issn":"1744-683X","websiteLink":"http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/sm/about.asp","documentHash":"f3c269ab-3cc1-491d-9469-b2be3e4819e1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c3ffc74097077bbdbde033","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"9","documentHash":"079f82a8-9be3-4292-95ea-ff8985878e28"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058196906"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62ce885d4097070a2ca1db23","name":"Felix","lastName":"von Stetten","orcidId":"0000-0002-8547-0495","documentHash":"cb516d23-fe6d-4c92-83f8-f9e1a5dfafca"},{"objectId":"62ce885d4097070a2ca1db21","name":"Roland","lastName":"Zengerle","documentHash":"ec6b91d3-005a-4f5d-a9ce-e17b87f4afdd"},{"objectId":"62ce885d4097070a2ca1db20","name":"Peter","lastName":"Juelg","documentHash":"1b395d4c-14e5-4722-a6fb-5bb5cb54a85a"},{"objectId":"62ce885d4097070a2ca1db1f","name":"Franziska","lastName":"Schlenker","orcidId":"0000-0003-2082-1677","documentHash":"b12cf987-eaac-4b68-ac63-da2b47fbbaa5"},{"objectId":"62ce885d4097070a2ca1db1d","name":"Michael","lastName":"Lehnert","documentHash":"b1a62fa8-e603-4443-aecf-107952d30a12"},{"objectId":"62ce885d4097070a2ca1db1c","name":"Nadine","lastName":"Borst","orcidId":"0000-0003-1258-3250","documentHash":"55564e9d-de00-4ae7-8b7b-9cb1e3eabfb0"},{"objectId":"62ce885c4097070a2ca1db1b","name":"Silvia","lastName":"Calabrese","documentHash":"5200bae3-e648-44ab-a404-36bd4aede767"},{"objectId":"5ebee330752340254fc43fc8","name":"Yu-Kai","lastName":"Lai","uuid":"8528DB559051F9D7DB4DEE4876430CE130CC1D24608FE1476F15CADF46BE76D58C4FC92C8DFF118BB15E2C5FD2F490784D1F3CB7296EAD0DA8049936D0960BE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1037-9846","documentHash":"a36e5d18-87ea-4f98-960c-e10d4a66b48c"},{"objectId":"5ebed656752340254fc40676","name":"Yu-Ting","lastName":"Kao","uuid":"9D58C31B6B4C3FC70AD0A5F092BC67A834DFF34FCF067681B754A71D082F4740419EB4442771464B34B748461365ABBFA37ACF224C6258FD433F63B5F6AAFCDD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4671-7907","documentHash":"d6f56f0d-a167-4838-b674-127a1c4f89ff"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Garstecki","uuid":"75C65452002051CEFFE6071097E89DF6A74DD0FC1A118DE168CD40EFEDC485E8FF7DCB8A8288FEEBC45B2BDC2ADE2FC757D7CC1EB814D7EB9EAFD1588F4EB22E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9101-7163","documentHash":"cdc40e41-dc83-4780-be61-52db050a0f2d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62ce885c4097070a2ca1db18","doi":"10.3390/bios12040237","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/12/4/237/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Microfluidic One-Pot Digital Droplet FISH Using LNA/DNA Molecular Beacons for Bacteria Detection and Absolute Quantification","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We demonstrate detection and quantification of bacterial load with a novel microfluidic one-pot wash-free fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay in droplets.

Density of grafted xanthate on guar gum product (GG-X) is as high as 4.4%, thus GG-X is conceivably characterized and confirmed by various spectrometric, electrochemical, thermogravimetric, and microscopic methods. Complexation of GG-X with numerous borderline and soft metal ions (e.g. Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Pt2+ and Cd2+) yields hydrophilic gel-like materials and shows good agreement with hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory. This indicates tremendous potential of GG-X in metal ion extraction, removal and hydrogel cross-linking. GG-X is also employed to formulate an aqueous colloidal dispersion of copper sulfide covellite (GG-X/CuS) nanocomposites. GG-X therefore behaves as a surfactant, allowing formation of electronically conductive nanocomposites. XRD indicates apparent beneficial effects of GG-X in the synthesis of CuS with a crystallite size of 15.6 nm. This novel nanocomposite is a promising material for humidity sensing, showing reversible linear responses to relative humidity changes within 10 to 80% range. The interaction between GG-X and water might cause changes in electrical permittivity of GG-X/CuS nanocomposite and/or electrical hopping conductivity between CuS nanoparticles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"206","pagesFromTo":"105-114","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62ceb8194097070a2ca4f6e6","62ceb8194097070a2ca4f6e7","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","62ceb8194097070a2ca4f6e9","62ceb81a4097070a2ca4f6ea","62ceb81a4097070a2ca4f6eb","62ceb81a4097070a2ca4f6ec"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547818a","mniswId":"8662","title":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","doi":"10.1016/j.ijbiomac","issn":"0141-8130","eissn":"0141-8130","websiteLink":"www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-biological-macromolecules","documentHash":"9c17a06c-adef-42b9-adcc-46d05c211bde"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ceb81a4097070a2ca4f6ee","year":"2022","volume":"206","documentHash":"3429d4f7-8c67-4161-8e78-59c7b7e0b78b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CUS THIN-FILMS/THERMAL CHARACTERIZATION/DIVERSE APPLICATIONS/COUNTER ELECTRODE/ADSORPTION/HYDROGELS/REMOVAL/SPECTROSCOPY/COMPLEXESMECHANISM"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199665"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62d1106f4097073a4bc509b5","name":"Angelika","lastName":"Janaszkiewicz","orcidId":"0000-0003-2159-8729","documentHash":"6641edce-697f-4003-b70f-243d9e56ce5a"},{"objectId":"62d1106f4097073a4bc509b4","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Śnieżek","documentHash":"8e2311d9-262e-4c89-8ca2-95570294491d"},{"objectId":"62d1106f4097073a4bc509b2","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Kośnik","orcidId":"0000-0002-3889-7744","documentHash":"3e490af5-9e93-4185-9be6-fbbaa1513004"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b75d5","name":"Maura","lastName":"Malińska","uuid":"3430C2C4F168A38D8B44435EAE317E1C012969A6EF706124CFF44A7781564DEAA694DC1B8DD0013A52F0499A1E8FB094B7C71A7B64CE18455081D0FF733F1421","orcidId":"0000-0002-7138-7041","documentHash":"a6593e66-82da-44e8-89e6-d566f204bd6d"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a33","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kajetanowicz","uuid":"76C5EFD00D186BC3A9138F596D34A78D68EE9049CFEE8293DA0418C9583B6AACEA660831C4FA6D0FB9B7053A2790A7B4F548569CC029EE4EB6EC688FBAEA96E9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0315-0998","documentHash":"75800c91-fa97-4e69-863d-c65f2267bd0b"},{"objectId":"5e70935c878c28a0473a8036","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Lichosyt","uuid":"5D4A1C3E27899466933AD729D52D0B86E754742BFB866648BD438D2872ED7CD25040D7D4DF17A67F79587D932F5E369CD5DDADBE83C29B75AF2FC503053DC1C7","documentHash":"e0da9f19-cb42-49e4-b552-d2b188f036d3"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d68","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Trzaskowski","uuid":"983E94CF58BC1BC5C0158F0C670526C17072F5C448DFB6A7ECF36D101C0D3003F2B3E4E83101D321FCEB0C9EFFD77CF6FFB40F39C983E0D088498D0CAFD38D21","orcidId":"0000-0003-2385-1476","documentHash":"06efa1a4-d66c-48ae-9b84-a122a2069c2b"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7aa2","name":"Karol","lastName":"Grela","uuid":"9442D2040D3B08B312B040C1CE881B5C536F26DDFEC825D186EC7EF629F4D5F8D8834486824EFD98702EE93707DF33BD5DFEB8B0D40605C27C1B69568C1E8B6E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9193-3305","documentHash":"8173287f-17b0-4205-b9e4-654000c7761d"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7874","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"FB3161DD5EE2E4C5929F94A1027B5B5A95938A10F8A68D9F5DDB0A37802C8BA856B73CBE96B1D2FCEC46E44E64C2FE31DD6085F718AD5F11EBBE71F094EA0431","orcidId":"0000-0002-0277-294X","documentHash":"f8b8f8ae-1211-4bdc-8f40-f68ff62ad20a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62d1106f4097073a4bc509b1","doi":"10.1002/anie.202201472","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/anie.202201472","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Ruthenium Olefin Metathesis Catalysts Bearing a Macrocyclic N‐Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand: Improved Stability and Activity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Formation of sterically hindered C−C double bonds via catalytic olefin metathesis is considered a very challenging task for Ru catalysts. This limitation led to the development of specialised catalysts bearing sterically reduced N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands that are very active in such transformations, yet significantly less stable as compared to general purpose catalysts. To decrease the small-size NHC catalysts susceptibility to decomposition, a new NHC ligand was designed, in which two sterically reduced aryl arms were tied together by a C-8 alkyl chain. The installation of this macrocyclic ligand on the ruthenium centre led to the formation of an olefin metathesis catalyst (trans-Ru6). Interestingly, this complex undergoes transformation into an isomer bearing two Cl ligands in the cis-arrangement (cis-Ru6). These two isomeric complexes exhibit similarly high thermodynamic stability, yet different application profiles in catalysis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62d1106f4097073a4bc509b4","5e709358878c28a0473a7aa2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709429878c28a0473b75d5","62d1106f4097073a4bc509b2","5e70935c878c28a0473a8036","5e709355878c28a0473a7874","5e709358878c28a0473a7aa2","5e709410878c28a0473b5a33"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f082","uid":"b9SXTF1Zzo_eiHN0JX9AfyA","uuid":"951ff117-fef4-4ad2-81fa-149f6095a5a7","name":"Centrum Nowych Technologii UW","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7d68"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935c878c28a0473a8036"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"61","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"e202201472","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62d1106f4097073a4bc509b2","5e70935c878c28a0473a8036","62d1106f4097073a4bc509b4","62d1106f4097073a4bc509b5","5e709355878c28a0473a7874","5e709429878c28a0473b75d5","5e709359878c28a0473a7d68","5e709410878c28a0473b5a33","5e709358878c28a0473a7aa2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477026","mniswId":"1127","title":"ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION","issn":"1433-7851","eissn":"1521-3773","documentHash":"2e22c515-48a8-4277-bd3a-488ee4361571"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d1106f4097073a4bc509bc","year":"2022","volume":"61","number":"24","documentHash":"e5a568ed-f0c1-4710-93db-02a0ad6202db"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058203497"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62d10fb44097073a4bc4f605","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Śmietana","documentHash":"11452797-7f47-48c2-9418-2d379cb02ebb"},{"objectId":"62d10fb44097073a4bc4f602","name":"Monika","lastName":"Janik","orcidId":"0000-0002-8002-3055","documentHash":"e283a139-3440-4a2b-9ca7-fd43e9d3be6a"},{"objectId":"62d10fb44097073a4bc4f601","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Gabler","orcidId":"0000-0002-8936-9909","documentHash":"2e0caa1d-983e-42f2-b970-5bc69d273c93"},{"objectId":"60c33c029543c723365441e3","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Krześniak","uuid":"CE4964C7D0F8D33B3274314A08471E9615D6BF9A6490C9722E4680D17C7ED3C46329A6159108BB31115FD01C4C0E552E2CF3F08F115319FF86D389BFC6F1DB92","orcidId":"0000-0002-0045-5983","documentHash":"3b3ff25c-f7ee-4833-a81a-76a5bced9a18"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","name":"Anders","lastName":"Jonsson-Niedziółka","uuid":"3394A368CB0E6B611D461246FA8924DA0550D7AF68CD7EBB72456860833F46CDC79A875204939C5A2F631BE36B09951DDC56FAB1B1015A54CDFB0E1A1E128C0B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5642-5946","documentHash":"68cb99b8-33a0-4453-8724-820d86d19c36"},{"objectId":"5e70932a878c28a0473a4087","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Koba","uuid":"3679F948ED49F47A7E83EEBB1ADC63D2BC1A836AD701DEFEE43A8C03D79AA657CEBFDD8791ECC1179B3D706001461D45C3C7774C2A34CB15F30B8D0CA4900CCD","orcidId":"0000-0002-0295-8242","documentHash":"50b9a7f3-1023-41e8-8137-5f864cff93d1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62d10fb44097073a4bc4f5fe","doi":"10.1016/j.optlaseng.2022.107173","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0143816622002263?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A microfluidic system for analysis of electrochemical processing using a highly sensitive optical fiber microcavity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Microfluidics provide unique possibilities to control tiny volumes of liquids and their composition. In this work we combined a microfluidic system with a microcavity in-line Mach-Zehnder interferometer (&#181;IMZI) induced in the side surface of a single-mode optical fiber using a femtosecond laser micromachining. The &#181;IMZI shows capability for investigating optical properties of volumes down to picoliters with an exceptionally high refractive index sensitivity. Here we report numerical analysis and experimental results that show that when the &#181;IMZI is incorporated with the microfluidic system the measurements can be performed with sensitivity exceeding 14,000 nm/RIU which is similar to measurements done under static conditions. In a flow injection system, we show the influence of flow rate and injection volume on the response, and that the orientation of the cavity versus the flow direction has only a minor impact on the results. Finally, we have supported the system by band electrodes making it possible to induce redox reactions in the microchannel to detect the flowing products of the reactions optically. It has been found that thanks to the high sensitivity of the &#181;IMZI the products of the reactions can be clearly detected both electrochemically and optically even when the only part of the flowing redox probe is oxidized at the band electrode. The capability for monitoring the products was shown for a standard redox probe, potassium ferricyanide, as well as for the neurotransmitter dopamine. This work shows that the proposed solution may offer highly sensitive optical measurements, even when the chemical reactions are not effective in the whole volume of the system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dede","uid":"bdoAFCGTorZ9N_5NoE6bisA","uuid":"d86ce494-55e8-4d01-929c-48a2908e6e5a","name":"Instytut Łączności - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70932a878c28a0473a4087"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dede","parentUuid":"d86ce494-55e8-4d01-929c-48a2908e6e5a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dede","rootUuid":"d86ce494-55e8-4d01-929c-48a2908e6e5a","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c33c029543c723365441e3","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"158","pagesFromTo":"107173","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c33c029543c723365441e3","62d10fb44097073a4bc4f601","62d10fb44097073a4bc4f602","5e70932a878c28a0473a4087","62d10fb44097073a4bc4f605","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479112","mniswId":"15490","title":"OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING","issn":"0143-8166","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"2aa5ab07-e18c-4697-ba2d-35fbfa3efea9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d10fb44097073a4bc4f607","year":"2022","volume":"158","documentHash":"749e1239-9a54-41b7-a593-cc0ce05fbd14"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Microfluidics Optical fiber sensor Refractive index sensing Mach-Zehnder interferometer Electrochemistry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058203866"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc48287085dcb1e6ae0b829","name":"Nazar","lastName":"Rad","orcidId":"0000-0002-2755-8085","documentHash":"0fb96eec-2145-4c36-9e4c-2a88be8c47c9"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Sashuk","uuid":"7B9E651603C44ECD7E173B7A34E505E79330EDF4DD04B973310915D4CB9C3A93FE2EC7E76F47936D6F44735FB425946716A2A46CE201074FC33F28CEE87FCD58","orcidId":"0000-0002-5907-8596","documentHash":"2b6c5410-3288-40e9-b679-a6627af57d6d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-04-01","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62e24e6b4097077d65aa1c0a","doi":"10.1039/d2cc00772j","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/CC/D2CC00772J","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> on the cucurbituril-mediated hydrolysis of a phenyl acetate","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The environment around the active site affects the catalytic activity of enzymes.

This unusual situation leads to nontypical photophysical characteristics: dual fluorescence is observed for BMP in solution, whereas only a single emission, originating from the phototautomer, is detected for the ultracold isolated molecules. In order to understand the completely different behavior in the two regimes, detailed photophysical studies have been carried out. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of ESIPT were determined from stationary and transient picosecond absorption and emission for BMP in different solvents in a broad temperature range. These studies were combined with time-dependent- density functional theory quantum-chemical modeling. The excited-state double-well potential for BMP and its methyl-free analogue were calculated by applying different hybrid functionals and compared with the results obtained for another proton-transferring molecule, 2,5-bis(5-ethyl-2-benzoxazolyl)hydroquinone (DE-BBHQ). The results lead to the model that explains the difference in proton-transfer properties of BMP in vacuum and in the condensed phase by inversion of the two lowest singlet states occurring along the PT coordinate."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff15","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff86","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","5e709491878c28a0473bfad1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ba878c28a04739b9b7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"126","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1823-1836","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff15","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff86","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b","5e7092ba878c28a04739b9b7","5e709491878c28a0473bfad1","62e2782c4097077d65ab6b60","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a0","mniswId":"12284","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","issn":"1089-5639","eissn":"1520-5215","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"13be0363-c559-48eb-b3e6-1e8759dc265b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e278604097077d65ab6d85","year":"2022","volume":"126","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"3540d720-004c-4f67-873d-c97878f6de44"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058210926"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62e271064097077d65ab3616","name":"Neerish","lastName":"Revaprasadu","orcidId":"0000-0001-5730-1232","documentHash":"d9b8b0b1-c338-47fb-ba40-1e20a7646042"},{"objectId":"62e271064097077d65ab3615","name":"Ram K.","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"89e75c7b-9c4b-4bcb-9f8e-5f95289cf76f"},{"objectId":"62e271064097077d65ab3614","name":"Jonghyun","lastName":"Choi","documentHash":"8d31a5c1-9037-4e10-ae4d-b0a213c26db2"},{"objectId":"62e271064097077d65ab3612","name":"Ginena Bildard","lastName":"Shombe","documentHash":"9ac38b60-99ad-47cb-890f-78609f393e5f"},{"objectId":"6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","name":"Malik","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"3F14D6BD4340633067804C270812A937F4E92325031BE1176142856E397CDDA3DE8C90CE8CB58D3FB67D87C91202A989955940DCCDD0BEF387B162A98B900235","orcidId":"0000-0002-3316-041X","documentHash":"b5f5ad91-b181-4281-9e6e-7bd70d906091"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Opałło","uuid":"ECB569ECB4125066F1DCDB9F48064E76F971F64BACACA1AFD7DBBBE80107D088337CBD1844ADDF79163AEED6F4FB8E817D076BC1662EF431F114EA1356D7929A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5872-7059","documentHash":"71cabfc4-5832-4f70-97cb-7c9b9abea0ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-04-06","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62e271064097077d65ab3610","doi":"10.1039/d2ra00815g","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/RA/D2RA00815G","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Tuning composition of CuCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>–NiCo<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub> solid solutions <i>via</i> solvent-less pyrolysis of molecular precursors for efficient supercapacitance and water splitting","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mixed metal sulfides are increasingly being investigated because of their prospective applications for electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Their high electronic conductivity and high density of redox sites result in significant improvement of their electrochemical properties. Herein, the composition-dependent supercapacitive and water splitting performance of a series of Ni(1-x)CuxCo2S4 (0.2 <= x <= 0.8) solid solutions prepared via solvent-less pyrolysis of a mixture of respective metal ethyl xanthate precursors is reported. The use of xanthate precursors resulted in the formation of surface clean nanomaterials at low-temperature. Their structural, compositional, and morphological features were examined by p-XRD, SEM, and EDX analyses. Both supercapacitive and electrocatalytic (HER, OER) properties of the synthesized materials significantly vary with composition (Ni/Cu molar content). However, the optimal composition depends on the application. The highest specific capacitance of 770 F g(-1) at a current density of 1 A g(-1) was achieved for Ni0.6Cu0.4Co2S4 (NCCS-2). This electrode exhibits capacitance retention (C-R) of 67% at 30 A g(-1), which is higher than that observed for pristine NiCo2S4 (838 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1), 47% C-R at 30 A g(-1)). On the contrary, Ni0.4Cu0.6Co2S4 (NCCS-3) exhibits the lowest overpotential of 124 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Finally, the best OER activity with an overpotential of 268 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) was displayed by Ni0.8Cu0.2Co2S4 (NCCS-1). The prepared electrodes exhibit high stability, as well as durability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"10675-10685","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62e271064097077d65ab3612","6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","62e271064097077d65ab3614","62e271064097077d65ab3615","62e271064097077d65ab3616","5e7092b4878c28a04739b167"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547962f","mniswId":"18024","title":"RSC Advances","doi":"10.1039/c5ra","issn":"2046-2069","eissn":"2046-2069","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Journals/JournalIssues/RA","documentHash":"8fad672c-d3cf-463d-ae47-bc0bee8d0fd4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e271064097077d65ab3619","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"17","documentHash":"cfd0e487-76c4-4e39-8edf-db34b118b909"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058211085"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62e7616140970778ffa5a805","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Skotak","documentHash":"33299af6-7d39-4a2e-9292-e168b33953eb"},{"objectId":"5fc4bba0085dcb1e6ae0b8d5","name":"Kumar","lastName":"Kumar Sarang","uuid":"EADCAB66EFAC0CB625A173B40003C54E95EE33E1593EA935CC23A15D6ACB90071DE05B7D2197AA65DA6BA707046C5D6470DE18F2FD9EE77CA14D48F55B2E919F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0613-1867","documentHash":"22e0d982-ea21-477e-b4c2-93b9d07f04e2"},{"objectId":"5e709498878c28a0473c010f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Żyfka-Zagrodzińska","uuid":"811547C00C8D0A24E5AB0AE5040636DB51199863FFAA3D259A60999D889C6155A748B7D3D1ABCABB93367D1DD021A79FD4B9077FB541CAB9025F252FD9A859B7","orcidId":"0000-0003-1674-2597","documentHash":"fe25e253-0160-4fd4-9d03-df97ce0e832f"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5974","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rudziński","uuid":"3D506125510B3BBBBC100FED79F7B850A30F8D8147B86F25C7B7C88D7EE86B7DABC6B2827FC4B337FD7C25E356AF6293D4516CDEF0F0B5BB30FD46F7CBC466B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5785-9751","documentHash":"7412096e-82dd-41fd-a947-0b5456249825"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Szmigielski","uuid":"8BA441832175E89B21F79F78CE35C01EAE6DA9568D355F2A4BFC7D823AB2D6D5C83D7B8E06C8BBC3896462D090D1BFEEFF6AC20665089B7B419A5802C9DAD013","orcidId":"0000-0003-3389-9318","documentHash":"b9e87d98-9f5d-4922-852b-1896bf4792e3"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea3","name":"Monika","lastName":"Asztemborska","uuid":"FB06FBD85548759213D9EFF8F64A1DDDB4315FCED178453EA389B9D0A36561A476C7D58833851C6B3FF9FDD40217BFD85C757B2EFFF297F8D9CCFB1E38742CD7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7785-5379","documentHash":"455e5b25-4541-4c08-b405-54aba46e3411"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abeff","name":"Klara","lastName":"Nestorowicz","uuid":"03CE110605628DDBCD2B7ED6AD24CC00D7A45FE4EE4C3AB4CC1D6737579AF086BCBA0F83F2207DB648C2C2146DB43761190D6C44A28CF01FFF8789E1845DA6B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2709-373X","documentHash":"9e60ad04-7ea1-4aa1-9cb7-8e9e04bcd7ce"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-07-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62e7616140970778ffa5a7ff","doi":"10.1007/s11356-022-21673-1","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-022-21673-1.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Winter sources of PM2.5 pollution in Podkowa Leśna, a Central-European garden town (Mazovia, Poland)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper analyzes PM2.5 aerosol samples collected in Podkowa Leśna, a garden town in Mazovia, Central Poland, for 15 days in winter 2019. We determined the mass concentrations in the air of PM2.5 and PM2.5-bound organic carbon, elemental carbon, levoglucosan, and nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PM2.5 ranged from 11 to 51 μg m−3 (mean 31 μg m−3) and contained less than 32% organic carbon, 4% elemental carbon, 1% levoglucosan, and 0.12% total PAHs. The analysis based on positive matrix factorization (PMF) indicated two sources of PM2.5 of similar strength — burning vehicle fuels and biomass burning for residential heating. Levoglucosan originated exclusively from biomass burning, while 90% of elemental carbon was from vehicle emissions. About 62% of organic carbon, 85% of benzo(a)anthracene and 55–65% of the remaining PAHs originated from biomass burning. Compared to many worldwide locations, PM2.5, organic carbon, elemental carbon, and levoglucosan in Podkowa were among the lowest. The benzo(a)pyrene concentrations were the highest, while other PAHs were intermediate. However, the mass fractions of PAHs in Podkowa PM2.5 were the highest among the four locations available for comparison. That may indicate the low quality of fuel-burning processes. PAH-related inhalation cancer risk based on PAH carcinogenic potency in Podkowa appeared marginal.

These two polymers, with different configurations of methyl substituents on the imine bridge, were used as precursors for the preparation of electrocatalytically active nickel hydroxide [Ni(OH)(2)]-type nanoparticles (NPs) anchored in the polymeric matrix as poly[SalenNi(OH)(2)]. The use of potentiodynamic and potentiostatic electropolymerization conditions for the deposition of polymeric precursors allowed us to control the molecular architecture of poly(NiSalen)s and NPs derived from them. Thus, we obtained different arrangements of NPs embedded in morphologically different poly(Salen) matrixes, indicating their electrocatalytic activity toward ethanol to different extents. Moreover, we found a direct relationship between the electrochemical stability of the poly(NiSalen) precursors operating in the organic solvent-based electrolyte solutions and the easiness of their transformation into Ni(OH)(2) NPs operating in the aqueous alkaline media. Poly(NiSalen)s and Ni(OH)(2)-type NPs were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff23","5e709409878c28a0473b5395"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"29","pagesFromTo":"33768-33786","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709409878c28a0473b5395","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff23","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","62f38602409707058d1c61df"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dc5","mniswId":"125","title":"ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES","issn":"1944-8244","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/aamick","documentHash":"27b6e464-7a88-4cfc-a099-7ec8b65dc4b1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f384e1409707058d1c5f27","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"29","doi":"","documentHash":"a2d9b8ce-8ad8-4d3a-8196-408e31c0324f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058214512"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62ed08fe409707218863aaf9","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Świȩszkowski","documentHash":"846ceff7-c0e9-490a-8fd8-3160e5a7e226"},{"objectId":"62ed08fe409707218863aaf8","name":"Alessia","lastName":"Paradiso","documentHash":"3fe382c7-88dd-4f42-b016-9dce23ecbc13"},{"objectId":"62ed08fe409707218863aaf7","name":"Marina","lastName":"Volpi","documentHash":"e2cb33f9-46a4-49f1-a0f4-550ed69a7ee5"},{"objectId":"5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","name":"Marco","lastName":"Costantini","uuid":"39AF91D3BD887DDA9D7064C2EEA4EC3EA3433737B56F1680E3899FD57F4B56CF80C6CBF0037AABC256FFEBAA40368FC799B344097649E00467A4677CD64AE0F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2756-5872","documentHash":"cb8eda43-6975-486d-98a0-48f4cabbf744"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62ed08fe409707218863aaf5","doi":"10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01145","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsbiomaterials.1c01145","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Hydrogel-Based Fiber Biofabrication Techniques for Skeletal Muscle Tissue Engineering","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The functional capabilities of skeletal muscle are strongly correlated with its well-arranged microstructure, consisting of parallelly aligned myotubes. In case of extensive muscle loss, the endogenous regenerative capacity is hindered by scar tissue formation, which compromises the native muscle structure, ultimately leading to severe functional impairment. To address such an issue, skeletal muscle tissue engineering (SMTE) attempts to fabricate in vitro bioartificial muscle tissue constructs to assist and accelerate the regeneration process. Due to its dynamic nature, SMTE strategies must employ suitable biomaterials (combined with muscle progenitors) and proper 3D architectures. In light of this, 3D fiber-based strategies are gaining increasing interest for the generation of hydrogel microfibers as advanced skeletal muscle constructs. Indeed, hydrogels possess exceptional biomimetic properties, while the fiber-shaped morphology allows for the creation of geometrical cues to guarantee proper myoblast alignment. In this review, we summarize commonly used hydrogels in SMTE and their main properties, and we discuss the first efforts to engineer hydrogels to guide myoblast anisotropic orientation. Then, we focus on presenting the main hydrogel fiber-based techniques for SMTE, including molding, electrospinning, 3D bioprinting, extrusion, and microfluidic spinning. Furthermore, we describe the effect of external stimulation (i.e., mechanical and electrical) on such constructs and the application of hydrogel fiber-based methods on recapitulating complex skeletal muscle tissue interfaces. Finally, we discuss the future developments in the application of hydrogel microfibers for SMTE."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii

lipid and glucose metabolism regulator that possesses intrinsic ceramidase activity. Mutations of the ADIPOR1 gene have been associated with nonsyndromic and syndromic retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we show that the absence of AdipoR1 in mice leads to progressive photoreceptor degeneration, significant reduction of electroretinogram amplitudes, decreased retinoid content in the retina, and reduced cone opsin expression. Single cell RNA-Seq results indicate that ADIPOR1 encoded the most abundantly expressed ceramidase in mice and one of the 2 most highly expressed ceramidases in the human retina, next to acid ceramidase ASAH1. We discovered an accumulation of ceramides in the AdipoR1(-/-) retina, likely due to insufficient ceramidase activity for healthy retina function, resulting in photoreceptor death. Combined treatment with desipramine/L-cycloserine (DC) lowered ceramide levels and exerted a protective effect on photoreceptors in AdipoR1(-/-) mice. Moreover, we observed improvement in cone-mediated retinal function in the DC-treated animals. Lastly, we found that prolonged DC treatment corrected the electrical responses of the primary visual cortex to visual stimuli, approaching near-normal levels for some parameters. These results highlight the importance of ADIPOR1 ceramidase in the retina and show that pharmacological inhibition of ceramide generation can provide a therapeutic strategy forADIPOR1-related retinopathy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","5f505f00752340073806a8ca"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"e156301","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62ed07864097072188639c2a","5f505f00752340073806a8ca","62ed07864097072188639c2b","62ed07864097072188639c2c","62ed07864097072188639c2d","62ed07864097072188639c2e","62ed07864097072188639c2f","62ed07864097072188639c30","62ed07864097072188639c31","62ed07864097072188639c32","62ed07864097072188639c33","62ed07864097072188639c34","62ed07864097072188639c35","62ed07864097072188639c36","62ed07864097072188639c37","62ed07864097072188639c38","62ed07864097072188639c39","62ed07864097072188639c3a","62ed07864097072188639c3b","62ed07864097072188639c3c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","62ed07864097072188639c3d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c667","mniswId":"9859","title":"JCI Insight","issn":"2379-3708","eissn":"2379-3708","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"a9989d26-0976-40f7-b87b-b74100d785aa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ed07864097072188639c29","year":"2022","volume":"7","number":"4","documentHash":"6265c2e4-0819-4316-835b-7439aeead2f2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058214643"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62ed0a42409707218863b65f","name":"Christopher","lastName":"Milne","documentHash":"f8ed3323-0fad-44db-854e-ded767a2e764"},{"objectId":"62ed0a42409707218863b65e","name":"Marcus","lastName":"Lundberg","documentHash":"7f1353fb-ed86-4060-888c-8c3549c10a09"},{"objectId":"62ed0a42409707218863b65d","name":"Pavle","lastName":"Juranić","documentHash":"3252081e-b3a9-4aa9-b0ea-3d17ceb6422c"},{"objectId":"62ed0a42409707218863b65b","name":"Christopher","lastName":"Arrell","documentHash":"48d30467-8e42-4993-84c5-2a2348488e44"},{"objectId":"62ed0a42409707218863b65a","name":"Mickaël","lastName":"Delcey","documentHash":"8fd32e7f-b253-4efe-a2de-3a5845b7c488"},{"objectId":"62ed0a42409707218863b658","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wach","documentHash":"d81eadb4-e081-4cf6-8884-d7a9583a5039"},{"objectId":"622036397523402df08c206c","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sa","uuid":"87182E2E0888DA41C757B81B2143E2316665900AFDCDE55D96C088AFA76BAFB6A4F1AA06C4EDA6BD452B1F53C7A1CCDD6A3E7FE74E2E496F4852B0410671F4C6","documentHash":"b4c2efbd-ab85-495c-833b-083d3a9f0f35"},{"objectId":"60c2fcee9543c723365434a5","name":" Rafał ","lastName":"Fanselow","uuid":"4D51A209DA6D43BBA6F6435B5050F3022EE662F4D05C4C8621F431712C7EFC8A1A4EA55A14C15DF50FF8E2FE97728721F34E4D8E327A6B7CE390CABAB6847024","orcidId":"0000-0002-0939-4590","documentHash":"2f505fb0-4044-4b5a-ac14-a2d51096e351"},{"objectId":"5e7094c6878c28a0473c3772","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Błachucki","uuid":"5C0FF965DD7A9BFD6AE966177BEB06D90EA5DE12ECC3766F10D17DE12F8F19392304D2B38EBBA7A5B616E257D9D3B0DFC1598E860E98FFD54B3AFA699ABA3341","orcidId":"0000-0003-4457-2345","documentHash":"8f6f28af-4f26-4bdd-8fe2-d0bb5484c07b"},{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b72a9","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Czapla-Masztafiak","uuid":"7EC3C0793F7DCBE24E53D110D7DB56043D624224A1BFC60E59B6BB4AF4584807380A91EA35145EDCD80E990A1C5FC783B3EE1FB88437F7345BF6FAE875A331A0","orcidId":"0000-0001-7706-0296","documentHash":"8f1379e8-8a16-42b9-b389-bc41ae90c33a"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397c2c","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Szlachetko","uuid":"CBFD946E3064E9CAB5B0BB644F9088EBA6EB3459C542F749E49A1FD2BD86309841B9142F0C36A9756815B6083DA6493CBA7429E06A1FA1D104F34C818976B453","orcidId":"0000-0002-7526-3097","documentHash":"7d3289a8-2522-46b8-b8df-d75984555f4f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62ed0a42409707218863b656","doi":"10.3390/app12031721","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/3/1721","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Approaching the Attosecond Frontier of Dynamics in Matter with the Concept of X-ray Chronoscopy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have provided scientists opportunities to study matter with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions. However, access to the attosecond domain (i.e., below 1 femtosecond) remains elusive.

The proposed X-ray chronoscopy approach exploits the state-of-the-art developments in terahertz streaking to measure the time structure of X-ray pulses with ultrahigh temporal resolution. The sub-femtosecond dynamics of the saturable X-ray absorption process is simulated. The employed rate equation model confirms that the X-ray-induced mechanisms leading to X-ray transparency can be probed via measurement of an X-ray pulse time structure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1721","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c6878c28a0473c3772","62ed0a42409707218863b658","5e709425878c28a0473b72a9","62ed0a42409707218863b65a","62ed0a42409707218863b65b","60c2fcee9543c723365434a5","62ed0a42409707218863b65d","62ed0a42409707218863b65e","62ed0a42409707218863b65f","5e70928e878c28a047397c2c","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8a20a31f-8131-4357-899d-7b8f694df717"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa33c42467f013ba90c63e","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"3","documentHash":"c55ce275-e29f-44a4-a326-024196bc27b4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL)","X-ray chronoscopy","nonlinear X-ray-matter interaction","sub-femtosecond X-ray techniques"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058214791"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f4cdc240970737355c1967","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"ccf0c846-907a-46f6-83f1-1f07bfcab612"},{"objectId":"62f4cdc240970737355c1966","name":"Soumitra","lastName":"Satapathi","documentHash":"eb316941-6e12-4b42-8026-4368bcc5f08d"},{"objectId":"62f4cdc240970737355c1965","name":"Mohammad Mahdi","lastName":"Tavakoli","documentHash":"01080ea2-495f-4819-a2e4-1c10cc953fd4"},{"objectId":"62f4cdc240970737355c1964","name":"Abul","lastName":"Kalam","documentHash":"49636f0c-41c3-4ed8-ad52-c9c2602d99c8"},{"objectId":"62f4cdc240970737355c1963","name":"Manoj","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"30df7b31-499d-46ae-a848-cd42450de35a"},{"objectId":"62f4cdc240970737355c1962","name":"Manoj","lastName":"Pandey","documentHash":"bf426118-03e3-4883-80fa-74b68684bbff"},{"objectId":"62f4cdc240970737355c1961","name":"Nishi","lastName":"Parikh","documentHash":"06270afb-7c10-4725-a819-31b935751345"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62f4cdc240970737355c195f","doi":"10.1016/j.egyr.2022.06.047","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352484722011878?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Identifying dominant recombination mechanisms in spiro-based conventional perovskite solar cells: Roles of interface and bulk recombination","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been popular in the photovoltaic (PV) community, owing to their ease of processing and high efficiency. In order to improve their device performance, the interfaces are believed to play a vital role. In this regard, the interfacial energies and the associated physical processes such as charge transport, accumulation and recombination have been the focus of the research community. Despite the rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and all development, PSCs still suffer from the charge carrier recombination. As a result, highly efficient PSCs cannot meet the theoretical values of fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage ( VOC). Therefore, to reach out to the theoretical limit of performance for PSCs, carrier recombination needs to be controlled both in the bulk and at the corresponding interfaces. Herein, we have systematically studied the recombination in PSCs by establishing the role of different layers of PSCs using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To get insights into the role of different layers in recombination we fabricated PSCs with n-ip configuration and changed the thickness of TiO2 electron transport layer (ETL), absorber layer, and spiro-OMeTAD hole transport layer (HTL). Our results suggest that the recombination is reduced in case of devices with thicker HTL and is trap-assisted recombination. These results are in good agreement with impedance spectroscopy analysis. The value of recombination resistance (extracted by fitting of Nyquist response) is higher at VOC, which is consistent with higher VOC in these two cases. In case of the increased ETL thickness, the performance of the device is dropped since the increased interfacial resistance encourages the recombination. Our study presents a simple and effective approach to elucidate the dominating recombination sites in PSCs and improve the device performance.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

With the advancement and progress in the study of MHP SCs, it is found that the properties at the surface and bulk of SCs are significantly different. However, there are only a few studies present for the facet-dependent performance of MHP SCs. In this work, we have systematically investigated the anisotropic properties of naturally exposed facets ((100) and (112)) in MAPbI3 SCs. We studied the influence of temperature and illumination on the properties of these facets. It was found that hysteresis at the (112) facet is higher than that at the (100) facet because of the higher trap density of 1.17 x 10(13) cm(-3) at this facet as compared to the trap density of 2.11 x 10(12) cm(-3) for the (100) facet. Although there exist different kinds of defects at both the facets, the ion migration mechanism remains the same at both facets, which is confirmed by the obtained almost same activation energy of 0.378 and 0.308 eV for (100) and (112) facets, respectively, for ion migration. The photocurrent, responsivity, and EQE values further confirm anisotropic properties of both the facets in MAPbI(3) SCs although they are the same from the crystallography point of view. Thus, this study provides a detailed and systematic investigation of the facet-dependent properties in MHP SCs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"126","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"8906-8912","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62fc9eac4097074498b0b3fc","62fc9eac4097074498b0b3fd","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","62fc9eac4097074498b0b3fe","62fc9eac4097074498b0b3ff","62fc9eac4097074498b0b400","62fc9eac4097074498b0b401","62fc9eac4097074498b0b402"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a2","mniswId":"12286","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry.

For several years, there has been increased attention on the use of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for the detection of CTCs. SERS is a non-destructive, accurate and precise technique, and the use of special SERS platforms even enables the amplification of weak signals from biological objects. In the current study, we demonstrate the unique arrangement of the SERS technique combined with the deposition of CTCs cells on the surface of the SERS platform via a dielectrophoretic effect. The appropriate frequencies of an alternating electric field and a selected shape of the electric field can result in the efficient deposition of CTCs on the SERS platform. The geometry of the microfluidic chip, the type of the cancer cells and the positive dielectrophoretic phenomenon resulted in the trapping of CTCs on the surface of the SERS platform. We presented results for two type of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, deposited from the 0.1 PBS solution. The limit of detection (LOD) is 20 cells/mL, which reflects the clinical potential and usefulness of the developed approach.

The stickiness of the A-TiO2-BiOBr-Bt wet cake and the low drying temperature make A-TiO2-BiOBr-Bt a feasible platform composite for the fabrication of the photoreactive inner coating of water treatment containers for photocatalytic treatment of drinking water. The A-TiO2-BiOBr-Bt photocatalyst with an A-TiO2:BiOBr:Bt mass ratio of 1:1:2 (Ti(1)Bi(1)Bt(2)) displayed the highest BET surface area of 124.8 m(2)/g, a low bandgap of 2.86 eV, and sufficiently low electron-hole recombination rate. The high number of A-TiO2-BiOBr p-n heterojunctions, and the Ti-O-Si and Bi-O-Si bonds between A-TiO2-BiOBr and Bt in Ti(1)Bi(1)Bt(2) lowered its electron-hole recombination rate with enhanced visible light-harvesting ability. Within 70 min of visible light irradiation, 150 mg of Ti(1)Bi(1)Bt(2) gave 100% conversion of 100 mL of 20 ppm phenol with a pseudo-first-order rate constant of 0.0322 min(-1) at pH 4.0. Scavenging experiments showed superoxide radicals (O-2(-center dot)) and electrons (e-) being the most dominant reactive oxidation species (ROS) responsible for the phenol photodegradation process while holes (h(+)) and hydroxyl radicals ((OH)-O-center dot) also exerted appreciable participation.

The enzyme concentration limit was found where the description of the M-M model breaks. It was shown that the system determines the kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions: Vmax—the maximum rate of reaction and KM—the Michaelis constant.

(PBF-LB) is a commonly used additive manufacturing (3D printing) process for the fabrication of various parts from pure metals and their alloys. This work shows for the first time the possibility of using PBF-LB technology for the production of 3D titanium substrates (Ti 3D) for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements. Thanks to the specific development of the 3D titanium surface and its nanoscale modification by the formation of TiO2 nanotubes with a diameter of ~80 nm by the anodic oxidation process, very efficient SERS substrates were obtained after deposition of silver nanoparticles (0.02 mg/cm2, magnetron sputtering). The average SERS enhancement factor equal to 1.26 × 106 was determined for pyridine (0.05 M + 0.1 M KCl), as a model adsorbate. The estimated enhancement factor is comparable with the data in the literature, and the substrate produced in this way is characterized by the high stability and repeatability of SERS measurements. The combination of the use of a printed metal substrate with nanofunctionalization opens a new path in the design of SERS substrates for applications in analytical chemistry. Methods such as SEM scanning microscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) were used to determine the morphology, structure and chemical composition of the fabricated materials"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb66"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","60dda4479543c7233654463c","5e7093d9878c28a0473b1e03","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"3108","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628e1b0e40970776244d2347","628e1b0e40970776244d2348","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb66","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","5e7093d9878c28a0473b1e03","60dda4479543c7233654463c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"626a20d14097075861ca3148","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"9","documentHash":"2e06daf9-85bc-40a7-9070-f8ecab5c9971"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["additive manufacturing; ;  ; ;","powder bed fusion (PBF)","CP titanium","anodic oxidation","TiO2 nanotubes","Ag nanoparticles","SERS platforms","plasmonic substrates"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058254706"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c32f759543c72336544028","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Zbonikowski","uuid":"E25732A6ACDE02743F9F906A933A6757F4B737A0260153E72970A6BCFDE691EA1C24C5547CC2F14AD23D2700E5102EEAB2D53C059CB3E79BEE06CD6DB7DDF399","documentHash":"5fd44a6e-8e9a-49c8-b194-772af721e253"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bab","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Moś","uuid":"9FE69A6B065AC7CC93190206705F356507B9BF6EAF71547ED6BF5FC7658553B720B398719C7A0929E568CD5F3141C40AA54ABAA2AA69DBCC6677BA3C91E13AE7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1486-9263","documentHash":"0ca42072-1d6c-4267-997b-b14884105d2b"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","name":"Jan","lastName":"Paczesny","uuid":"22569BA0D9E03A26F0A64D7FCE396ED2ABE848430876A29510DE2522F2961D44598990961BF4B864621D02EECDE361E0D5D41E3F1FDFCA243A5BC52483EC38B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-3951","documentHash":"6d641bb0-96ee-402e-ac7c-55829c1da4b4"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ccb","name":"Karol","lastName":"Stasiewicz","uuid":"B567B635A554869C7D0D582CFE75D1D28DA330AE681A78A8A95304BC34378487C37490B423595A46D49D6C3E66F0DAB8FAB4264A545DF030FADBD18AB95C6142","orcidId":"0000-0002-7497-4380","documentHash":"e57873c7-526f-4c6d-91b7-765b4b2a95af"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399cb5","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Marć","uuid":"FC607B054C196033138D49FAC45A8F68CCCA948CBB7B2D0EC4B13E1CA21254206CABD9998DB3561B96D60170DA23AFAD18B2D87BBCD6334F7B84A4FAD036206C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7328-0088","documentHash":"483b10a0-449b-4c62-bc4c-6aa11071db69"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ca5","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Jaroszewicz","uuid":"7CA191660DBEC04D0EEDDC929AD871BFA5B2F201541CB2EF9AC7A7375F70D3C63A1B5184B51CC84527503ED2A8729DE6F5914100D4C4461DC4E0AD2B7F37A272","orcidId":"0000-0001-8838-5846","documentHash":"de0509b7-faa0-4f67-a4ec-d3ef3e52fd7d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"635927a04097076d018f127f","doi":"10.3390/engproc2022021033","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4591/21/1/33/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Research on Optical Properties of a Tapered Optical Fiber with Higher Alkane Cladding Doped with Fe3O4 Nanoparticles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The presented research shows the effect of mixing Fe3O4 nanoparticles with higher alkanes on the propagation of the light wave in a biconical, adiabatic optical fiber taper. A fiber optic taper makes it possible to directly influence the light parameters inside the taper without the necessity of leading the beam out of the structure. The mixture of alkanes and Fe3O4 nanoparticles forms a special cladding surrounding the fiber taper, which can be controlled by temperature and magnetic fields. The results show changes in beam intensity and polarization properties, such as the azimuth; ellipticity, depending on mixture temperature, aggregation of nanoparticles, and different applied magnetic fields. The taper is made of a standard single-mode telecommunication fiber, pulled out to a length of 25.0 ± 0.5 mm. The diameter of the tapers is around 8.0 ± 0.3 μm. Such a taper causes the beam to leak out of a waist structure and allows the addition of external beam-controlling cladding material. The built-in sensor containing nanoparticles operates according to the on-off principle, as well as with changes in the nanoparticles’ position around the taper. Nanoparticles added to the alkanes cause an increase in hysteresis via a heating and cooling process. Magnetic particles can change their positional influence on the light propagation and polarization parameters. Such a mixture also creates a significant shift in the temperature characteristics during the heating process, in which the mixture changes its physical state with the simultaneous slight shifting of the characteristics during cooling. The data covers a wide spectral range of 500 to 1700 nm. Temperature tests for the selected lengths in the visible and infrared range are determined."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i

X-ray structures of two hydrates of trans-1 demonstrate a very different alignment of the azobenzene linkage, which is involved in T-shape or parallel-displaced π⋯π stacking interactions with the pyridine-2,6-dicarboxamide moieties from the macrocyclic backbone. Despite the rigidity of the macrocyclic framework, which generates a large steric hindrance around the azobenzene chromophore, the host 1 retains the ability to undergo a reversible cis⟷trans isomerization upon irradiation with UVA (368 nm) and blue (410 nm) light. Moreover, thermal cis→trans back-isomerization (ΔG0 = 106.5 kJ∙mol−1, t½ = 141 h) is markedly slowed down as compared to the non-macrocyclic analog. 1H NMR titration experiments in DMSO-d6/0.5% water solution reveal that trans-1 exhibits a strong preference for dihydrogenphosphate (H2PO4−) over other anions (Cl−, MeCO2−, and PhCO2−), whereas the photogenerated metastable cis-1 shows lower affinity for the H2PO4− anion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709420878c28a0473b6c1a","608a94189543c73526c48c76","5e70936e878c28a0473a965f","5e70949d878c28a0473c06db","5e709352878c28a0473a743c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b3878c28a04739afe8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"692","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70936e878c28a0473a965f","5e7092b3878c28a04739afe8","608a94189543c73526c48c76","5e70949d878c28a0473c06db","5e709420878c28a0473b6c1a","5e709352878c28a0473a743c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e1cce32467f00328313fea","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"2","documentHash":"6feccc50-4f6d-4a2d-a4de-8b8445857aea"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058275492"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf954","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Golec","uuid":"D89DE74BC6EEDE0855F152DB93980D45E50DB125C1999B86D64CC14A090A9AE48CC4FB4B428EC932AEE9928ABC85D03595A1E2062597134F8C673C19A06F1DB8","orcidId":"0000-0001-9818-1716","documentHash":"af5cd524-2b6f-4acf-8736-381bebb811c9"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a0473916f1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Sałdyka","uuid":"F62F3DD872DBD1EF11B1F87E46AA8C2A6674C14A98BD447021A30FEE6A027034608124B74F0298B05E0CEF353FE1F8F749CF1772CD06C51626E96D97397DBF2C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5000-2640","documentHash":"9a1d9d83-67c4-4e58-94b0-75ce4cc9d9df"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a0473915e7","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Mielke","uuid":"899762ECE51193DD1AD5787289FD00684D0DDE7108829D03C8F5141A7B7F15261D04D2A24DBBFFF7A33C8EB29CF990A1297A905A4E31C31C306B7577FA8C4D0C","documentHash":"d97c74c4-71e0-40af-abbd-2c688dc09138"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6363b2d54097077852cbb14a","doi":"10.3390/molecules27154797","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules27154797","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Photo-Induced Reactions between Glyoxal and Hydroxylamine in Cryogenic Matrices","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, the photochemistry of glyoxal–hydroxylamine (<b>Gly–HA</b>) complexes is studied using FTIR matrix isolation spectroscopy and ab initio calculations.

This photocathode consists of a dye-sensitized p-type nickel oxide (NiO) with a perylene-based chromophore (PCA) and a tetra-adamantane modified cobaloxime reduction catalyst (Co) that photo-reduces aqueous protons to H2. An original supramolecular approach was employed, using β-cyclodextrin functionalized gold nanoparticles (β-CD-AuNPs) to link the alkane chain of the PCA dye to the adamantane moieties of the cobaloxime catalyst (Co). This new architecture was investigated by photoelectrochemical measurements and via femtosecond-transient absorption spectroscopy. The results show that irradiation of the complete NiO|PCA|β-CD-AuNPs|Co electrode leads to ultrafast hole injection into NiO (π = 3 ps) from the excited dye, followed by rapid reduction of the catalyst, and finally H2 evolution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"51","issue":"41","pagesFromTo":"15716-15724","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["636a20374097073ba71003b2","636a20374097073ba71003b3","636a20374097073ba71003b4","636a20374097073ba71003b5","636a20374097073ba71003b6","636a20374097073ba71003b7","622036397523402df08c206c","636a20374097073ba71003b8","636a20374097073ba71003b9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778f6","mniswId":"4868","title":"Dalton Transactions","doi":"10.1039/c5dt","issn":"1477-9226","eissn":"1477-9234","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/dt","documentHash":"36c7053d-ce23-4ec3-9b37-3552e1f9c3ba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636a20374097073ba71003b1","year":"2022","volume":"51","number":"41","documentHash":"2bc7630f-0849-4dd1-bcb5-982bb010c1a3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058290087"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"636a45504097073ba714e60e","name":"Anthony W.","lastName":"Coleman","documentHash":"85df7f67-9b95-4f04-917c-50213f8e9002"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff85","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Leśniewska","uuid":"4F175C90B33C4916E9F3B2271BE114C4E498913E73BC2BA852C16FA12A2C19E4942BE331DB42E9596A5D38E96B8E51E1A1416802A37B8CC384C622E34F27028A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2992-4472","documentHash":"828886eb-c8d9-4dcf-a473-8558171a2333"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b1f7","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Suwińska","uuid":"24BE098843C77F3ADDBF3000057D49624160051E349E7CB8F0344361038314196E279419350F51756EA5754F269EA6A56F12E673A7B66A8BF1CE75B18D3DA53B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6702-0773","documentHash":"3c1c0169-1014-4163-9ddb-8a7cb5681e6c"}],"objectId":"636a45504097073ba714e60c","doi":"10.1021/acs.cgd.2c00578","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.cgd.2c00578","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Host–Guest Complexation of the <i>para</i>-Sulfonato-calix[4]arene Receptor with Biomolecules","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"para-Sulfonato-calix[4]arene has been shown to be an excellent receptor for many biomolecules.

Here, we focus on predicting the electronic spectra of polyynic nitriles HC2m+1N (m = 0-13) and dinitriles NC2n+2N (n = 0-14). The results of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations are compared with the available gas-phase and noble gas matrix experimental data. We assessed the performance of fifteen functionals and five basis sets for reproducing (i) vibrationless electronic excitation energies and (ii) vibrational frequencies in the singlet excited states. We found that the basis sets of at least triple-zeta quality were necessary to describe the long molecules with alternate single and triple bonds. Vibrational frequency scaling factors are similar for the ground and excited states. The benchmarked spectroscopic parameters were shown to be acceptably reproduced with adequately chosen functionals, in particular omega B97X, CAM-B3LYP, B3LYP, B971, and B972. Select functionals were applied to study the electronic excitation of molecules up to HC27N and C30N2. It is demonstrated that optical excitation leads to a shift from the polyyne- to a cumulene-like electronic structure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b0b8","5e709411878c28a0473b5ae6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"5829","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709411878c28a0473b5ae6","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0b8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6328465a409707636fd20a93","year":"2022","volume":"27","number":"18","documentHash":"e7d0c69f-3603-4a80-a5a7-9c27fe5dc373"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["polyynes/nitriles/TD-DFT/oligomers/nanowire/spectroscopy/electronic states/orbitals/quantum chemistry/vibrational frequencies"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058298006"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c333b79543c7233654409d","name":"Yaroslav","lastName":"Harkavyi","orcidId":"0000-0002-0148-5236","documentHash":"b11b9dcd-1b76-4bc3-99bb-5f6cabe4a33e"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf939","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Rozynek","uuid":"198D46B4175A7AA543A3BCD007C28611C2FC9E5098AB9DD70700C6BD7A0AF4212DCE5F21439CC83B331C2598A2B4A103F6F550A29D6E9EB55AE47B6A92C87ED6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0785-7088","documentHash":"f4491721-0128-4410-9c83-2a12d426111e"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Giżyński","uuid":"7AEDD73DD5B1257841075AC646D7AF5FC2472AC6E46D6B167FA3D962FDEFA3E257CD7B398C64DC6A04810369674D2DCA9ABA0C97270D398AA0B697F0E2F788ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-3547-1174","documentHash":"1424e1a0-06b3-460a-9b83-8855874b6421"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6375130a4097073f405a9353","doi":"10.1016/j.matdes.2022.111233","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2022.111233","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Fabrication of 1D particle structures outside a liquid environment using electric and capillary interactions: From fundamentals to applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Assembling microparticles into one-dimensional (1D) particle structures formed outside a liquid environment is challenging. This greatly hinders possible applications of such structures and the development of new materials. Herein, we demonstrate a simple, efficient, and easy-to-implement method for fabricating one particle–thick chain-like structures. Electrically conductive particles, initially dispersed in a nonpolar and weakly conductive liquid, are pulled out of the liquid using an electric field supported by capillary action. We study in detail how capillary and electric interactions, viscosity and ionic conductivity of the dispersing phase, particle shape, size and density, and pulling rate affect the general performance\nof our method. Our experimental results reveal that different types of microparticles can be assembled within seconds to form long chains. We found that capillary forces help aligning particles and creating single particle–resolution structures. The results show that dispersing liquids with large viscosity and low ionic conductivity are preferred as they reduce the negative effect of ionic screening. In the second part of our research, we investigate the physical properties of the produced beaded structures that we deem intriguing for both fundamental and applied research. We finally demonstrate that 1D particle structures can be used to design electrically conductive micropaths."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df43","uid":"bCjf_69LHgvLIIhL_6qbloQ","uuid":"77fec22f-f1d8-4df9-b027-d9855e96e1b2","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c333b79543c7233654409d","5e709490878c28a0473bf939"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","parentUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","rootUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942a878c28a0473b7770"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"223","pagesFromTo":"111233","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709490878c28a0473bf939","60c333b79543c7233654409d","5e70942a878c28a0473b7770"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc32","mniswId":"13966","title":"Materials and Design","issn":"0264-1275","eissn":"1873-4197","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"f1dd2bfa-0a4b-42bb-a055-f054e3162498"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6375130a4097073f405a9354","year":"2022","number":"223","doi":"10.1016/j.matdes.2022.111233","documentHash":"d8fc458f-debe-4fc6-8bae-252140922964"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058298184"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b31fe","name":"Helena","lastName":"Butkiewicz","uuid":"D232F9D985FE7B0F4D1C71F17286C11073AD44259C84B043A0768F54075F7631B694DC0A3601B0F8CC2CB98DD4081CE15C9499EA7D40B8862715C2667CEF28FB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7962-3603","documentHash":"9259d605-a4e3-4885-bad3-f33ceec4ab68"},{"objectId":"5e7093e8878c28a0473b314c","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Kosiorek","uuid":"FA91E94A82CA22A29665C945F2906CBD75A61AB865B3F97174E6A2880591C040D4BE85B5A6C721F21830BFC114CF86F124A98D4D6581B0C49360856D36BC0C31","orcidId":"0000-0002-1031-3671","documentHash":"0cded3b7-3988-437a-b1bb-e8dfae244107"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"ZIMNICKA","uuid":"A55C0BB9A722626ED739F12F4A22CDE94CB1EC75940370352BA67451BC7314661DB3D1A87480093FDCC4D5E9D484F65E0D59586A06E48D96DBAE154A187AC197","orcidId":"0000-0001-5078-4374","documentHash":"fb860716-0b74-492f-b357-d38392a505cd"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Danylyuk","uuid":"76C9B1CC8BF786B245E6E064FB1EF762E68427200C6553653512B713F436D343D13A0FB2F4895E1A41BC3AF4C15135CAD6F23994A9FF03CEFCD8BF9C0FB1D1C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3653-2418","documentHash":"f0349659-5182-4ae8-aa50-8a56d0ae53e1"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Sashuk","uuid":"7B9E651603C44ECD7E173B7A34E505E79330EDF4DD04B973310915D4CB9C3A93FE2EC7E76F47936D6F44735FB425946716A2A46CE201074FC33F28CEE87FCD58","orcidId":"0000-0002-5907-8596","documentHash":"2b6c5410-3288-40e9-b679-a6627af57d6d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-14","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62c2a0a240970721cb8e29ab","doi":"10.1021/acs.cgd.1c01201","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.cgd.1c01201","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Inclusion of Pentamidine in Carboxylated Pillar[5]arene: Late Sequential Crystallization and Diversity of Host–Guest Interactions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Here we describe the inclusion of the minor-groove binding drug pentamidine in its extended conformation into the macrocyclic cavity of water-soluble carboxylated pillar[5]arene. The artificial host-guest system is manifested as an ensemble of three crystalline forms differing in the pillar[5]arene-pentamidine interaction mode, solvation type, and even stoichiometry. The strong hydrogen bonds of various types of amidinium-carboxylate (between pentamidine and pillar[5]arene) and carboxylic-carboxylate (between adjacent pillar[5]arenes) are realized in all complexes, rigidifying the assembly. However, it seems that more subtle effects, such as local solvation/desolvation, a certain degree of flexibility of both the host and guest, and variable protonation/deprotonation state of the pillar[5]arene substituents, play significant roles in the peculiar crystallization behavior of the system. The snapshots of three crystal structures highlighting various binding geometries and intermolecular interaction modes between the same host and guest present exciting opportunities in terms of more holistic models of the host-guest systems, shifting from focusing our attention on \"visible interactions\" in one crystal structure to the appreciation of many subtle effects playing a combined role in the host-guest chemistry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e8878c28a0473b314c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","5e7093ea878c28a0473b31fe","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"2854-2862","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b31fe","5e7093e8878c28a0473b314c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547784f","mniswId":"4571","title":"Crystal Growth & Design","issn":"1528-7483","eissn":"1528-7505","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a74fd0a5-1a2c-4144-b4de-f61e8704ecc7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6283481840970702b8804fc7","year":"2022","volume":"22","number":"5","documentHash":"d85c647c-971e-4bc4-9a12-68e4faad5c0d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058298372"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c40c3f4097077bbdbe42f3","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Ryl","documentHash":"5ae0e437-28d6-4c67-9f8f-53df2562caee"},{"objectId":"62c40c3f4097077bbdbe42ee","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Cieslik","documentHash":"06cc830d-7287-41c1-a6e6-3d96e175325d"},{"objectId":"60c2fdcf9543c72336543753","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Celej","uuid":"9F7D4DE58F01E2796C72454EACF9E3C7935FA4FEF54703BA87899DDB81D739F8FF058BCC347CF719BFDE4A90DC73079BE9FD4F41E298BB5F35F97A1DDCEB16B1","documentHash":"db540b5c-de0e-4007-97ab-3e3a690377ad"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e3","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jendrzejewski","uuid":"3DAB47F4D22BECB860B8DC3CBEDFCF685C0D04780897800B840020D724FF52259A3B3A622D633D5FD148CF7DE4B9A05A2D10A303E962E449C75E37C188014B4B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3939-5874","documentHash":"5cbe5956-c0dd-4240-843e-b36e4a584f29"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"},{"objectId":"5e7092b0878c28a04739ab99","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sawczak","uuid":"54951DFA0C8FB8C7453816CFAA68CD5E017306D7BBFB81DBF91DD18B905192197BE19357C2048CB7DD9FE99398E95A3CA38938250CCFA31B7197CD26E8D01F84","orcidId":"0000-0002-1365-5351","documentHash":"51cf7e20-b139-48b5-9dbc-b3b52fafe05a"}],"objectId":"62c40c3f4097077bbdbe42ec","doi":"10.1016/j.electacta.2022.140288","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013468622004571?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Locally sculptured modification of the electrochemical response of conductive poly(lactic acid) 3D prints by femtosecond laser processing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This manuscript presents an approach to sculpture high electrochemical activity of the 3D printed electrodes with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) matrix and carbon black (CB) filler by femtosecond laser (FSL) ablation. CB-PLA utility for electrochemical applications depends on a surface modification aiming to remove the PLA and uncover the conductive CB. We have discussed how laser pulse energy is critical for such an activation process. The best performance was obtained for 4.1 J cm(-2), while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows only partial evaporation of PLA at lower energy densities. Next, we have confirmed the efficiency of locally sculptured CBPLA surface activation by FSL treatment, obtaining high linearity between electrochemically active surface and FSL-treated surface from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies. The electrode's efficient sculpturing of stripes 0.2 mm in width was confirmed with electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Finally, by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy, we confirmed no significant oxidation of the CB filler after FSL treatment. We revealed significant differences with ablation by longer nanosecond laser pulses, where significant heat transferred to the electrode surface contributed to partial melting and re-solidification of the PLA, negatively influencing the activation efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","60c2fdcf9543c72336543753"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"416","pagesFromTo":"140288","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c40c3f4097077bbdbe42ee","5e7092b0878c28a04739ab99","5e709410878c28a0473b59e3","60c2fdcf9543c72336543753","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","62c40c3f4097077bbdbe42f3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a67","mniswId":"5553","title":"Electrochimica Acta","issn":"0013-4686","eissn":"1873-3859","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/electrochimica-acta/","documentHash":"9acc56c7-cbf9-4da3-b4ef-7d0a9cfd7d71"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c40c3f4097077bbdbe42f5","year":"2022","volume":"416","documentHash":"fb386322-513d-4736-9510-5629482f8ad2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058300991"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602e1df49543c7410626ecb8","name":"Ashmita","lastName":"Bose","uuid":"2961E3C4FC50753B299D2248B3E33DB5BBE101A6E041B06E43FC90CBFC5DA3063BAAD625B6FF1DE3DEC01D0489C4E760EC0F94A66AD36ABAC3D5FE274820C86B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6961-1059","documentHash":"631336d2-f582-41d1-90f1-81dc28355611"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Górecki","uuid":"5C1C88BEF5066E9C3874BDB6264294C1392BD86C12A9F48FB84DCDF91ECC0D7892866EA7D364E14630DDA5138F0746E07B789269886028DCDB2ABF6BD86EA9B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4574-0083","documentHash":"95958b83-8129-419e-8027-969462b967a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62c4331b4097077bbdbfa6c0","doi":"10.3389/fchem.2022.848685","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2022.848685/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Computing With Networks of Chemical Oscillators and its Application for Schizophrenia Diagnosis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Chemical reactions are responsible for information processing in living organisms, yet biomimetic computers are still at the early stage of development. The bottom-up design strategy commonly used to construct semiconductor information processing devices is not efficient for chemical computers because the lifetime of chemical logic gates is usually limited to hours. It has been demonstrated that chemical media can efficiently perform a specific function like labyrinth search or image processing if the medium operates in parallel. However, the number of parallel algorithms for chemical computers is very limited. Here we discuss top-down design of such algorithms for a network of chemical oscillators that are coupled by the exchange of reaction activators. The output information is extracted from the number of excitations observed on a selected oscillator. In our model of a computing network, we assume that there is an external factor that can suppress oscillations. This factor can be applied to control the nodes and introduce input information for processing by a network. We consider the relationship between the number of oscillation nodes and the network accuracy. Our analysis is based on computer simulations for a network of oscillators described by the Oregonator model of a chemical oscillator. As the example problem that can be solved with an oscillator network, we consider schizophrenia diagnosis on the basis of EEG signals recorded using electrodes located at the patient’s scalp. We demonstrated that a network formed of interacting chemical oscillators can process recorded signals and help to diagnose a patient. The parameters of considered networks were optimized using an evolutionary algorithm to achieve the best results on a small training dataset of EEG signals recorded from 45 ill and 39 healthy patients. For the optimized networks, we obtained over 82% accuracy of schizophrenia detection on the training dataset. The diagnostic accuracy can be increased to almost 87% if the majority rule is applied to answers of three networks with different number of nodes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e1df49543c7410626ecb8","5e7092b4878c28a04739b050"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"848685","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e1df49543c7410626ecb8","5e7092b4878c28a04739b050"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1ac","mniswId":"6833","title":"Frontiers in Chemistry","issn":"2296-2646","eissn":"2296-2646","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0a6d3380-36a7-4f86-b584-b5ea2f1a2bf5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6225f0a52467f0548a02ab67","year":"2022","volume":"10","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"fd9a0a08-4968-4cae-ba6b-92db2e2bffba"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058301047"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c57c384097074de227a1ed","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Jopa","documentHash":"c15e01ba-644d-493b-b72c-817c94765924"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfad1","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Pietrzak","uuid":"E8DF04DDCA10F855E190706F16473F2B981BC9AA81EE0C3B070AB01793F51E14AD955B1BE8F2FE714F6EABFE19FB821C719E12438C3ECD3B6BD5A272D1E02B74","orcidId":"0000-0002-0419-5613","documentHash":"17531e24-84bb-4e32-b43f-456e7518d073"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ratajczyk","uuid":"D7BF159D17AA3F44A08389A461C0C453E3CFA0D80BDD70361E3C3FDAABAB66937DFBCBEDC5E928A5269A3370C62BD41F00F01DF11D10C408342FED73975BA671","orcidId":"0000-0003-1613-6933","documentHash":"aafca08f-0cdd-4319-8133-314824720e0a"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa8f5","name":"Adam","lastName":"MAMES","uuid":"8420B7211E5333E6463250C9B633C1AC8084792BB4AA8684E065D10227F82EECDD8B33F41A4FB62C69F0CF5266D75B311A46CE9B147C87D0FE2805792ECD3758","orcidId":"0000-0002-0636-0264","documentHash":"1b5aee9d-e3ef-4e1b-bd6f-f2d934157e06"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-27","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62c57c374097074de227a1ea","doi":"10.1039/d2ra02872g","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/RA/D2RA02872G","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Deactivation of catalysts in simultaneous reversible and irreversible parahydrogen NMR signal enhancement, and the role of co-ligands in the stabilization of the reversible method","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE) and hydrogeneable Parahydrogen Induced Polarization (hPHIP) can enhance weak NMR signals, and thus increase the range of NMR applications.

Here, the possible cellular impact of kisspeptin receptor activation in a rat model of the early stage AD was assessed using whole-cell patch-clamp recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons and mo-lecular approaches. Compared to neurons from the control group, cells from the A beta-treated group displayed spontaneous and evoked hyperexcitability with lower spike frequency adaptation. These cells had also a lower sag ratio in response to hyperpolarizing prepulse current delivered before a depolarizing current injection. Neurons from the A beta-treated group exhibited short spike onset latency, lower rheobase and short utilization time compared with those in the control group. Furthermore, phase plot analysis of action potential showed that A beta treatment affected the action potential features. These electrophysiological changes induced by A beta were asso-ciated with increased expression of stromal interaction molecules (STIMs), particularly (STIM2) and decreased pCREB/CREB ratio. Treatment with KP-13 following A beta injection into the entorhinal cortex, however, prevented the excitatory effect of A beta on spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity, increased the latency of onset, enhanced the sag ratio, increased the rheobase and utilization time, and prevented the changes induced A beta on spike pa-rameters. In addition, the KP-13 application after A beta treatment reduced the expression of STIMs and increased the pCREB/CREB ratio compared to those receiving A beta treatment alone. In summary, these results provide ev-idence that activation of kisspeptin receptor may be effective against pathology of A beta.& nbsp;"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61e634397523406748fb0476"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"184","pagesFromTo":"13-23","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62cd2a124097073c6e2cc323","62cd2a124097073c6e2cc324","62cd2a124097073c6e2cc325","62cd2a124097073c6e2cc326","61e634397523406748fb0476","62cd2a124097073c6e2cc328","62cd2a124097073c6e2cc329","62cd2a124097073c6e2cc32a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477429","mniswId":"2759","title":"Brain Research Bulletin","doi":"10.1016/j.brainresbull","issn":"0361-9230","eissn":"1873-2747","websiteLink":"http://sciencedirect.com/science/journal/03619230","documentHash":"360bd1cb-608a-4314-8dd9-6b2777f5580d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cd2a124097073c6e2cc32c","year":"2022","volume":"184","documentHash":"b210554e-d8a9-4a96-9d1f-594d7b739709"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058304996"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c9","name":"Vijay K.","lastName":"Kuchroo","orcidId":"0000-0001-7177-2110","documentHash":"03573d70-1fb5-44cc-8099-60a60ed61ca7"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c8","name":"Ana C.","lastName":"Anderson","orcidId":"0000-0002-0877-2932","documentHash":"b26319f4-b749-40d6-8c84-9a314b7239a7"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c7","name":"Aviv","lastName":"Regev","orcidId":"0000-0003-3293-3158","documentHash":"43e79067-0eb1-4d45-ac44-22e9aef46db0"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c6","name":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","orcidId":"0000-0003-3084-6093","documentHash":"38b57f77-fbf8-4d1f-ad6f-390f4baae820"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c5","name":"Raymond A.","lastName":"Sobel","orcidId":"0000-0002-0477-9002","documentHash":"219bec9d-ca15-43cc-a1b3-5e2e3019e09d"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c4","name":"Orit","lastName":"Rozenblatt-Rosen","orcidId":"0000-0001-6313-3570","documentHash":"8986ed82-ea81-4891-b629-2563b96579b5"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c3","name":"Junrong","lastName":"Xia","orcidId":"0000-0002-2818-1494","documentHash":"183de4fe-6fe5-4188-b4cb-9d82a3038ce0"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c2","name":"Connor","lastName":"Lambden","documentHash":"93415337-b772-4b64-97a9-ac422ae0ee52"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c1","name":"Karen O.","lastName":"Dixon","orcidId":"0000-0001-7811-5439","documentHash":"010e3b78-e224-44ad-a098-3a4f3f01b84b"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c0","name":"Danyang","lastName":"He","orcidId":"0000-0002-3613-4188","documentHash":"d4788ef2-9f9c-43e2-b87c-fa0560974584"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7bf","name":"Yu","lastName":"Hou","orcidId":"0000-0001-7875-7087","documentHash":"51a5dd5c-e9c0-41e1-9203-1ac4a32b26f3"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7bd","name":"Vinee","lastName":"Purohit","orcidId":"0000-0001-8093-5540","documentHash":"7c07d3e7-016d-42a1-a082-84c5ac46ff46"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7bc","name":"Ayshwarya","lastName":"Subramanian","documentHash":"a4465706-a200-43d7-9c8c-6f6ec6f4f450"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7bb","name":"Nandini","lastName":"Acharya","documentHash":"27f545f8-1510-4144-87fe-6bf52ab35cb8"},{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7ae","name":"Ruihan","lastName":"Tang","documentHash":"84a76a56-2da2-4bc3-8fc1-4c64a836dee3"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Tabaka","uuid":"63697FD3BAC09928F64280F5418390BE3D248F95AC2532A406A81FFDA2B3351C3C89A72952149CCABF5343B29938E60A387ABB4069187BF56A4F9F7573805C11","documentHash":"ceceaf5b-e17d-4fcf-8907-5fa306db3dfe"}],"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7ac","doi":"10.1126/sciimmunol.abm0631","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abm0631","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Tim-3 adapter protein Bat3 acts as an endogenous regulator of tolerogenic dendritic cell function","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Dendritic cells (DCs) sense environmental cues and adopt either an immune-stimulatory or regulatory phenotype, thereby fine-tuning immune responses. Identifying endogenous regulators that determine DC function can thus inform the development of therapeutic strategies for modulating the immune response in different disease contexts. Tim-3 plays an important role in regulating immune responses by inhibiting the activation status and the T cell priming ability of DC in the setting of cancer. Bat3 is an adaptor protein that binds to the tail of Tim-3; therefore, we studied its role in regulating the functional status of DCs. In murine models of autoimmunity (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) and cancer (MC38-OVA-implanted tumor), lack of Bat3 expression in DCs alters the T cell compartment-it decreases T(H)1, T(H)17 and cytotoxic effector cells, increases regulatory T cells, and exhausted CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, resulting in the attenuation of autoimmunity and acceleration of tumor growth. We found that Bat3 expression levels were differentially regulated by activating versus inhibitory stimuli in DCs, indicating a role for Bat3 in the functional calibration of DC phenotypes. Mechanistically, loss of Bat3 in DCs led to hyperactive unfolded protein response and redirected acetyl-coenzyme A to increase cell intrinsic steroidogenesis. The enhanced steroidogenesis in Bat3-deficient DC suppressed T cell response in a paracrine manner. Our findings identified Bat3 as an endogenous regulator of DC function, which has implications for DC-based immunotherapies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"69","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7ae","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7bb","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7bc","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7bd","5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7bf","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c0","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c1","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c2","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c3","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c4","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c5","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c6","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c7","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c8","62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7c9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d2b9","mniswId":"18236","title":"Science Immunology","issn":"2470-9468","eissn":"2470-9468","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"41c9861d-a7ee-42ad-9803-759e65f730e5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cd5ca44097073c6e2fd7cb","year":"2022","volume":"7","number":"69","documentHash":"450db035-35e7-4402-910c-60e564c477e1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058305185"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62cc0c7f409707746ec6fbf2","name":"Luis M.","lastName":"Varela","documentHash":"17f78a86-24ec-4fe1-a7f5-2912566cf206"},{"objectId":"62cc0c7f409707746ec6fbf0","name":"Oscar","lastName":"Cabeza","documentHash":"98df9027-68aa-4bd4-a0a2-ce52784adb43"},{"objectId":"62cc0c7f409707746ec6fbef","name":"Martín","lastName":"Montoto","documentHash":"7ee58155-5b25-4079-8118-9e1f8fbbb5ce"},{"objectId":"62cc0c7f409707746ec6fbee","name":"Víctor","lastName":"Gómez-González","documentHash":"56b8139c-4e18-45db-ae0b-f9502a1a5304"},{"objectId":"62cc0c7f409707746ec6fbed","name":"Hadrián","lastName":"Montes-Campos","documentHash":"e20fb5db-2b93-48b2-9959-8c7eb037f278"},{"objectId":"62cc0c7f409707746ec6fbec","name":"José M.","lastName":"Otero-Mato","documentHash":"c06cac02-9ebf-4d0e-80d2-2c91ff5fd3f8"},{"objectId":"5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","uuid":"4C8E231D76FA1FF9DEBFB40938EB36AF89D302A9BF4FB4483D4EB2BD2B36DFFFCE516493C98DF050048768547005AB2F2AB230D9F072ED3FD77064BDE749E112","orcidId":"0000-0003-4448-0686","documentHash":"22911df0-6857-4e43-8285-ca3bbbff21b2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-01","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"62cc0c7f409707746ec6fbea","doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2022.118955","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0167732222004937?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Structure, dynamics and conductivities of ionic liquid-alcohol mixtures","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We study the microscopic structure and transport properties of ions in mixtures of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium and 1-butyl-3-ethylimidazolium iodide with ethanol using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and conductivity measurements. Compared with the same ionic liquids in water, we reveal essential differences in ionic structure that are closely related to the differences in the solubil-ity mechanisms of both types of solvents. In particular, unlike for aqueous solutions, we find a homoge-neous distribution of solvent molecules in the system, i.e., we observe no cluster formation, which agrees with the nano-structured solvation paradigm. In addition, we calculate the conductivities of these sys-tems in the whole concentration range and compare them with experimental data. Although the simu-lated values slightly underestimate the experimental ones, they reproduce the shape of the experimental conductivity dome reasonably well. We also show that the pseudo-lattice random-alloy model, which is based on microscopic ion jumping frequencies, describes the conductivity data accu-rately. We compute the average jumping frequencies directly from simulations and find that they agree well with those obtained by fitting the simulation conductivity data. These results show that the pseudo-lattice random-alloy model provides a valuable tool to describe the conductivities of ionic liquid-solvent mixtures and particularly their concentration dependence. It shall also apply to other systems, e.g., inor-ganic electrolytes and dispersed ionic conductors.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

The yields of the one-pot procedure are higher (40-81%) than those of the two-step procedure (32-70%)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4accd085dcb1e6ae0b89f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62cd43564097073c6e2de43b","62cd43564097073c6e2de43c","62cd43564097073c6e2de43d","62cd43564097073c6e2de43e","5fc4accd085dcb1e6ae0b89f","62cd43564097073c6e2de440","62cd43564097073c6e2de441","62cd43564097073c6e2de442"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798b8","mniswId":"19217","title":"Synthesis","issn":"    0039-7881","eissn":"1437-210X","websiteLink":"https://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/journal/10.1055/s-00000084","documentHash":"97341ccf-3c2d-4736-8d59-e132ab3ce5ff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cd43564097073c6e2de444","year":"2022","documentHash":"41455068-1f91-4303-be41-bb015c9f2fd7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058305432"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62cd65e44097073c6e30a1a0","name":"Jason D.","lastName":"Surratt","orcidId":"0000-0002-6833-1450","documentHash":"f9df6266-3185-4b06-952a-39a5a2743577"},{"objectId":"62cd65e44097073c6e30a19f","name":"Jonathan D.","lastName":"Krug","orcidId":"0000-0002-7045-7650","documentHash":"72f2301e-f63f-44a9-91b4-acc4aae0c447"},{"objectId":"62cd65e44097073c6e30a19e","name":"John H.","lastName":"Offenberg","documentHash":"6240550e-778e-4ffc-9e88-dc75f37f98a4"},{"objectId":"62cd65e44097073c6e30a19d","name":"Tadeusz E.","lastName":"Kleindienst","documentHash":"ee670555-e1bd-4a5f-8bbd-b6f9d6e061c7"},{"objectId":"62cd65e44097073c6e30a19c","name":"Michael","lastName":"Lewandowski","orcidId":"0000-0002-0058-956X","documentHash":"35697656-af3c-4ccc-ba47-ddde2b4166ac"},{"objectId":"62cd65e44097073c6e30a19b","name":"Domingo","lastName":"Gil-Casanova","documentHash":"dbcf367d-5b98-450c-b375-a9f4e05d0e4e"},{"objectId":"62cd65e34097073c6e30a19a","name":"Alicia","lastName":"Martinez-Romero","orcidId":"0000-0002-5197-0635","documentHash":"973c07da-aa69-4cba-8462-c9b15320d4dd"},{"objectId":"62cd65e34097073c6e30a197","name":"Mohammed","lastName":"Jaoui","documentHash":"d21111b0-dfb6-4ef5-bab2-c4620ce5e1e1"},{"objectId":"60c9a35f9543c72336544549","name":"Faria","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"39E07C71126CB953A6B883C26E5F4C804EF2DC42D09B487F7ADE91C38454A282EA2A936446C3EC478FBC847A59A72B733F78A89BEF7FBEBDEBB7AEEB94E073CA","documentHash":"6e021189-63b7-4547-9e0d-f8adf3c62257"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","name":"Karina","lastName":"Kwapiszewska","uuid":"B5FE41F14EEC666D304654994E6250629F4F330AF6CF26B5585E2C99E5641B03DFEB8EA8A3A168084B7D1ED1D12DA60714C2ED67A21A919BC975D9B8456110D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7396-9571","documentHash":"eb6a4320-99ed-48fa-8778-37744fd76b87"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5974","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rudziński","uuid":"3D506125510B3BBBBC100FED79F7B850A30F8D8147B86F25C7B7C88D7EE86B7DABC6B2827FC4B337FD7C25E356AF6293D4516CDEF0F0B5BB30FD46F7CBC466B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5785-9751","documentHash":"7412096e-82dd-41fd-a947-0b5456249825"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Szmigielski","uuid":"8BA441832175E89B21F79F78CE35C01EAE6DA9568D355F2A4BFC7D823AB2D6D5C83D7B8E06C8BBC3896462D090D1BFEEFF6AC20665089B7B419A5802C9DAD013","orcidId":"0000-0003-3389-9318","documentHash":"b9e87d98-9f5d-4922-852b-1896bf4792e3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62cd65e34097073c6e30a194","doi":"10.1016/j.envpol.2022.119010","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S026974912200224X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Cytotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by atmospheric mono-nitrophenols in human lung cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nitrophenols (NPs) are hazardous pollutants found in various environmental matrices, including ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), agricultural residues, rainwater, wildfires, and industrial wastes. This study showed for the first time the effect of three pure nitrophenols and their mixture on human lung cells to provide basic understanding of the NP influence on cell elements and processes. We identified NPs in ambient PM2.5 and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles generated from the photooxidation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the U.S. EPA smog chamber. We assessed the toxicity of identified NPs and their equimolar mixture in normal bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) and alveolar epithelial cancer (A549) lung cell lines. The inhibitory concentration-50 (IC50) values were highest and lowest in BEAS-2B cells treated with 2-nitrophenol (2NP) and 4nitrophenol (4NP), respectively, at 24 h of exposure. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay showed that 4NP, the most abundant NP we identified in PM2.5, was the most cytotoxic NP examined in both cell lines. The annexin-V/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) analysis showed that the populations of late apoptotic/necrotic BEAS-2B and A549 cells exposed to 3NP, 4NP, and NP equimolar mixture increased between 24 and 48 h. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) buildup led to cellular death post exposure to 3NP, 4NP and the NP mixtures, while 2NP induced the lowest ROS buildup. An increased mitochondrial ROS signal following NP exposure occurred only in BEAS-2B cells. The tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate (TMRM) assay showed that exposed cells exhibited collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. TMRM signals decreased significantly only in BEAS-2B cells, and most strongly with 4NP exposures. Our results suggest that acute atmospheric exposures to NPs may be toxic at high concentrations, but not at ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Further chronic studies with NP and NP-containing PM2.5 are warranted to assess their contribution to lung pathologies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c9a35f9543c72336544549","5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"301","pagesFromTo":"119010","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c9a35f9543c72336544549","62cd65e34097073c6e30a197","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974","5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","62cd65e34097073c6e30a19a","62cd65e44097073c6e30a19b","62cd65e44097073c6e30a19c","62cd65e44097073c6e30a19d","62cd65e44097073c6e30a19e","62cd65e44097073c6e30a19f","62cd65e44097073c6e30a1a0","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b0e","mniswId":"5835","title":"ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION","issn":"0269-7491","eissn":"1873-6424","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"feb1bcde-6ec7-4b98-9624-ea2e81646922"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cd65e44097073c6e30a1a3","year":"2022","volume":"301","documentHash":"84d79680-282a-4d35-94cf-d95c27660257"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058305559"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c344","name":"Andrey A.","lastName":"Zamyatnin","orcidId":"0000-0002-3046-4565","documentHash":"f6acfe64-45b7-4c8e-9063-74680282a1fe"},{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c343","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Parodi","documentHash":"696efc6d-e417-48f4-aa1f-245f37b25052"},{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c342","name":"Andrey Z.","lastName":"Vinarov","orcidId":"0000-0001-9510-9487","documentHash":"50381f26-c57c-4c76-b462-88b815eb5433"},{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c341","name":"Natalia V.","lastName":"Potoldykova","documentHash":"f99790b6-1d56-40bf-bb16-f16c0ac9998f"},{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c340","name":"Dmitry O.","lastName":"Korolev","documentHash":"8d760e35-1d0b-457b-8007-44e9d1affc2c"},{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c33f","name":"Darina V.","lastName":"Sokolova","orcidId":"0000-0003-3972-2425","documentHash":"2d830a35-5c34-4eec-8309-8b98405db11b"},{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c33e","name":"Vadim S.","lastName":"Pokrovsky","orcidId":"0000-0003-4006-9320","documentHash":"b75760db-1c0d-4b66-8be0-89c775f520e0"},{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c33d","name":"Neonila V.","lastName":"Gorokhovets","documentHash":"b7ad1310-34a4-4f93-8ead-6d7a4a5bec35"},{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c33c","name":"Anastasia V.","lastName":"Balakireva","documentHash":"e05b603f-8dec-40c2-8392-96337bfe71b8"},{"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c33b","name":"Anastasia S.","lastName":"Frolova","orcidId":"0000-0002-6980-0028","documentHash":"d0c15f33-c646-4723-8971-333fc05b4464"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a51","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Radecka","uuid":"56D2B30A2881E7CCA06DD1716969CA273A700024A53CF6938E93BDFA9DFEC2342337A4A16201FA797C4C1B385C54B565BC195350315E78F8B9E1626A93E67563","orcidId":"0000-0001-9912-2128","documentHash":"e429e0ae-db65-4cb8-8364-1b35837f11f1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62cbf015409707746ec5c338","doi":"10.3390/cells11091455","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/9/1455/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"In Silico, In Vitro, and Clinical Investigations of Cathepsin B and Stefin A mRNA Expression and a Correlation Analysis in Kidney Cancer","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The cysteine protease Cathepsin B (CtsB) plays a critical role in multiple signaling pathways, intracellular protein degradation, and processing. Endogenous inhibitors regulate its enzymatic activity, including stefins and other cystatins. Recent data proved that CtsB is implicated in tumor extracellular matrix remodeling, cell invasion, and metastasis: a misbalance between cathepsins and their natural inhibitors is often considered a sign of disease progression. In the present study, we investigated CtsB and stefin A (StfA) expression in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). mRNA analysis unveiled a significant CTSB and STFA increase in RCC tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerogenic tissues and a higher CtsB expression in malignant tumors than in benign renal neoplasms. Further analysis highlighted a positive correlation between CtsB and StfA expression as a function of patient sex, age, tumor size, grade, lymph node invasion, metastasis occurrence, and survival. Alternative overexpression and silencing of CtsB and StfA confirmed the correlation expression between these proteins in human RCC-derived cells through protein analysis and fluorescent microscopy. Finally, the ectopic expression of CtsB and StfA increased RCC cell proliferation. Our data strongly indicated that CtsB and StfA expression play an important role in RCC development by mutually stimulating their expression in RCC progression."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a51"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1455","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a51","62cbf015409707746ec5c33b","62cbf015409707746ec5c33c","62cbf015409707746ec5c33d","62cbf015409707746ec5c33e","62cbf015409707746ec5c33f","62cbf015409707746ec5c340","62cbf015409707746ec5c341","62cbf015409707746ec5c342","62cbf015409707746ec5c343","62cbf015409707746ec5c344"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bca9","mniswId":"3385","title":"Cells","issn":"2073-4409","eissn":"2073-4409","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3f0f9fd0-584c-4a82-9bc2-3080deec3a36"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"627bb428409707127179188b","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"9","documentHash":"f16a366e-2f97-4dc3-8817-200089693ee6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058305575"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fd859543c723365436a5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dusiło","uuid":"39B0D6E76B70F7168320D3265772A117770C2B5094291BC4EA306A9CA945B941AF71218E83FCFC84B062457F9179CCBFE65929F7499EE4F418051CF43D52C54C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6847-063X","documentHash":"c03e16a4-90ad-4d2d-aa48-130a48f446e8"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b002d","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Warczak","uuid":"9A73BBBF00AAFCF8C63902944899F5A1C8054299458227BE62C6D27338E9ACD2289E811817AD8956483A39DDB83C64ADCED24D1C994D5F57A2A452DC19840BFD","orcidId":"0000-0002-4589-4701","documentHash":"adc964fc-323f-43a3-8a4a-9916a69df006"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff75","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Kalisz","uuid":"3D6A2D91BDB6649BC2E3554AC4B4D1691290D977DCD8FCC2253A03AB74C5AA22EE5AC09EE05CCD4E443EE61F0A26ED8247097DA657DB5DE0897F05F28B96C029","orcidId":"0000-0002-4188-5074","documentHash":"644d8925-eb2a-4b35-b7c7-c417da3095d8"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Opałło","uuid":"ECB569ECB4125066F1DCDB9F48064E76F971F64BACACA1AFD7DBBBE80107D088337CBD1844ADDF79163AEED6F4FB8E817D076BC1662EF431F114EA1356D7929A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5872-7059","documentHash":"71cabfc4-5832-4f70-97cb-7c9b9abea0ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63779a4140970701fd42e251","doi":"10.1002/celc.202200513","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/celc.202200513","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Hydrogen Evolution, Oxygen Evolution, and Oxygen Reduction at Polarizable Liquid|Liquid Interfaces","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Research on hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions at polarizable liquid|liquid interfaces was reviewed.

Here we combine theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to show that skyrmions can spontaneously emerge in chiral active matter without external confinements or regulation. Strikingly, these activity-driven skyrmions can either self-organize into a periodic, stable square lattice consisting of half Neel skyrmions and antiskyrmions, where the in-plane flows display an antiferromagnetic vortex array, or undergo phase separation between skyrmions with different topological numbers. We identify that the emerging skyrmion dynamics stems from the competition between the chiral and polar coherence length scales dictated by the interplay of intrinsic chirality, polarity, and elasticity in the system. Our results reveal unanticipated topological excitations, self-organization, and phase separation in non-equilibrium systems and also suggest a potential way towards engineering complicated bespoke skyrmionic structures through manipulating active matter."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473afee8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"38","pagesFromTo":"7348-7359","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6377977840970701fd42d239","6377977840970701fd42d23a","6377977840970701fd42d23b","5e7093bd878c28a0473afee8","6377977840970701fd42d23c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547979e","mniswId":"18664","title":"Soft Matter","issn":"1744-683X","eissn":"1744-6848","documentHash":"59b57291-e9a9-4e2e-943b-c3f1410e26ac"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6377977840970701fd42d238","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"38","documentHash":"bff852de-c648-4937-9a6e-39fb87e333a6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058305774"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62d009fc40970733e796b161","name":"Volodymyr A.","lastName":"Yartys","documentHash":"07eef17c-1315-4c1a-bed5-0b4db56d5450"},{"objectId":"62d009fc40970733e796b15f","name":"Mikhail A.","lastName":"Kuzovnikov","documentHash":"b9f52709-d968-43d6-9e04-96352a2217c9"},{"objectId":"62d009fc40970733e796b15e","name":"Alexander I.","lastName":"Kolesnikov","documentHash":"47b5dc67-0528-40b0-a76a-f87d24b48829"},{"objectId":"62d009fc40970733e796b15d","name":"Alexandre S.","lastName":"Ivanov","documentHash":"4d29c1d7-91cd-4992-84ef-5ec43b217109"},{"objectId":"62d009fc40970733e796b15c","name":"Vladimir K.","lastName":"Fedotov","documentHash":"fab00c3d-a2ef-4711-a5b1-46262d0a5cfa"},{"objectId":"62d009fc40970733e796b15b","name":"Vladimir E.","lastName":"Antonov","documentHash":"d428a0ea-5ee9-4d91-b3fc-3998d8f5f511"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900de","name":"Marek","lastName":"Tkacz","uuid":"8B70F4141E0385F6F13B5919BEC00024E494D0625AD8AA2A3E966F7088F2D35E44E033B1909D3397A00C865227FEB19AACA655CD14AC27B01BA3C5807FA8E907","orcidId":"0000-0002-7253-7005","documentHash":"5f7aec6d-d5d0-4116-aed7-d415144a9473"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62d009fc40970733e796b159","doi":"10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164208","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0925838822005990?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Lattice dynamics of high-pressure hydrides studied by inelastic neutron scattering","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to the small mass and anomalously large neutron scattering cross-section of proton (about 80 barns compared to a few barns for other nuclei), inelastic neutron scattering is considered as one of the most effective tools in studying optical vibrations of hydrogen atoms in metal hydrides. The current review is focused on the binary hydrides of 3d-and 4d-metals of groups VI-VIII, which were produced at high hydrogen pressures of several gigapascals in relatively large quantities of hundreds of mg, quenched to low temperature and studied by INS ex situ at ambient pressure with high statistical accuracy. One of the unusual effects revealed by INS is a strong increase in the strength of the metal-hydrogen interactions with decreasing atomic number of the d-metal accompanied by an increase in the Me-H distance. Based on the available experimental results, the spectra g(E) of the phonon density of states and temperature dependencies C-V(T) of the heat capacity at constant volume at T up to 1000 K have been derived in this paper and presented both in the figures and in digital form. This provides the reference data for the theoretical investigations of the crystal structures and compositions of new practically important hydrides giving the opportunity to validate calculation methods by comparing the calculated g(E) and C-V(T) with the accurate experimental dependencies for the binary hydrides. Recent INS studies showed [R.A. Klein et al., J. Alloy. Compd. 894 (2022) 162381] that the fingerprints of anomalously short H-H separations of 1.6 & ANGS; violating the \"2 & ANGS; rule \" can be easily and unambiguously identified in the complex INS spectra of quaternary hydrides (La,Ce)NiInH1+x. This makes neutron spectroscopy an attractive means for obtaining valuable data in the search for novel hydrides with a record high hydrogen capacity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii

expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) system is associated with tumor invasion, neo-angiogenesis, and metastatic spread, and has been shown to positively correlate with a poor prognosis in several cancer types, including thyroid carcinomas. In recent years, several uPA inhibitors were found to have anticancer effects in preclinical studies and in some phase II clinical trials, which prompted us to evaluate uPA as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of patients affected by the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer, the anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). In this study, we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effects of WX-340, a highly specific and selective uPA inhibitor, on two ATC-derived cell lines, CAL-62 and BHT-101. The results obtained indicated that WX-340 was able to reduce cell adhesion and invasiveness in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines. In addition, WX-340 increased uPA receptor (uPAR) protein levels without affecting its plasma membrane concentration. However, this compound was unable to significantly reduce ATC growth in a xenograft model, indicating that uPA inhibition alone may not have the expected therapeutic effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["605d589b9543c745d80e5a5f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"3724","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62d01a1140970733e7971719","605d589b9543c745d80e5a5f","62d01a1140970733e797171b","62d01a1140970733e797171c","62d01a1140970733e797171d","62d01a1140970733e797171e","62d01a1140970733e797171f","62d01a1140970733e7971720","62d01a1140970733e7971721","62d01a1140970733e7971722","62d01a1140970733e7971723","62d01a1140970733e7971724","62d01a1140970733e7971725","62d01a1140970733e7971726","62d01a1240970733e7971727","62d01a1240970733e7971728","62d01a1240970733e7971729","62d01a1240970733e797172a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6246c4aa2467f0368b8993cf","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"7","documentHash":"494b5e23-ace2-42c6-91a6-1e55ad57ee78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058309383"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"637772c240970701fd3f3793","name":"Monika","lastName":"Malinowska","documentHash":"4c43b6f1-5511-4048-b5e4-24b5fefe08ff"},{"objectId":"637772c240970701fd3f3792","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Włodarczyk","documentHash":"4b44f6d3-925e-417b-a173-6ff098728c50"},{"objectId":"637772c240970701fd3f3791","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Doleżyczek","documentHash":"50fad99b-cc89-4fc3-91c0-6fa9ead5bba4"},{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb04f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kasprzycki","uuid":"00C76A966EA8A58991219F0F8BE830F44ADF3C0EF58F96B25330ABF68598A01200AB82532C58E2870DFD4C643151DEDA4A86DF2C3580D7C5F3082B899091D552","orcidId":"0000-0001-9299-5209","documentHash":"c00d9ee1-87f3-4f55-a3a6-351b885cb7cf"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Wojtkowski","uuid":"72C7EFD6AE3C0FF6AB46F559605ACE983360A4E4C03769BB1C4D0D72A5671C8A9CF4B7F1DF377F7E2D985ACB38C7A2EE1DA60B3BE1A843F188600A590E526E53","orcidId":"0000-0003-0599-0878","documentHash":"380243f1-4e56-4426-bead-5a7a8a484819"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"637772c240970701fd3f378f","doi":"10.55782/ane-2022-010","publicUri":"https://ane.pl/pdf/DjTZHtBnKhXJwacN.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Optical coherence tomography reveals heterogeneity of the brain tissue and vasculature in the ischemic region after photothrombotic stroke in mice","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We demonstrate in vivo imaging of the ischemic area in the mouse brain after photostroke using a custom prototype Gaussian‑beam optical coherence tomography (OCT) setup in which the near infrared imaging beam and the green photoinducing light pass through the same objective lens.

Utilizing the diamond anvil cell methodology and synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction, we have attempted to push this limit further via hydrogenation of metallic Yb and Yb3H8. Compression of the latter has also been investigated in a neutral pressure-transmitting medium (PTM). While the in situ heating of Yb facilitates the formation of YbH2+x hydrides, we have not observed clear qualitative differences between the systems compressed in H2 and He or Ne PTM. In all of these cases, a sequence of phase transitions occurred within ca. 13–18 GPa (P3̅1m–I4/m phase) and around 27 GPa (to the I4/mmm phase). The molecular volume of the systems compressed in H2 PTM is ca. 1.5% larger than of those compressed in inert gases, suggesting a small hydrogen uptake. Nevertheless, hydrogenation toward YbH3 is incomplete, and polyhydrides do not form up to the highest pressure studied here (ca. 75 GPa). As pointed out by electronic transport measurements, the mixed-valence Yb3H8 retains its semiconducting character up to >50 GPa, although the very low remnant activation energy of conduction (<5 meV) suggests that metallization under further compression should be achievable.

Surprisingly, for nanorods a superior accumulation of hot spots is present at surface coverages above 60%, which ensures a higher efficiency for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In this study, we produced pegylated gold nanorods in Langmuir-Blodgett layers in order to optimize SERS performance for the ultrasensitive detection of molecules, by tuning plasmonic coupling and nanoparticle surface coverage. To understand the arrangement of the nanorods in Langmuir and Langmuir-Blodgett layers, we performed spectroscopic and microscopic analysis of the obtained films. Based on the compression isotherms of the nanorods, we proposed the best conditions for nanoplatform design. The Raman enhancement factor was around 2.10(5) with a deposition surface pressure equal to 12 mN.m(-1). Due to the polymer's presence at the surface of the nanorods and the dewetting process, specific dendritic-like aggregates were observed on the solid substrate. The results obtained indicate the significance of further studies on the arrangement of metallic nanoparticles in monolayers, taking into account the size and shape of the nanoparticles, as well as the type of stabilizing ligands at their surface."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62d7a5d34097075e7cfcd0f3","5e7093a9878c28a0473aea15","602e41009543c7410626ef84"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709415878c28a0473b5f14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"573","pagesFromTo":"151518-1 - 151518-22","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e41009543c7410626ef84","5e7093a9878c28a0473aea15","5e709415878c28a0473b5f14","62d7a5d34097075e7cfcd0f3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477156","mniswId":"1525","title":"Applied Surface Science","issn":"0169-4332","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"6b1a871d-474e-41fa-bd55-783bef013932"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d445542467f0627d10807a","year":"2022","volume":"573","documentHash":"dd7df247-0e31-4322-a743-299ab2772e21"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058317769"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Górecki","uuid":"5C1C88BEF5066E9C3874BDB6264294C1392BD86C12A9F48FB84DCDF91ECC0D7892866EA7D364E14630DDA5138F0746E07B789269886028DCDB2ABF6BD86EA9B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4574-0083","documentHash":"95958b83-8129-419e-8027-969462b967a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6387522340970727ca803c20","doi":"10.3390/e24081054","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/8/1054/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Information Processing Using Networks of Chemical Oscillators","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"I believe the computing potential of systems with chemical reactions has not yet been fully explored. The most common approach to chemical computing is based on implementation of logic gates. However, it does not seem practical because the lifetime of such gates is short, and communication between gates requires precise adjustment. The maximum computational efficiency of a chemical medium is achieved if the information is processed in parallel by different parts of it. In this paper, I review the idea of computing with coupled chemical oscillators and give arguments for the efficiency of such an approach. I discuss how to input information and how to read out the result of network computation. I describe the idea of top-down optimization of computing networks. As an example, I consider a small network of three coupled chemical oscillators designed to differentiate the white from the red points of the Japanese flag. My results are based on computer simulations with the standard two-variable Oregonator model of the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. An optimized network of three interacting oscillators can recognize the color of a randomly selected point with >98% accuracy. The presented ideas can be helpful for the experimental realization of fully functional chemical computing networks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b050"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1054","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b050"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ae1","mniswId":"5774","title":"Entropy","issn":"1099-4300","eissn":"1099-4300","documentHash":"bbef1c6f-1acc-4128-b3e8-f2e4e9bfe953"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6318b544409707796839b695","year":"2022","volume":"24","number":"8","documentHash":"22cd533e-1edb-4316-9466-096d72c20610"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058317781"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6387615c40970727ca8210ee","name":"Martin M.","lastName":"Hanczyc","documentHash":"2bd215a7-b7f4-44b9-bcc6-7cea91bfe057"},{"objectId":"6387615c40970727ca8210ed","name":"Shinpei","lastName":"Tanaka","documentHash":"925a95ad-cc0e-41e4-b842-0ec2d91d539b"},{"objectId":"6387615c40970727ca8210ec","name":"Chiho","lastName":"Watanabe","documentHash":"30511328-7fd9-4255-bbab-d82f82315b24"},{"objectId":"5fc513b9085dcb1e6ae0b9f1","name":"Richard","lastName":"Loffler","uuid":"C00717FE197C00535A026AA7286B1432C2FF502593BC384EB31BA7100B7EF4B79E17A468E956058CDD7B5E01C78BCAC83F84FE8C629623764A5B63DDEC049E79","orcidId":"0000-0003-0400-8731","documentHash":"a3ab8f7f-59aa-4103-af32-6dbf55100a05"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Górecki","uuid":"5C1C88BEF5066E9C3874BDB6264294C1392BD86C12A9F48FB84DCDF91ECC0D7892866EA7D364E14630DDA5138F0746E07B789269886028DCDB2ABF6BD86EA9B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4574-0083","documentHash":"95958b83-8129-419e-8027-969462b967a4"}],"objectId":"6387615c40970727ca8210ea","doi":"10.1039/d2sm00497f","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/SM/D2SM00497F","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Dynamic ordering caused by a source-sink relation between two droplets","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Two droplets composed of different chemicals, 1-decanol and liquid paraffin, floating on the water surface show characteristic co-responsive behavior. The presence of two different types of droplets in the system imposes an asymmetry that would not be possible with single droplets alone. The self-propulsion and interactions between droplets appear because surface active 1-decanol molecules provided by the source are absorbed by the paraffin sink thus generating an asymmetric surface tension gradient. This source-sink relation between droplets stabilizes and enhances the self-propulsion, and leads to a variety of dynamic structures including oscillations in the inter-droplet distance. We found that the character of time evolution also depends on the concentration of dye, Sudan Black B, initially used just to stain the decanol droplet. A simple mathematical model explains the transition between the stationary state and the oscillations as a Hopf bifurcation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","5fc513b9085dcb1e6ae0b9f1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"34","pagesFromTo":"6465-6474","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6387615c40970727ca8210ec","6387615c40970727ca8210ed","6387615c40970727ca8210ee","5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","5fc513b9085dcb1e6ae0b9f1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547979e","mniswId":"18664","title":"Soft Matter","issn":"1744-683X","eissn":"1744-6848","documentHash":"03ac2274-20a4-4695-ba0f-bee525f4f334"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6387615c40970727ca8210eb","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"34","documentHash":"17843b58-b874-4a81-9989-4003866df21b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058318020"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62e24d244097077d65aa1435","name":"Kousha","lastName":"Hadi","documentHash":"80ead661-9929-4fe9-a9f6-79d2c19f7b83"},{"objectId":"62e24d244097077d65aa1434","name":"Morteza A.","lastName":"Sharif","orcidId":"0000-0003-1469-6910","documentHash":"12472d3e-1b82-4e21-bf6b-f266a70372d1"},{"objectId":"61e634397523406748fb0476","name":"Mehdi","lastName":"Borjkhani","uuid":"A9D236281EF73257AC177BBB8257A66C2FA8E4F27F4CB8AB1276F0121518EECB5B7C09B3FBCA11D124385D7A731DC2A6116376BD8359FDBED91AA295F2BE739A","documentHash":"394fa8ba-6a97-44a3-a4f0-56cc5983b724"}],"objectId":"62e24d244097077d65aa1432","doi":"10.1016/j.physb.2022.413768","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0921452622001077?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Propagation length enhancement of surface plasmon polaritons in ultrafine Au nanodisk array, the role of kinky breather and periodic lump","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We deal with a non-radiative approach to investigate the propagation of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) in an Au nanodisk array in touch with an analyte medium.

It is shown that the periodic feature can guarantee the enhanced propagation length of SPPs stationary modes. Analytical results also reveal the occurrence of Fano resonance while numerical results show that the propagation length can go beyond 56 mu m. On the other hand, using Kretschmann-Raether approach, we reach the Fano resonance in consequence of the interaction of dark and bright plasmon modes which is in agreement with our model and interpretation.

This monitoring facilitates an efficient design of chemicals and materials with the precise properties that are desired. This work presents the simultaneous utilization and synergy of two novel time-resolved NMR methods, i.e., time-resolved diffusion NMR and time-resolved nonuniform sampling. The first method allows the average diffusion coefficient of the products to be followed, while the second method enables the particula r products to be monitored. Additionally, the average mass of the system is calculated with excellent resolution using both techniques.

S. Groves et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 1702]. We assumed spherical ions with different diameters and implicit solvent, inducing strong, short-range attraction between ions of the same sign. For this highly simplified model, we calculated correlation functions. Our results indicate that mesoscopic inhomogeneities can occur when the sum of the Coulomb and the water-mediated interactions between like ions is attractive at short and repulsive at large distances. We adjusted the attractive part of the potential to the water-in-LiTFSI electrolyte and obtained both the period and the decay rate of the correlations, in semiquantitative agreement with the experiment.

The topology of foams remaining in the material after camphor and camphene molecules have been removed through evaporation or dissolution is similar to polypropylene foams obtained using thermally-induced phase separation.

As the rate of antibiotic-resistant infections rises, so do complications to health and the risk of disability and death. Urgent action is required regarding the discovery of new antibiotics and rapid diagnosis of the resistance profile of an infectious pathogen as well as a better understanding of population and single-cell distribution of the resistance level. High-throughput screening is the major affordance of droplet microfluidics. Droplet screens can be exploited both to look for combinations of drugs that could stop an infection of multidrug-resistant bacteria and to search for the source of resistance via directed-evolution experiments or the analysis of various responses to a drug by genetically identical bacteria. In droplet techniques that have been used in this way for over a decade, aqueous droplets containing antibiotics and bacteria are manipulated both within and outside of the microfluidic devices. The diagnostics problem was approached by producing a series of microfluidic systems with integrated dilution modules for automated preparation of antibiotic concentration gradients, achieving the speed that allowed for high-throughput combinatorial assays. We developed a method for automated emulsification of a series of samples that facilitated measuring the resistance levels of thousands of individual cells encapsulated in droplets and quantifying the inoculum effect, the dependence of resistance level on bacterial cell count. Screening of single cells encapsulated in droplets with varying antibiotic contents has revealed a distribution of resistance levels within populations of clonally identical cells. To be able to screen bacteria from clinical samples, a study of fluorescent dyes in droplets determined that a derivative of a popular viability marker is more suitable for droplet assays. We have developed a detection system that analyzes the growth or death state of bacteria with antibiotics for thousands of droplets per second by measuring the scattering of light hitting the droplets without labeling the cells or droplets. The droplet-based microchemostats enabled long-term evolution of resistance experiments, which will be integrated with high-throughput single-cell assays to better understand the mechanism of resistance acquisition and loss. These techniques underlie automated combinatorial screens of antibiotic resistance in single cells from clinical samples. We hope that this Account will inspire new droplet-based research on the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709307878c28a0473a176b","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"55","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"605-615","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709307878c28a0473a176b","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476da0","mniswId":"69","title":"ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH","issn":"0001-4842","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"fc8ba530-b92a-43fb-abb7-57c66d3d0544"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e3cc294097075e45d88d72","year":"2022","volume":"55","number":"5","documentHash":"1226a646-e0f4-433f-a179-ad757f028aa2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["GENERATION/GROWTH/MICROBIOLOGY/RESISTANCE/RESOLUTION/EVOLUTION/LIBRARIES/SYSTEMS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058328551"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f0db4240970731f3eb0634","name":"László","lastName":"Kövér","documentHash":"a6a66dee-5076-4126-b4d1-732f7cb0b65f"},{"objectId":"62f0db4240970731f3eb0633","name":"József","lastName":"Tóth","documentHash":"8f427fe0-6485-4c64-8353-d5951acf1315"},{"objectId":"5fc4ba0d085dcb1e6ae0b8cf","name":"Neha","lastName":"Rangam","uuid":"7E845891996F420D44BDED234AA41B05C9791674A8DAC82D89E63BC22C8E1E3612EB2C7FF92C26566DBBEC7BD044173497E24130249BD929CFEC6B5A4A1A3D22","orcidId":"0000-0002-3461-804X","documentHash":"4d2d9dea-6b82-4845-8b0e-89083c254960"},{"objectId":"5fc4b8c9085dcb1e6ae0b8cc","name":"Alcina","lastName":"Sudagar","uuid":"5B2123C5D55E6DBA3FE36F02F1FE6BEC7F075BCA692259E551036D6A7681319975D4507E89F1FCDF4ED7AD3EDA65CDA163E5774D5BBCC910C206638343556B33","orcidId":"0000-0001-5478-0928","documentHash":"0e92e9f0-2535-441d-a885-e9826e398feb"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf720","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Michałowska","uuid":"3C86BF221054E0DA638132A262E735B5FE3D56538D97B5BC92E3042316086870CA18020EAA276AC6A2A538830016D8E26EE844D701125EDD06FBC2F5D0ADFFF7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0417-000X","documentHash":"627d10e0-4032-442e-8eb0-5930e9018c10"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4808","name":"Marek","lastName":"Roszko","uuid":"BBE386C05F358BCFC242B25F0684A50B75B08D2AD913A6910AFB51EB2C5A4CC32CC0CDFFF706EB241CBECFF11756078E1A480468234C3699A40E2D80B956FD24","orcidId":"0000-0003-1848-2100","documentHash":"5a516718-6582-4314-99ac-0b56a65130e8"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Borowicz","uuid":"D63B2D1CBAA9D153E2BD617283D505E334189960BF43C306B6800911E131A1DC46163DC826D5DBC9591F08210F55027FACEF450EFC439AC7D859B7E08287470B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6440-3568","documentHash":"a3264215-d1bb-4319-b51d-735971fa60f0"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff4b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Noworyta","uuid":"8C310206E42F55B812232B3EBF76443A9FDA17420C33C5B6AF767DE0B155C9253089E21C7DD54147D5DFC80566C7E17F99C332200C11E4D2172D349C9F2FC241","orcidId":"0000-0002-9883-1288","documentHash":"224120f6-17a8-4e7c-beb0-2b733bd0bcb8"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff24","name":"Beata","lastName":"Lesiak-Orłowska","uuid":"568072B8F795A59A4469526D64724F7F6F8F2618DA71B4B3A9EDEC60CD39056859AC4029BE30E48544BE9B39BAB9FDF91C3E1C831AB9E81624539A39BA95AD56","orcidId":"0000-0003-2633-8483","documentHash":"dc99ae88-6c95-471d-bb47-54d64d716fce"},{"objectId":"5e709337878c28a0473a50b7","name":"Artur","lastName":"Ruszczak","uuid":"45F659529DE17E7C38358489F159A1815FD641AC73A05BE9EF2B06751E1D9873FE246641DE9F5BA0E2E5AC5F5A647611FCBEB95CAB9AD2A9FFC13E30E603C689","orcidId":"0000-0002-5328-4057","documentHash":"7fc72c4c-4af1-4ce6-baca-d3b51eaf2795"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62f0db4240970731f3eb0632","doi":"10.3390/nano12030442","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/3/442/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Valorizing the Unexplored Filtration Waste of Brewing Industry for Green Silver Nanocomposite Synthesis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The brewing industry generates a substantial amount of by-products rich in polyphenols, carbohydrates, sugars, sulfates, nitrogen compounds, organic carbon, and several elements, including chlorine, magnesium, and phosphorus. Although limited quantities of these by-products are used in fertilizers and composts, a large amount is discarded as waste. Therefore, it is crucial to identify different ways of valorizing the by-products. Research regarding the valorization of the brewery by-products is still in its nascent stage; therefore, it still has high potential. Herein, we report the valorization of the brewery by-product from the filtration stage of the brewing process (BW9) to synthesize silver nanocomposites as this waste has remained largely unexplored. The BW9 nanocomposites have been compared to those obtained from the brewery product B. The chemical composition analysis of BW9 and B revealed several organic moieties capable of reducing metal salts and capping the formed nanoparticles. Therefore, the brewery waste from stage 9 was valorized as a precursor and added to silver-based precursor at various temperatures (25, 50, and 80 degrees C) and for various time periods (10, 30, and 120 min) to synthesize silver nanocomposites. The nanocomposites obtained using BW9 were compared to those obtained using the main product of the brewing industry, beer (B). Synthesized nanocomposites composed of AgCl as a major phase and silver metal (Ag-met) was incorporated in minor quantities. In addition, Ag3PO4 was also found in B nanocomposites in minor quantities (up to 34 wt.%). The surface morphology depicted globular nanoparticles with layered structures. Small ball-like aggregates on the layer representative of Ag3PO4 were observed in B nanocomposites. The surface of nanocomposites was capped with organic content and functional groups present in the brewery products. The nanocomposites demonstrated high antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (E. coli), with BW9 nanocomposites exhibiting a higher activity than B nanocomposites."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4ba0d085dcb1e6ae0b8cf","5fc4b8c9085dcb1e6ae0b8cc","5e709337878c28a0473a50b7","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff4b","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff24"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a04738564a","uid":"beGpESG6icEeopJ3VnMkvIw","uuid":"0e8f33a2-7d2c-4765-a697-b104163eb1ac","name":"Instytut Biotechnologii Przemysłu Rolno-Spożywczego im. prof.

The existing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) theory appears to be complete, capable of describing even the finest details of the temperature-dependent spectra of such objects. However, the once reported temperature effects in the carbon spectra of the C13-labeled methyl group in a single crystal of acetylsalicylic acid have still not been explained. As the temperature decreases, in the quartet corresponding to the rapid motional averaging regime, the inner lines first begin to broaden, but then, they narrow again, so that at 6 K, a pattern similar to that at room temperature was observed. In the present work, these puzzling effects are explained quantitatively by invoking the molecular Zeeman (MZ) interaction. Like the spin–rotation (SR) interaction long known to occur in methyl groups, it engages the magnetic moments generated by their torsional motions. However, it has not been considered in NMR spectroscopy until now. This is a surprising situation because in the magnetic fields currently used in NMR spectroscopy, the MZ interaction is orders of magnitude stronger than the (magnetic field independent) SR effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7cad"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"157","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"74312","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709430878c28a0473b7cad","6384ad11409707320871607c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec005b8ad49b31cced90a18","title":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","issn":"0021-9606","eissn":"1520-9032","documentHash":"1d750368-97f2-4500-a086-8f729f1de6d5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6384ad11409707320871607b","year":"2022","volume":"157","number":"7","documentHash":"0f615906-a67e-44ef-80ea-8e29eb59dd8d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058332344"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca3206432","name":"Vincent","lastName":"Couderc","documentHash":"d32ad1f3-9720-4829-962e-8f4eaa75e547"},{"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca3206431","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Wabnitz","documentHash":"adcf737e-c485-4231-b563-182a6e735bb9"},{"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca3206430","name":"Benjamin","lastName":"Wetzel","documentHash":"bcf4aae1-c1dc-4634-911b-7916dbbbad8b"},{"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca320642f","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Baronio","documentHash":"1921c64a-2234-4339-8a75-331cd9082634"},{"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca320642e","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Tonello","documentHash":"09a45dfe-9bd3-4c2e-b715-0819ed0d941b"},{"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca320642d","name":"Tigran","lastName":"Mansuryan","documentHash":"166751c3-6cc5-4b43-b34d-06ac3246e25b"},{"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca320642c","name":"Sahar","lastName":"Wehbi","documentHash":"9b701c37-08ac-4d0c-a10f-630e7b3f07f8"},{"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca320642b","name":"Raphaël","lastName":"Jauberteau","documentHash":"4d2043d7-79f0-4af1-97d1-7dea9d735cb4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":"5FFECF2E5A62709C63A8D260B40C0CD90CF8BD0DCCB7FA27183145DDA5B5CBF16812F71E9EEBA4A8B79058C3D3533F3A261B5BDE1ED8D1DEAD6581D3C27C7140","orcidId":"0000-0001-7885-7395","documentHash":"c2d231ae-c19c-4fa0-aa50-7b4f82f3ffa2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca3206429","doi":"10.1038/s42005-022-00976-2","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-022-00976-2.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Twin spotlight beam generation in quadratic crystals","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Optical rogue waves have been extensively studied in the past two decades. However, observations of multidimensional extreme wave events remain surprisingly scarce. In this work we present the experimental demonstration of the spontaneous generation of spatially localized two-dimensional beams in a quadratic nonlinear crystal, which are composed by twin components at the fundamental and the second-harmonic frequencies. These localized spots of light emerge from a wide background beam, and eventually disappear as the laser beam intensity is progressively increased.\n\nOptical rogue waves are the optical counterpart of sudden and dramatic oceanic wave formations the underlying physics of which are thought to be connected with solitons. Here, the authors report the observation of a 2D spatial twin spotlight beam in anisotropic crystals with quadratic nonlinearity, that spontaneously appears and disappears as a function of laser beam in intensity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"5","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6388b0474097074ca320642b","6388b0474097074ca320642c","6388b0474097074ca320642d","6388b0474097074ca320642e","6388b0474097074ca320642f","6388b0474097074ca3206430","6388b0474097074ca3206431","6388b0474097074ca3206432","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bdb2","mniswId":"4105","title":"Communications Physics","issn":"2399-3650","eissn":"2399-3650","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8af0002c-5f26-4ab0-9857-0481f1ec8cfb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6388b0474097074ca320642a","year":"2022","volume":"5","number":"1","documentHash":"dfcc0786-6762-4b69-b03a-c4230c443a8a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058339516"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6389d3cf40970711474d0c99","name":"Artur","lastName":"Małolepszy","documentHash":"9c82e173-8235-45bb-b7f3-c8ce446705c5"},{"objectId":"616a392975234017e0545a24","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Mazurkiewicz","uuid":"C166144CA3B82B9A7A09DF5B4E8E7007E28A5122CC14ACA6F4C2F9E09E2565BF2C82964D2D414884786C2FC78C882405AA5CF181DF3CF04D500118E30C8A6928","orcidId":"0000-0001-8897-531X","documentHash":"db62287a-82c1-4723-951d-d2e109a3420a"},{"objectId":"5e7094a0878c28a0473c094a","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Witkowska Nery","uuid":"E5BA30CD78D747AFE0690B1F2F91C75C7C9BCC2DDE3D38B78258600B225827763CC060E7F889A904CD4F10AABCF1BE43AD15904A9E0FC8B903F068C2F27FBF7B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3152-8070","documentHash":"0b623736-62b8-442c-9761-00cdc5b2d711"}],"objectId":"6389d3cf40970711474d0c97","doi":"10.1002/celc.202200330","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/celc.202200330","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Comparison of Carbon Nanomaterials for Simultaneous Detection of Neurotransmitters in the Presence of Interfering Species","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main hurdle in simultaneous analysis of dopamine and serotonin is not only their similar detection potential but also the polymerization of dopamine at physiological pH, which results in sensitivity loss. In this work, we investigated glassy carbon electrodes and electrodes modified with carbon black, graphene oxide, and carbon nanodots in terms of their ability to detect 5 neurobiologically relevant analytes (dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid). We proved that simultaneous detection of dopamine and serotonin in the presence of uric and ascorbic acids is possible on electrodes modified with carbon black and graphene oxide, both in buffer solution and cell medium. Graphene oxide-modified electrodes have shown the highest sensitivity towards all tested neurotransmitters. Moreover, a considerable shift of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid peaks towards more negative potentials was observed for electrodes modified with carbon black and graphene oxide as compared with glassy carbon electrodes. Electrodes covered with carbon nanodots were proven inappropriate due to their surface functionalization with ethylenediamine."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["616a392975234017e0545a24","5e7094a0878c28a0473c094a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"15","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["616a392975234017e0545a24","6389d3cf40970711474d0c99","5e7094a0878c28a0473c094a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775c0","mniswId":"3460","title":"ChemElectroChem","issn":"2196-0216","eissn":"2196-0216","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"69b4b420-d94d-4637-a792-841d1267318d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6389d3cf40970711474d0c98","year":"2022","volume":"9","number":"15","documentHash":"6fd14d8b-58b7-49dd-bdfd-c74bac848122"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058339648"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63888f444097074ca31e9b8c","name":"Yuki","lastName":"Koyano","documentHash":"77b6fbff-178c-4908-ac31-f575eac03815"},{"objectId":"63888f444097074ca31e9b8b","name":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Kitahata","documentHash":"2198bcec-f0a4-425b-9e1d-9d146a637047"},{"objectId":"5fc513b9085dcb1e6ae0b9f1","name":"Richard","lastName":"Loffler","uuid":"C00717FE197C00535A026AA7286B1432C2FF502593BC384EB31BA7100B7EF4B79E17A468E956058CDD7B5E01C78BCAC83F84FE8C629623764A5B63DDEC049E79","orcidId":"0000-0003-0400-8731","documentHash":"a3ab8f7f-59aa-4103-af32-6dbf55100a05"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Górecki","uuid":"5C1C88BEF5066E9C3874BDB6264294C1392BD86C12A9F48FB84DCDF91ECC0D7892866EA7D364E14630DDA5138F0746E07B789269886028DCDB2ABF6BD86EA9B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4574-0083","documentHash":"95958b83-8129-419e-8027-969462b967a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63888f444097074ca31e9b89","doi":"10.1039/d2cp02456j","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/CP/D2CP02456J","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Complexity and bifurcations in the motion of a self-propelled rectangle confined in a circular water chamber","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider the motion of a self-propelled object of rectangular shape inside a circular water chamber. The mathematical model of self-motion includes equations for the orientation and location of the rectangle and reaction-diffusion equation with an effective diffusion coefficient for the time evolution of the surface concentration of active molecules. Numerical simulations of motion were performed for different values of the ratio between the supply rate S and the evaporation rate a of active molecules. Treating S-0 = S/a as a control parameter, we found the critical behavior in variables characterizing the trajectory and identified different types of motion. If the value of S-0 is small, the rectangle rests at the chamber center. For larger S-0, a reciprocal motion during which the rectangle passes through the center is observed. At yet higher supply rates, the star-polygonal motion appears, and the trajectory remains at a distance from the chamber center. In the experiments with a rectangle made of camphor-camphene-polypropylene plastic moving in a Petri dish, we observed the transition from the star-polygonal motion to the reciprocal motion in time. This transition can be understood on the basis of the developed model if we assume that the supply rate decreases in time."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","5fc513b9085dcb1e6ae0b9f1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"34","pagesFromTo":"20326-20335","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63888f444097074ca31e9b8b","63888f444097074ca31e9b8c","5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","5fc513b9085dcb1e6ae0b9f1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547925d","mniswId":"16075","title":"PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS","issn":"1463-9076","documentHash":"8e732841-944b-4696-92c7-03b5ad988f7d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63888f444097074ca31e9b8a","year":"2022","volume":"24","number":"34","documentHash":"f67fd1ce-4143-43a7-8f9c-2b81a4ddb33c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058339801"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602e0d769543c7410626eb42","name":"Nabila","lastName":"Yasmeen","uuid":"5629667FCE149F5142FD8B6E5B6A23356B0FCD2FFCBC0C58C7A5F5E0DD4EBE081A62817372403BAD35D0350770B16BB89EB93C7A79EB902B9F11CED3F77DEEC8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2010-4395","documentHash":"eb4a12d7-8391-49f1-b553-553a13081bba"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b9717","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Karpińska","uuid":"1E5D3969A685107F2DB3FC1CD786462F8E526B7BF236FA6AF57885335DB5C230BE72076C9DCBC4BF49A960192B7513E33BE338F8DDE07D2C5B50B1EE7DE56CF1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3307-2882","documentHash":"320937a4-d647-4f0a-9ec2-b12487135b6b"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","name":"Karina","lastName":"Kwapiszewska","uuid":"B5FE41F14EEC666D304654994E6250629F4F330AF6CF26B5585E2C99E5641B03DFEB8EA8A3A168084B7D1ED1D12DA60714C2ED67A21A919BC975D9B8456110D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7396-9571","documentHash":"eb6a4320-99ed-48fa-8778-37744fd76b87"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","name":"Piyush","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"E13DBE297A73F2ACA1DA7F32D373EDA5FB882AC5C4DDE593B81140BAD5BD6DA80677830414B610AFC144957EF4E20FF1A8CC4A4F5367FEC382ACC689DAE8CD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-7729-8314","documentHash":"d3733567-ec08-40ae-9d79-439c8d659f9e"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kałęcki","uuid":"9A55E22434DE512B22E198C0B70313B1365F26049E72E1BEBEFB40B80D4C4235D1A7C0767203F64C4058B1644E52242BC2E4377385480C13AED4B622364A7FC1","orcidId":"0000-0002-4286-2085","documentHash":"f71fc73f-c75c-4cde-bb90-86a86989d73c"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Kutner","uuid":"4DB1E113A4C8683FB6BC69134920B86E44C946E3D21F32F5F6CE1483179976E11B16608F3E02B532633CFF5B5216E4C96C7B94090438FDEA74135F1AE4F3BCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-5170","documentHash":"71f3755a-d420-46be-bb05-d5ea4b0bfa7c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6388b49a4097074ca3209322","doi":"10.1021/acsami.2c04904","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsami.2c04904","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Electrochemically Synthesized Polyacrylamide Gel and Core–Shell Nanoparticles for 3D Cell Culture Formation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biocompatible polyacrylamide gel and core-shell nanopartides (NPs) were synthesized using a one-step electro-chemically initiated gelation.

porphyrin, embedded in solid nitrogen and xenon. The external heavy atom effect resulted in nearly a 100% population of the triplet state and in the appearance of phosphorescence, with the origin located at 10163 cm−1. This energy is much lower than that corresponding to the T1 position in porphyrin. This difference could be explained by postulating that the orbital origin corresponds in both isomers to the second excited singlet state, which lies much closer to S1 in porphycene. Most of the vibrational frequencies observed in the phosphorescence spectrum correspond to totally symmetric modes, but several ones were assigned to the out-of-plane Bg vibrations. These bands are not observed in fluorescence, which suggests their possible role in vibronic-spin-orbit coupling."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e14d","uid":"bmdKVDpdRKl1usGhQUipgpQ","uuid":"5bb2b585-b070-41eb-866a-c34942735c79","name":"Wydział Matematyczno-Przyrodniczy.Szkoła Nauk Ścisłych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709490878c28a0473bf957","5e709490878c28a0473bf954"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"217-224","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709490878c28a0473bf954","5e709490878c28a0473bf957","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"]},"journal":{"objectId":"6308b044409707498f0da564","title":"Photochem","issn":"2673-7256","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/photochem","documentHash":"50141db4-b50c-463a-980f-f50613adb5a7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63986f8540970708596a9c38","year":"2022","volume":"2","number":"1","documentHash":"1c92c8cd-5159-4d55-b7b7-e5d2ea29dbfd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058349849"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"639874d640970708596b837c","name":"A.","lastName":"Meyra","documentHash":"c737f1cf-4dc4-43be-a88d-3bec03bb1c20"},{"objectId":"639874d640970708596b837b","name":"O.","lastName":"Patsahan","documentHash":"75917de1-a8a8-484b-b37e-f4c8e4761214"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","name":"Alina","lastName":"Ciach","uuid":"520AD5EF74AF15FA81FB18147E92D695E358B38A5F90389DF9A11C3C3623C0214250CFB548E34846D53DBA21ED79955D9F88250356F8AFEBD6A696B7263A658B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5556-401X","documentHash":"630645e8-c7ee-4652-a5a0-a0da6ec79d79"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-10-01","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"639874d640970708596b8379","doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2022.119844","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0167732222013824?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of a confining surface on a mixture with spontaneous inhomogeneities","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A binary self-assembling mixture near a planar wall is studied by theory and Monte Carlo simulations.\nThe grand potential functional of the local concentration and the local volume fraction of all particles\nis developed in the framework of the density functional and field-theoretic methods.

Yet, even the first step in such an analysis—the assignment of observed resonances to particular nuclei—is often problematic due to low peak dispersion in the spectra of IDPs. We show that the assignment process can be aided by finding “hidden” chemical shift patterns specific to the amino acid residue types. We find such patterns in the training data from the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank using linear discriminant analysis, and then use them to classify spin systems in an α-synuclein sample prepared by us. We describe two situations in which the procedure can greatly facilitate the analysis of NMR spectra. The first involves the mapping of spin systems chains onto the protein sequence, which is part of the assignment procedure—a prerequisite for any NMR-based protein analysis. In the second, the method supports assignment transfer between similar samples. We conducted experiments to demonstrate these cases, and both times the majority of spin systems could be unambiguously assigned to the correct residue types."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f082","uid":"b9SXTF1Zzo_eiHN0JX9AfyA","uuid":"951ff117-fef4-4ad2-81fa-149f6095a5a7","name":"Centrum Nowych Technologii UW","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d87","5e7093b5878c28a0473af7be"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d9b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935c878c28a0473a8005"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"e1010258","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d87","5e70941f878c28a0473b6864","5e70935c878c28a0473a8005","5e7093b5878c28a0473af7be","5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d9b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e5","mniswId":"16238","title":"PLoS Computational Biology","issn":"1553-7358","eissn":"1553-7358","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e61d8081-4b34-474b-9029-c1d4c9813b8d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63998c5c40970768cd0b1fc5","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"10","documentHash":"99e7f22d-ae53-4e2c-ba8c-60d535cd387b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058349964"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"639873a840970708596b1b2d","name":"Sauro","lastName":"Succi","documentHash":"14fc0dd9-6b35-4051-ac66-46984ae20504"},{"objectId":"639873a840970708596b1b2c","name":"Michał","lastName":"Bogdan","documentHash":"034bf239-6e75-43eb-b9c9-e4dd38e587cc"},{"objectId":"639873a840970708596b1b2b","name":"Marco","lastName":"Lauricella","documentHash":"ee3b9597-909d-41bf-b22b-2b7f17a427de"},{"objectId":"639873a840970708596b1b2a","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Montessori","documentHash":"fe1e76f0-3673-4a8c-af2a-4449145acc9e"},{"objectId":"639873a840970708596b1b29","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Bonaccorso","documentHash":"3dbdd9af-d83b-420f-9612-bb0ee6214aee"},{"objectId":"639873a840970708596b1b28","name":"Adriano","lastName":"Tiribocchi","documentHash":"4d6d1252-ed79-4dc3-a0f7-eb6443bf14fc"},{"objectId":"639873a840970708596b1b27","name":"Mihir","lastName":"Durve","documentHash":"e3a44bd7-8c93-4704-8050-3d3235c6cd3e"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","name":"Jan","lastName":"Guzowski","uuid":"A8B48F7F745AC2DFDED086903CA20E4647AA2D07E044454CCFF949079D1455DCCD7E7BE0AE516AAB19C1A06B1B84EFEE24846B3ABD004DE97B9592C2E299FDDC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8070-3747","documentHash":"ce9af7d5-565c-439c-8f22-2a02a87f3ca4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-08-01","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"639873a840970708596b1b25","doi":"10.1063/5.0097597","publicUri":"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0097597","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"DropTrack—Automatic droplet tracking with YOLOv5 and DeepSORT for microfluidic applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Deep neural networks are rapidly emerging as data analysis tools, often outperforming the conventional techniques used in complex microfluidic systems. One fundamental analysis frequently desired in microfluidic experiments is counting and tracking the droplets. Specifically, droplet tracking in dense emulsions is challenging due to inherently small droplets moving in tightly packed configurations. Sometimes, the individual droplets in these dense clusters are hard to resolve, even for a human observer. Here, two deep learning-based cutting-edge algorithms for object detection [you only look once (YOLO)] and object tracking (DeepSORT) are combined into a single image analysis tool, DropTrack, to track droplets in the microfluidic experiments. DropTrack analyzes input microfluidic experimental videos, extracts droplets' trajectories, and infers other observables of interest, such as droplet numbers. Training an object detector network for droplet recognition with manually annotated images is a labor-intensive task and a persistent bottleneck. In this work, this problem is partly resolved by training many object detector networks (YOLOv5) with several hybrid datasets containing real and synthetic images. We present an analysis of a double emulsion experiment as a case study to measure DropTrack's performance. For our test case, the YOLO network trained by combining 40% real images and 60% synthetic images yields the best accuracy in droplet detection and droplet counting in real experimental videos. Also, this strategy reduces labor-intensive image annotation work by 60%. DropTrack's performance is measured in terms of mean average precision of droplet detection, mean squared error in counting the droplets, and image analysis speed for inferring droplets' trajectories. The fastest configuration of DropTrack can detect and track the droplets at approximately 30 frames per second, well within the standards for a real-time image analysis.

However, it is still challenging to develop a visible-light active and strong-acid resistive photocatalyst. Hybrid perovskites have been recognized as a potential photocatalyst for photovoltaic HX splitting. Herein, a novel environmentally friendly mixed halide perovskite MA(3)Bi(2)Cl(9-x)I(x) with a bandgap funnel structure is developed, i.e., confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray analysis and density functional theory calculations. Due to gradient neutral formation energy within iodine-doped MA(3)Bi(2)Cl(9), the concentration of iodide element decreases from the surface to the interior across the MA(3)Bi(2)Cl(9-x)I(x) perovskite. Because of the aligned energy levels of iodide/chloride-mixed MA(3)Bi(2)Cl(9-x)I(x), a graded bandgap funnel structure is therefore formed, leading to the promotion of photoinduced charge transfer from the interior to the surface for efficient photocatalytic redox reaction. As a result, the hydrogen generation rate of the optimized MA(3)Bi(2)Cl(9-x)I(x) is enhanced up to approximate to 341 +/- 61.7 mu mol h(-1) with a Pt co-catalyst under visible light irradiation"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2200326","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a19ea84097073ee8327bc1","63a19ea84097073ee8327bc2","63a19ea84097073ee8327bc3","63a19ea84097073ee8327bc4","63a19ea84097073ee8327bc5","63a19ea84097073ee8327bc6","63a19ea84097073ee8327bc7","63a19ea84097073ee8327bc8","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","63a19ea84097073ee8327bc9","63a19ea84097073ee8327bca","63a19ea84097073ee8327bcb","63a19ea84097073ee8327bcc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d31b","mniswId":"18535","title":"Small Methods","issn":"2366-9608","eissn":"2366-9608","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0d67f64f-cf01-4a3b-bf96-c4e819c45ac7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a19ea84097073ee8327bc0","year":"2022","volume":"6","number":"8","documentHash":"dabb2650-bcd5-4b9c-b482-8370f225c109"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058359953"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"639889ee40970708596d939e","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"3506f80a-22b1-4474-b7bd-825159d63870"},{"objectId":"639889ee40970708596d939d","name":"Soumitra","lastName":"Satapathi","documentHash":"059ed1e9-bb6d-46f3-b460-23c0ac9550a6"},{"objectId":"639889ee40970708596d939c","name":"Seckin","lastName":"Akin","documentHash":"6da30858-1bee-4f7f-bc37-3fa1fb70debd"},{"objectId":"639889ee40970708596d939b","name":"Rouhollah","lastName":"Tavakoli","documentHash":"9fccc81c-89d6-4345-a691-d4d16f7f8df2"},{"objectId":"639889ee40970708596d939a","name":"Ziba","lastName":"Fazel","documentHash":"61639b03-1854-4574-b1db-942c2227f9dc"},{"objectId":"639889ee40970708596d9399","name":"Mohammad Mahdi","lastName":"Tavakoli","documentHash":"75eedc78-628a-4de3-8da5-45f6910a662f"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-07-08","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"639889ee40970708596d9397","doi":"10.1002/solr.202200106","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/solr.202200106","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Efficient and Less‐Toxic Indium‐Doped MAPbI\n            <sub>3</sub>\n            Perovskite Solar Cells Prepared by Metal Alloying Technique","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Perovskite materials with ABX(3) structure (A: organic, B: metal, and X: halides) have attracted tremendous attention due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. Herein, a novel approach is developed using chemical vapor deposition (CVD), i.e., metal alloying of halide-perovskite domain via ion-transfer (MAHDI) for the growth of high-quality perovskite films, grown directly from a metal precursor. This technique easily enables us to replace the toxic Pb metal (B site) with other metals using alloying approach. Using the proposed approach, we fabricated stable and efficient Pb-In perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.2%, which is more efficient than the pure Pb-based PSCs (19.23%). Our characterization results reveal that In-doping improves the crystallinity and photoluminescence (PL) of the perovskite film, resulting in higher photovoltaic properties in the device. To demonstrate the potential of our proposed method for other alloys, we also fabricated PSCs based on Pb-25%Sn alloy and obtained PCE of up to 15.2%. Overall, MAHDI technique opens up a new direction in the field of perovskite devices demonstrating great advantages such as lower price, higher performance, scalability, and fabrication flexibility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"2200106","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["639889ee40970708596d9399","639889ee40970708596d939a","639889ee40970708596d939b","639889ee40970708596d939c","639889ee40970708596d939d","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","639889ee40970708596d939e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d349","mniswId":"18690","title":"Solar RRL","issn":"2367-198X","eissn":"2367-198X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ce90d4cb-b038-463f-8a86-a01ec2b86158"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639889ee40970708596d9398","year":"2022","volume":"6","number":"9","documentHash":"a0a2d3cb-f5ab-4e01-82bb-6d84c65fafb4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058367856"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63987d7740970708596c733b","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"f8c411b4-5308-4d5e-ae22-8989d133b20a"},{"objectId":"63987d7740970708596c733a","name":"Abul","lastName":"Kalam","documentHash":"2adba256-aa4e-4069-b3f3-437b7eee52d3"},{"objectId":"63987d7740970708596c7339","name":"Pawan","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"daf96e85-9b9e-49a3-9683-9521afb258be"},{"objectId":"63987d7740970708596c7338","name":"Mohammad Mahdi","lastName":"Tavakoli","documentHash":"2fd7aba9-8911-424e-9c50-4fdc5ac6a55e"},{"objectId":"629eb829752340212cd272f2","name":"Rohit Dinkar","lastName":"Chavan","uuid":"42A4419351507C5EFF57A56FBFE83E1427C39AFCCFFE11312EE91407D09E063653D764F0C3E0A44E6E077C8C8285F6E7094D1AD7141AAAB755D357F2A203B403","orcidId":"0000-0001-9254-5048","documentHash":"911a2b07-da41-4a94-b31a-c3f1e2ca1b35"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63987d7740970708596c7336","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c03735","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c03735","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Revealing the Variation of Photodetectivity in MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and MAPb(I<sub>0.88</sub>Br<sub>0.12</sub>)<sub>3</sub> Single Crystal Based Photodetectors Under Electrical Poling-Induced Polarization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The use of electrical poling to induce polarization potential has been found to increase the photocurrent (I-light) in hybrid perovskite-based devices; however, the origin of this process has not been fully understood. Here, we study the effect of electrical poling on the photodetection properties of self-powered photodetectors (PDs) based on halide perovskites in two different phase structures (i.e., tetragonal and cubic). Specifically, extensive investigations are performed on the MAPbI(3) (tetragonal) and MAPb(I0.88Br0.12)(3) (cubic) single crystals (SCs). Our characterization results revealed that the I-light has increased by 2-fold during forward poling and decreased during reverse poling in both PDs. The improved I-light is caused by polarization induced ion migration, which builds remanent potential due to ion accumulation near metal electrodes. The effect of this polarization was found to be greater in MAPbI(3) PD as compared to MAPb(I0.88Br0.12)(3) PD, which influences the interface band bending and reduces Schottky barrier height (SBH). This study highlights that the modification of SBH, which describes the potential energy barrier for electrons formed at a metal-semiconductor junction, can tune the photocurrent and response time of PDs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629eb829752340212cd272f2","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"126","issue":"31","pagesFromTo":"13458-13466","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622ac2387523402df090302f","629eb829752340212cd272f2","63987d7740970708596c7338","63987d7740970708596c7339","63987d7740970708596c733a","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","63987d7740970708596c733b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a2","mniswId":"12286","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry C","issn":"1932-7447","eissn":"1932-7455","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c69a966f-fba3-41b9-8902-e029fec3f1ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63987dad40970708596c7684","year":"2022","volume":"126","number":"31","doi":"","documentHash":"f863c6c3-9732-4295-bda7-53520c94c07f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058368068"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6398825240970708596cb9e4","name":"Jovana","lastName":"Prekodravac","documentHash":"0fc32cf4-4246-4885-8b1e-6a7ebf096118"},{"objectId":"6398825240970708596cb9e3","name":"Vaishakh","lastName":"Nair","documentHash":"27568fec-2350-4c29-9252-29db5c2979b0"},{"objectId":"6398825240970708596cb9e2","name":"Soumya Koippully","lastName":"Manikandan","documentHash":"446016e6-748d-4d4a-aaff-51b620cd59fb"},{"objectId":"5fc4b6f2085dcb1e6ae0b8c3","name":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Giannakoudakis","uuid":"EF7A9B541B546414AC99804FF7756D3398515753227A5640A461BE05B80210E972A5A20423DCF52E80F4AAFD513AD043C600959BDF4FE208E8324086AF858E8C","documentHash":"38ec48bc-cd6c-4461-ab65-1bd1cbf05429"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"objectId":"6398825240970708596cb9e0","doi":"10.1002/jctb.7177","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jctb.7177","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Role of catalyst supports in biocatalysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biocatalysis utilizes enzymes and microbial cells as catalysts for a wide range of applications in biotechnology.

This study demonstrates the real-time experimental observation of double-Hopf-type breathers in an all-normal dispersion all-polarization maintaining ytterbium-doped fiber laser instead. It is shown that the breather frequency can be modulated periodically by the additional oscillation with increasing amplitude in response to increased pump power until a stationary dissipative soliton is formed. The possible explanation of the observed double-Hopf-like bifurcation dynamics is discussed by exploring the numerical approach that combines the interplay of the population inversion in the laser medium with the pulses energy. The results provide additional building blocks for further understanding laser physics and can help in optimizing fiber cavity designs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"2100646","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a1a0f04097073ee832becf","5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ca2","mniswId":"13496","title":"Laser & Photonics Reviews","issn":"1863-8880","eissn":"1863-8899","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ad51db77-bf4e-4d80-a483-04d035e54338"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"638de5d74097076e0f713080","year":"2022","volume":"","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"fd01d462-eaa9-4899-8577-ed4ad0b3a215"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058376353"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63a1c04d4097073ee8368a62","name":"Moazzam H.","lastName":"Bhatti","documentHash":"ba5c710b-e1c5-4134-934e-8b39acd88e9b"},{"objectId":"63a1c04d4097073ee8368a61","name":"Neerish","lastName":"Revaprasadu","documentHash":"6f0010b7-7743-46aa-a53c-fbc41bc667c2"},{"objectId":"63a1c04d4097073ee8368a60","name":"Mohammad Azad","lastName":"Malik","documentHash":"746a5ac9-ccbb-4b36-bbc3-f5b743b758f8"},{"objectId":"63a1c04d4097073ee8368a5f","name":"Masood","lastName":"Akhtar","documentHash":"01649510-b4db-4c1e-a535-a80ee6bcb38d"},{"objectId":"63a1c04d4097073ee8368a5e","name":"Javeed","lastName":"Akhtar","documentHash":"a8320a81-71b5-416e-9b6e-5d82de08b4f6"},{"objectId":"63a1c04d4097073ee8368a5d","name":"Rehana","lastName":"Akram","documentHash":"355dd0c3-12b0-4470-8484-e37eaeabbbdb"},{"objectId":"6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","name":"Malik","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"3F14D6BD4340633067804C270812A937F4E92325031BE1176142856E397CDDA3DE8C90CE8CB58D3FB67D87C91202A989955940DCCDD0BEF387B162A98B900235","orcidId":"0000-0002-3316-041X","documentHash":"b5f5ad91-b181-4281-9e6e-7bd70d906091"}],"objectId":"63a1c04d4097073ee8368a5b","doi":"10.1007/s10854-022-09172-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10854-022-09172-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Single-source route to chalcopyrite-type CuFeS2 and CuFeSe2 nanocrystals and their structural and optical studies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Materials such as ternary (MME2)-M-I-E-III (where M-I = Ag, Cu; M-III = In, Fe; E = S, Se) chalcopyrite-type nanocrystals have garnered interest recently because of their size- and composition-tunable electronic and optical properties. However, controlling the composition of multinary compounds is challenging due to the difference in reactivity of the involved components. Metal-organic precursors usually provide better control over stoichiometry due to preformed bonds. Herein, we have synthesized suitable sulfur-based (dihexyldithiocarbamato) and selenium-based (tetradiphenylimidodiselnodiphosphanate) metal-organic precursors of iron for the preparation of phase pure ternary CuFeS2 and CuFeSe2 nanocrystals, via hot injection route using oleylamine as solvent, decomposition initiator and capping agent. The nanomaterials were characterized by powder-X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), TEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) analysis. The effect of temperature on synthesized nanoparticles was also investigated, showing that the size and morphology change from particles to sheet-like structures. The band gap of synthesized nanomaterials also showed variation along with the temperature change. The study shows a facile route for composition and morphologically controlled ternary chalcopyrite nanomaterials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"32","pagesFromTo":"24619-24630","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a1c04d4097073ee8368a5d","63a1c04d4097073ee8368a5e","63a1c04d4097073ee8368a5f","63a1c04d4097073ee8368a60","63a1c04d4097073ee8368a61","6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","63a1c04d4097073ee8368a62"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478854","mniswId":"11764","title":"Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Electronics","doi":"10.1007/s10854","issn":"0957-4522","eissn":"1573-482X","documentHash":"b0c6c89e-4cf0-42da-a5ae-dc9c0622e869"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a1c04d4097073ee8368a5c","year":"2022","volume":"33","number":"32","documentHash":"9be4dece-6eca-47da-983b-0404ea1ce3bd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058379470"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","name":"Ladislav","lastName":"Derzsi","uuid":"298610A9E3EFD4BD025EE078249F66C3169768A76BA240CFC716072496622CB734DDFCDAE10CFF3D6DCF9853F31A90480F1F1E643D5C8E3147B5E6B43B92C460","orcidId":"0000-0002-3562-0758","documentHash":"d22f43d7-cee1-47a3-9c48-45099bf80c18"},{"objectId":"5ebee330752340254fc43fc8","name":"Yu-Kai","lastName":"Lai","uuid":"8528DB559051F9D7DB4DEE4876430CE130CC1D24608FE1476F15CADF46BE76D58C4FC92C8DFF118BB15E2C5FD2F490784D1F3CB7296EAD0DA8049936D0960BE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1037-9846","documentHash":"a36e5d18-87ea-4f98-960c-e10d4a66b48c"},{"objectId":"5e7093e8878c28a0473b313f","name":"Adam","lastName":"Opalski","uuid":"CC1FFDC9803444C7095218EB1713FA492C253F282F54302FC67B518980BB1BD55D995AFE9F2337F17373894EAB8956578E030D9AE466B1E13675D1C0A69459B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0941-474X","documentHash":"73b6fdd9-c20d-4284-b852-5d8ad9afb197"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","name":"Jan","lastName":"Guzowski","uuid":"A8B48F7F745AC2DFDED086903CA20E4647AA2D07E044454CCFF949079D1455DCCD7E7BE0AE516AAB19C1A06B1B84EFEE24846B3ABD004DE97B9592C2E299FDDC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8070-3747","documentHash":"ce9af7d5-565c-439c-8f22-2a02a87f3ca4"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Garstecki","uuid":"75C65452002051CEFFE6071097E89DF6A74DD0FC1A118DE168CD40EFEDC485E8FF7DCB8A8288FEEBC45B2BDC2ADE2FC757D7CC1EB814D7EB9EAFD1588F4EB22E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9101-7163","documentHash":"cdc40e41-dc83-4780-be61-52db050a0f2d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-06-08","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"633c267f4097074f73527939","doi":"10.1039/d2sm00327a","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/SM/D2SM00327A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A double-step emulsification device for direct generation of double emulsions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In microfluidic step emulsification, the size of droplets generated in the dripping regime is predominantly determined by the nozzle's height and only weakly depends on the applied flow rates or liquid properties. While the generation of monodisperse emulsions at high throughput using step emulsifiers has been well established, the generation of double emulsions, i.e., liquid core-shell structures, is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel double-step emulsification method for the direct generation of multi-core double-emulsions and provide a predictive model for the number of cores. While the mechanism of the formation of the core droplets or empty shell droplets follows the well-established scenario of simple step emulsification, the formation of double-emulsion droplets is strongly affected by the presence of the cores. Passing of the cores through the narrowing neck of the shell postpones shell pinch-off. In particular, we demonstrate that our system can be used for the generation of arbitrary large, tightly packed droplet clusters consisting of a controllable number of droplets. Finally, we discuss the options of upscaling the system for high-throughput generation of tailored double emulsions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","5e7093e8878c28a0473b313f","5ebee330752340254fc43fc8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"33","pagesFromTo":"6157-6166","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebee330752340254fc43fc8","5e7093e8878c28a0473b313f","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547979e","mniswId":"18664","title":"Soft Matter","issn":"1744-683X","eissn":"1744-6848","documentHash":"bbdb4708-4eef-4305-9152-1191418727e5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633c267f4097074f7352793a","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"33","documentHash":"3d3ea4d7-8730-469b-a7d6-dfff2dc4cf3a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058383191"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c32f759543c72336544028","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Zbonikowski","uuid":"E25732A6ACDE02743F9F906A933A6757F4B737A0260153E72970A6BCFDE691EA1C24C5547CC2F14AD23D2700E5102EEAB2D53C059CB3E79BEE06CD6DB7DDF399","documentHash":"5fd44a6e-8e9a-49c8-b194-772af721e253"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bab","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Moś","uuid":"9FE69A6B065AC7CC93190206705F356507B9BF6EAF71547ED6BF5FC7658553B720B398719C7A0929E568CD5F3141C40AA54ABAA2AA69DBCC6677BA3C91E13AE7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1486-9263","documentHash":"0ca42072-1d6c-4267-997b-b14884105d2b"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","name":"Jan","lastName":"Paczesny","uuid":"22569BA0D9E03A26F0A64D7FCE396ED2ABE848430876A29510DE2522F2961D44598990961BF4B864621D02EECDE361E0D5D41E3F1FDFCA243A5BC52483EC38B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-3951","documentHash":"6d641bb0-96ee-402e-ac7c-55829c1da4b4"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ccb","name":"Karol","lastName":"Stasiewicz","uuid":"B567B635A554869C7D0D582CFE75D1D28DA330AE681A78A8A95304BC34378487C37490B423595A46D49D6C3E66F0DAB8FAB4264A545DF030FADBD18AB95C6142","orcidId":"0000-0002-7497-4380","documentHash":"e57873c7-526f-4c6d-91b7-765b4b2a95af"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399cb5","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Marć","uuid":"FC607B054C196033138D49FAC45A8F68CCCA948CBB7B2D0EC4B13E1CA21254206CABD9998DB3561B96D60170DA23AFAD18B2D87BBCD6334F7B84A4FAD036206C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7328-0088","documentHash":"483b10a0-449b-4c62-bc4c-6aa11071db69"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ca5","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Jaroszewicz","uuid":"7CA191660DBEC04D0EEDDC929AD871BFA5B2F201541CB2EF9AC7A7375F70D3C63A1B5184B51CC84527503ED2A8729DE6F5914100D4C4461DC4E0AD2B7F37A272","orcidId":"0000-0001-8838-5846","documentHash":"de0509b7-faa0-4f67-a4ec-d3ef3e52fd7d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"634d6c5d4097070766979489","doi":"10.3390/s22207801","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/20/7801/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Optical Properties of a Tapered Optical Fiber Coated with Alkanes Doped with Fe3O4 Nanoparticles","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The presented research shows the possibilities of creating in-line magnetic sensors based on the detection of changes of light propagation parameters, especially polarization, obtained by mixing Fe3O4 nanoparticles with hexadecane (higher alkane) surrounding a biconical optical fiber taper. The fiber optic taper allows to directly influence light parameters inside the taper without the necessity to lead the beam out of the structure. The mixture of hexadecane and Fe3O4 nanoparticles forms a special cladding surrounding a fiber taper which can be controlled by external factors such as the magnetic field. Described studies show changes of transmission (power, loss) and polarization properties like azimuth, and ellipticity, depending on the location of the mixture on sections of tapered optical fiber. The taper was made of a standard single-mode telecommunication fiber, stretched out to a length of 20.0 ± 0.5 mm and the diameter of the tapers is around 15.0 ± 0.3 μm, with the loss lower than 0.5 dB @ 1550 nm. Such a taper causes the beam to leak out of the waist structure and allows the addition of the external beam-controlling cladding material. The presented research can be used to build polarization switches or optical sensor. The results show that it can be a new way to control the propagation parameters of a light beam using tapered optical fiber and magnetic mixture."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a5878c28a047399ccb","5e709401878c28a0473b4bab","5e7092a5878c28a047399ca5","5e7092a5878c28a047399cb5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c32f759543c72336544028","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"7801","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a5878c28a047399ccb","5e709401878c28a0473b4bab","5e7092a5878c28a047399cb5","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","5e7092a5878c28a047399ca5","60c32f759543c72336544028"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tapered optical fiber","magnetic nanoparticles","polarization parameters","alkane"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058398543"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6369184a4097075f61a998f5","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Suchomski","documentHash":"31d192df-7c92-4b5e-984b-05a0fcb8ee02"},{"objectId":"60caeb349543c72336544565","name":"Ashwin Melvin","lastName":"Ambrose","uuid":"F6BA098A2960025F62C4275A6FA450A931F5C11A61845DE621A4B1921ECE33F0A7C7AAC412E71DDF144515F4002494908DCAD94E3630608DF2B3C98A3F0BDF50","documentHash":"8eaa182f-cf9f-4045-8aaa-d2b49530dc0e"},{"objectId":"605d60749543c745d80e5a65","name":"Bhavana","lastName":"Gupta","uuid":"AC6B32A259B1EED07E7B7D122C124FA2584D1B82B4F45CC0C27768ECDC0E45D999F07DF9B0C583C66EC6E7ED36C4346B55C7FD0A32759764560A404DBD4DC401","orcidId":"0000-0001-9426-8750","documentHash":"fb539681-d025-47b3-a615-41ecb8bac193"},{"objectId":"602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b","name":"Steven","lastName":"Linfield","uuid":"8E09CFFFBEDD455A82435F50FC99FDB564D04FD8783608CF726C4868937FE5381DA040B0751F1336F128EB85FD58A7DCA2FB6DD92C5FD1DE85A22FCC89936D7A","orcidId":"0000-0001-9911-307X","documentHash":"41a79e77-8692-4c89-bd7f-14ed0eafee44"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Opałło","uuid":"ECB569ECB4125066F1DCDB9F48064E76F971F64BACACA1AFD7DBBBE80107D088337CBD1844ADDF79163AEED6F4FB8E817D076BC1662EF431F114EA1356D7929A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5872-7059","documentHash":"71cabfc4-5832-4f70-97cb-7c9b9abea0ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6369184a4097075f61a998f4","doi":"10.1016/j.elecom.2022.107329","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S138824812200131X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Optical readout of moisture in sand employing bipolar electrochemistry","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The fast and wireless estimation of moisture in sand and other bulk materials usually requires high-tech instrumentation and computation. To overcome the complexity of such systems, we have employed bipolar electrochemistry as a fast, straightforward, and cost-effective method to wirelessly produce an optical signal. An electric field generated across moist sand is used to polarize an immersed light-emitting diode (LED), triggering an electrochemical reaction and causing a current to flow. Therefore, the bipolar activation of the LED by a threshold electric field creates an optically readable moisture sensor. The light emission intensity depends on two factors: the amount of moisture and the salt concentration. As two stimuli control the light emission, the signal can be considered as an AND logic gate, which is expected to open possibilities in wireless and user-friendly moisture sensors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","605d60749543c745d80e5a65","60caeb349543c72336544565","602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b","5e7092b4878c28a04739b167"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"140","pagesFromTo":"107329","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["605d60749543c745d80e5a65","60caeb349543c72336544565","602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","6369184a4097075f61a998f5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a66","mniswId":"5552","title":"ELECTROCHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS","issn":"1388-2481","documentHash":"954a3909-e962-4497-b85f-93018468c0e7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62fb402a4097076f71434b95","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"140","documentHash":"ee5c75ed-244d-4d98-a83e-3a1b6a2fe6de"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058418108"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"636a395e4097073ba713630a","name":"Spyros N.","lastName":"Pandis","documentHash":"e9c3733a-839a-4b5d-9edd-f2c19f2bda51"},{"objectId":"636a395e4097073ba7136309","name":"Kalliopi","lastName":"Florou","documentHash":"b3bd5a2b-48bd-4143-91f0-4289b880a891"},{"objectId":"636a395e4097073ba7136308","name":"John K.","lastName":"Kodros","documentHash":"2b323c4d-dc59-4e65-bc54-6c2f916091aa"},{"objectId":"636a395e4097073ba7136307","name":"Spiro","lastName":"Jorga","documentHash":"9649a9ab-4f42-4106-8a56-8fe7d29b05c1"},{"objectId":"636a395e4097073ba7136306","name":"Evangelia","lastName":"Kostenidou","documentHash":"a1f63e30-a349-45b5-b0a3-426e4eef0a56"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Szmigielski","uuid":"8BA441832175E89B21F79F78CE35C01EAE6DA9568D355F2A4BFC7D823AB2D6D5C83D7B8E06C8BBC3896462D090D1BFEEFF6AC20665089B7B419A5802C9DAD013","orcidId":"0000-0003-3389-9318","documentHash":"b9e87d98-9f5d-4922-852b-1896bf4792e3"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Błaziak","uuid":"AEDB2ECC32F737F5077EC9208A4CE78A44A394111443167820E6EF5EA4670E5AE09D9D49AF5EAB18FB5968748B3CBACB9FA54CC956C74EBBC14197011907BBAB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9270-5304","documentHash":"b0419532-30c3-4540-9c4d-f50db1e70699"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"636a395e4097073ba7136304","doi":"10.3390/atmos13091481","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/9/1481/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Properties and Atmospheric Oxidation of Norpinic Acid Aerosol","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Norpinic acid is a major semi-volatile oxidation product of α-pinene and β-pinene, two of the most important biogenic atmospheric volatile organic compounds. In this study we characterized the physicochemical properties of norpinic acid aerosol using a variety of techniques, and we investigated its reaction with OH radicals. The Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) spectrum of norpinic acid was characterized by a pronounced peak at m/z 82 (C5H6O+), which can be used as its chemical signature. The measured density of norpinic acid particles was 1.3 g cm−3. Its saturation concentration at 298 K was estimated to be equal to 8.9 μg m−3 using thermodenuder measurements and 12.8 μg m−3 using isothermal dilution. Its vaporization enthalpy was equal to 71 kJ mol−1. After reaction with OH radicals for an equivalent atmospheric period of 0.6–5 days under UV radiation and low RH, there were no noticeable changes in the AMS spectrum of the particles, while the wall-loss corrected mass concentration slightly decreased. This suggests that the atmospheric aging products of norpinic acid particles are quite similar to the parent molecule when measured by the AMS, and the aging reactions lead to a small change in particle mass concentration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1481","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["636a395e4097073ba7136306","636a395e4097073ba7136307","636a395e4097073ba7136308","636a395e4097073ba7136309","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","636a395e4097073ba713630a","5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","issn":"2073-4433","eissn":"2073-4433","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e99bbe2c-fe08-4cb7-999f-c3a55335bedc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636a395e4097073ba7136305","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"9","documentHash":"2ab13629-20c3-46a0-b866-dc53a033df45"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["norpinic acid; saturation concentration; vaporization enthalpy; density; chemical aging"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058418459"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"636908404097075f61a865dd","name":"Melissa Gurgel Adeodato","lastName":"Vieira","documentHash":"1f5968c7-e6d1-4803-abc3-3f3dce91cbaa"},{"objectId":"636908404097075f61a865dc","name":"Patrícia","lastName":"Prediger","documentHash":"aee0aef9-8678-478c-aec6-a73da99721e4"},{"objectId":"636908404097075f61a865da","name":"Giani de Vargas","lastName":"Brião","documentHash":"5f4bd5a5-aea1-4e6d-bf74-6bfafb1884ef"},{"objectId":"636908404097075f61a865d9","name":"Natália Gabriele","lastName":"Camparotto","documentHash":"8f841987-47e7-4c0d-8f67-3af71b69aa14"},{"objectId":"636908404097075f61a865d8","name":"Gustavo Rocha","lastName":"Paixão","documentHash":"081abe83-79cf-434f-be90-d34f0f52867b"},{"objectId":"616a392975234017e0545a1c","name":"Rafael","lastName":"De Lima Oliveira","uuid":"2A0952DDD5CA46FCB5F8E537449E7400054CA4D3A6CDED3C35A806C05ECCFE5E63CCA987EE7F1445FE8A8D1E0AFF7929A38B99AA638724CB2CE8BBD46A32C36D","documentHash":"fe127367-6cc0-4c99-b0c3-67135675feb1"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"objectId":"636908404097075f61a865d6","doi":"10.1016/j.cherd.2022.09.009","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0263876222004828?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Synthesis of mesoporous P‑doped carbon and its application in propranolol drug removal: Characterization, kinetics and isothermal studies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A novel P-doped mesoporous carbon (PMC) was prepared from sucrose, a natural source, using a hard template based on silica nanoparticles. The new PMC was characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, N-2 physisorption, Raman, XPS, and FT-IR. The analysis confirmed the tridimensional structure of PMC, which showed a high surface area of 830 m2.g(-1) and a pore volume of 1.4 cm3.g(-1). XPS analysis determined the phosphorus content of 4.1 %, mainly due to the functional groups of C-3-P]O and C-P(O)(OH)(2)/C-2-P(O)(OH). The new material was used to remove the drug propranolol (PRO) from water. PMC could remove PRO in 10 min, achieving a high removal capacity of 287 mg.g(-1), corresponding to 99 % of removal efficiency. The kinetic and equilibrium data were best described by pseudo -second order kinetic and BET isothermal models, suggesting multilayer adsorption where the first layer of PRO molecules strongly binds to the PMC surface, and subsequent layers are formed over the first one. The proposed mechanism of PRO adsorption is based on the chemisorption in C-P(O)(OH)(2)/C-2-P(O)(OH) acidic groups of PMC, physisorption through hydrogen-bonding, electrostatic and pi - pi interactions.

However, the performance of ETL-free devices still lags behind conventional devices because of mismatched energy levels and undesired interfacial charge recombination. In this study, we introduce sodium fluoride (NaF) as an interface layer in ETL-free PSCs to align the energy level between the perovskite and the FTO electrode. KPFM measurements clearly show that the NaF layer covers the surface of rough underlying FTO very well. This interface modification reduces the work function of FTO by forming an interfacial dipole layer, leading to band bending at the FTO/perovskite interface, which facilitates an effective electron carrier collection. Besides, the part of Na+ ions is found to be able to migrate into the absorber layer, facilitating enlarged grains and spontaneous passivation of the perovskite layer. As a result, the efficiency of the NaF-treated cell reaches 20%, comparable to those of state-of-the-art ETL-based cells. Moreover, this strategy effectively enhances the operational stability of devices by preserving 94% of the initial efficiency after storage for 500 h under continuous light soaking at 55 degrees C. Overall, these improvements in photovoltaic properties are clear indicators of enhanced interface passivation by NaF-based interface engineering."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"34","pagesFromTo":"38631-38641","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6374ce114097073f40570d1f","6374ce114097073f40570d20","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","6374ce114097073f40570d21","6374ce114097073f40570d22","6374ce114097073f40570d23"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dc5","mniswId":"125","title":"ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES","issn":"1944-8244","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/aamick","documentHash":"27b6e464-7a88-4cfc-a099-7ec8b65dc4b1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6374ce5f4097073f40571057","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"34","doi":"","documentHash":"f5575439-7c8e-4048-b7cc-584aeb31734a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058431725"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Garstecki","uuid":"75C65452002051CEFFE6071097E89DF6A74DD0FC1A118DE168CD40EFEDC485E8FF7DCB8A8288FEEBC45B2BDC2ADE2FC757D7CC1EB814D7EB9EAFD1588F4EB22E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9101-7163","documentHash":"cdc40e41-dc83-4780-be61-52db050a0f2d"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9a36","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Pacocha","uuid":"04DF661296E74E0C4CEF8F9B10D96583D5A24342DABAB09DCF99256C190D702C80AA49EF5CAAD49DB64D00983564B27EC3913B27E478EFDA087B33B1E1EADFE5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9543-7122","documentHash":"44fd9cf1-a37b-4252-a7c5-6f0faf9e91ab"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a176b","name":"Witold","lastName":"Postek","uuid":"47D349CB03FF194CE2D0465994215AF15F8684B8B7237E34026159CBA81DA08DCA2BBA4B33B832E70390259C54DD735BB27E95D8BD4E6BE0CB8DB79F5AD66F70","orcidId":"0000-0003-0329-4983","documentHash":"ce83d57e-25e9-460d-919b-271b4a88052d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6374d23c4097073f40577890","doi":"10.1039/d2lc00394e","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/LC/D2LC00394E","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Microfluidics for antibiotic susceptibility testing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The rise of antibiotic resistance is a threat to global health.

Renewable energy sources are the only way out in order to provide energy in a sustainable manner for the ever-increasing demands of the society. A renewable energy source which can also provide clean water will be of immense interest and that is where Photocatalytic Fuel Cells (PFCs) exactly fit in. PFCs hold the ability to produce electric power with simultaneous photocatalytic degradation of pollutants on exposure to light. Different strategies, including conventional Photoelectrochemical cell design, have been technically upgraded to exploit the advantage of PFCs and to widen their applicability. Parallel to the research on design, researchers have put an immense effort into developing materials/composites for electrodes and their unique properties. The efficient strategies and potential materials have opened up a new horizon of applications for PFCs. Recent research reports reveal this persistently broadening arena which includes hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide generation, carbon dioxide and heavy metal reduction and even sensor applications. The review reported here consolidates all the aspects of various design strategies, materials and applications of PFCs. The review provides an overall understanding of PFC systems, which possess the potential to be a marvellous renewable source of energy with a handful of simultaneous applications.

Bacterial biofilm formation on such devices (e.g., brackets) causes enamel demineralization, referred to as white spot lesions (WSL). WSL is significant health, social and economic problem. We provide a nanotechnology-based solution utilizing a nanocomposite of gold nanoparticles embedded in a polyoxoborate matrix (BOA: B-boron, O-oxygen, A-gold, Latin aurum). The nanocomposite is fully inorganic, and the coating protocol is straightforward, effective, and ecologically friendly (low waste and water-based). Prepared coatings are mechanically stable against brushing with a toothbrush (up to 100 min of brushing). Bacteria adhesion and antibacterial properties are tested against Streptococcus mutans-common bacteria in the oral cavity. BOA reduces the adhesion of bacteria by around 78%, that is, from around 7.99 x 10(5) & PLUSMN; 1.33 x 10(5) CFU per bracket to 1.69 x 10(5) & PLUSMN; 3.07 x 10(4) CFU per bracket of S. mutans detached from unmodified and modified brackets, respectively. Modified fixed orthodontic brackets remain safe for eukaryotic cells and meet ISO 10993-5:2009 requirements for medical devices. The gathered data show that BOA deposited on orthodontic appliances provides a viable preventive measure against bacteria colonization, which presents frequent and significant complications of orthodontic treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","5e70942a878c28a0473b7770"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c7fb084097076eb37d47dd","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","63c7fb084097076eb37d47de","5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454784e7","mniswId":"10322","title":"Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials","issn":"1552-4973","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1552-4981","documentHash":"53c76b5f-6565-4f4c-8af2-b1205df83201"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"630e124c4097073ebc94c83d","year":"2022","documentHash":"54226cd6-ddae-401f-9ec8-910ccf9df969"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058445578"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c7f98f4097076eb37d3118","name":"Leonhard","lastName":"Grill","documentHash":"d1897095-a46a-4bcb-88e9-b465adf7820b"},{"objectId":"63c7f98f4097076eb37d3117","name":"Mats","lastName":"Persson","documentHash":"c32f0360-7277-4e88-977b-7e1da2ee051f"},{"objectId":"63c7f98f4097076eb37d3116","name":"Monika","lastName":"Schied","documentHash":"e9d7461e-2f01-40ea-8f4f-d9f1d725e474"},{"objectId":"63c7f98f4097076eb37d3115","name":"Emile","lastName":"Durant","documentHash":"85329142-2090-4647-a47e-e52adf4d3606"},{"objectId":"63c7f98f4097076eb37d3114","name":"Simon","lastName":"Jaekel","documentHash":"ff0c6353-293f-4dd3-998f-2780fdf67cf2"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a28","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Ostapko","uuid":"578A0F5EDEB0CBAD6272B43D4AFB1F6DCBA6CDDA8E3BA4F0730D54F23516125014F3FB3F82AFAF4C7EC826A79D3BFF20CE6D58A6FEBFA5FE3413068FFC1847C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0129-2418","documentHash":"0eb165d4-6fa1-444a-8a70-1ac95a734540"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff86","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kijak","uuid":"6D0014D1FB60F4B89A96CE61DE56724016FBC175221013305BD94E0861B3F0C0C44F716CE81502D6E5110D5F3FDA7FFD057DEA890CBD72FE691600CA3C5405A0","orcidId":"0000-0001-9340-583X","documentHash":"443a4505-4b1d-43bb-8fd7-f883335ca686"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Waluk","uuid":"587A78D077C4375A4C980253E3D29FB2074174FC88F6A7341BDCBF8F80F6764FDE1461139B4C2337F132A7A1787A14076B55E79D57654F32E1BE17E03941A875","orcidId":"0000-0001-5745-583X","documentHash":"f8893a20-d629-4008-9c8c-d34c0e171106"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63c7f98f4097076eb37d3112","doi":"10.1039/d2cp04746b","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/CP/D2CP04746B","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Tautomerization of single asymmetric oxahemiporphycene molecules on Cu(111)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We have studied 22-oxahemiporphycene molecules by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy at low temperatures and density functional theory calculations. In contrast to other molecular switches with typically two switching states, these molecules can in principle exist in three different tautomers, due to their asymmetry and three inequivalent binding positions of a hydrogen atom in their macrocycle. Different tautomers are identified from the typical appearance on the surface and tunneling electrons can be used to tautomerize single molecules in a controllable way with the highest rates if the STM tip is placed close to the hydrogen binding positions in the cavity. Characteristic switching processes are explained by the different energy pathways upon adsorption on the surface. Upon applying higher bias voltages, deprotonation occurs instead of tautomerization, which becomes evident in the molecular appearance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a28","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff86","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1096-1104","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c7f98f4097076eb37d3114","63c7f98f4097076eb37d3115","63c7f98f4097076eb37d3116","63c7f98f4097076eb37d3117","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a28","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff86","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","63c7f98f4097076eb37d3118"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547925d","mniswId":"16075","title":"PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS","issn":"1463-9076","documentHash":"8e732841-944b-4696-92c7-03b5ad988f7d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c7f98f4097076eb37d3113","year":"2023","volume":"25","number":"2","documentHash":"67d7d2b1-b36c-493a-b1b3-3ea2d1232c90"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058445801"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c7fbd84097076eb37d5917","name":"Pedro","lastName":"Cano-Perdomo","documentHash":"b8ff341c-d6f5-4446-bd15-48d9e56e66be"},{"objectId":"63c7fbd84097076eb37d5916","name":"Manuela","lastName":"Ruiz-Candamil","documentHash":"aab83038-60d6-4718-b90a-a57b198e7350"},{"objectId":"63c7fbd84097076eb37d5915","name":"Kim E.","lastName":"Stansfield","documentHash":"59c6fa9e-f39d-4776-afa7-34eea70eae1c"},{"objectId":"63c7fbd84097076eb37d5914","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Rojas","documentHash":"ea1f3bdd-40a9-40e7-b3ea-467b04f0dd16"},{"objectId":"63c7fbd84097076eb37d5913","name":"Sergio","lastName":"Barbosa-Granados","documentHash":"4aeee9f4-8f90-4dbc-908d-bc73456b2985"},{"objectId":"63c7fbd84097076eb37d5912","name":"Ramón Fernando","lastName":"Colmenares-Quintero","documentHash":"789c6d87-2fcf-4ead-8b79-10cb1c8195a3"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63c7fbd84097076eb37d5911","doi":"10.3390/su142315545","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/23/15545/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Learning and Teaching Styles in a Public School with a Focus on Renewable Energies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of this study is to identify teaching styles (TS) and learning styles (LS) in teachers and students in public schools with a focus on renewable energies, with the aim of designing and applying curricular strategies based on active learning in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the same way, it seeks to determine the differences related between TS and LS. The research was developed with a quantitative methodology and a correlational descriptive approach. In addition, a non-experimental, cross-sectional design was used and an intentional non-probabilistic sampling of 125 students and 20 professors from the Maria Inmaculada School of the municipality of Puerto Carreno, Colombia. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between TS and LS. However, it was identified that students prefer a reflective teaching methodology (M = 15.5, SD = 0.75) followed by the active style (M = 14.2, SD = 1.10) and, to a lesser extent, the pragmatic style (M = 11.4, SD = 1.19). In the case of teachers, the most used teaching style is also reflective (M = 25.7, SD = 1.02), followed by individualized (M = 20.1, SD = 0.56) and, to a lesser extent, inquiry (M = 5.3, SD = 1.10). This research allows the generating of new knowledge that contributes to improving educational processes in the school population with a focus on renewable energies, enabling the promotion of strategies towards a sustainable society."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"15545","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c7fbd84097076eb37d5912","63c7fbd84097076eb37d5913","63c7fbd84097076eb37d5914","63c7fbd84097076eb37d5915","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","63c7fbd84097076eb37d5916","63c7fbd84097076eb37d5917"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63899a1c40970777167faac9","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"14","number":"23","documentHash":"6a03efa8-7440-48eb-b686-4c27288ff873"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058449937"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62c3","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Palczewski","documentHash":"74b7818b-5d85-4266-9fd7-1bf2c43c14c8"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62c2","name":"David R.","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"5259132d-ffad-4b14-a0c2-340880d38887"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62c1","name":"David C.","lastName":"Lyon","documentHash":"ace2a2e0-b2a4-4951-b7eb-16e7f96e6b7a"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62c0","name":"Seth","lastName":"Blackshaw","documentHash":"cc325c41-0512-4571-88a1-21d516db5d12"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62bf","name":"Sajeev","lastName":"Kohli","documentHash":"a4be0aff-6ba5-4374-8369-c05ce4a1c4ee"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62be","name":"Aditya","lastName":"Raguram","documentHash":"137e2a62-4287-436c-93e9-c21513a8e1d0"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62bd","name":"Zhiqian","lastName":"Dong","documentHash":"8dfe59f4-7c78-4f6d-a302-f07c738e5959"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62bc","name":"Samuel W.","lastName":"Du","documentHash":"08918e5c-2206-4754-91e1-4961aca73c7f"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62bb","name":"Thanh","lastName":"Hoang","documentHash":"695c051e-4d2c-4aac-8cc7-8e28f4c77713"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62ba","name":"Samagya","lastName":"Banskota","documentHash":"9d814b89-de20-4b93-98ec-3d15c63f85a1"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62b9","name":"Xin D.","lastName":"Gao","documentHash":"10d7c19e-e04a-485e-a849-e9d7b2a9c4bb"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62b8","name":"Gregory A.","lastName":"Newby","documentHash":"13ea0a6d-0429-41c5-a2af-82640e33e486"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62b7","name":"Henri","lastName":"Leinonen","documentHash":"9da7399f-c3e2-4df0-9513-f79a797213ce"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62b6","name":"Susie","lastName":"Suh","documentHash":"e895ba05-dbc4-4ccc-bf8c-fcee1d89671a"},{"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62b5","name":"Elliot H.","lastName":"Choi","documentHash":"9c892249-9043-4fb9-b7a9-233122913d21"},{"objectId":"5f505f00752340073806a8ca","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Foik","uuid":"920777744AE28A5DDAB9F1CE4CE386158926640B4996491C47ACB5D4F5DE6FD1F8EA9296334C2DC6F74B2CDC57F4705E23004E7F0D80EE5BD7CCFEC56E05824F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1110-9223","documentHash":"d6ab11c7-e957-4d1b-aa7c-f7c42d4fb5d6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63c941124097074220cc62b4","doi":"10.1038/s41467-022-29490-3","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29490-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"In vivo base editing rescues cone photoreceptors in a mouse model of early-onset inherited retinal degeneration","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is the most common cause of inherited retinal degeneration in children. LCA patients with RPE65 mutations show accelerated cone photoreceptor dysfunction and death, resulting in early visual impairment. It is therefore crucial to develop a robust therapy that not only compensates for lost RPE65 function but also protects photoreceptors from further degeneration. Here, we show that in vivo correction of an Rpe65 mutation by adenine base editor (ABE) prolongs the survival of cones in an LCA mouse model. In vitro screening of ABEs and sgRNAs enables the identification of a variant that enhances in vivo correction efficiency. Subretinal delivery of ABE and sgRNA corrects up to 40% of Rpe65 transcripts, restores cone-mediated visual function, and preserves cones in LCA mice. Single-cell RNA-seq reveals upregulation of genes associated with cone phototransduction and survival. Our findings demonstrate base editing as a potential gene therapy that confers long-lasting retinal protection.\nLeber congenital amaurosis is caused by mutations in RPE65 and leads to retinal degeneration in children.

One of the ways to cargo introduction is osmotic-mediated intracellular vesicle swelling. However, its widespread use was hindered due to cargo size (<10 nm) and cell-type-related restrictions. We addressed the issue of the composition of colloidal loading solution to enhance the efficiency of cellular delivery.\n\nExperiments: We examined the effectiveness of colloidal loading solutions of varied compositions, including various types and sizes of polymers building osmotic pressure. We used confocal imaging coupled with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to evaluate the introduction of polymers, proteins, nanopartides, and DNA plasmids (cargos of sizes 1-175 nm) to cells representing eight cell lines: cancer, normal, epithelial, and mesenchymal ones.\nFindings: We found that cellular delivery effectiveness strongly correlates with the size and concentration of osmotic pressure building polymers and not with the high value of the osmotic pressure itself. We show that polymer solutions at the entangled regime of concentrations enhance the delivery of large biomacromolecules even of size 200 nm (DNA plasmids) into cells, including MDA-MB-231 cells - so far resistant to the osmotic procedure. We show that the colloid loading medium based on entangled polymer chains is a versatile cargo delivery tool for molecular biology. (C) 2022 The Authors.

However, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the 2D perovskites solar cells (PSCs) still lag behind their three-dimensional (3D) counterpart, particularly due to the anisotropy in the charge carrier mobility and inhomogeneous energy landscape. A promising alternative is Dion Jacobson (D-J)phase quasi-2D perovskite, where the bulky organic diammonium cations are introduced into inorganic frameworks to remove the weak van der Waals interactions between interlayers and to improve the open-circuit voltage (V-oc). Although the D-J phase 2D perovskite shows a homogeneous energy landscape and better charge transport, their poor crystallinity and existence of higher trap states remain a major challenge for the development of high-efficiency solar cells device. To address this issue, here, we report the eclipsed D-J phase 2D perovskite using 1,5-diaminonaphthalene cation and subsequently treated the film with ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) additive to further improve the film crystallinity, out-of-plane orientation, and carrier mobility. We observe that 2 mol NH4SCN surface treatment in NDA-based D-J phase perovskite leads to better film morphology and improved crystallinity, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy and steady-state space charge limited current (SCLC) mobility measurement reveal a significant reduction of trap-assisted nonradiative recombination and improvement of carrier mobility in the thiocyanate-passivated perovskite. Consequently, the PCE of the NH4SCN-treated (NDA)(MA)(3)(Pb)(4) (I)(13) perovskite device enhanced nearly 46% from 10.3 to 15.08%. We have further studied intensity-dependent J-V characteristics, which demonstrate the reduction of ideality factor, confirming the effective suppression of trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, consistent with the transient PL results.

As a result of its strengths, the literature concerning its fundamental prin-ciples is comprehensive. Since this field continues to evolve, new areas, such as the production of solid microcapsules, need to be covered and updated. To date, some specific reviews cover microencapsulation by microfluidic focusing on the area of biology and medicine: production of microgels, controlled drug release, bacteria and cell encapsulation, and tissue engineering. Nonetheless, this technique is expanding to other research areas like material science, which can bring these materials to other applications such as food and cosmetics, self-healing materials, and energy storage industry. This work aims to cover these aspects by presenting the latest research trends in microfluidic microcapsule production. The review traces the field's evolution, showing the weaknesses and challenges faced by scientists to fully exploit the advantages of this technique. To this end, the work focuses on different facets of material science: core and shell materials; parameters affecting the capsule structure; shell curing processes; material per-formance; and mass production challenges. The review initially addresses the fundamentals required to understand the microcapsule formation process.CO 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report D-J phase quasi2D (XDA)(MA)3(Pb)4(I)13 perovskites processed with an ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) additive, showing a stabilized PCE of 17.05% which is one of the highest reported PCEs for a D-J phase quasi-2D perovskite. The NH4SCN additive modification leads to the optimum phase distribution, enlarged grain size, and improved crystallinity. Moreover, increased charge transport and reduced defect density was confirmed in the passivated perovskite. The unencapsulated device retained 80% of its initial PCE after 1000 h of storage under 50% relative humidity and 75% of its initial PCE in 200 h of storage under 85 degrees C of thermal stress.

An efficient charge transfer between ZnIn2S4 and CdTe in the ZnIn2S4/CdTe QD composite is confirmed from Photoluminescence (PL) studies. Effective reduction in bandgap of composite heterostructure enhances the absorption in visible spectrum and generates more charge carriers, as corroborated from PEC measurements (similar to 5.7 mu A/cm(2)). In the present work 3% CdTe QDs decorated with ZnIn2S4 (ZCd(3)) exhibits higher photocatalytic activity during degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye by 94% in 35 min. An excellent photocatalytic performance of ZCd(3) sample was also noted during H-2 production yielding a production rate of 1070 mu mol g(-1) in 3 h.

The XPS measurements do not show any contamination by F- on the surface, which is common for WOx samples formed by an anodization method.

In reported research, Prussian Blue nanoparticles served as a model redox active nanoobjects for studies in forced convection conditions. Recently, (M. Holdynski et al. Electrochem. Commmun. 86 (2018) 130-134), we have demonstrated that injection of these nanoparticles suspension into electrochemical cell results in a sharp decrease or increase of the current at glassy carbon rotating disc electrode set at potential corresponding to their electroreduction or electrooxidation respectively. Here, on the example of the electroreduction of Prussian Blue nanoparticles, we show that the shape of potential vs time dependence is independent of the electrode rotation rate. Analysis of the current-time dependences based on the Levich equation indicates that only an average 0.12 % of Fe3+ ions present at the surface of the given nanoparticle undergoes electroreduction in the elementary reaction step. Injection of Prussian Blue nanoparticles into flowing aqueous electrolyte produces a sharp increase of the current recorded at glassy carbon electrode of the electrochemical wall-jet detector, followed by its gradual decrease. Such behaviour is generally observed for redox-active molecules. The ratio of the peak currents corresponding to electrooxidation and electroreduction of Prussian Blue nanoparticles colliding with the electrode differs from the expected from the stoichiometry of reactions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709350878c28a0473a70f7","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","5e7092b4878c28a04739b167"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"921","pagesFromTo":"116698","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709350878c28a0473a70f7","5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478652","mniswId":"10899","title":"JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","issn":"1572-6657","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b615ecb3-7f71-48eb-8edd-c20f712541b0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6384a2bb4097073208700f81","year":"2022","volume":"921","documentHash":"edd32707-cd63-4fe7-9b22-e44f2c3df6ff"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hexacyanoferrate/Flow injection analysis/Rotating disc electrode/Wall-jet detector/Glassy carbon electrode"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058460931"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6384b49b4097073208724152","name":"József","lastName":"Tóth","documentHash":"595e233d-7bb1-4bc5-8f49-e28c6bbaf1ca"},{"objectId":"6384b49b4097073208724151","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Atrei","documentHash":"9e6486b4-b417-4a9f-944f-18029c2a2c55"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff24","name":"Beata","lastName":"Lesiak-Orłowska","uuid":"568072B8F795A59A4469526D64724F7F6F8F2618DA71B4B3A9EDEC60CD39056859AC4029BE30E48544BE9B39BAB9FDF91C3E1C831AB9E81624539A39BA95AD56","orcidId":"0000-0003-2633-8483","documentHash":"dc99ae88-6c95-471d-bb47-54d64d716fce"}],"objectId":"6384b49b4097073208724150","doi":"10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.154366","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0169433222018992?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Magnetite nanoparticles functionalized with citrate: A surface science study by XPS and ToF-SIMS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The surface composition of magnetite nanoparticles, bare and functionalized with citrate, was investigated by means of XPS and ToF-SIMS.

Micmflow photocatalytic oxidation tests proved that the Fe-TiO2 material has the highest photocatalytic conversion of benzyl alcohol compared with the other titania samples under UV and visible light irradiation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b0038","5fbddc5d085dcb3958990a73","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"162","pagesFromTo":"106375","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fbddc5d085dcb3958990a73","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0038","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477562","mniswId":"3325","title":"Catalysis Communications","issn":"1566-7367","eissn":"1873-3905","documentHash":"266797a6-3d08-453b-8704-f4325f27139b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d24f3f40970773d53a8d35","year":"2022","volume":"162","documentHash":"4e909f65-7753-4427-a224-718872759cef"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058463697"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d251aa40970773d53abeea","name":"Kim E.","lastName":"Stansfield","documentHash":"d438e324-9037-40cd-bb47-9c83e1cab259"},{"objectId":"63d251aa40970773d53abee9","name":"Marieth","lastName":"Baquero-Almazo","documentHash":"492c446a-c2a5-4359-906a-0063ebfe420d"},{"objectId":"63d251aa40970773d53abee8","name":"Gina","lastName":"Maestre-Gongora","documentHash":"adcb79da-c394-45be-806f-cba02873c65e"},{"objectId":"63d251aa40970773d53abee7","name":"Ramón Fernando","lastName":"Colmenares-Quintero","documentHash":"6068d2bd-db9a-4800-b4ae-07a5f9f453dc"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63d251aa40970773d53abee6","doi":"10.3390/en15207644","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/20/7644/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Data Analysis of Electricity Service in Colombia’s Non-Interconnected Zones through Different Clustering Techniques","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Energy determines the social, economic, and environmental aspects that enable the advancement of communities. For this reason, this paper aims to analyze the quality of the energy service in the Non-Interconnected Zones (NIZ) of Colombia. For this purpose, clustering techniques (K-means, K-medoids, divisive analysis clustering, and heatmaps) are applied for data analysis in the context of the NIZ to identify patterns or hidden information in the Colombian government data related to the state of the electricity service in these localities during the years 2019-2020. A descriptive statistical analysis and validation of the results of the clustering techniques is also carried out using R software. Through the implementation of clustering algorithms such as K-means, K-medoids, and divisive analysis clustering, potential areas for the development of renewable and alternative energy projects are identified, considering places with deficiencies in their current electricity service, higher consumption, or places with very low daily hours of electricity service. Additionally, relationships were identified in the dataset that can be considered as tools that would support decision-making for academia and industry, as well as the definition of guidelines or strategies from the government to improve energy efficiency and quality for these places, and consequently, the living conditions of the residents of Colombia's NIZs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"7644","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d251aa40970773d53abee7","63d251aa40970773d53abee8","63d251aa40970773d53abee9","63d251aa40970773d53abeea","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"634cff75409707021a624442","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"20","documentHash":"5107fdbe-83f1-4945-93b3-f043ce872762"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058463764"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d250bb40970773d53aa5b9","name":"Eva G.","lastName":"Noya","documentHash":"3d58502a-7b1a-40c8-9b56-87c0f279aa91"},{"objectId":"63d250bb40970773d53aa5b8","name":"Ariel G.","lastName":"Meyra","documentHash":"431f3e8f-c43f-434c-a5b0-272df619b837"},{"objectId":"5fc4c5a0085dcb1e6ae0b8f5","name":"Horacio","lastName":"Serna Serna","uuid":"52E15A53855BB93EA1CB6B19633F0C5D2345E7E37A5DA447CB9E5462957EB6354AC21469F9DF21691E2D09321C3186564C8EFA16A7089429292EFD3E7DDE965E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5885-5074","documentHash":"4c5560d4-4fdd-4b61-ac87-dc4cf647e979"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afee8","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Góźdź","uuid":"197B6E68CB3C2A59D0BC10FE02374BD275CDB73277FF57AD7B1F7945DEC1E8C579C7FF45896BCC73F763CD875C839EFC962E3F19F45034A7BE89A84DB14AEADD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4506-6831","documentHash":"182609ba-8d05-4c5b-adfd-ddf5d4231097"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-01","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63d250bb40970773d53aa5b6","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c04850","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c04850","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Self-Assembly of Optimally Packed Cylindrical Clusters inside Spherical Shells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Systems with short-range attraction and long-range repulsion can form ordered microphases in bulk and under confinement.

Sample vibrations were stimulated via a loudspeaker, and pre-compensation was used to calibrate the acoustic spectrum. Sample vibrations were measured via phase-sensitive swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT). Resonance frequencies of corneal phantoms were measured at varying intraocular pressures (IOP), and dependencies on Young ' s Modulus (E), phantom thickness and IOP were observed. Cycling IOP revealed hysteresis. For E = 0.3 MPa, resonance frequencies increased with IOP at a rate of 3.9, 3.7 and 3.5 Hz/mmHg for varied thicknesses and 1.7, 2.5 and 2.8 Hz/mmHg for E = 0.16 MPa. Resonance frequencies increased with thickness at a rate of 0.25 Hz/mu m for E = 0.3 MPa, and 0.40 Hz/mu m for E = 0.16 MPa. E showed the most predominant impact in the shift of the resonance frequencies. Full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the resonance modes increased with increasing thickness and decreased with increasing E. Only thickness and E contributed to the variance of FWHM. In rabbit corneas, resonance frequencies of 360-460 Hz were observed.

Polymer-assisted techniques are a great approach to control the growth rate of SCs effectively. However, the resultant optoelectrical properties induced by polymers are ambiguous and need to be taken into the consideration. In this study, we have synthesized methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) SCs using polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polystyrene (PS) polymers where PEG contains oxygen functionalities and PS does not. We studied the electrical properties of these SCs under dark and illumination conditions. It was observed that PEG-assisted SCs showed few defects with lower photocurrent as compared to the PS-assisted ones because of defect-mediated conductivity. The results are further verified by transient current response, responsivity, and capacitance-frequency measurements. The present study sheds light on the polymer selection for the growth of MHP SCs and their optoelectronic properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"41","pagesFromTo":"36535-36542","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d23b7e40970773d5391812","63d23b7e40970773d5391813","63d23b7e40970773d5391814","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","63d23b7e40970773d5391815","63d23b7e40970773d5391816","63d23b7e40970773d5391817","63d23b7e40970773d5391818","63d23b7e40970773d5391819","63d23b7e40970773d539181a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b800","mniswId":"138","title":"ACS Omega","issn":"2470-1343","eissn":"2470-1343","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/page/acsodf/about.html","documentHash":"97264f81-7bd1-468f-8fdb-1f4116564c77"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d23b7e40970773d5391811","year":"2022","volume":"7","number":"41","documentHash":"afdf257b-f8b8-482a-9d25-4d291bd5e391"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058464059"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6387536840970727ca806185","name":"Tan-Phat","lastName":"Huynh","documentHash":"39119b87-d586-484d-a9e9-f0690217dc4a"},{"objectId":"6387536840970727ca806184","name":"Amit","lastName":"Jaiswal","documentHash":"fe2a7bce-9c5e-4c64-8b1a-1daf4bf125f8"},{"objectId":"6387536840970727ca806183","name":"Shounak","lastName":"Roy","documentHash":"340b4726-8311-4acf-87cd-324a6a3e2059"},{"objectId":"6387536840970727ca806182","name":"Parastoo","lastName":"Vahdatiyekta","documentHash":"96b6b8e8-0c83-4d9e-80a9-e730dee3b8be"},{"objectId":"6387536840970727ca806181","name":"Mohammed","lastName":"Zniber","documentHash":"62570892-eae4-4682-8f50-1296c3570b4a"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Nikiforow","uuid":"E166453BA6868F48895D87A86E6702843A623A59A84923A7C78B7FFBB992983C7D95FE6E5E79D29AB2127112DC3887B27E8FB1E44DE4688F1367FD5EA5783F74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6135-8514","documentHash":"c96f36f3-357e-4938-9d4c-83e71d392895"}],"objectId":"6387536840970727ca80617f","doi":"10.1088/2399-1984/ac8215","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2399-1984/ac8215","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Electrochemical detection of homovanillic acid, a breast cancer biomarker, using Pluronic-modified MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides have gained considerable attention from the scientific community for their various applications thanks to their remarkable chemical, physical, optical and electronic properties.

Herein, electroactivity toward hydrogen evolution reaction was examined in 1.0 M KOH on commercial Ni81P19 (MBF-60) and Ni70Cr6Fe2B14Si8 (MBF-20A) amorphous alloys and for comparison on Ni, untreated and modified by anodic etching in hot concentrated NaCl solutions. This treatment increased the electroactivity of all the materials, but especially of Ni81P19 and particularly of matte side of its ribbons, decreasing overpotential at -10 mA cm(-2) to -0.14 V. XRD, SEM/EDS and XPS studies were carried out. EIS measurements indicated that the rise of hydrogen evolution after etching was related mainly to the increase of surface area, and only slightly to the rise of intrinsic electroactivity, probably being due to the formation of NiO.

The plaques are mainly composed of small peptides from the beta-amyloid (A beta) family which differ in how they bind copper ions and thus in their properties. pA beta(3-42) species and its A beta(3-42) precursor are found in significant proportion in the plaques; however, their complexes with copper ions are hardly explored. The electrochemical response of the copper complexes with N-truncated A beta(3-16) and its pyroglutamate counterpart pA beta(316) was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. Results obtained in physiological pH (pH similar to 7.4) show that Cu(II) ions in these peptides undergo reduction Cu(II)/Cu(I) at a potential (E-f)similar to 0.05 V which in other peptides have been shown to enhance production of reactive oxygen species. Here, a voltammetric study, performed at pH below and above 7.4, reveals the effects of coordination modes on the observed redox processes. The conclusions are important for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6fb","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"e202200623","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6fb","638892ac4097074ca31ed756","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775c0","mniswId":"3460","title":"ChemElectroChem","issn":"2196-0216","eissn":"2196-0216","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"69b4b420-d94d-4637-a792-841d1267318d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"638892ac4097074ca31ed755","year":"2022","volume":"9","number":"17","documentHash":"54eb104b-8ea1-4161-a372-2b0de59b9ede"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058467456"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"638753f740970727ca806801","name":"O.

Belonging to the matrix metalloproteinase protein family, MMP-1 is an interstitial collagenase that degrades collagen and may be involved in cell migration, cell proliferation, the pro-inflammatory effect, and cancer progression. Hence, it can serve as a disease protein biomarker and thus be useful in early diagnosis. Herein, epitopes of MMP-1 were identified by screening its crystal structure. To identify possible epitopes for imprinting, MMP-1 was cleaved in silico with trypsin, pepsin at pH = 1.3, and pepsin at pH > 2.0 using Peptide Cutter, generating peptide fragments containing 8 to 12 amino acids. Five criteria were applied to select the peptides most suitable as potential epitopes for MMP-1. The triphenylamine rhodanine-3-acetic acid (TPARA) functional monomer was synthesized to form a stable pre-polymerization complex with a selected template epitope. The complexed functional monomer was then copolymerized with 3,4-ethoxylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) using potentiodynamic electropolymerization onto indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes. The composition of the molecularly imprinted poly(TPARA-co-EDOT) (MIP) was optimized by maximizing the film's electrical conductivity. Cyclic voltammetry was used to determine MMP-1 concentration in the presence of the Fe(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(CN)(6)(4-) redox probe actuating the \"gate effect.\" A calibration curve was constructed and used to determine the usable concentration range and the limit of detection as ca. 0.001 to 10.0 pg/mL and 0.2 fg/mL MMP-1, respectively. Finally, the MMP-1 concentration in the A549 human lung (carcinoma) culture medium was measured, and this determination accuracy was confirmed using an ELISA assay"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7a","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1018","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63cfb6df4097075010f2b22f","63cfb6df4097075010f2b230","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","63cfb6df4097075010f2b231","63cfb6df4097075010f2b232","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7a","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","63cfb6df4097075010f2b233","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","63cfb6df4097075010f2b234","63cfb6df4097075010f2b235"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb7d","mniswId":"2541","title":"Biosensors-Basel","issn":"2079-6374","eissn":"2079-6374","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"1542b059-47a9-47d7-9847-d06727ccea21"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cfb6df4097075010f2b22e","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"11","documentHash":"490027b2-a342-40bc-b5c7-be61aca60f8d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058470920"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63cfb0b04097075010f1bf87","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kamińska","documentHash":"13ff1370-763e-48e5-8404-5bfb42f22788"},{"objectId":"63cfb0b04097075010f1bf86","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Przedpełska","documentHash":"af3d5ce4-df2c-4bea-a9e5-ae064cbd79e0"},{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6b70","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Berus","uuid":"7815C16291F02480DD49EBB8325DCA99B488C88A3FAFEF5DF72BC897B1E71A3B5298546D057A8D69AF1B529FD223FB58B390215962E0B4DF01BD71E7AD8E7CCF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1321-3884","documentHash":"d80e0c0a-2b2c-406a-9f70-bcef54688730"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Stepanenko","uuid":"BF57EE64971811A251374C75A08A64C7DC048997A86A87460BCC2CC8BC9E96C9DFF7EC1C40B0754A465BB2A8216565AC2EACDC66EAAA2EAAD983E233DEA89728","orcidId":"0000-0001-9919-4447","documentHash":"5f260202-2f2b-402d-83ac-ff29415a756b"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0030","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szymborski","uuid":"954854E6F2B443EC1CEB9F87B01EE762AF5FD41964DF487AECCC88636584A873D6A10C14419BE9300C7867D99C4B0428A933B1CC8AEFC11FFBA4EA05B9BB8898","orcidId":"0000-0002-7308-0609","documentHash":"947670c0-098e-4473-88a8-425f44f4fcbf"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a4b","name":"Monika","lastName":"Adamczyk-Popławska","uuid":"44767C6B635420412AC75E1913FC5C6CEC1EC8BEB23588EE1DDA9A6431D37C1047A11A8C1BDB7C8EBC2171EC044D7222AC6278C83B3C9AF0F45D4B5CE04A180B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5885-9550","documentHash":"201f6aad-2f3c-48a3-8ad8-339fa29edb73"},{"objectId":"5e709303878c28a0473a1151","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Goździk","uuid":"458A62EE829EF54A5846347F540B7FA35A03B36AF8E20C2669BB556BC418605CA97408A8E4F3DCAE9F16549B754502D5E435CB50B24C6371981FBFABF5916EC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7051-9524","documentHash":"8cb1d8f7-a7ab-4966-9aa6-ef1491a6eb6e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63cfb0b04097075010f1bf83","doi":"10.3390/ijms232012576","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/20/12576/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"SERS-PLSR Analysis of Vaginal Microflora: Towards the Spectral Library of Microorganisms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The accurate identification of microorganisms belonging to vaginal microflora is crucial for establishing which microorganisms are responsible for microbial shifting from beneficial symbiotic to pathogenic bacteria and understanding pathogenesis leading to vaginosis and vaginal infections. In this study, we involved the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique to compile the spectral signatures of the most significant microorganisms being part of the natural vaginal microbiota and some vaginal pathogens. Obtained data will supply our still developing spectral SERS database of microorganisms. The SERS results were assisted by Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), which visually discloses some dependencies between spectral images and hence their biochemical compositions of the outer structure. In our work, we focused on the most common and typical of the reproductive system microorganisms (Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp.) and vaginal pathogens: bacteria (e.g., Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Atopobium vaginae), fungi (e.g., Candida albicans, Candida glabrata), and protozoa (Trichomonas vaginalis). The obtained results proved that each microorganism has its unique spectral fingerprint that differentiates it from the rest. Moreover, the discrimination was obtained at a high level of explained information by subsequent factors, e.g., in the inter-species distinction of Candida spp. the first three factors explain 98% of the variance in block Y with 95% of data within the X matrix, while in differentiation between Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. (natural flora) and pathogen (e.g., Candida glabrata) the information is explained at the level of 45% of the Y matrix with 94% of original data. PLSR gave us insight into discriminating variables based on which the marker bands representing specific compounds in the outer structure of microorganisms were found: for Lactobacillus spp. 1400 cm(-1), for fungi 905 and 1209 cm(-1), and for protozoa 805, 890, 1062, 1185, 1300, 1555, and 1610 cm(-1). Then, they can be used as significant marker bands in the analysis of clinical subjects, e.g., vaginal swabs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e709420878c28a0473b6b70","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0030"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7a4b","5e709303878c28a0473a1151"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"12576","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709420878c28a0473b6b70","5e709358878c28a0473a7a4b","5e709303878c28a0473a1151","63cfb0b04097075010f1bf86","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0030","5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","63cfb0b04097075010f1bf87"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"634903b84097072ef2873362","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"20","documentHash":"47cd9c6b-fdfa-4412-83eb-1aed1e751d09"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058471094"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d9126d4097073994946367","name":"Gian Andrea","lastName":"Rizzi","documentHash":"6909a10a-dab1-4044-b094-d2e3e9a2b10f"},{"objectId":"60a4fb449543c758682b639b","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Cimoch","uuid":"42951E10AF46D11EBF438AF1A6B0AF59593908593803C15FF62F418CDE60920CB059B0F5867C90F4364E3916A8FE291B65953C98287CDEC86AD9FB8273B04E2F","documentHash":"4a10f113-86c2-46d4-8875-3aafd44d1aa2"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf93e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bonarowska","uuid":"21F496BADEA1603A60B3BC0B550C9BDC48275EB56F9CDB4CC1C5F650844D5864C5733E50F68A3B809C8BF7B8BED5B67431EE5357365FDF42F01428BB1C0577A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3152-4400","documentHash":"3636a35f-940d-4f01-926a-3e4c22bb4c32"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4987","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kozłowski","uuid":"86AEA15136657DA1EC4D8C4EE06E4A3491B4715EB2BBA22B62AA2F3DC40829218B54E60CC398954679FBA3DD687D228AB469206A82442D1057970DFA07B303B7","orcidId":"0000-0003-4144-6298","documentHash":"a6439e90-0189-4f2d-aded-020631d188a8"},{"objectId":"5e7092ba878c28a04739b8cf","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Dłużewski","uuid":"EBF4FD34FCC08C883A27795F5EA98830F307598AE89F8F24A08CD3603AAD97BB2160B848247290EABB9746C866D97BBC2060B7CEC0FE4EAA0B1101B64F4C6FCE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4153-6309","documentHash":"0e61fccf-836b-4a66-94a0-5053cf55ba54"},{"objectId":"5e709213878c28a04738f86f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Winkler","uuid":"32DD94BA65B9B6E66F1A189FFC9E4D52A3A80D3F4678CC31A7A0022CF6FBB074F1F7359A0E8EFAF1E5DD81F0F7C29B66ED9BA725F60C4C796134A97D759B3824","orcidId":"0000-0002-0433-7001","documentHash":"79d60bc2-187d-4f99-ae26-631c90034605"},{"objectId":"5e709213878c28a04738f869","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Grądzka","uuid":"A540A79817E3307EE08B1E7A93C42EE953C7B6C5C3795A5697692A2B58F83E1E5B14CF874C98D1A57AEE39FA8FFBEC6B41605F354E0FE66B8888B080B03C81EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1312-7962","documentHash":"a9e079da-5962-42b9-bd4e-08ca5ccd54fc"}],"objectId":"63d9126d4097073994946362","doi":"10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141741","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013468622018977?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Formation and electrochemical properties of ternary mesoporous carbon, coordination C60Pd polymer and palladium nanoparticle composites","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work describes the preparation and properties of composites based on spherical mesoporous carbon nanoparticles and fullerene-coordinated C60Pd polymer. The composite material was synthesized under a multistep chemical procedure. In the first step, mesoporous carbon nanoparticles were synthesized via a template-assisted method. Next, the C60 fullerene was incorporated into mesoporous carbon pores, and then the polymerization process was carried out in a solution containing a Pd(0) complex. The composite material is electroactive in the negative potential range due to the faradaic reduction process of C60 moieties. At less negative potentials, a high capacity current related to the presence of mesoporous carbon is observed. Under voltammetric conditions, this system exhibits a high capacitance equal to 359 F g−1 in the potential range of C60Pd reduction at 0.1 V s−1. This value is 3 times higher than that of the pure polymeric material. Moreover, the composite system is more stable than pristine C60Pd. Capacitance retention, in this case, is approximately 30% higher than that of the C60Pd polymer after 6000 charging/discharging cycles at current density of 6.7 A g−1."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f82d","uid":"baM7_bWGivADreGHZOXP9TA","uuid":"f30e0713-62f4-48d4-adfd-229566974a34","name":"Wydział Chemii (od 1.10.2019 r.)","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709213878c28a04738f86f","5e709213878c28a04738f869"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709490878c28a0473bf93e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ff878c28a0473b4987","5e7092ba878c28a04739b8cf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"441","pagesFromTo":"141741","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60a4fb449543c758682b639b","5e709213878c28a04738f869","5e709490878c28a0473bf93e","5e7092ba878c28a04739b8cf","63d9126d4097073994946367","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4987","5e709213878c28a04738f86f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a67","mniswId":"5553","title":"Electrochimica Acta","issn":"0013-4686","eissn":"1873-3859","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/electrochimica-acta/","documentHash":"9acc56c7-cbf9-4da3-b4ef-7d0a9cfd7d71"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d9126d4097073994946363","year":"2023","volume":"441","documentHash":"88d081c6-7a30-45d4-b4f1-5aabce9dc1ad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Electrochemical capacitors","Composites","Fullerene polymers","Mesoporous materials","Conducting polymers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058474356"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbcea8","name":"Martin","lastName":"Villiger","documentHash":"24acb2d1-6483-4da7-a11b-1b94ff13291f"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbcea7","name":"Ben J.","lastName":"Vakoc","documentHash":"000caf9b-0cb7-4b66-9cef-064237fe04de"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbcea6","name":"Melissa","lastName":"Suter","documentHash":"7c49856e-30ac-45fe-9ca3-301fd3e60172"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbcea5","name":"David D.","lastName":"Sampson","documentHash":"ed38515e-e605-4eaa-a692-532d5a726b40"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbcea4","name":"Rainer","lastName":"Leitgeb","documentHash":"9694bda7-789d-49a0-a485-3c1c4b9acadd"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbcea3","name":"Cadman L.","lastName":"Leggett","documentHash":"f07e821f-0771-4c1b-b173-1864720a5176"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbcea2","name":"Taishi","lastName":"Yonetsu","documentHash":"707dc27a-346d-4f65-9184-0a8078ef8bf3"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbcea1","name":"Ik-Kyung","lastName":"Jang","documentHash":"465454d5-1c6b-41ea-9db2-0871e70dd6ca"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbcea0","name":"David","lastName":"Huang","documentHash":"19e0e303-611f-4177-ac73-03df91c2d9ac"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbce9f","name":"Johannes F.","lastName":"de Boer","documentHash":"5ab6327a-4c1d-4850-85da-752e650c4de9"},{"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbce9e","name":"Brett E.","lastName":"Bouma","documentHash":"04ca05da-ba41-461c-9ac0-a38fee1589e5"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Wojtkowski","uuid":"72C7EFD6AE3C0FF6AB46F559605ACE983360A4E4C03769BB1C4D0D72A5671C8A9CF4B7F1DF377F7E2D985ACB38C7A2EE1DA60B3BE1A843F188600A590E526E53","orcidId":"0000-0003-0599-0878","documentHash":"380243f1-4e56-4426-bead-5a7a8a484819"}],"objectId":"63cff05c4097075010fbce9b","doi":"10.1038/s43586-022-00162-2","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-022-00162-2.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Optical coherence tomography","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-contact method for imaging the topological and internal microstructure of samples in three dimensions.

Ants in Solenopsis spp, termed 'Fire ants', are well known for their aggressive behavior, which leads to the release of toxic venom. Notably, the tribal natives of the malaria-laden densely forested Bastar region, Chhattisgarh, India, use fire ant sting-based therapy to cure malaria-like high fever. Inspired by this, we have collected the fire ants from the forest of Bastar and extracted peptide and alkaloid fractions from ant venom using HPLC and analyzed them by LC/MS-based applications. Evaluation of the anti-malarial efficacy of these peptide fractions demonstrated a significant reduction in the growth of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf 3D7) in vitro, whereas the alkaloid fraction showed a negligible effect. in vitro hemolytic activity confirmed the venom peptide fraction to be non-hemolytic. Additionally, the venom peptide fraction is purely non-toxic to HepG2 cells. Anti-malarial efficiency of the same in Plasmodium berghei ANKA infected mice models showed a drastic reduction in parasitemia representing promising anti-malarial activity. Overall, our study has unraveled the scientific rationale underlying fire ant sting therapy used as a tribal naturotherapy for curing malaria-like fever, thus, introducing a way forward to develop nature-inspired anti-malarial chemotherapeutics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fd629543c723365435c9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"789","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63cfed384097075010fbac6d","63cfed384097075010fbac6e","63cfed384097075010fbac6f","60c2fd629543c723365435c9","63cfed384097075010fbac70","63cfed384097075010fbac71"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479977","mniswId":"19616","title":"Toxins","issn":"2072-6651","eissn":"2072-6651","documentHash":"4922466c-bd4f-427e-b7e6-1f00ee4fbfcf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6391b61740970764e07db851","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"11","documentHash":"fb993c8a-e4b6-4df1-9515-5be6c85f4387"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058474712"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d13a4640970711f8fe21e0","name":"Priyanka H.","lastName":"Maheshwari","documentHash":"ddf799e2-82ce-463d-bd93-89daee5eea6e"},{"objectId":"63d13a4640970711f8fe21df","name":"Prashant","lastName":"Dubey","documentHash":"8e29552f-e7ac-4fba-88bd-247a8ca78a48"},{"objectId":"62fef5a87523404ea24371aa","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","uuid":"6F9C3A0EF3007DEE8A2CC6A5051A1A4819F78767F8574EF11C2E9A4A894E3C14DDE5DCA35168189F7198156D76A2251C7F81CED040C57D4A631575AA76314E67","documentHash":"937c2285-0f6c-4107-bc0c-a0f5bd181b58"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-19","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63d13a4640970711f8fe21dd","doi":"10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c01926","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c01926","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Human Hair-Derived Porous Activated Carbon as an Efficient Matrix for Conductive Polypyrrole for Hybrid Supercapacitors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) mechanism offered by carbon frameworks alone cannot suffice the unprecedented demand for energy. Hence, including a pseudocapacitive material (conducting polymer) in the carbon framework can impart additional pseudocapacitance to the material, thereby improving its electrochemical performance. Herein, human hair as a biowaste resource with inherent heteroatoms has been subjected to chemical activation at 800 degrees C to yield human hair-derived activated carbon (HHAC). Sub-sequently, an in situ chemical oxidation technique has been employed to generate the composite of HHAC and polypyrrole (HHAC/PPy). The HHAC/PPy composite when tested in 1 M H2SO4 outperforms pristine HHAC and PPy, with a higher specific capacitance of 358 F/g compared to 274 and 53 F/g obtained for individual materials, respectively (at 0.5 A/g). Moreover, the HHAC/PPy composite also solved the problem of low cyclic stability in the conducting polymers by maintaining 84.2% of the initial capacitance after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. In addition, a HHAC/PPy//HHAC asymmetrical supercapacitor device was assembled in an aqueous electrolyte (1 M H2SO4), which delivered an ultrahigh energy density of 53.3 W h/kg with a respectable power density of 408.5 W h/kg that can help in avoiding costly and toxic organic electrolytes.

An advanced theoretical approach describing an electron transport in condensed matter typically involved Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of electron trajectories since signal electrons undergo multiple interactions in a solid. The relevant algorithms are relatively slow and are burdened with statistical errors; thus they may be inconvenient in certain applications. However, much effort in the past was devoted to create models that describe electron transport by an analytical formalism with similar accuracy as Monte Carlo simulations. There are two major advantages of analytical approaches: (i) the computing time can be much shorter as compared with MC algorithms, and (ii) the relevant software can be easily included in external programs when large number of calculated parameters is needed. In the present work, the analytical formalism derived within the so-called transport approximation (TA) is described in detail, and implemented in the enclosed software TRANS_APPROX (Fortran 90). The formalism of quantitative XPS is based on an expression that provides a probability that a photoelectron emitted at a given depth reaches an analyzer without energy loss (emission depth distribution function - EMDDF). Consequently, the analytical expression for the EMDDF derived from the TA is discussed here. Stress is also put on parameters descending from the EMDDF: (i) the photoelectron signal intensity, (ii) the information depth, (iii) the mean escape depth, and (iv) the attenuation length for overlayer thickness measurements. The input parameters needed for calculations are briefly overviewed, followed by recommendations for use in the proposed program. Finally, it is indicated that the TA formalism requires calculations of numerous integrals with integrable singularities.

Cow dung derived porous carbon (CDPC) with a 3D structure and linked pores is synthesized in this study, making it an alternative electrode for supercapacitors (SC). Herein, we studied the diffusion and surface charge contribution and their relationship with the scan rate. Diffusion charge contribution is more prevalent at lower scan rates. Furthermore, a large fraction of surface charge contribution of 69.2 % at a high scan rate of 100 mV/s indicates rapid electrochemical kinetics and hence high-rate performance even at higher current densities. In addition, utilizing a 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte, the CDPC electrode has attained a high specific capacitance value of 210 F/g at 0.5 A/g. Furthermore, symmetrical solid-state SC device displayed high energy density of 36 Wh/kg at good power density of 800 W/kg along with remarkable cyclic stability of 92.6 % after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles.

Microelectrodes and nanoelectrodes allow for voltammetric measurements in solutions of substantial resistivity, however, their application in non-supported electrolytes is vaguely studied in detail. This work demonstrates the employment of carbon and platinum nanoelectrodes in solutions of ionic and neutral ferrocene derivatives in the presence and absence of supporting electrolyte. The ferrocene derivatives of various charges served as redox probes for the studies of diffusion-migration transport to nanoelectrodes. The obtained results are confronted with the theoretical predictions derived for microelectrodes. An addition of a supporting electrolyte stabilizes the voltammetric signal. It makes the voltammetric waves at nanoelectrodes well developed irrespective of the type of the redox system examined. The results revealed that the migration of electroactive species to nanoelectrodes in the absence of a supporting electrolyte does not introduce significant changes to the voltammetric signal recorded with a supporting electrolyte as much as for bigger microelectrodes. In many cases, the complete elimination of supporting electrolyte led to the poor development of the voltammetric waves at nanoelectrodes, possibly due to the breakdown of the electroneutrality in the region adjacent to the nanoelectrode, since the electrical double layer for nanoelectrodes may occupy a significant fraction of the transport depletion layer. The uncertainty in the concentrations of ionic impurities (that determine the actual ionic strength) in the layer adjacent to the electrode is another factor that may produce unpredictable and, to some extent, random voltammetric behavior of charged redox probes at nanoelectrodes in the absence of supporting electrolyte."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63d676a0409707538294939a","5e709358878c28a0473a7af1","63d676a04097075382949399"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"931","pagesFromTo":"117184","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d676a04097075382949399","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","63d676a0409707538294939a","5e709358878c28a0473a7af1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478652","mniswId":"10899","title":"JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","issn":"1572-6657","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b615ecb3-7f71-48eb-8edd-c20f712541b0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d676a04097075382949398","year":"2023","volume":"931","documentHash":"67271665-6f7e-4601-813c-7ce715006f1c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058491071"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63973c8840970751e82ba22a","name":"Wilhelm T.

Here, we demonstrate that by screening these interactions and, in consequence, increasing the local concentration of reactants, we boost the reactions by many orders of magnitude. The reaction between negatively charged Coenzyme A molecules accelerates ~5 million-fold using cationic micelles. That is ~104 faster kinetics than in 0.5 M NaCl, although the salt is ~106 more concentrated. Rate enhancements are not limited to micelles, as evidenced by significant catalytic effects (104–105-fold) of other highly charged species such as oligomers and polymers. We generalize the observed phenomenon by analogously speeding up a non-covalent complex formation—DNA hybridization.

During outbreaks, they can massively defoliate pine forests. The discovery of unknown components of D. pini sex pheromone opens possibilities for optimizing the lures for trapping D. pini males and increasing their use in insect monitoring systems.\nAbstract\nThe pine-tree lappet moth, D. pini, is a harmful defoliator of pine forests in Europe and Asia and a potentially invasive species in North America. The lures for trapping D. pini males based on two known components of its sex pheromone appeared weakly attractive to male moths. Identification of all components of the sex pheromone might allow for the development of more effective lures. The pheromone was sampled from virgin females using SPME and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Four new likely components ((Z5)-dodecenal, (Z5)-dodecen-1-ol, (Z5)-decen-1-yl acetate, (Z5)-tetradecen-1-yl acetate) and two known components ((Z5,E7)-dodecadienal, (Z5,E7)-dodecadien-1-ol) were identified based on comparison against authentic standards, Kováts indices and spectra libraries. The samples also contained several sesquiterpenes. Wind tunnel and field experiments showed that some blends of synthetic pheromone components alone or enriched with Scots pine essential oil (SPEO) were attractive to D. pini males. One component—(Z5)-decen-1-yl acetate—had a repelling effect. The presented knowledge of D. pini sex pheromone provides a basis for developing optimal lures for monitoring or controlling insect populations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy

high-throughput single-cell antimicrobial susceptibility assays and investigation of drug resistance mechanisms. Every droplet must serve as an isolated environment with a controlled antibiotic concentration in such assays. While technologies for generation, incubation, screening, and sorting droplets mature, predictable retention of active molecules inside droplets remains a major outstanding challenge. Here, we analyzed 36 descriptors of the antibiotic molecules against experimental results on the cross-talk of antibiotics in droplets. We show that partition coefficient and fractional polar surface area are the key physicochemical properties that predict antibiotic retention. We verified the prediction by monitoring growth inhibition by antibiotic-loaded neighboring droplets. Our experiments also demonstrate that transfer of antibiotics between droplets is concentration-and distance-dependent. Our findings immediately apply to designing droplet antibiotic assays and give deeper insight into the retention of small molecules in water-in-oil emulsions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fd6e9543c7233654361b","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff14","5e709337878c28a0473a50b7","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709337878c28a0473a50b7","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff14","60c2fd6e9543c7233654361b","63e0f66b40970740cdc91712","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477015","mniswId":"1091","title":"Analytical Chemistry","issn":"0003-2700","eissn":"1520-6882","documentHash":"57a7c6a0-00f3-4f83-b097-73b03033ba0a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e0f66b40970740cdc91711","year":"2023","documentHash":"0c56f9a9-95f4-4519-b05b-0f79f0552648"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058505551"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63dcf5d940970768a2c0aa94","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Lipkowski","documentHash":"bd8246ad-abd3-4fc8-8f99-c07ff879a7a5"},{"objectId":"602e0e919543c7410626eb5e","name":"Dusan","lastName":"Mrdenovic","uuid":"AC8DFB7457CBFF096972092A59F1B432BCFD6B4A267C69913DFEB9587854E51A8472EFFBAC21E48D2404B0AA3EB351E23CC07C2E57C12C11891FCD559FFAF12B","documentHash":"7469a3f1-d81c-49ec-a3f9-843b8723c3bd"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff48","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pięta","uuid":"AAC33876BE4017A0BF483155E0138F3F608C83D6AA39C4ABF3134DC6948009F7901870AB03A378CEB5BF302B02D88DD03E3E66A2026415822996C783589F4040","orcidId":"0000-0003-0341-2310","documentHash":"c4d620f7-3216-4b62-817e-b4330092a1a0"}],"objectId":"63dcf5d940970768a2c0aa93","doi":"10.1007/978-1-0716-1843-1_18","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-0716-1843-1_18","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Analyzing Morphological Properties of Early-Stage Toxic Amyloid β Oligomers by Atomic Force Microscopy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Protein misfolding diseases, like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease, are associated with misfolded protein aggregation.

The developed inhibitor is an environmentally friendly biological molecule and has been used for lead acid batteries for the first time as an additive. The methodology used to evaluate GG-VA inhibitive performance included hydrogen evo-lution and electrochemical methods, i.e., EIS and PDP. The corrosion inhibition performance of GG-VA is 88.57 %. The Pb surface was screened for GG-VA adsorption via SEM and AFM. The experimental data confirmed the reduction in hydrogen gas evolution with the addition of GG-VA. The EIS result supports the increasing Rct values with the rising GG-VA amount corresponding to the GG-VA adsorption. PDP data reveals the mixed inhibition action and reduction in icorr values with the addition of GG-VA. The increasing temperature causes a decrease in GG-VA performance. GG-V adsorption over the Pb surface was best described by Langmuir isotherm. The Ea data reveals the increase in the energy barrier for corrosion reaction and H2 gas evolution in the presence of GG-VA. The SEM and AFM support the adsorbed layer of GG-VA formation at the Pb surface."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["605d60749543c745d80e5a65"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"57","pagesFromTo":"106272","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63e0f75240970740cdc9270b","63e0f75240970740cdc9270c","63e0f75240970740cdc9270d","63e0f75240970740cdc9270e","605d60749543c745d80e5a65"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c7f0","mniswId":"10948","title":"Journal of Energy Storage","issn":"2352-152X","eissn":"2352-152X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"78428a8b-db54-4c61-85cb-4930e51f8824"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e0f75240970740cdc9270a","year":"2023","volume":"57","documentHash":"f1d4980f-2a6d-4be0-a8a1-9ad727401e19"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058505733"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63dd03ac40970768a2c17e0d","name":"Eric","lastName":"von Lieres","documentHash":"0bc486ca-003d-4ade-bb04-f770df045b74"},{"objectId":"5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","uuid":"4C8E231D76FA1FF9DEBFB40938EB36AF89D302A9BF4FB4483D4EB2BD2B36DFFFCE516493C98DF050048768547005AB2F2AB230D9F072ED3FD77064BDE749E112","orcidId":"0000-0003-4448-0686","documentHash":"22911df0-6857-4e43-8285-ca3bbbff21b2"}],"objectId":"63dd03ac40970768a2c17e0c","doi":"10.1007/978-1-0716-2269-8_3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-0716-2269-8_3","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Mechanisms and Effects of Substrate Channelling in Enzymatic Cascades","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Substrate or metabolite channelling is a transfer of intermediates produced by one enzyme to the sequential enzyme of a reaction cascade or metabolic pathway, without releasing them entirely into bulk. Despite an enormous effort and more than three decades of research, substrate channelling remains the subject of continuing debates and active investigation. Herein, we review the benefits and mechanisms of substrate channelling in vivo and in vitro. We discuss critically the effects that substrate channelling can have on enzymatic cascades, including speeding up or slowing down reaction cascades and protecting intermediates from sequestration and enzymes’ surroundings from toxic or otherwise detrimental intermediates. We also discuss how macromolecular crowding affects substrate channelling and point out the galore of open questions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"27-50","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","63dd03ac40970768a2c17e0d"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"63dd02eb40970768a2c177ea","doi":"10.1007/978-1-0716-2269-8","title":"Multienzymatic Assemblies: Methods and Protocols","year":2022,"isbn":"9781071622681","issn":"1064-3745","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-1-0716-2269-8.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"a92bbfa1-e583-49c7-a533-fe0c84f972f6","publisher":{"objectId":"5e710aa146e0fb0001ba6e5b","name":"Springer US","documentHash":"7acc4751-473c-4118-b7be-5f03f907a1c1"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Enzymatic cascade","Direct channelling","Channelling by proximity","Enzyme complex","Multifunctional enzyme","Macromolecular crowding"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058505781"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63a181734097073ee82e53da","name":"Ville‐Veikko","lastName":"Telkki","documentHash":"2ffacc36-3c55-4333-8b21-7d56c75e7741"},{"objectId":"63a181734097073ee82e53d9","name":"Mikko I.","lastName":"Kettunen","documentHash":"e8c7067c-e89f-4a83-ae9b-4530f428a81a"},{"objectId":"63a181734097073ee82e53d8","name":"Sarah","lastName":"Mailhiot","documentHash":"e9648bd7-db59-4184-8120-ec7c1e6de8e3"},{"objectId":"63a181734097073ee82e53d7","name":"Vladimir V.","lastName":"Zhivonitko","documentHash":"74b8ae11-b48e-464a-b0a8-b1a0028d7a00"},{"objectId":"63a181734097073ee82e53d6","name":"Yashu","lastName":"Kharbanda","documentHash":"82de1761-62eb-4d8e-9915-83534b2b2863"},{"objectId":"5e70935c878c28a0473a8005","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Urbańczyk","uuid":"AF444E1C978195263F4C2CD5A4DC7195A4371BE77AAB40A62FA044CE2580C85A2E65405BBE3D3FE2524D89205C7AA9301E9A593953F3680FAEF96891F12DD491","orcidId":"0000-0001-6085-1593","documentHash":"44d8669d-b8ac-47bb-9cc0-ec9d4717eeef"}],"objectId":"63a181734097073ee82e53d4","doi":"10.1002/anie.202203957","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/anie.202203957","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sensitive, Efficient and Portable Analysis of Molecular Exchange Processes by Hyperpolarized Ultrafast NMR","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935c878c28a0473a8005"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"61","issue":"28","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a181734097073ee82e53d6","5e70935c878c28a0473a8005","63a181734097073ee82e53d7","63a181734097073ee82e53d8","63a181734097073ee82e53d9","63a181734097073ee82e53da"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477026","mniswId":"1127","title":"Angewandte Chemie.

Natural ingredients, like parts of plants, have been used to elaborate miniaturized dynamic objects, which can move when they are combined with other, non-natural, building blocks. Herein, we report that the precise structural tailoring of natural plant leaves allows generating a spatially predefined and confined release of oxygen gas, due to the conversion of carbon dioxide. This constitutes the driving force for generating motion, which is solely due to the respiration of leaves by photosynthesis. The rate of gas evolution can be fine-tuned by changing the light intensity and the leaf size, allowing ultimately to control the motility of objects with dimensions ranging from the millimeter to the micrometer scale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","60caeb349543c72336544565"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"61","issue":"34","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60caeb349543c72336544565","63a19d704097073ee8325b4c","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","63a19d704097073ee8325b4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477026","mniswId":"1127","title":"ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION","issn":"1433-7851","eissn":"1521-3773","documentHash":"2e22c515-48a8-4277-bd3a-488ee4361571"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a19d704097073ee8325b4b","year":"2022","volume":"61","number":"34","documentHash":"748d80cb-a74c-41b7-94b6-3865cb767447"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058509330"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f1878c28a0473c77c5","name":"Marta","lastName":"Zapotoczna","uuid":"0CA57E571C514AAB1A6D628142AD0FC4916BAEE44A0F6AE1FBA76F2AD5D77800DA8F9367B43F7480EE1A5C4B3C18DA0F1370EC90E88B839BB050B18C68D5E4A3","orcidId":"0000-0001-5971-1163","documentHash":"39487103-4b47-44d3-beed-2ba388debb46"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Garstecki","uuid":"75C65452002051CEFFE6071097E89DF6A74DD0FC1A118DE168CD40EFEDC485E8FF7DCB8A8288FEEBC45B2BDC2ADE2FC757D7CC1EB814D7EB9EAFD1588F4EB22E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9101-7163","documentHash":"cdc40e41-dc83-4780-be61-52db050a0f2d"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","name":"Karol","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"30216860D4FCF71F80CCF2F14F9FA6358B5A0632271ACE53CD62EC8265F97928E335571E5A301CC0BA9C252A21169DB64AF4E27EC652B74805AD01BFF7BDF4DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9769-7646","documentHash":"3ea17df7-ffc6-4937-bb72-a24f676f97e3"},{"objectId":"5e709381878c28a0473ab7ab","name":"JAKUB","lastName":"BOGUSŁAWSKI","uuid":"8B1CE7592FDFE4B011EBA57F77D2063E4E6D802D080BAE5621784AD235F1154B93BC3FD11E156FB9E3F50BD30C83AB2130B217747978771E40D267F18C5FCE98","orcidId":"0000-0003-0335-1802","documentHash":"a2a7c2b3-3d0f-4e31-aba4-2197c66d076c"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9a36","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Pacocha","uuid":"04DF661296E74E0C4CEF8F9B10D96583D5A24342DABAB09DCF99256C190D702C80AA49EF5CAAD49DB64D00983564B27EC3913B27E478EFDA087B33B1E1EADFE5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9543-7122","documentHash":"44fd9cf1-a37b-4252-a7c5-6f0faf9e91ab"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63a1bfab4097073ee8367289","doi":"10.1039/d2lc00234e","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/LC/D2LC00234E","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"You will know by its tail: a method for quantification of heterogeneity of bacterial populations using single-cell MIC profiling","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Severe non-healing infections are often caused by multiple pathogens or by genetic variants of the same pathogen exhibiting different levels of antibiotic resistance. For example, polymicrobial diabetic foot infections double the risk of amputation compared to monomicrobial infections. Although these infections lead to increased morbidity and mortality, standard antimicrobial susceptibility methods are designed for homogenous samples and are impaired in quantifying heteroresistance. Here, we propose a droplet-based label-free method for quantifying the antibiotic response of the entire population at the single-cell level. We used Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus samples to confirm that the shape of the profile informs about the coexistence of diverse bacterial subpopulations, their sizes, and antibiotic heteroresistance. These profiles could therefore indicate the outcome of antibiotic treatment in terms of the size of remaining subpopulations. Moreover, we studied phenotypic variants of a S. aureus strain to confirm that the profile can be used to identify tolerant subpopulations, such as small colony variants, associated with increased risks for the development of persisting infections. Therefore, the profile is a versatile instrument for quantifying the size of each bacterial subpopulation within a specimen as well as their individual and joined heteroresistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709381878c28a0473ab7ab","5e709371878c28a0473a9a36","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f1878c28a0473c77c5"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"4317-4326","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709371878c28a0473a9a36","5e7094f1878c28a0473c77c5","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","5e709381878c28a0473ab7ab","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c63","mniswId":"13399","title":"LAB ON A CHIP","issn":"1473-0197","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a2c3b3a5-6d0f-4204-97a3-69954624c2b7"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058516142"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6157c42a75234017e04d6887","name":"Julia","lastName":"Kuczak","uuid":"3678EE72E89EE6BE27C9A4AD2B0233C8D7A8CDAC20C3FAD3E14E9D2343C233FA918C4F82580423DA681536B2D966487B6C8B04B1C434BB158F2B327530802D0E","documentHash":"cdeddf5d-51ed-442b-b65d-b794fe80ad77"},{"objectId":"5e709486878c28a0473bef7b","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"ROJEK","uuid":"682AC03F16379AD6B87AE2912E5F1A8379E3F082E0EF882059DD404A7E5C03E86FF17F1FD61EFF9B06C4DE365056B9D91F1B661365A91C6FC9FF96BE15C8575C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7810-7447","documentHash":"79316d33-778c-485a-8b60-d1af1f665d5f"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","name":"Jan","lastName":"Guzowski","uuid":"A8B48F7F745AC2DFDED086903CA20E4647AA2D07E044454CCFF949079D1455DCCD7E7BE0AE516AAB19C1A06B1B84EFEE24846B3ABD004DE97B9592C2E299FDDC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8070-3747","documentHash":"ce9af7d5-565c-439c-8f22-2a02a87f3ca4"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399068","name":"Monika","lastName":"Ćwiklińska","uuid":"FC8266EDCAD9EC5DAC77EA5E514D59C8D6673CAA5D4F804B3ADC72585F5CCAEF48A6B9D7637FF12A6554BD07936C2A05EC84C16107202B86A1452365800CF0D7","orcidId":"0000-0001-7992-633X","documentHash":"b4c858f9-5de8-4588-911e-7f95cc1a40ad"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63a1c1474097073ee836aac5","doi":"10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00798","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00798","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Microfluidic Formulation of Topological Hydrogels for Microtissue Engineering","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Microfluidics has recently emerged as a powerful tool in generation of submillimeter-sized cell aggregates capable of performing tissue-specific functions, so-called microtissues, for applications in drug testing, regenerative medicine, and cell therapies. In this work, we review the most recent advances in the field, with particular focus on the formulation of cell-encapsulating microgels of small “dimensionalities”: “0D” (particles), “1D” (fibers), “2D” (sheets), etc., and with nontrivial internal topologies, typically consisting of multiple compartments loaded with different types of cells and/or biopolymers. Such structures, which we refer to as topological hydrogels or topological microgels (examples including core–shell or Janus microbeads and microfibers, hollow or porous microstructures, or granular hydrogels) can be precisely tailored with high reproducibility and throughput by using microfluidics and used to provide controlled “initial conditions” for cell proliferation and maturation into functional tissue-like microstructures. Microfluidic methods of formulation of topological biomaterials have enabled significant progress in engineering of miniature tissues and organs, such as pancreas, liver, muscle, bone, heart, neural tissue, or vasculature, as well as in fabrication of tailored microenvironments for stem-cell expansion and differentiation, or in cancer modeling, including generation of vascularized tumors for personalized drug testing. We review the available microfluidic fabrication methods by exploiting various cross-linking mechanisms and various routes toward compartmentalization and critically discuss the available tissue-specific applications. Finally, we list the remaining challenges such as simplification of the microfluidic workflow for its widespread use in biomedical research, bench-to-bedside transition including production upscaling, further in vivo validation, generation of more precise organ-like models, as well as incorporation of induced pluripotent stem cells as a step toward clinical applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef7b","6157c42a75234017e04d6887","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","5e70929c878c28a047399068"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"122","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"16839-16909","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709486878c28a0473bef7b","5e70929c878c28a047399068","6157c42a75234017e04d6887","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775d8","mniswId":"3487","title":"Chemical Reviews","doi":"10.1021/acs.chemrev","issn":"0009-2665","eissn":"1520-6890","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/chreay","documentHash":"9bfcd870-1806-4c68-b6a0-2f5f2b7fa652"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a1c1474097073ee836aac6","year":"2022","volume":"122","number":"22","documentHash":"24a2ae4c-4add-4215-9d1d-7ee2ac5f2e25"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058516491"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","name":"Anders","lastName":"Jonsson-Niedziółka","uuid":"3394A368CB0E6B611D461246FA8924DA0550D7AF68CD7EBB72456860833F46CDC79A875204939C5A2F631BE36B09951DDC56FAB1B1015A54CDFB0E1A1E128C0B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5642-5946","documentHash":"68cb99b8-33a0-4453-8724-820d86d19c36"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6fb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wiloch","uuid":"80493E92B20FDF4BB85E08FD70302E0545F70959E6FBB9CC01FF8576C1A08C8CC864AF5E8D8F2A2B74CDE695CD710143C649FCF56AFE8A60087F46FFD7C71CB2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8331-8572","documentHash":"35deba9a-f120-4bca-b1e1-d0f72f31177a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63eb64744097075ca5116d6d","doi":"10.1016/j.jelechem.2022.116746","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S157266572200738X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Very small changes in the peptide sequence alter the redox properties of Aβ(11–16)-Cu(II) and pAβ(11–16)-Cu(II) β-amyloid complexes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Alzheimer’s disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease in the world and oxidative stress is a major factor in its pathogenesis. It is known that copper(II) ions forming complexes with peptides from the β-amyloid (Aβ) group can facilitate the production of reactive oxygen species. A very common amyloid in AD brain pla-\nques Aβ(11–42) form very stable Cu(II)-complexes that suppress ROS formation. However, when glutamic acid in Aβ(11–42) undergoes dehydration form cyclic pyroglutamate, resulting in a new derivative pAβ(11–42), the Cu(II) stabilisation is much weaker. Here, we investigate, for the first time, the redox chemistry of pAβ(11–16)-\nCu (II) complexes as a model system for pAβ(11–42). We show that the weaker Cu(II) affinity for the pyroglu-tamate-modified peptide leads to Cu(I)/Cu(II) oxidation at potentials associated with increased ROS production. Our study also shows a significant difference in the redox properties of the complex if phosphate ions\nare present in the electrolyte, underlining the importance of proper choice of buffer solutions. These results can be crucial for an increased understanding of AD pathogenesis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6fb","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"922","pagesFromTo":"116746","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6fb","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478652","mniswId":"10899","title":"JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","issn":"1572-6657","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"b615ecb3-7f71-48eb-8edd-c20f712541b0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6373751f4097070c79ccef61","year":"2022","volume":"922","documentHash":"dc668ae8-2910-400c-99bc-e81856f54ce9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058519798"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"616a392975234017e05459f9","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Korol","orcidId":"0000-0002-4390-729X","documentHash":"c56f6d8a-e55e-41c0-905f-26a7c11b7cef"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b56a9","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Cieplak","uuid":"313998F60C13F1EFFE27D0DDA66A1486D9766A1EC194DBB6940663D2D674B6CE7EA1E01955BD604B83FB566855B9B102C63F008441135CAC313C98A3228818CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-2663-7259","documentHash":"47e01327-eeee-47cc-9a31-e487fa015ae4"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","name":"Piyush","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"E13DBE297A73F2ACA1DA7F32D373EDA5FB882AC5C4DDE593B81140BAD5BD6DA80677830414B610AFC144957EF4E20FF1A8CC4A4F5367FEC382ACC689DAE8CD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-7729-8314","documentHash":"d3733567-ec08-40ae-9d79-439c8d659f9e"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7ca0","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kisiel-Kwiatek","uuid":"21B7602EE509AB399549AD30B4C92BDD54F0B0EA816BEBC9A9D4465BC6A9EFB1EB45AAD25D59A197AF7A8740B7B7FFCCE7B4087CB2F8E302C64EE64C7B4F3D8D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1605-456X","documentHash":"663fb70f-8442-4d6e-9a73-a6ebdd908a6c"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a7989","name":"Agata","lastName":"Michalska-Maksymiuk","uuid":"C59058CB5691F605B03A369B06B6A064DA929757C178E25710B3C7F6EDEDC47597E39AC4244555981D7A44C894C70A56336D5009DD9CB5CDD450DAEE9C673B09","orcidId":"0000-0002-8509-1428","documentHash":"c3e5c242-447b-4ef9-b897-9c5d8441bef2"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a781d","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Maksymiuk","uuid":"4940937F0F67C0465181C8086B16A036CB4985EFC60A4F10497E4B5C2971DAD73865B1C1A48B8277D132F7D61BA0239BB903DF854665ACF8B62D660053C8DE0F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3931-3798","documentHash":"48984cb0-bcb4-4429-a40e-df2c1f266b61"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63f6039e409707158a88592f","doi":"10.1016/j.snb.2023.133476","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2023.133476","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Synthesis of conducting molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles for estriol chemosensing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Herein, electrochemically active molecularly imprinted polypyrrole nanoparticles (PPy NPs) were synthesized with the aid of micelles.

We studied the activity of two hydrolysable tannins, (i) gallotannin—1,2,3,4,5-penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (PGG) and (ii) ellagitannin—1,2-di-O-galloyl-4,6-valoneoyl-β-D-glucose (dGVG), applied alone and in combination with antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus strain 8324-4. We also evaluated the effect of these tannins on bacterial membrane integrity and fluidity and studied their interaction with membrane proteins and lipids. A correlation between the antimicrobial activity of the tannins and their membranotropic action depending on the tannin molecular structure has been demonstrated. We found that the antibacterial activity of PGG was stronger than dGVG, which can be associated with its larger flexibility, dipole moment, and hydrophobicity. In addition, we also noted the membrane effects of the tannins observed as an increase in the size of released bacterial membrane vesicles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f82c","uid":"bW6UmF5uUXnumJ4PLD8QbxQ","uuid":"da53ef4a-4e78-45bf-8b53-36a8ba11acd3","name":"Wydział Biologii (od 1.10.2019 r.)","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390bec","5e709227878c28a047390beb"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fae2146085dcb5a2b98da14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7bbd"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1124","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709227878c28a047390beb","5e709227878c28a047390bec","5e709358878c28a0473a7bbd","5fae2146085dcb5a2b98da14","63ad77294097070d11bc7cd7","63ad77294097070d11bc7cd8","5e70922d878c28a04739129d","63ad77294097070d11bc7cda"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc83","mniswId":"14224","title":"Membranes","issn":"2077-0375","eissn":"2077-0375","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"c5b972b1-b8f7-4bb3-8a62-972a6cb76708"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"638872a94097074ca31d2d1f","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"11","documentHash":"5485e2b3-314c-4865-ac07-5c9d84fd3b4d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Staphylococcus aureus; antibacterial activity; bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs); tannins"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058530451"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64105f0c4097072836430ef9","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Jopa","documentHash":"faede960-da6f-4e9f-9438-00b73ce2ce56"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ratajczyk","uuid":"D7BF159D17AA3F44A08389A461C0C453E3CFA0D80BDD70361E3C3FDAABAB66937DFBCBEDC5E928A5269A3370C62BD41F00F01DF11D10C408342FED73975BA671","orcidId":"0000-0003-1613-6933","documentHash":"aafca08f-0cdd-4319-8133-314824720e0a"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa8f5","name":"Adam","lastName":"MAMES","uuid":"8420B7211E5333E6463250C9B633C1AC8084792BB4AA8684E065D10227F82EECDD8B33F41A4FB62C69F0CF5266D75B311A46CE9B147C87D0FE2805792ECD3758","orcidId":"0000-0002-0636-0264","documentHash":"1b5aee9d-e3ef-4e1b-bd6f-f2d934157e06"}],"objectId":"64105f0c4097072836430ef8","publicUri":"https://ptchem.pl/storage/pages/November2022/Ratajczyk.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"WZMOCNIENIA SYGNAŁU MAGNETYCZNEGO REZONANSU JĄDROWEGO METODAMI HIPERPOLARYZACJI JĄDROWEJ ZE SZCZEGÓLNYM UWZGLĘDNIENIEM HIPERPOLARYZACJI INDUKOWANEJ PARAWODOREM","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nuclear Magnetic Resonance based methods are currently being widely utilized\nin many fields of science, medicine, and industry. The impressive amount of success\nthat has been made with NMR has been possible because an enormous effort has been\nexpended to improve the low level of NMR sensitivity. However, the issue of low\nNMR sensitivity is still a serious problem, and NMR still cannot be utilized in many\nimportant cases where the concentrations of NMR active species are low-this is why\nthe boosting of the NMR signal is currently one of the most important research fields\nin the NMR area. Here, the problem of low NMR sensitivity is discussed through the\npresentation of methodologies aimed at increasing NMR sensitivity and their novel\napplications. First, a short general overview of the NMR and its sensitivity problem\nwill be presented. Having clearly identified the problem, the main technologies that\nwill be utilized for the improvement of NMR sensitivity will be introduced. First, we\nwill concisely, and with appropriate references, present methodologies that can\nincrease NMR sensitivity via the design of novel superconducting magnets, the\napplication of cryotechnology for the design of noiseless probe heads, and other\nhardware and software approaches. Next, the most promising and powerful method\nfor NMR signal enhancement which is known as hyperpolarization will be discussed.\nFirst, noble gas hyperpolarization and CIDNP will be briefly presented. We will\ndescribe the basic mechanism and applications of these methods. Next, our attention\nwill be paid to the DNP approach, and the origin and applications of the DNP effect\nwill be presented, in particular from the point of view of its utilization in medical\ndiagnostics and material sciences. The most extensive part of our discussion will be\ndevoted to the parahydrogen-based methods, which include hydrogenable\nParahydrogen Induced Polarization and Signal Amplification by Reversible\nExchange. In the introduction to these methods, the properties of hydrogen\nmolecules, which are the main driving forces of PHIP, will be presented.\nThe mechanism of the boosting of NMR signals will be presented for hPHIP and\nSABRE. The application of these methods will be presented, with the central focus\nbeing on their applications in catalysis and medical diagnostics. In the context of\nmedical applications, the hyperpolarization of biorelevant molecules will be\npresented. Finally, a summary and future prospects for the development of methods\nof NMR signal enhancement, particularly in the context of hyperpolarization, will be\ndiscussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","5e70937a878c28a0473aa8f5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"76","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64105f0c4097072836430ef9","5e70937a878c28a0473aa8f5","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac20ad204581b62ebb9a","mniswId":"201380","title":"Wiadomości Chemiczne","issn":"0043-5104","documentHash":"8f6a2b75-715e-4668-a57f-e02a3fb0a90b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64105f32409707283643112b","year":"2022","volume":"76","number":"11-12","doi":"","documentHash":"8f29219a-cf7e-47e9-af68-3565856e1da4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058539768"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63db32f17523404b9db44a9e","name":"Nazar","lastName":"Rad","uuid":"2D9970B558E7E257457EAD52D8FC965B599D53ECCDC3B91EE03443A6F53CCCEF26B368ED33EBAB0C6E153AB8695F040DCE2E78A6B35D1528C7DAD55E78F6463D","documentHash":"ecdfb834-01a7-4900-a319-98527d550f7c"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Sashuk","uuid":"7B9E651603C44ECD7E173B7A34E505E79330EDF4DD04B973310915D4CB9C3A93FE2EC7E76F47936D6F44735FB425946716A2A46CE201074FC33F28CEE87FCD58","orcidId":"0000-0002-5907-8596","documentHash":"2b6c5410-3288-40e9-b679-a6627af57d6d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-10-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"641058794097072836425078","doi":"10.1039/d2sc02077g","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/SC/D2SC02077G","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A light-gated regulation of the reaction site by a cucurbit[7]uril macrocycle","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Competitive inhibition can be overcome by increasing the amount of catalyst in the reaction mixture.

g-C3N4 is a well-known semiconductor utilized in heterogenous photocatalysis and water splitting. An improvement in light harvesting and separation of photogenerated charge carriers may be obtained by polymer doping with sulfur. In this work, we incorporate sulfur into the polymer chain by chemical polymerization of trithiocyanuric acid (C3N3S3H3) to obtain C3N3S3. The XRD measurements and TEM images indicated that C3N3S3, in contrast to g-C3N4, does not exist in the form of a graphitic structure and is not exfoliated into thin lamellas. However, both polymers have similar optical properties and positions of the conduction and valence bands. The comparative studies of electrochemical oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution indicated that the overpotentials for the two processes were smaller for C3N3S3 than for g-C3N4. The RDE experiments in the oxygen-saturated solutions of 0.1 M NaOH have shown that O2 is electrochemically reduced via the serial pathway with two electrons involved in the first step. The spectroscopic experiments using NBT demonstrated that both polymers reveal high activity in the photocatalytic reduction of oxygen to superoxide anion radical by the photogenerated electrons."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["640f159e4097074fd739744e","602ca8d29543c7410626e17c","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1855"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"2469","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["640f159e4097074fd739744e","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","602ca8d29543c7410626e17c","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1855"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"640f159e4097074fd739744d","year":"2023","volume":"28","number":"6","documentHash":"3efbb1a9-23cd-4719-a7ba-3cd719442646"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["g-C3N4","C3N3S3","band diagrams","oxygen reduction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058563343"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6410558d4097072836420113","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Palczewski","documentHash":"d26cd4ac-8bd4-446d-8a58-81b432447280"},{"objectId":"6410558d4097072836420112","name":"Philip D.","lastName":"Kiser","documentHash":"fdc63364-ce20-48e6-b3c7-c90deecccbb7"},{"objectId":"6410558d4097072836420111","name":"Michał Andrzej","lastName":"Kochman","documentHash":"b3fbedfa-a4d9-4225-a219-fe63c165d530"},{"objectId":"6410558d4097072836420110","name":"David","lastName":"Salom","documentHash":"d522b944-b7f3-4cff-b7ea-9ba1cebe221e"},{"objectId":"6410558d409707283642010f","name":"John D.","lastName":"Hong","documentHash":"cc6fd6d3-59eb-4c62-aa5c-bf90e7449536"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kubas","uuid":"5502D7BBD854811ACE4A362AACF7E8E88D472EBF744D8A7CA3375962360A19B8C994FD5882E9191B79B6745D5F7A3AB2529D5A4D64C8AFBB3B7204C8694C6382","orcidId":"0000-0002-5508-0533","documentHash":"9f31decc-1aaa-47ff-8296-c27349c11c1e"}],"objectId":"6410558d409707283642010d","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2213911119","publicUri":"https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2213911119","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Chromophore hydrolysis and release from photoactivated rhodopsin in native membranes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For sustained vision, photoactivated rhodopsin (Rho*) must undergo hydrolysis and release of all-trans-retinal, producing substrate for the visual cycle and apo-opsin available for regeneration with 11-cis-retinal. The kinetics of this hydrolysis has yet to be described for rhodopsin in its native membrane environment. We developed a method consisting of simultaneous denaturation and chromophore trapping by isopropanol/borohydride, followed by exhaustive protein digestion, complete extraction, and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Using our method, we tracked Rho* hydrolysis, the subsequent formation of N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine (N-ret-PE) adducts with the released all-trans-retinal, and the reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol. We found that hydrolysis occurred faster in native membranes than in detergent micelles typically used to study membrane proteins. The activation energy of the hydrolysis in native membranes was determined to be 17.7 ± 2.4 kcal/mol. Our data support the interpretation that metarhodopsin II, the signaling state of rhodopsin, is the primary species undergoing hydrolysis and release of its all-trans-retinal. In the absence of NADPH, free all-trans-retinal reacts with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), forming a substantial amount of N-ret-PE (∼40% of total all-trans-retinal at physiological pH), at a rate that is an order of magnitude faster than Rho* hydrolysis. However, N-ret-PE formation was highly attenuated by NADPH-dependent reduction of all-trans-retinal to all-trans-retinol. Neither N-ret-PE formation nor all-trans-retinal reduction affected the rate of hydrolysis of Rho*. Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the hydrolysis of Rho* and the release of all-trans-retinal and its reentry into the visual cycle, a process in which alteration can lead to severe retinopathies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"119","issue":"45","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6410558d409707283642010f","6410558d4097072836420110","6410558d4097072836420111","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","6410558d4097072836420112","6410558d4097072836420113"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793a7","mniswId":"16559","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","eissn":"0027-8424","documentHash":"6c7e55c8-7f5c-4cba-8821-15f816a6ebee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6410558d409707283642010e","year":"2022","volume":"119","number":"45","documentHash":"22ad32bc-5dbc-452d-8a1d-5d113fa3fdaf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058563479"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"640f17734097074fd739d752","name":"Peng","lastName":"Ren","documentHash":"178b86a3-26aa-4dad-973f-6be39ad88c87"},{"objectId":"640f17734097074fd739d751","name":"Chuya","lastName":"Fu","documentHash":"5d1dd220-23ca-4f3d-b9c6-d5a11884aa46"},{"objectId":"640f17734097074fd739d750","name":"Brij","lastName":"Mohan","documentHash":"4b11a9fe-158d-4b66-af53-078c96e5264e"},{"objectId":"640f17734097074fd739d74f","name":"Sandeep","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"ba645212-27a2-4a96-85ce-73bc6f1545d4"},{"objectId":"5fc53d8d085dcb1e6ae0ba87","name":"Vijay","lastName":"Gupta","uuid":"DD4B08608F3F2B8E14072F8536A074D7F84BC4D34A8FE64B20723CECD0A1F2FECD3B6B98517F05363A660CCAEE0198CE023635FB315E8AE11EC44BD348873B25","documentHash":"40cb20d0-6781-4340-9b63-02c4e15f2cbc"}],"objectId":"640f17734097074fd739d74d","doi":"10.1016/j.ccr.2022.214876","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0010854522004714?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Decoration and utilization of a special class of metal–organic frameworks containing the fluorine moiety","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fluorinated organic molecules are generally chemically stable and have low electric polarizability because of the high electronegativity of fluorine. The use of fluorinated organic and inorganic molecules to synthesize innumerable coordination compounds, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), has had a significant effect on the field of material chemistry. The high electronegativity of the fluorine atom attached to the organic ligand/linker generates electropositive character on the other part of the linker. This electropositive character of the ligand means that it can easily interact with electron-rich guest molecules in different host-guest applications. The metal complex formed with these fluorinated moi-eties generates an electron-dense pore environment owing to the existence of fluorine atoms inside the voids. These properties make fluorinated MOFs (FMOFs) potential candidates to provide a range of properties, such as particular chemical adsorption sites and host-material flexibility. FMOFs are generally hydrophobic because of the existence of fluorine atoms inside the pores, which aids in removal of oil spills on water and adsorption/separation of different gases and hydrocarbons. The high chemical and aqueous stability of FMOFs make them excellent candidates for many applications under various condi-tions. The fluorine-lined channels of FMOFs show excellent affinity for gas molecules, and they can thus be used for gas storage/separation. Owing to these unusual properties, FMOFs have been widely used as gas-separation materials and for removal of hazardous impurities from aqueous systems. Herein, we review synthesis of FMOFs using different strategies, the characteristics of FMOFs, and the applications of FMOFs in various fields, including gas adsorption/separation, hydrocarbon adsorption/separation, dye adsorption, catalysis, and sensing of small molecules.

Here, we demonstrated that single-sided nuclear mag-netic resonance (NMR) can be used for noninvasive monitoring of the cheese ripening process. The matu-ration of soft-ripened Camembert-like molded cheese samples was monitored for 20 d measuring 1 -dimen-sional and 2-dimensional NMR relaxation and diffusion data at various depths, ranging from the hard surface layer to the soft center. Gelation and gel shrinkage were observed throughout ripening, and a complete loss of free water signal was observed at the cheese rind. Transversal (T2) relaxation distributions include 3 components that evolve with ripening time and position, corresponding to water inside the casein gel network, water trapped in casein, and fat. Two-dimen-sional T1 -T2 relaxation experiments provided enhanced resolution of the 3 components, allowing quantification of the relative proportions of each phase. Furthermore, diffusion (D) -T2 relaxation correlation experiments revealed the bimodal size distribution of fat globules. The study demonstrated that single-sided NMR can provide spatially resolved signal intensity, relaxation, and diffusion parameters that reflect structural changes during the ripening process and can be exploited to understand and monitor the ripening of cheeses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935c878c28a0473a8005"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"106","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1586-1595","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6437ba7a4097076ac7d5b0a1","6437ba7a4097076ac7d5b0a2","6437ba7a4097076ac7d5b0a3","5e70935c878c28a0473a8005","6437ba7a4097076ac7d5b0a4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454785fb","mniswId":"10746","title":"JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE","issn":"0022-0302","documentHash":"527eb80d-9671-4b71-8923-d71727aed085"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6437ba7a4097076ac7d5b0a0","year":"2023","volume":"106","number":"3","documentHash":"55dd53e0-7ca9-4c44-b0ae-f0ac47912e02"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ripening cheese ripening","single-sided nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)","Laplace NMR","spatial profiling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058576080"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6437bedd4097076ac7d5e07d","name":"Philip","lastName":"Tinnefeld","documentHash":"8558ff1c-7492-4817-8cf3-99b107a0f969"},{"objectId":"6437bedd4097076ac7d5e07c","name":"Florian","lastName":"Steiner","documentHash":"95b0c3ef-21f5-460e-8a20-354a00a27221"},{"objectId":"6437bedd4097076ac7d5e07b","name":"Johann","lastName":"Bohlen","documentHash":"47ed1241-52a6-46fc-90ff-77d9dffc1f7e"},{"objectId":"6437bedd4097076ac7d5e07a","name":"Fiona","lastName":"Cole","documentHash":"2a24196b-54e1-4fce-9f96-4f263b36bcb9"},{"objectId":"6437bedd4097076ac7d5e079","name":"Jonas","lastName":"Zähringer","documentHash":"34ffacf0-fa5a-476f-a440-abdb3f48e10c"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7965","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Kamińska","uuid":"514968F8DF0696D6ED0DCDD91AAF3EA01C45529D7EBC9807AB7524189F9EA8D7BB99AA7E42B1F097B92523B0D091FD29926A5D17A3A6925AF7424CF73CE28529","orcidId":"0000-0002-9435-8198","documentHash":"fdd8015d-a2e0-4491-a674-56c5eacf239e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6437bedd4097076ac7d5e077","doi":"10.1038/s41377-023-01111-8","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-023-01111-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Combining pMINFLUX, graphene energy transfer and DNA-PAINT for nanometer precise 3D super-resolution microscopy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"3D super-resolution microscopy with nanometric resolution is a key to fully complement ultrastructural techniques with fluorescence imaging.

In 3D DNA-PAINT measurements, structural features, i.e., individual docking strands at distances of 3 nm, are directly resolved on DNA origami structures. pMINFLUX and GET represent a particular synergetic combination for super-resolution imaging near the surface such as for cell adhesion and membrane complexes as the information of each photon is used for both 2D and axial localization information. Furthermore, we introduce local PAINT (L-PAINT), in which DNA-PAINT imager strands are equipped with an additional binding sequence for local upconcentration improving signal-to-background ratio and imaging speed of local clusters.

Membranes separating protocells from the environment were necessary for life to occur. Later, compartmentalization allowed for the development of more complex cellular structures. Nowadays, 2D materials (e.g., graphene, molybdenum disulfide) are revolutionizing the smart materials industry. Surface engineering allows for novel functionalities, as only a limited number of bulk materials have the desired surface properties. This is realized via physical treatment (e.g., plasma treatment, rubbing), chemical modifications, thin film deposition (using both chemical and physical methods), doping and formulation of composites, or coating. However, artificial systems are usually static. Nature creates dynamic and responsive structures, which facilitates the formation of complex systems. The challenge of nanotechnology, physical chemistry, and materials science is to develop artificial adaptive systems. Dynamic 2D and pseudo-2D designs are needed for future developments of life-like materials and networked chemical systems in which the sequences of the stimuli would control the consecutive stages of the given process.

In weakly emitting porphycenes the fluorescence intensity strongly depends on viscosity and can be recovered by placing a molecule in a rigid environment. We postulate that the efficient nonradiative deactivation is due to the quantum effect, delocalization of the inner protons. The delocalization, which increases with the strength of intramolecular hydrogen bonds may induce structural changes that lead to distortion from planarity and, as a result, efficient S0 ← S1 internal conversion. The effect seems to be general, as indicated by good correlation between the quantum yield of fluorescence and the distance between H-bonded nitrogen atoms, the latter being a reliable measure of hydrogen bonding strength. Based on the available photophysical and X-ray data, such correlation was found so far for over 20 differently substituted porphycenes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c285145479475","mniswId":"16866","title":"Pure and Applied Chemistry","issn":"0033-4545","documentHash":"f145012c-6e74-4d83-bf59-8c0f90bb36ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6437d09c4097076ac7d6f985","year":"2023","volume":"0","number":"0","documentHash":"9bec5b71-fbd0-43e9-a0a7-98f23b37cb23"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FLUORENONE","EXCITED SINGLET-STATE","PHOTOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES","CHARGE-TRANSFER","PROTON-TRANSFER","MOLECULAR-MECHANISM","HYDROGEN","SOLVENT","DERIVATIVES","ALCOHOLS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058576637"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643e88f34097072d53989353","name":"Dean H.","lastName":"Barrett","documentHash":"7d3ec06d-5e45-4746-90f4-053c516487a0"},{"objectId":"643e88f34097072d53989352","name":"Neil J.","lastName":"Coville","documentHash":"a50a4ea0-d403-4858-9b52-4505c5cfe2f2"},{"objectId":"643e88f34097072d53989351","name":"Bryan P.","lastName":"Doyle","documentHash":"5b27427d-7223-41ff-a9fc-2ddc98a09603"},{"objectId":"643e88f34097072d53989350","name":"Beatriz D.","lastName":"Moreno","documentHash":"19ec45a5-3b25-43d0-a1fd-2c2487da73da"},{"objectId":"643e88f34097072d5398934f","name":"Lebohang","lastName":"Macheli","documentHash":"1a95a95c-899d-42ea-898a-5763a5303ff8"},{"objectId":"643e88f34097072d5398934e","name":"Victor","lastName":"Mashindi","documentHash":"e9224fa8-b8a8-49fd-b1c7-4f06ba06794c"},{"objectId":"643e88f34097072d5398934d","name":"Joyce B.","lastName":"Matsoso","documentHash":"bb7aff06-f7e3-4155-8866-6b59fc77fca0"},{"objectId":"643e88f34097072d5398934c","name":"Ryan","lastName":"O’Connor","documentHash":"729e885e-d0e7-46fb-8c29-937b5fa9d301"},{"objectId":"620b1e387523402df0840e1c","name":"Pumza","lastName":"Mente","uuid":"40350E0EFFEC8CCB7DB10B74B59D719E9B1CF1156238FD71538D6B5CDF9A60EDD01DA597EA9F2CC85EAB6D3AFF8F21E17A2DE5E302E11F584975942EADE07526","documentHash":"b1337c6d-9b49-4174-ba1f-eb78b9fdbe85"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"643e88f34097072d5398934a","doi":"10.3390/nano13030426","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/13/3/426/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Catalyst Design: Counter Anion Effect on Ni Nanocatalysts Anchored on Hollow Carbon Spheres","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Herein, the influence of the counter anion on the structural properties of hollow carbon spheres (HCS) support was investigated by varying the nickel metal precursor salts applied.

Importantly, the effect of the precursor salt on the textural properties of the HCS nanosupports (~565 m2/gNi(acet)) and ~607 m2/gNiCl), influenced the growth of the Ni nanoparticles, viz for the acetate-(ca 6.4 nm)- and chloride (ca 12 nm)-based salts, respectively.

Currently, renewable energies (RE) have achieved more efficient advances to produce energy from non-conventional and inexhaustible sources, which can meet the basic needs of society and whose environmental impact is a door of opportunities for all. For this reason, academia has a preponderant role in ensuring that engineers are fully equipped with the necessary skills to provide feasible and contextualised solutions for this era of energy transition framed by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article explores the impact on the development of the necessary skills for engineers in the renewable energy sector by tracing a route towards the acquisition of renewable energy knowledge with strategically organised work teams of undergraduate students, where two methodologies that are gaining ground in engineering education programs are applied: Problem Based Learning(PBL)and Design thinking (DT).After the validation of these techniques, it is concluded that bringing engineering students closer to real contexts related to renewable energies and above all with an objective of impact on communities, it is the right way to build knowledge in teams, in an immersive and committed way with the institution, which has developed and implemented an innovative pedagogical method based on the application of a critical educational model focused on the development of competencies, where the union of new technologies with the teaching processes on which this research is based is

Hence, design and development of novel photocatalyst for the partial selective oxidation is highly desirable. In this research work, ultrasonication of different frequencies (22, 40, 80 kHz) and different amplitudes was utilized as synthesis tool in order to obtain novel materials by precipitation method. The syn-thesized samples were characterized by using different techniques such as N2 sorption, TEM, XPS, XRD, thermal analysis, and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The synthesized sample by using low ultrasound frequency (22 kHz) and amplitude showed a mixed morphological and structural nature consisting of asymmetric 1 -dimen-sional (nanorods-like), layered nano-structures and not well-defined areas, leading to elevate for metal oxide specific surface areas up to 155 m2/g. The observed 1-D nanostructures have diamentions in the range of 20-60 nm. This sample revealed the highest photo-oxidation efficiency for the selective conversion of two biomass -derived, and more specifically lignin-inspired model compounds, benzyl alcohol and cinnamyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and cinnamyl aldehyde, respectively, and hence the highest yield towards the desired aldehydes. The selective photo-oxidation activity was retained even after 5 photocatalytic cycles, while no leaching of Ti was recorded."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0038","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","60c34db59543c72336544454","5fc4b6f2085dcb1e6ae0b8c3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"94","pagesFromTo":"106306","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c34db59543c72336544454","5fc4b6f2085dcb1e6ae0b8c3","5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","643fbc614097073cb69ab9dd","643fbc614097073cb69ab9de","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0038","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a1a","mniswId":"19937","title":"ULTRASONICS SONOCHEMISTRY","issn":"1350-4177","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e5a6d72c-45a6-40c9-ac86-11b6bcdcebfa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"643fbc614097073cb69ab9dc","year":"2023","volume":"94","documentHash":"2133bd6d-8110-41b1-93aa-65158d8bb415"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ultrasound assisted precipitation synthesis","Titanium oxide nanostructure","Photocatalysis","Benzyl alcohol selective oxidation","Biomass valorization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058592639"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643e5aa44097072d53955cf4","name":"Giuseppina","lastName":"Luciani","documentHash":"ffd0f04b-76e7-44fd-96e9-f58539731ed9"},{"objectId":"643e5aa44097072d53955cf3","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Andreozzi","documentHash":"d87d8405-2d0f-466d-af9f-79bd1127e2ff"},{"objectId":"643e5aa44097072d53955cf2","name":"Ilaria","lastName":"Di Somma","documentHash":"c8e23e02-07af-4bd4-bfcd-ce9960615235"},{"objectId":"643e5aa44097072d53955cf1","name":"Raffaele","lastName":"Marotta","documentHash":"424db0cd-0b98-4fbd-9e05-cd9f0a204ae9"},{"objectId":"643e5aa44097072d53955cf0","name":"Robert","lastName":"Bericat Vadell","documentHash":"81e00130-8bb4-4179-b464-c7b7453b5855"},{"objectId":"643e5aa44097072d53955cef","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Vitiello","documentHash":"b40c6340-f8ed-47f9-ba81-af9f90d6f2df"},{"objectId":"643e5aa44097072d53955cee","name":"Laura","lastName":"Clarizia","documentHash":"72b9e56c-81d5-4412-a93b-eaa1c57b56a5"},{"objectId":"622036397523402df08c206c","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sa","uuid":"87182E2E0888DA41C757B81B2143E2316665900AFDCDE55D96C088AFA76BAFB6A4F1AA06C4EDA6BD452B1F53C7A1CCDD6A3E7FE74E2E496F4852B0410671F4C6","documentHash":"b4c2efbd-ab85-495c-833b-083d3a9f0f35"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"643e5aa44097072d53955ced","doi":"10.3390/ijms24032004","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/3/2004/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effect of Synthesis Method on Reaction Mechanism for Hydrogen Evolution over CuxOy/TiO2 Photocatalysts: A Kinetic Analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The existing literature survey reports rare and conflicting studies on the effect of the preparation method of metal-based semiconductor photocatalysts on structural/morphological features, electronic properties, and kinetics regulating the photocatalytic H-2 generation reaction. In this investigation, we compare the different copper/titania-based photocatalysts for H-2 generation synthesized via distinct methods (i.e., photodeposition and impregnation). Our study aims to establish a stringent correlation between physicochemical/electronic properties and photocatalytic performances for H-2 generation based on material characterization and kinetic modeling of the experimental outcomes. Estimating unknown kinetic parameters, such as charge recombination rate and quantum yield, suggests a mechanism regulating charge carrier lifetime depending on copper distribution on the TiO2 surface. We demonstrate that H-2 generation photoefficiency recorded over impregnated CuxOy/TiO2 is related to an even distribution of Cu(0)/Cu(I) on TiO2, and the formation of an Ohmic junction concertedly extended charge carrier lifetime and separation. The outcomes of the kinetic analysis and the related modeling investigation underpin photocatalyst physicochemical and electronic properties. Overall, the present study lays the groundwork for the future design of metal-based semiconductor photocatalysts with high photoefficiencies for H-2 evolution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"2004","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["643e5aa44097072d53955cee","643e5aa44097072d53955cef","643e5aa44097072d53955cf0","643e5aa44097072d53955cf1","643e5aa44097072d53955cf2","643e5aa44097072d53955cf3","643e5aa44097072d53955cf4","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cf9db64097075010efc5d2","year":"2023","volume":"24","number":"3","documentHash":"85b18ab6-b7cc-476c-b4d2-de2aaa2a1e0a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058592981"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5fbddc5d085dcb3958990a73","name":"Swaraj","lastName":"Pradhan","uuid":"5EC4CC7C7A06240D7B58B4DF97D12E0E4F1B992EE3C5A0ECEF5674420C6996727F132755F9CAED54EB83174AEC57252CCF9E868CD04208FB1CD716E7919A47BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1823-461X","documentHash":"2f9569a6-962a-4dc0-b1d9-450d7efbff30"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Łomot","uuid":"9AD36137223F2722603D98969D279F5AB25CDBFDC76A5D950100F7F869850EC0FF7080AD835DF490058317885BB46E2FA8C68ECFF5811377F69FFFD0A2288626","orcidId":"0000-0003-3663-1122","documentHash":"15b687f0-a174-44c7-97e5-cebe3bb751ea"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0038","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Lisovytskiy","uuid":"A8A796D50EFFF8069264EFD5B9ACE3F61FEA2071CEE105DD78FDB4FEBD6828DDDFFE7F2FCFFE7976EF497CDB1BD58E046CD46E6285C0F395D09E3D283D7F78B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-9595-2746","documentHash":"2dac5747-4f8c-4299-9f14-e3f092109400"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"},{"objectId":"5e709381878c28a0473ab62f","name":"Marta","lastName":"Paszkiewicz-Gawron","uuid":"8DA1270887969730547D4A2484E7577FD31661F3F3C4C4DB868D3FDCE61C602F0FD3A8119D307CBB377FE661BC640CCF05DBF454ECDC1A8D06B61A0A0984B199","orcidId":"0000-0002-0391-8138","documentHash":"0195c8a8-2b1f-43a5-861a-f485a6f2e69e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63c69ab14097071bb539e4c1","doi":"10.3390/molecules27248731","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/24/8731/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Bimetallic TiO2 Nanoparticles for Lignin-Based Model Compounds Valorization by Integrating an Optocatalytic Flow-Microreactor","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The challenge of improving the activity of TiO2 by modifying it with metals and using it for targeted applications in microreactor environments is an active area of research. Recently, microreactors have emerged as successful candidates for many photocatalytic reactions, especially for the selective oxidation process. The current work introduces ultrasound-assisted catalyst deposition on the inner walls of a perfluoro-alkoxy alkane (PFA) microtube under mild conditions. We report Cu-Au/TiO2 and Fe-Au/TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized using the sol-gel method. The obtained photocatalysts were thoroughly characterized by UV-Vis diffuse-reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and N-2 physisorption. The photocatalytic activity under UV (375 nm) and visible light (515 nm) was estimated by the oxidation of lignin-based model aromatic alcohols in batch and fluoropolymer-based flow systems. The bimetallic catalyst exhibited improved photocatalytic selective oxidation. Herein, four aromatic alcohols were individually investigated and compared. In our experiments, the alcohols containing hydroxy and methoxy groups (coniferyl and vanillin alcohol) showed high conversion (93% and 52%, respectively) with 8% and 17% selectivity towards their respective aldehydes, with the formation of other side products. The results offer an insight into ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) complex formation, which was found to be the main reason for the activity of synthesized catalysts under visible light."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0038","5e709381878c28a0473ab62f","5fbddc5d085dcb3958990a73","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"8731","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fbddc5d085dcb3958990a73","5e709381878c28a0473ab62f","5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0038","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639c23e5409707327114d865","year":"2022","volume":"27","number":"24","documentHash":"0b5ec318-743a-41fe-be7f-914ee7162f52"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058595498"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c6a49e4097071bb53ca859","name":"Melio","lastName":"Drillet","documentHash":"959a0406-d185-4ac0-8408-4466e2de8245"},{"objectId":"63c6a49e4097071bb53ca858","name":"Amal","lastName":"Mendalz","documentHash":"28e8e169-e683-4596-8e33-05378bc15460"},{"objectId":"63c6a49e4097071bb53ca857","name":"Yawen","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"95ae4a64-f958-4b00-92b2-300a85bd1d8a"},{"objectId":"63c6a49e4097071bb53ca856","name":"Robert Bericat","lastName":"Vadell","documentHash":"00e262b9-114e-49dc-bcef-878f4fc21070"},{"objectId":"63c6a49e4097071bb53ca855","name":"Xianshao","lastName":"Zou","documentHash":"16f5faf5-b77d-4c34-9fa8-44fb7a48d700"},{"objectId":"622036397523402df08c206c","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sa","uuid":"87182E2E0888DA41C757B81B2143E2316665900AFDCDE55D96C088AFA76BAFB6A4F1AA06C4EDA6BD452B1F53C7A1CCDD6A3E7FE74E2E496F4852B0410671F4C6","documentHash":"b4c2efbd-ab85-495c-833b-083d3a9f0f35"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-08","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63c6a49e4097071bb53ca853","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c07021","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c07021","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Photophysical Study of Electron and Hole Trapping in TiO<sub>2</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>/Au Nanoparticles through a Selective Electron Injection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The photophysics surrounding the electron and hole trapping in TiO2 do not have a scientific consensus. Herein, we studied the steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved spectroscopy features from TiO2 and TiO2/Au nanoparticles (NPs). In TiO2/Au NPs, time-resolved photoluminescence indicates that the electrons from bandgap excitation decay slower (∼30 ps) than in TiO2 (<24 ps). We conclude this as a result of the band bending passivation effect on the surface electron traps. Meanwhile, electron trapping is proved as the dominant surface depopulation process because of the easy-fill characteristics of surface hole traps even under low excitation density, which also interprets the slow surface hole trapping (∼2 ns) in TiO2. Through plasmon-assisted electron injection, we distinguished the electron and hole behaviors at varied photon fluences and then obtained the intrinsic bulk trapping of electrons and holes in the ∼50 and ∼400 ps time range, respectively."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"126","issue":"50","pagesFromTo":"21467-21475","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c6a49e4097071bb53ca855","63c6a49e4097071bb53ca856","63c6a49e4097071bb53ca857","63c6a49e4097071bb53ca858","63c6a49e4097071bb53ca859","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffe0ead49b31ccece8421","title":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry.

However, its fabrication is challenging because its photoactive phase is thermodynamically unstable at room temperature. Adding dimethylammonium (DMA) alleviates this instability and is currently understood to result in the formation of DMA(x)Cs(1-x)PbI(3) perovskite solid solutions. Here, we use NMR of the Cs-133 and C-13 local structural probes to show that these solid solutions are not thermodynamically stable, and their synthesis under thermodynamic control leads to a segregated mixture of yellow one-dimensional DMAPbI(3) phase and delta-CsPbI3. We show that mixed-cation DMA(x)Cs(1-x)PbI(3) perovskite phases only form when they are kinetically trapped by rapid antisolvent-induced crystallization. We explore the energetics of DMA incorporation into CsPbI3 using first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations and find that this process is energetically unfavorable. Our results provide a complete atomic-level picture of the mechanism of DMA-induced stabilization of the black perovskite phase of CsPbI3 and shed new light on this deceptively simple material."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629eb829752340212cd272f2","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2745-2752","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c92e134097074220c9a014","63c92e134097074220c9a015","63c92e134097074220c9a016","629eb829752340212cd272f2","63c92e134097074220c9a017","63c92e134097074220c9a018","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","63c92e134097074220c9a019","63c92e134097074220c9a01a","63c92e134097074220c9a01b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b7fe","mniswId":"133","title":"ACS Energy Letters","issn":"2380-8195","eissn":"2380-8195","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"039c5c13-5e6d-4798-b3e1-a65f591ba3b4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c92e134097074220c9a013","year":"2022","volume":"7","number":"8","documentHash":"686e19fe-453b-4ad5-b189-8c528cbbf3f1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058602464"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cf1","name":"Maria","lastName":"Tirelli","uuid":"882E8F14E51EDA1525C2D1F1D129406658AD36E2E9267D10899D6D79F2B07077A29805B0EB309375A2A08B606565E701B830F180302A1DC1BC99431890574253","documentHash":"ce393929-5a2c-475d-a7ed-65ecf134da91"},{"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87ff","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Barbetta","documentHash":"67141cca-6962-439a-ba7a-6807e9351f39"},{"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87fe","name":"Gianluca","lastName":"Cidonio","documentHash":"7dd3eaa4-15b3-4b2b-b200-2060c78ac105"},{"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87fd","name":"Giancarlo","lastName":"Ruocco","documentHash":"677bc8ad-ecac-468b-8cba-be4cc42698dc"},{"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87fc","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Święszkowski","documentHash":"b379083f-e282-4ac5-a520-912b2cb24bb5"},{"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87fb","name":"Chiara","lastName":"Scognamiglio","documentHash":"407a08df-78f0-4dc2-944e-bdd7def7a3c6"},{"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87fa","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Jaroszewicz","documentHash":"5d31d74f-a227-4130-857b-11dac1f6acf2"},{"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87f9","name":"Marina","lastName":"Volpi","documentHash":"846dbc4f-7f0d-444c-8943-f921ee38b24c"},{"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87f8","name":"Martina","lastName":"Marcotulli","documentHash":"c4bd0e60-52c1-426e-b82d-3d8ea794ddf8"},{"objectId":"5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","name":"Marco","lastName":"Costantini","uuid":"39AF91D3BD887DDA9D7064C2EEA4EC3EA3433737B56F1680E3899FD57F4B56CF80C6CBF0037AABC256FFEBAA40368FC799B344097649E00467A4677CD64AE0F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2756-5872","documentHash":"cb8eda43-6975-486d-98a0-48f4cabbf744"},{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb04f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kasprzycki","uuid":"00C76A966EA8A58991219F0F8BE830F44ADF3C0EF58F96B25330ABF68598A01200AB82532C58E2870DFD4C643151DEDA4A86DF2C3580D7C5F3082B899091D552","orcidId":"0000-0001-9299-5209","documentHash":"c00d9ee1-87f3-4f55-a3a6-351b885cb7cf"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b5291","name":"Karol","lastName":"Karnowski","uuid":"331A827868CB8E345E7746499EC7E2D9A8CF0E3031FA3CFBE6B6754949E6C61506FB5F94CC2957E58F534D4BCF5C6F0D9B61631FB2F49832479287B26B8440C1","orcidId":"0000-0002-5426-5878","documentHash":"2ea311ae-1299-4efc-afd0-2030a46e2bb1"}],"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87f6","doi":"10.1002/admt.202201244","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/admt.202201244","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Microfluidic 3D Printing of Emulsion Ink for Engineering Porous Functionally Graded Materials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the last decade, 3D printing systems have greatly evolved both in terms of processable materials and printing resolutions, becoming a top seed technology for many academic and industrial applications. Nevertheless, manufacturing polymeric materials characterized by a trabecular porosity and functionally graded architecture-where both the local porosity and chemical composition of the matrix change in the 3D space-through additive platforms remains an open technical challenge. In this study, a 3D extrusion printing strategy to tackle this problem is presented. The proposed systems are based on a flow-focusing microfluidic printing head-to continuously generate oil-in-water emulsion inks-and on an agarose fluid-gel used as a temporary support bath for the deposition of the photo-curable emulsion inks. It is demonstrated that through this strategy one can design a priori and build with high accuracy both discontinuous and continuous functionally graded polymeric foams, where both the density and composition of the materials could be varied independently within arbitrarily complex 3D architectures. This study provides new means for the synthesis of microporous, polymeric FGMs which could find applications ranging from interface tissue engineering to automotive and construction industries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cf1","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","5e709408878c28a0473b5291","5e709459878c28a0473bb04f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"2201244","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c7fd814097076eb37d87f8","63c7fd814097076eb37d87f9","63c7fd814097076eb37d87fa","63c7fd814097076eb37d87fb","5e709459878c28a0473bb04f","5e709408878c28a0473b5291","63c7fd814097076eb37d87fc","63c7fd814097076eb37d87fd","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","63c7fd814097076eb37d87fe","63c7fd814097076eb37d87ff","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cf1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b85c","mniswId":"433","title":"Advanced Materials Technologies","issn":"2365-709X","eissn":"2365-709X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3263498c-0e52-41ea-a7e4-5bbee44ab6ef"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c7fd814097076eb37d87f7","year":"2022","documentHash":"e8007946-6987-4361-a214-ff03af5c0330"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058602517"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbef3","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Skowronska‐Krawczyk","documentHash":"84f8c679-b8ac-47a2-94b4-7c5d58a9668f"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbef2","name":"Won‐Kyu","lastName":"Ju","documentHash":"8a39042c-3fce-4af4-8ce1-d3c4bbb5c139"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbef1","name":"Robert N.","lastName":"Weinreb","documentHash":"44447d7e-1ce2-4cf7-a0ed-34ace351d85a"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbef0","name":"Steve","lastName":"Horvath","documentHash":"ad57ccc3-aaf1-43aa-9560-bee7b85ac927"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbeef","name":"Robert T.","lastName":"Brooke","documentHash":"7bbc1522-f204-4a5a-8c31-3e2d4b2af519"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbeee","name":"David C.","lastName":"Lyon","documentHash":"aaff9e55-60d6-4dc4-bd38-b8faad176778"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbeed","name":"John","lastName":"Donello","documentHash":"ee0954f8-984a-48ce-98ac-3f6aafa622c8"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbeec","name":"Mary","lastName":"Jabari","documentHash":"3b78d1a2-3028-4e6a-9c2c-cd22609125f6"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbeeb","name":"William","lastName":"Cho","documentHash":"1e5de35d-cb0e-4ef6-834f-14b4546d8923"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbeea","name":"Irene","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"584d9d6e-640f-4050-99df-daf39d08edf1"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbee9","name":"Claudia","lastName":"Palomino La Torre","documentHash":"6942dc8f-aa40-441b-b0c8-c72ff7e8dff8"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbee8","name":"Lorena","lastName":"Rocha","documentHash":"797cbcb4-f745-439f-85d2-ff2e2d778491"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbee7","name":"Viet Anh","lastName":"Nguyen Huu","documentHash":"6cd67090-451e-41ac-8c65-4d86fa0070b6"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbee6","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Rydz","documentHash":"2a6b916e-936a-4935-a95c-2f93c335d3cb"},{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbee5","name":"Qianlan","lastName":"Xu","documentHash":"2fc01d36-afcc-4136-9065-66c9d82de487"},{"objectId":"5f505f00752340073806a8ca","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Foik","uuid":"920777744AE28A5DDAB9F1CE4CE386158926640B4996491C47ACB5D4F5DE6FD1F8EA9296334C2DC6F74B2CDC57F4705E23004E7F0D80EE5BD7CCFEC56E05824F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1110-9223","documentHash":"d6ab11c7-e957-4d1b-aa7c-f7c42d4fb5d6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbee3","doi":"10.1111/acel.13737","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/acel.13737","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Stress induced aging in mouse eye","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aging, a universal process that affects all cells in an organism, is a major risk factor for a group of neuropathies called glaucoma, where elevated intraocular pressure is one of the known stresses affecting the tissue. Our understanding of molecular impact of aging on response to stress in retina is very limited; therefore, we developed a new mouse model to approach this question experimentally. Here we show that susceptibility to response to stress increases with age and is primed on chromatin level. We demonstrate that ocular hypertension activates a stress response that is similar to natural aging and involves activation of inflammation and senescence. We show that multiple instances of pressure elevation cause aging of young retina as measured on transcriptional and DNA methylation level and are accompanied by local histone modification changes. Our data show that repeated stress accelerates appearance of aging features in tissues and suggest chromatin modifications as the key molecular components of aging. Lastly, our work further emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and prevention as well as age-specific management of age-related diseases, including glaucoma."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f505f00752340073806a8ca"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c94c064097074220cdbee5","63c94c064097074220cdbee6","63c94c064097074220cdbee7","63c94c064097074220cdbee8","63c94c064097074220cdbee9","63c94c064097074220cdbeea","63c94c064097074220cdbeeb","63c94c064097074220cdbeec","63c94c064097074220cdbeed","63c94c064097074220cdbeee","63c94c064097074220cdbeef","63c94c064097074220cdbef0","63c94c064097074220cdbef1","63c94c064097074220cdbef2","5f505f00752340073806a8ca","63c94c064097074220cdbef3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f11","mniswId":"648","title":"Aging Cell","issn":"1474-9718","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com","documentHash":"afb6bc42-60b6-4fa4-9804-731e91cfce63"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c94c064097074220cdbee4","year":"2022","volume":"21","number":"12","documentHash":"a48328ba-7df6-4659-a027-3e3f84297f90"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058602672"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65c9f56040970762634a5e32","name":"L.","lastName":"Kępiński","documentHash":"6ce9358e-bcc0-4df0-a908-742aca1f204b"},{"objectId":"65c9f56040970762634a5e30","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Patkowski","documentHash":"7883bc80-9fd1-44ce-a9a9-e052f399d1a8"},{"objectId":"65c9f56040970762634a5e2f","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Tarka","documentHash":"6ba818e6-d524-4219-9875-8fc2e711747b"},{"objectId":"602cb3e09543c7410626e20d","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Ronduda","uuid":"2E6F142938B897BB333D03AFEC121957A2D509AB2D6F1A829F8EC712EDDE17B5CF7FE9555D01DE984FD63C600EC4FA5A42E16825888F546E823EC7547D6F8B18","orcidId":"0000-0001-7756-219X","documentHash":"96710d91-098c-4141-be2f-ee5de2a6c4fe"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfacc","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Mierzwa","uuid":"54065E26C3D200153C730AF3E447BC2950E2E49D845E3B8D5358A9C44003D0353EDFAB77A5C91662E91276AE40339156B8F4181BB1D90EC52F24A8A4E21C2CA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0199-4556","documentHash":"d3d7a2af-5a12-42c0-8a21-6a1d9845d0f2"},{"objectId":"5e70946a878c28a0473bc951","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zybert","uuid":"7012440E904A5856C052C090CD487D4D0647373D59B1B6EC61F8DEC0A8793C3330FB831EE6E700841E4E24FC0BDC02B69C3C93BC6432BFE6981CB33FB58E2199","orcidId":"0000-0002-6163-0853","documentHash":"e672d9ca-c513-4dd2-9a85-b119039f01ac"},{"objectId":"5e7092ee878c28a04739f572","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Raróg-Pilecka","uuid":"2F3B0146FAA44656610922C44BA6B4A4DF4D919AFBC4C85F2C2671C635481FA3CA7BC285170EDAFD6BCB0E6B61CB2D04FFC4F16A4B3A9526D3A598A8E3715388","orcidId":"0000-0002-0451-424X","documentHash":"11aa8d01-14c2-45a1-bd18-fcf34a81688b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ce71f24097072e2fc6a4b1","doi":"10.3390/catal12101285","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4344/12/10/1285","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Structure Sensitivity of Ammonia Synthesis on Cobalt: Effect of the Cobalt Particle Size on the Activity of Promoted Cobalt Catalysts Supported on Carbon","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work presents a size effect, i.e., catalyst surface activity, as a function of active phase particle size in a cobalt catalyst for ammonia synthesis. A series of cobalt catalysts supported on carbon and doped with barium was prepared, characterized (TEM, XRPD, and H2 chemisorption), and tested in ammonia synthesis (9.0 MPa, 400 °C, H2/N2 = 3, 8.5 mol% of NH3). The active phase particle size was varied from 3 to 45 nm by changing the metal loading in the range of 4.9–67.7 wt%. The dependence of the reaction rate expressed as TOF on the active phase particle size revealed an optimal size of cobalt particles (20–30 nm), ensuring the highest activity of the cobalt catalyst in the ammonia synthesis reaction. This indicated that the ammonia synthesis reaction on cobalt is a structure-sensitive reaction. The observed effect may be attributed to changes in the crystalline structure, i.e., the appearance of the hcp Co phase for the particles with a diameter of 20–30 nm"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfacc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70946a878c28a0473bc951","602cb3e09543c7410626e20d","5e7092ee878c28a04739f572","65c9f56040970762634a5e2f","65c9f56040970762634a5e30","5e709491878c28a0473bfacc","65c9f56040970762634a5e32"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477568","mniswId":"3333","title":"Catalysts","issn":"2073-4344","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"467b91d9-8d0c-4cfd-ab42-eccbc898d26d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"634916034097072ef287cebc","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"10","documentHash":"482770f9-f344-43c0-9514-97e9fbe80f35"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["structure sensitivity","size effect","cobalt catalyst","ammonia synthesis","carbon support"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058612363"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65c9ffbf40970762634b808e","name":"S.

Finding proper additives for morphology improvement and passivation of the perovskite defects is critical to fabricate highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, 1,3-disubstituted urea additives are employed to study the effect of different substituents at -NH moiety on the quality of the perovskite layer and device performance. By adding 1,3-diphenyl urea (Ph-urea) or 1,3-di(tert-butyl)urea (tBu-urea) into the precursors, the crystallization process leads to the formation of perovskite films with larger grains and lower defect densities as compared to the nonsubstituted urea additive. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental spectro-scopic measurements, we found that the selected 1,3-disubstituted ureas are prone to form stronger coordination interaction with undercoordinated Pb2+ ions than the urea. Applying this additive engineering to the devices reduced the current density-voltage (J-V) hysteresis and improved the photovoltaic performance, resulting in maximum power conversion efficiencies of 21.7 and 21.2% for the Ph-urea and tBu-urea modified devices, respectively. In addition, the device with Ph-urea enhanced long-term stability, where it remains at 90% of its initial efficiency, while the device with tBu-urea degrades fast reaching 20% of its initial efficiency after aging for 90 days due to the high moisture permeability of tBu-urea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c301819543c723365439a6","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"5","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"13617-13626","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c301819543c723365439a6","63ce868d4097072e2fc883b2","63ce868d4097072e2fc883b3","63ce868d4097072e2fc883b4","63ce868d4097072e2fc883b5","63ce868d4097072e2fc883b6","63ce868d4097072e2fc883b7","63ce868d4097072e2fc883b8","63ce868d4097072e2fc883b9","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f09b","mniswId":"27714","title":"ACS Applied Energy Materials","issn":"2574-0962","eissn":"2574-0962","documentHash":"5d6f6c9f-f6aa-450a-bc82-d4dc386e2d75"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ce85664097072e2fc8641c","year":"2022","volume":"5","number":"11","documentHash":"2b8cb8a5-ada5-4e7c-9bf9-974afee604eb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058615123"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ce841b4097072e2fc83d6e","name":"Ankur","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"b0c9bc89-525d-46d7-b173-93108b38066f"},{"objectId":"63ce841b4097072e2fc83d6d","name":"Filipe","lastName":"Henrique","documentHash":"def9ec41-2878-4548-abd8-1e8c6b45dd37"},{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb067","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Żuk","uuid":"A2CF96DA8DBC0F0EC756C6ABC4425D960DE3CE0ABBAA543C816DF4A24FDC838930FFB8FDCE1B3C5232CB0C3FD9D93CDDF5F6336061F13F18AC43F6C77E9DD4F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0555-5913","documentHash":"323764fb-47c8-4632-b36c-1a2615cfd8d2"}],"objectId":"63ce841b4097072e2fc83d6b","doi":"10.1016/j.electacta.2022.141220","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013468622013779?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Impact of asymmetries in valences and diffusivities on the transport of a binary electrolyte in a charged cylindrical pore","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ion transport in porous media is present in a wealth of technologies, e.g., energy storage devices such as batteries and supercapacitors, and environmental technologies such as electrochemical carbon capture and capacitive deionization. Recent studies on flat plate electrodes have demonstrated that asymmetries in ions properties, such as valences and diffusivities, lead to intriguing and counter-intuitive physical phenomena. Yet, the consequences of such asymmetries to ion transport have seldom been explored in porous geometries. To bridge this knowledge gap, we employ direct numerical simulations to solve Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations inside a cylindrical pore for a binary electrolyte with arbitrary valences and diffusivities. Next, we conduct a perturbation expansion in the limit of small potential and derive equations for charge and salt transport under confinement. We obtain good agreement between the perturbation analysis and the direct numerical simulations. Our analysis reveals that the charge and the salt transport are coupled with each other. Further, the coupling between the charge and salt transport processes is enhanced by an increase in valence and diffusivity asymmetries of ions. We observe that the mismatch of the ionic diffusivities induces a non-trivial salt dynamics, producing either transient depletion or enhancement of salt in the pore. In the regime of high static-diffusion-layer conductance, we obtain an analytical solution to our perturbation model. The solution elucidates how electrolyte asymmetry induces two charging timescales that are set by the relative pore size. In the overlapping-double-layer regime, these timescales reduce to the diffusion times of each ion such that the transport of the two ions appears to be decoupled. Overall, our work underscores that the asymmetry in cation and anion diffusivities fundamentally alters the behavior of ionic transport inside a charged cylindrical pore and opens up new avenues of research on electrolyte transport in porous materials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709459878c28a0473bb067"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"433","pagesFromTo":"141220","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ce841b4097072e2fc83d6d","63ce841b4097072e2fc83d6e","5e709459878c28a0473bb067"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a67","mniswId":"5553","title":"Electrochimica Acta","issn":"0013-4686","eissn":"1873-3859","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/electrochimica-acta/","documentHash":"9acc56c7-cbf9-4da3-b4ef-7d0a9cfd7d71"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ce841b4097072e2fc83d6c","year":"2022","volume":"433","documentHash":"360a2b58-779e-4b13-8a8b-07e9a928b730"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058615809"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c344639543c723365442c6","name":"Sada","lastName":"Raza","orcidId":"0000-0002-7409-4914","documentHash":"d31fa13d-70ec-4762-b908-adf5514aee27"},{"objectId":"60c2fce49543c72336543461","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Wdowiak","uuid":"F5BECBC8F8A9F5D587CC2E88EDF4FDD07EBAA5C3B6B2AACAB01368BD54777852964CA9152E868F8531C52E7412C63812CCE21360B0EDC398117660E5E5C891BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7822-9513","documentHash":"424e935a-387c-4d22-8b88-8b0edabb5042"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","name":"Jan","lastName":"Paczesny","uuid":"22569BA0D9E03A26F0A64D7FCE396ED2ABE848430876A29510DE2522F2961D44598990961BF4B864621D02EECDE361E0D5D41E3F1FDFCA243A5BC52483EC38B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-3951","documentHash":"6d641bb0-96ee-402e-ac7c-55829c1da4b4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"63cf9daf4097075010efc5ac","doi":"10.3390/pharmaceutics14091936","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/9/1936/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Enhancing the Stability of Bacteriophages Using Physical, Chemical, and Nano-Based Approaches: A Review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Phages are efficient in diagnosing, treating, and preventing various diseases, and as sensing elements in biosensors. Phage display alone has gained attention over the past decade, especially in pharmaceuticals. Bacteriophages have also found importance in research aiming to fight viruses and in the consequent formulation of antiviral agents and vaccines. All these applications require control over the stability of virions. Phages are considered resistant to various harsh conditions. However, stability-determining parameters are usually the only additional factors in phage-related applications. Phages face instability and activity loss when preserved for extended periods. Sudden environmental changes, including exposure to UV light, temperature, pH, and salt concentration, also lead to a phage titer fall. This review describes various formulations that impart stability to phage stocks, mainly focusing on polymer-based stabilization, encapsulation, lyophilization, and nano-assisted solutions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c344639543c723365442c6","60c2fce49543c72336543461","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1936","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fce49543c72336543461","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","60c344639543c723365442c6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceee","mniswId":"15948","title":"Pharmaceutics","issn":"1999-4923","eissn":"1999-4923","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"640fbe9a-6905-4a12-ae21-1faaade61778"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cf9daf4097075010efc5ad","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"9","documentHash":"2d5548ef-e8bb-4244-a806-e3073e2fe2a8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058615867"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d2587c40970773d53b8dea","name":"Maxym","lastName":"Dudka","documentHash":"213cbbe5-d5a5-442b-af03-6cce007ca154"},{"objectId":"63d2587c40970773d53b8de9","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Shapoval","documentHash":"680ce6f8-be85-4ae5-b438-fd17dd279db4"},{"objectId":"636dc1b87523405a7dd0411a","name":"Viktoriya","lastName":"Blavatska","uuid":"F461CD63D3BD823F0773DC006A87A8F76D6A2F4204D76AE1DB657ADB0E26F20F8B7F1CC5E50A9E86147DA9A605574508D73256D6C9900C0F7FCC52408A03895C","documentHash":"6887b7c0-cbde-4491-9d63-8c535234d918"}],"objectId":"63d2587c40970773d53b8de7","doi":"10.1088/1751-8121/ac9c39","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ac9c39","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Survival in two-species reaction-diffusion system with Lévy flights: renormalization group treatment and numerical simulations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We analyze the two-species reaction-diffusion system including trapping reaction A+B & RARR;A A+A & RARR;(A,0) 0"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["636dc1b87523405a7dd0411a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"55","issue":"45","pagesFromTo":"455002","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d2587c40970773d53b8de9","636dc1b87523405a7dd0411a","63d2587c40970773d53b8dea"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a7","mniswId":"12292","title":"Journal of Physics.

One of the various reasons for their improved properties is the reduced defect concentration as compared with thin films. Since their discovery, many efforts have been devoted to discerning the surface and bulk properties of SCs. However, it is difficult to probe the surface and bulk responses of SCs, and only a few reports distinguishing between these properties have been presented. In this study, we distinguished between the surface and bulk electrical responses of methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr(3)) SCs using impedance spectroscopy (IS). The electrical response of the MAPbBr(3) SC was recorded using different optical excitations for the generation of carriers. The Nyquist plots and capacitance-frequency responses observed under blue and red wavelengths differ significantly from each other and were studied systematically. The results obtained suggest that the photocurrent and capacitive response under blue light are higher than those under red light. Moreover, the change in the low-frequency capacitance is lower in the case of blue light. This is because of the polarization of the interface of metal contacts and the surface of SCs or due to defect-mediated conductivity. As the carriers are collected efficiently from the surface following a rapid process, they do not contribute to the capacitance build-up with temperature. To the best of our knowledge, electrical responses such as the impedance and the capacitive response of SCs using different illumination wavelengths and temperatures have been rarely discussed in the literature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"126","issue":"30","pagesFromTo":"12399-12404","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d23a6640970773d539053d","63d23a6640970773d539053e","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","63d23a6640970773d539053f","63d23a6640970773d5390541","63d23a6640970773d5390542","63d23a6640970773d5390543"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a2","mniswId":"12286","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry.

While there are treatments available, they are not always effective and are usually administered when the disease is already at a developed stage with visible clinical manifestation. However, homeostasis at a molecular level is disrupted before visible signs of the disease are evident. Thus, there has been a constant search for effective biomarkers that could signal the onset of DR. There is evidence that early detection and prompt disease control are effective in preventing or slowing DR progression. Here, we review some of the molecular changes that occur before clinical manifestations are observable. As a possible new biomarker, we focus on retinol binding protein 3 (RBP3). We argue that it displays unique features that make it a very good biomarker for non-invasive, early-stage DR detection. Linking chemistry to biological function and focusing on new developments in eye imaging and two-photon technology, we describe a new potential diagnostic tool that would allow rapid and effective quantification of RBP3 in the retina. Moreover, this tool would also be useful in the future to monitor therapeutic effectiveness if levels of RBP3 are elevated by DR treatments"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["620b1e387523402df0840e24","5ffecb96085dcb0e357dce0a","60c967c39543c7233654453b","60c9e86a9543c72336544557"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"4408","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c9e86a9543c72336544557","60c967c39543c7233654453b","620b1e387523402df0840e24","5ffecb96085dcb0e357dce0a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fc63cc4097074e59f93122","year":"2023","volume":"24","number":"5","documentHash":"c0417bc4-0fb9-47da-a359-48ffacd84e87"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PHOTORECEPTOR CELLS","RETINAL-PIGMENT EPITHELIUM","ALL-TRANS-RETINOL","OXIDATIVE STRESS","MOUSE MODEL","2-PHOTON MICROSCOPY","PROTEIN GENE","RAT RETINA","INTERPHOTORECEPTOR MATRIX","RHODOPSIN REGENERATION"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058625123"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6437b61e4097076ac7d53191","name":"O.","lastName":"Patsahan","documentHash":"c9733271-2056-42fc-82be-b3a8c7af4d13"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","name":"Alina","lastName":"Ciach","uuid":"520AD5EF74AF15FA81FB18147E92D695E358B38A5F90389DF9A11C3C3623C0214250CFB548E34846D53DBA21ED79955D9F88250356F8AFEBD6A696B7263A658B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5556-401X","documentHash":"630645e8-c7ee-4652-a5a0-a0da6ec79d79"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6437b61e4097076ac7d53190","doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2023.121453","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0167732223002568?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Structure of ionic liquids and concentrated electrolytes from a mesoscopic theory","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recently, underscreening in concentrated electrolytes was discovered in experiments and confirmed in simulations and theory. It was found that the correlation length of the charge-charge correlations, ks, sat-isfies the scaling relation ks/kD ti (a/kD)n, where kD is the Debye screening length and a is the ionic diam-eter. However, different values of n were found in different studies. In this work we solve this puzzle within the mesocopic theory that yielded n = 3 in agreement with experiments, but only very high den-sities of ions were considered [A. Ciach and O. Patsahan, J.Phys.: Condens. Matter 33, 37LT01 (2021)]. Here we apply the theory to a broader range of density of ions and find that different values of n in the above scaling can yield a fair approximation for ks/kD for different ranges of a/kD. The experimentally found scaling holds for 2 < a/kD < 4, and we find n = 3 for the same range of the reduced Debye length. For smaller a/kD, we find n = 2 obtained earlier in several simulation and theoretical studies, and still closer to the Kirkwood line we obtain n = 1.5 that was also predicted in different works. It follows from our the-ory that n = 3 (i.e.ks is proportional to the density of ions) when the variance of the local charge density is large, andks is proportional to this variance times the Bjerrum length.

The boat moves because the pill releases surface active molecules that decrease the surface tension and support the motion. We introduce a new experimental system in which the boat rotates on a long arm around the axis located at the centre of a Petri dish; thus, the motion is restricted to a circle and can be studied under stationary conditions for a long time. The experiments confirmed two previously reported modes of motion: continuous motion when the pill was located at the boat edge and pulsating (intermittent) motion if it was close to the boat centre (Suematsu et al., J. Phys. Chem. C, 2010, 114(21), 9876–9882). For intermediate pill locations, we observed a new, unreported type of motion characterised by oscillating speed (i.e. oscillating motion). Different modes of motion can be observed for the same pill location. The experimental results are qualitatively confirmed using a simple reaction-diffusion model of the boat evolution used in the above-mentioned paper."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","5e709491878c28a0473bfaba","5fc513b9085dcb1e6ae0b9f1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"7794-7804","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709491878c28a0473bfaba","643d3840409707219a504e59","643d3840409707219a504e5a","5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","5fc513b9085dcb1e6ae0b9f1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547925d","mniswId":"16075","title":"PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS","issn":"1463-9076","documentHash":"8e732841-944b-4696-92c7-03b5ad988f7d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"643d3840409707219a504e58","year":"2023","volume":"25","number":"11","documentHash":"e258e241-a0af-4160-bfdc-d60d065d0741"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058631832"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643d3670409707219a5029f9","name":"Alfons","lastName":"van Blaaderen","documentHash":"313ad886-d3c1-4090-9be5-5190d99978f4"},{"objectId":"643d3670409707219a5029f8","name":"René","lastName":"van Roij","documentHash":"ec496932-df38-4249-987e-7711f52c50dd"},{"objectId":"643d3670409707219a5029f7","name":"Marjolein N.","lastName":"van der Linden","documentHash":"e3dca440-3f84-4afb-a410-f43dfbee62a5"},{"objectId":"6023ab1c9543c7744e88f338","name":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Everts","uuid":"E02DE9E94AC1344B4297CD389B04020818F0DD7687F20293A8707839A26A90EF215970AF7A7F699751362408153D4AE984238BCA887577B6A0607CBE2FC4F82E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6289-3252","documentHash":"f1be3ee8-6e70-4de5-a5ab-acfed683e0c0"}],"objectId":"643d3670409707219a5029f6","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2213044120","publicUri":"https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2213044120","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Realization of the Brazil-nut effect in charged colloids without external driving","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sedimentation is a ubiquitous phenomenon across many fields of science, such as geology, astrophysics, and soft matter. Sometimes, sedimentation leads to unusual phenomena, such as the Brazil-nut effect, where heavier (granular) particles reside on top of lighter particles after shaking. We show experimentally that a Brazil-nut effect can be realized in a binary colloidal system of long-range repulsive charged particles driven purely by Brownian motion and electrostatics without the need for activity. Using theory, we argue that not only the mass-per-charge for the heavier particles needs to be smaller than the mass-per-charge for the lighter particles but also that at high overall density, the system can be trapped in a long-lived metastable state, which prevents the occurrence of the equilibrium Brazil-nut effect. Therefore, we envision that our work provides valuable insights into the physics of strongly interacting systems, such as partially glassy and crystalline structures. Finally, our theory, which quantitatively agrees with the experimental data, predicts that the shapes of sedimentation density profiles of multicomponent charged colloids are greatly altered when the particles are charge-regulating with more than one ion species involved. Hence, we hypothesize that sedimentation experiments can aid in revealing the type of ion adsorption processes that determine the particle charge and possibly the value of the corresponding equilibrium constants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6023ab1c9543c7744e88f338"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"120","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["643d3670409707219a5029f7","6023ab1c9543c7744e88f338","643d3670409707219a5029f8","643d3670409707219a5029f9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793a7","mniswId":"16559","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","eissn":"0027-8424","documentHash":"6c7e55c8-7f5c-4cba-8821-15f816a6ebee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fc71b14097074e59fa374b","year":"2023","volume":"120","number":"9","documentHash":"7c614f65-1a4b-4cc2-bb40-d7d823a804f6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058632620"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643e868e4097072d53986815","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Mackowski","documentHash":"4ef14bc2-0837-40b2-ae0d-8fab8d34f190"},{"objectId":"643e868e4097072d53986814","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Sulowska","documentHash":"3598cae7-8d48-4267-9602-3e8cacd5b2a6"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfadc","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Roźniecka","uuid":"D2141DDFA818A3D40F42B20AE4E2EFC008E3C15DB86811220AF2B4C087B9CC5BA1BC637504A974251606C9081BF3ECED6F38F16F8AB5CB926AFDD3AB1E313E2A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5521-4952","documentHash":"06bd06db-8c1e-47b3-a001-4709ad183462"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Niedziółka-Jönsson","uuid":"87A188D17120D3F4F55C5E1B0AA008499E9DC902A95D1C123E357F1DA1F7A976DFE69FEB7E38B942004B483B0B7F470AC78009BB04046308074F5705022474FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-9508-1373","documentHash":"3f269ce4-2f3f-4dd5-8a01-0de3a5a94550"}],"objectId":"643e868e4097072d53986813","doi":"10.1016/j.saa.2022.122225","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1386142522013737?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Aligned silver nanowires for plasmonically-enhanced fluorescence detection of photoactive proteins in wet and dry environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We developed a method of aligning silver nanowires in a microchannel and fixing them to glass substrates via appropriate functionalization.

Although bevacizumab's action is preferably extracellular, there are reports suggesting its internalization into cancer cells, consequently decreasing its therapeutic potential. Here we are solving this issue by applying fluorescence correlation spectroscopy in living cells. We tracked single molecules of fluorescent bevacizumab in MDAMB-231 and HeLa cells and proved that mobility measurements bring significant added value to standard imaging techniques. We confirmed the presence of the drug in intracellular vesicles. Additionally, we explicitly excluded the presence of a free cytosolic fraction of bevacizumab in both studied cell types. Extracellular and intracellular concentrations of the drug were measured, giving a partition coefficient on the order of 10-5, comparable with the spontaneous uptake of biologically inert nanoparticles.

Here, overcoming challenging crystallogenesis, we report the first crystallographic authentication of carboxylated pillar[6]arene in the form of two host–guest inclusion complexes with methyl viologen and pentamidine. The key to the successful crystallization of carboxylated pillar[6]arene is the mixed ionization state of its 12 carboxylic substituents. The deprotonation of several but not all substituents enables intermolecular hydrogen bonding and, as a result, “gluing” and crystallization of pillar[6]arene complexes with the aid of carboxylic-carboxylate, carboxylic-carboxylic, and amidinium-carboxylate supramolecular synthons. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that upon guest inclusion pillar[6]arene adopts a quasi-pentagonal shape rather than the expected hexagonal shape. The squeezed quasi-pentagonal conformation of the six-membered macrocycle is stabilized by two intramolecular hydrogen bonds between pillar[6]arene substituents. Moreover, the distinctive deviation of the macrocycle from hexagonal shape stays operative in the solution/gas phase as concluded from ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) studies and theoretical calculations. These results provide the first insight into how to gain control over the conformation of flexible pillar[6]arene with a view of solid state design of more advanced supramolecular host–guest structures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e8878c28a0473b314c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","5e7093ea878c28a0473b31fe","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"11-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b31fe","5e7093e8878c28a0473b314c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547784f","mniswId":"4571","title":"Crystal Growth & Design","issn":"1528-7483","eissn":"1528-7505","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a74fd0a5-1a2c-4144-b4de-f61e8704ecc7"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058640102"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"616a392975234017e05459af","name":"Enkhlin","lastName":"Ochirbat","uuid":"CB86875C7B254E065A8458C7DF5118E071954775ACFE56FDBB77328A3AE7C40ED11220FFBDD3EA66DF8B913622F39B4482FB36DEF6AAE8E5CA45BA0994984B00","orcidId":"0000-0002-7627-4724","documentHash":"fc790b0f-2996-4fd7-a805-98b0b5e45fd4"},{"objectId":"60c2fce49543c72336543461","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Wdowiak","uuid":"F5BECBC8F8A9F5D587CC2E88EDF4FDD07EBAA5C3B6B2AACAB01368BD54777852964CA9152E868F8531C52E7412C63812CCE21360B0EDC398117660E5E5C891BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7822-9513","documentHash":"424e935a-387c-4d22-8b88-8b0edabb5042"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","name":"Jan","lastName":"Paczesny","uuid":"22569BA0D9E03A26F0A64D7FCE396ED2ABE848430876A29510DE2522F2961D44598990961BF4B864621D02EECDE361E0D5D41E3F1FDFCA243A5BC52483EC38B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-3951","documentHash":"6d641bb0-96ee-402e-ac7c-55829c1da4b4"}],"objectId":"63dd01b840970768a2c167fb","doi":"10.1007/978-981-16-9190-4_20","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-981-16-9190-4_20","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Bacteriophage-Based Biosensors: Detection of Bacteria and Beyond","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pathogenic infections cause tremendous health threats and socioeconomic burdens worldwide.

Biofouling caused by the deposition of microorganisms and their extracellular substances decreases the operational flux of the membrane bioreactor, increasing the energy consumption costs of bioreactor maintenance. Standard protocols are costly and time-consuming, and generate harmful waste. Here, a method for the simultaneous utilization of UV light and bacteriophages for efficient sterilization of bacteria-contaminated membranes is demonstrated. Congo red, a commonly used dye, provides selective protection of phages, but not bacteria, against UV radiation. This allows for overcoming the significant drawback of such protocols – the phage inactivation by UV. The simultaneous utilization of phages, UV, and Congo red resulted in the complete removal of bacteria from membranes (>4 log) within just 30 minutes.

In this review, we present a brief overview of the main methods developed for enzyme immobilisation, co-localisation, and conjugation and discuss how and why they affect the enzyme properties. We also describe the effects emerging from bringing two sequential enzymes of a cascade reaction together, particularly if and when it speeds up reaction velocity. Furthermore, we discuss enzyme compartmentalisation, or clustering of several enzymes of a cascade, and present theoretical approaches developed to optimise synthetic enzyme clusters. We also point out the plenitude of open questions, which exist despite the enormous research effort channelled into understanding enzyme co-localisation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"100031","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","63eb62b24097075ca5115237","63eb62b24097075ca5115238"]},"journal":{"objectId":"63eb62b24097075ca5115236","title":"Current Research in Chemical Biology","eissn":"2666-2469","websiteLink":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/current-research-in-chemical-biology","documentHash":"b0500afb-f052-429b-af8d-5f1ab0cfe1b5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058651769"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"645376e54097075bae307e23","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Tomaszewska","documentHash":"4f5ae9db-e2fc-4af6-80f4-c85bcd6bf6c4"},{"objectId":"645376e54097075bae307e22","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Skórczewska","documentHash":"7c2bc1f7-ffde-40e6-9535-ba24d474b24e"},{"objectId":"645376e54097075bae307e21","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Wilczewski","documentHash":"9f754910-d941-4868-aa5c-8bdee5b6325d"},{"objectId":"60750d939543c745d80e5c6b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jenczyk","uuid":"8E520E5AB1639F1B726B08C83C2B92B196E208934633AFBAF685A827941BB897272577BE7BB11C6E0F6107F727668CFC564EBA0AD2AA3C7BE3DEEB65981F715C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4788-0450","documentHash":"80c1861c-f500-4428-9a2d-e0b2af4726fe"},{"objectId":"5f7c4331085dcb410a25eab5","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Grzywacz","uuid":"599FAFD8D595CE79170349D232DC88C53C53554EAC898E344B88B40739474DECB24F9EC60161ABD879D4329445094C976E36433FAE228EEF4F3F5F520F3A3E4F","documentHash":"fc28843a-5b8c-4264-b686-1758db041e0b"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Nikiforow","uuid":"E166453BA6868F48895D87A86E6702843A623A59A84923A7C78B7FFBB992983C7D95FE6E5E79D29AB2127112DC3887B27E8FB1E44DE4688F1367FD5EA5783F74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6135-8514","documentHash":"c96f36f3-357e-4938-9d4c-83e71d392895"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be68e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"0BBE8C9602F901ADD577E5DCEA8933D6B2BCA02B70A7690E1AA8B631268B5F53E07E8A6771F467EE8E7BDE5D6DB9E64BC4D0B6191E2B14E4F5E73E29BF39F545","orcidId":"0000-0003-1192-1764","documentHash":"d7ff9fb7-7170-4537-9447-85e7e86ce729"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7e90","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Osial","uuid":"7BF57838604E048836F88F364E085F91D99A9C833A38001B730C20094A19F1D8A72F1EE295B3B9A2FB8A61960AE5513D81CBE0C6AFC064A2E427F2D38C829FB5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3076-3415","documentHash":"f17dc8c6-9dc7-4a60-86b5-2062939be0c2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"645376e54097075bae307e20","doi":"10.3390/molecules28083383","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/8/3383/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Graphene Modification by Curcuminoids as an Effective Method to Improve the Dispersion and Stability of PVC/Graphene Nanocomposites","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A large amount of graphene-related research is its use as a filler for polymer composites, including thin nanocomposite films. However, its use is limited by the need for large-scale methods to obtain high–quality filler, as well as its poor dispersion in the polymer matrix. This work presents polymer thin-film composites based on poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and graphene, whose surfaces were modified by curcuminoids. TGA, UV–vis, Raman spectroscopy, XPS, TEM, and SEM methods have confirmed the effectiveness of the graphene modification due to π–π interactions. The dispersion of graphene in the PVC solution was investigated by the turbidimetric method. SEM, AFM, and Raman spectroscopy methods evaluated the thin-film composite’s structure. The research showed significant improvements in terms of graphene’s dispersion (in solutions and PVC composites) following the application of curcuminoids.

The transformations of GLVs are a potential source of SOA components through photo-oxidation processes oc-curring in the atmospheric aqueous phase. Here, we investigated the aqueous photo-oxidation products from three abundant GLVs (1-penten-3-ol, (Z)-2-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-2-hexen-1-al) induced by center dot OH radicals, carried out in a photo-reactor under simulated solar conditions. The aqueous reaction samples were analyzed using advanced hyphen-ated mass spectrometry techniques: capillary gas chromatography mass spectrometry (c-GC-MS); and reversed-phase liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Using carbonyl-targeted c-GC-MS analysis, we confirmed the presence of propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, 1-penten-3-one, and 2-hexen-1-al in the reaction samples. The LC-HRMS analysis confirmed the presence of a new carbonyl product with the molecular formula C6H10O2, which probably bears the hydroxyhexenal or hydroxyhexenone structure. Density functional theory (DFT)-based quantum calculations were used to evaluate the experimental data and obtain insight into the formation mechanism and struc-tures of the identified oxidation products via the addition and hydrogen-abstraction pathways. DFT calculations high-lighted the importance of the hydrogen abstraction pathway leading to the new product C6H10O2. Atmospheric relevance of the identified products was evaluated using a set of physical property data like Henry's law constant (HLC) and vapor pressure (VP). The unknown product of molecular formula C6H10O2 has higher HLC and lower VP than the parent GLV and thus has potential to remain in the aqueous phase leading to possible aqueous SOA formation. Other observed carbonyl products are likely first stage oxidation products and precursors of aged SOA."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4a7b6085dcb1e6ae0b889","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5fc4bba0085dcb1e6ae0b8d5","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"879","pagesFromTo":"162622","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4bba0085dcb1e6ae0b8d5","648868144097072fd7709efc","5fc4a7b6085dcb1e6ae0b889","648868144097072fd7709efd","648868144097072fd7709efe","648868144097072fd7709eff","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","648868144097072fd7709f00","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","eissn":"1879-1026","documentHash":"8db62889-7562-4bb8-9442-090130c06edf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6438f2c54097077a0cc64ad7","year":"2023","volume":"879","documentHash":"0cf436df-c4d3-48b5-b42c-fe4c7df43b2f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Green leaf volatiles","Hydroxyl radicals","Aqueous phase","Reaction products","Secondary organic aerosol","DFT calculations"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677481"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f5164","name":"Mehdi","lastName":"Dadashpour","documentHash":"69e8eb0d-45db-4d8f-ba41-489fe3a0105e"},{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f5163","name":"Mahdieh","lastName":"Ameri Shah Reza","documentHash":"ba1e1843-8835-406e-8e04-7f8f0ec07083"},{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f5162","name":"Majid","lastName":"Eslami","documentHash":"59806a2f-909b-48b4-890e-3eae056b5f0f"},{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f5161","name":"Farhood","lastName":"Ghazi","documentHash":"a8d75779-e22c-41d4-8e3d-48be1b116826"},{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f5160","name":"Yalda","lastName":"Yazdani","documentHash":"a586c018-6113-443d-b818-ed6502edffe7"},{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f515f","name":"Behnam","lastName":"Hashemi","documentHash":"9b437fe5-b1b8-4745-85cf-f497d78f9ae3"},{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f515e","name":"Vahid","lastName":"Alivirdiloo","documentHash":"3449be92-e689-4cd8-8983-c6ce7ded578c"},{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f515d","name":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Rahimi","documentHash":"47abde30-9ae4-43a9-9f27-2659038bbdf7"},{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f515c","name":"Hami","lastName":"Ashraf","documentHash":"c9ce97a9-71ba-4565-aa41-60ba2b5cba55"},{"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f515b","name":"Arianaz","lastName":"Hosseini","documentHash":"fd3722ef-b918-402c-8b89-26152d283ca8"},{"objectId":"60c2fc239543c7233654339a","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Alipourfard","uuid":"09F87F13C145EAA33D5D3E392CC52D6627B20E2FB071920A9AC8A55B4EFE06CCFDC635D1FBCFD0C3CE2E997891A272F5A4326A19832587B921FF5E5C935B8BC5","documentHash":"92b7f0ed-674e-4ca5-b512-5aa90affbef8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f515a","doi":"10.1186/s12935-023-02947-1","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12935-023-02947-1.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Recent advances in the detection of glioblastoma, from imaging-based methods to proteomics and biosensors: A narrative review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive type of cancer that originates in the cells called astrocytes, which support the functioning of nerve cells.

On the example of nanocrystalline gold supported on also nanocrystalline CeO(2 )we show evolution of (a) the background pattern due to chemisorption phenomena, (b) peak positions due to adsorption on nonstoichiometric CeO2-x particles, (c) Au peaks intensity. The results of the measurements, complemented with mass spectrometry gas analysis, point to (1) a multiply twinned structure of gold, (2) high mobility of Au atoms enabling transport phenomena of Au atoms to the surface of ceria while varying the amount of Au in the crystalline form, and (3) reversible CeO2 peaks position shifts on exposure to He-X-He where X is O-2 , H-2 , CO or CO oxidation reaction mixture, suggesting solely internal alternations of the CeO2 crystal structure. We found no evidence of ceria lattice oxygen being consumed/supplied at any stage of the process. The work shows possibility of structurally interpreting different contributions to the multi-phase powder diffraction pattern during a complex physicochemical process, including effects of physi-, chemisorption and surface evolution. It shows a way to structurally interpret heterogeneous catalytic reactions even if no bulk phase transition is involved."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfadf","5e709490878c28a0473bf9b3","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6489bc5740970732284c7895","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeef","5e709490878c28a0473bf9b3","5e709491878c28a0473bfadf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"3ee113d7-e583-4a13-8002-d0395774636a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058677796"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"648865374097072fd7705659","name":"Alexei A.","lastName":"Kornyshev","documentHash":"11ba5045-a048-4a37-9ac1-23a13887cc71"},{"objectId":"648865374097072fd7705658","name":"Michael","lastName":"Urbakh","documentHash":"e8557d7e-ae85-4833-bb0d-9b09bfec2444"},{"objectId":"648865374097072fd7705657","name":"Fernando","lastName":"Bresme","documentHash":"53103c6f-6986-4028-9b79-4a4c0e584191"},{"objectId":"648865374097072fd7705656","name":"Guang","lastName":"Feng","documentHash":"eca82c00-0ec6-4bf8-866d-03ec4cc702a8"},{"objectId":"5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","uuid":"4C8E231D76FA1FF9DEBFB40938EB36AF89D302A9BF4FB4483D4EB2BD2B36DFFFCE516493C98DF050048768547005AB2F2AB230D9F072ED3FD77064BDE749E112","orcidId":"0000-0003-4448-0686","documentHash":"22911df0-6857-4e43-8285-ca3bbbff21b2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"648865374097072fd7705654","doi":"10.1021/acs.chemrev.2c00728","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.chemrev.2c00728","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Theory and Simulations of Ionic Liquids in Nanoconfinement","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) have exciting properties such as nonvolatility, large electrochemical windows, and remarkable variety, drawing much interest in energy storage, gating, electrocatalysis, tunable lubrication, and other applications. Confined RTILs appear in various situations, for instance, in pores of nanostructured electrodes of supercapacitors and batteries, as such electrodes increase the contact area with RTILs and enhance the total capacitance and stored energy, between crossed cylinders in surface force balance experiments, between a tip and a sample in atomic force microscopy, and between sliding surfaces in tribology experiments, where RTILs act as lubricants. The properties and functioning of RTILs in confinement, especially nanoconfinement, result in fascinating structural and dynamic phenomena, including layering, overscreening and crowding, nanoscale capillary freezing, quantized and electrotunable friction, and superionic state. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the fundamental physical phenomena controlling the properties of such systems and the current state-of-the-art theoretical and simulation approaches developed for their description. We discuss these approaches sequentially by increasing atomistic complexity, paying particular attention to new physical phenomena emerging in nanoscale confinement. This review covers theoretical models, most of which are based on mapping the problems on pertinent statistical mechanics models with exact analytical solutions, allowing systematic analysis and new physical insights to develop more easily. We also describe a classical density functional theory, which offers a reliable and computationally inexpensive tool to account for some microscopic details and correlations that simplified models often fail to consider. Molecular simulations play a vital role in studying confined ionic liquids, enabling deep microscopic insights otherwise unavailable to researchers. We describe the basics of various simulation approaches and discuss their challenges and applicability to specific problems, focusing on RTIL structure in cylindrical and slit confinement and how it relates to friction and capacitive and dynamic properties of confined ions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"123","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"6668-6715","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","648865374097072fd7705656","648865374097072fd7705657","648865374097072fd7705658","648865374097072fd7705659"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775d8","mniswId":"3487","title":"Chemical Reviews","doi":"10.1021/acs.chemrev","issn":"0009-2665","eissn":"1520-6890","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/chreay","documentHash":"a87782e5-856b-4489-aeec-59202a5d30a0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"648865374097072fd7705655","year":"2023","volume":"123","number":"10","documentHash":"5e22fae3-f990-4ccb-a0c9-fbdb07cd453e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058678051"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64105d00409707283642d6fa","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Matus","documentHash":"ef2edd17-721c-40ae-a4ce-8a2c9ad2fd8a"},{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6a41","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Zawadzki","uuid":"8D53EFDFCD994003A65C5CED83D75D7375545F677A9B8B017A25D6E00ABC1EDD3F26E983925B933A318543B65B740A9EC0F947605B9C245692FFB44CBED30129","orcidId":"0000-0003-4973-637X","documentHash":"2cb1fb47-0ae8-4517-8480-bfaacc76542d"},{"objectId":"5e7093c2878c28a0473b05b9","name":"Emil","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"D6C500D9E288C584067685569D2D2A4A4505B7B8ECB08C9F8DE6C9E083BD0725A73662C60FF9C56EF372495184739630BA8E978F3111ADB772C521C1E624276A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5674-2132","documentHash":"a115f8b5-f55c-448e-ac3b-17cda1622eff"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff35","name":"Anna","lastName":"Śrębowata","uuid":"AE97DDA6B17C879B91FDE0B97F9FF35A88C18420D2D66F823A67C065F8E7AD332A023C5362A275861CBFD3A43CBFD3C1C1152AF3BEB6BDA934DE5DDA8397BD2E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9586-0278","documentHash":"8280839c-0caf-4bf1-88c2-7c08b3f6052d"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea3","name":"Monika","lastName":"Asztemborska","uuid":"FB06FBD85548759213D9EFF8F64A1DDDB4315FCED178453EA389B9D0A36561A476C7D58833851C6B3FF9FDD40217BFD85C757B2EFFF297F8D9CCFB1E38742CD7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7785-5379","documentHash":"455e5b25-4541-4c08-b405-54aba46e3411"}],"objectId":"64105d00409707283642d6f9","publicUri":"https://gazwoda.pl/czasopismo-7-8-2022-lipiec-sierpien/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Zastosowanie katalizatora Pd/γ-Al2O3 do usuwania diklofenaku z wody","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W niniejszej pracy zbadano właściwości katalityczne katalizatorów palladowych, osadzonych na γ-tlenku glinu, w oczyszczaniu wody z diklofenaku.

Currently, there is a lack of experimental tools for a numeric characterization of these defects in samples. Therefore, many structure-property correlations are poorly understood. Here, we report the exploration of the twinning effect on the XRD pattern and its practical application. We developed a new approach focused on the special mutual orientation of periodic fcc segments, domains. Using computational simulations, we found that the more domains, the smaller the height ratio of 220 to 111 diffraction peaks. Knowing this correlation, we performed the XRD bulk morphology and size analysis of Au and AuPt samples. The obtained results were compared with the results of TEM and SAXS analyses.

Here we report incorporating a cost-effective, non-toxic and abundant element, i.e., tin, in elongated semiconducting carbon nitride (g-C3N4). A novel procedure was used to introduce varying amounts of tin to the g-C3N4 framework. The new photocatalysts (Sn-CN) were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and FT-IR measurements, confirming the absence of tin oxide and incorporation of tin in the g-C3N4 backbone. The SEM, EDX, TEM and XPS measurements demonstrated the elongated morphology and the presence of tin in the composite materials. BET measurements showed a relative increase in the specific surface area for the com-posites. The optical measurements showed enhanced solar light absorption and promoted the charge carrier's separation after the insertion of Sn to g-C3N4. Photoelectrochemical water dissociation measurements showed that 10% tin doping increased the activity of g-C3N4 to water photo-oxidation about four times. This improve-ment was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"176","pagesFromTo":"111242","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ae7a8b4097077279b0e80d","6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","64ae7a8b4097077279b0e80e","64ae7a8b4097077279b0e80f","64ae7a8b4097077279b0e810","64ae7a8b4097077279b0e811"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a8","mniswId":"12293","title":"Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids","doi":"10.1016/j.jpcs","issn":"0022-3697","documentHash":"32730c00-531d-47ed-ba42-4686a4d2f6ab"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ae7a8b4097077279b0e80c","year":"2023","volume":"176","documentHash":"e42510da-76fd-4192-adec-355caaf44760"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058723456"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64ae79624097077279b0e07c","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"d074d69b-27e2-4549-bb46-5a69bada77ac"},{"objectId":"63574a29752340623bc01c6b","name":"Vishnu","lastName":"Anilkumar","documentHash":"5188d279-a413-4903-8af2-63154bc519e1"},{"objectId":"629eb829752340212cd272f2","name":"Rohit Dinkar","lastName":"Chavan","uuid":"42A4419351507C5EFF57A56FBFE83E1427C39AFCCFFE11312EE91407D09E063653D764F0C3E0A44E6E077C8C8285F6E7094D1AD7141AAAB755D357F2A203B403","orcidId":"0000-0001-9254-5048","documentHash":"911a2b07-da41-4a94-b31a-c3f1e2ca1b35"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"64ae79624097077279b0e07a","doi":"10.1021/acsphotonics.3c00033","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsphotonics.3c00033","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Understanding the Origin of Light Intensity and Temperature Dependence of Photodetection Properties in a MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> Single-Crystal-Based Photoconductor","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3), which belongs to the larger material family of lead halide perovskites (LHPs), has emerged as a promising semiconductor for the fabrication of single-crystal (SC)-based photodetectors (PDs).

Here, we investigate the impact of different light intensities and temperatures on the photodetection properties of planar-type MAPbBr3 SC-based PD with the help of transient photoresponse and impedance spectroscopy. The light intensity-dependent study revealed that the key performance parameters of PD decrease with increasing irradiation intensity due to changes in charge recombination and carrier lifetime. On the other hand, the detrimental effect of increasing temperature on the performance of PD was found to be related to the ion accumulation, increasing scattering of impurities and phonons, and change in conductivity and band gap rather than the change in charge recombination. This study provides a thorough understanding of the origin of light intensity and temperature-dependent photodetection properties of SC-based PD, which is crucial for the further advancement of optoelectronic devices based on LHPs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629eb829752340212cd272f2","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","63574a29752340623bc01c6b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1424-1433","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622ac2387523402df090302f","63574a29752340623bc01c6b","629eb829752340212cd272f2","64ae79624097077279b0e07c","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dcd","mniswId":"139","title":"ACS Photonics","issn":"2330-4022","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"3e816522-2820-4936-8988-5aa9006bfac5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ae79624097077279b0e07b","year":"2023","volume":"10","number":"5","documentHash":"d78d4ca9-20cd-47ef-8483-ec9318c171e9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058723551"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64ae772c4097077279b0abe8","name":"Mohd Talib","lastName":"Latif","documentHash":"7a0f7389-535a-46b6-aff7-298d423e3412"},{"objectId":"64ae772c4097077279b0abe7","name":"Amir","lastName":"Badieefar","documentHash":"3f3bc95d-ff98-47bb-bffc-26232e967b9d"},{"objectId":"64ae772c4097077279b0abe6","name":"Yones Heydari","lastName":"Shahbaz","documentHash":"80044d7e-8ec6-4be3-bcfd-34351d161e62"},{"objectId":"64ae772c4097077279b0abe5","name":"Adeleh","lastName":"Bayat","documentHash":"892b3998-a78f-4c54-8cf9-d1a53a4257c4"},{"objectId":"64ae772c4097077279b0abe4","name":"Mosayeb","lastName":"Kouhkan","documentHash":"e8a2d2a0-5fa6-4e76-af19-84d688643430"},{"objectId":"64ae772c4097077279b0abe3","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Azizi","documentHash":"e14ba4b1-6be1-4f6a-b773-db6241a15ea2"},{"objectId":"64ae772c4097077279b0abe2","name":"Saeed","lastName":"Shojaee Barjoee","documentHash":"6c5d9b75-8937-4037-a8de-777877039157"},{"objectId":"60c2fc239543c7233654339a","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Alipourfard","uuid":"09F87F13C145EAA33D5D3E392CC52D6627B20E2FB071920A9AC8A55B4EFE06CCFDC635D1FBCFD0C3CE2E997891A272F5A4326A19832587B921FF5E5C935B8BC5","documentHash":"92b7f0ed-674e-4ca5-b512-5aa90affbef8"}],"objectId":"64ae772c4097077279b0abe0","doi":"10.1007/s00244-023-00990-7","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00244-023-00990-7.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Impacts and Analysis of Individual and Social Risks of the Stochastic Emission of Benzene from Floating-Roof Tanks Using Response Surface Analysis and MPACT Model","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the present study, the researchers used an integrated approach composed of response surface analysis (RSM) and MPACT model to predict fatality rates caused by benzene emitted from floating-roof tanks. RSM scenarios were configured in Expert Design (version 7.0) software using the central composite design (CCD) method and five variables of wind speed, relative humidity, atmospheric temperature, failure diameter, and emission height were considered. Continuous Pasquill-Gifford Gaussian model was used to estimate the results of the RSM scenarios. The response values were considered for exposure concentrations above 50 ppm (slight damages), 150 ppm (moderate damage), and 1000 ppm (high damage). The analysis of individual and social risks for each scenario was done using the MPACT model in SAFETI program (version 8.22) by providing two variables of population characteristics and the frequency of tank wall failure. The results showed that atmospheric temperature, wind speed, failure diameter, and emission height have positive effects on the dispersion of the cloud of toxic benzene vapor with a concentration of 1000 ppm. Intolerable individual risk distances were estimated to be lower for indoor environments than for outdoor. Maximum distances of intolerable individual risks for the worst-case scenarios were estimated up to 2500 m from the emission point, which resulted from exposure to a concentration of 1000-ppm benzene. Results regarding the estimation of social risks showed that over 1600 fatalities should be expected under the worst-case scenarios. The three factors of high temperature, low wind speed, and low emission height play a major role in the occurrence of scenarios with the highest fatalities. High wind speed and high emission height were the most important factors in most scenarios with zero fatalities rate. Generally, the findings of this study show the necessity to provide an emergency response plan in the studied industry in both autumn and winter due to low wind speed. However, the coupling of the developed statistical models based on regional meteorological conditions with the MPACT model can help researchers to design an emergency response plan to deal with leakage incidents in petrochemical industries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"84","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"347-367","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ae772c4097077279b0abe2","64ae772c4097077279b0abe3","64ae772c4097077279b0abe4","60c2fc239543c7233654339a","64ae772c4097077279b0abe5","64ae772c4097077279b0abe6","64ae772c4097077279b0abe7","64ae772c4097077279b0abe8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477197","mniswId":"1667","title":"Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology","issn":"0090-4341","eissn":"1432-0703","documentHash":"37ab3cc7-05a4-4962-9b3c-8d7ac030606d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ae772c4097077279b0abe1","year":"2023","volume":"84","number":"3","documentHash":"d0adf680-847d-4a9a-948a-163db6913834"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058723918"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"648861304097072fd7700d49","name":"Sanjay","lastName":"Tiwari","documentHash":"0cbb383c-d67a-47c6-b373-6165d4f84558"},{"objectId":"648861304097072fd7700d48","name":"Ayush","lastName":"Khare","documentHash":"5ab62516-57ca-4119-9de5-4a3c68623249"},{"objectId":"648861304097072fd7700d47","name":"Priyanka","lastName":"Roy","documentHash":"b7734f99-510b-4250-b37d-748939613912"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"}],"objectId":"648861304097072fd7700d45","doi":"10.1002/ente.202300253","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ente.202300253","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Revealing the Role of Band Offsets on the Charge Carrier Dynamics of CsSn<sub>0.5</sub>Ge<sub>0.5</sub>I<sub>3</sub>‐Based Perovskite Solar Cell: A Theoretical Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A computational method using a unidimensional device simulator to theoretically study the CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3-based perovskite solar cell (PSC) is adopted.

The influence of band offset (BO) on the charge carrier dynamics of the PSCs is explained in terms of cliff and spike structures for various levels of conduction band offsets (CBOs) and valence band offsets (VBOs). The ideality factor (IF) is calculated with variable BOs, and its variation with the applied voltage is examined. IF value ranges from 1.95 to 1.55 and 1.57 to 1.51 for different levels of VBO and CBO, respectively. The study on absorber layer thickness is conducted at different levels of BOs, revealing the importance of optimized absorber thickness on the performance of the PSCs. The capacitance-voltage measurements under illumination and in the dark signify the importance of optimized BO on the built-in potential and maximum capacitances of the PSC.

The synthesis process is simple and involves the optical illumination of Zn nanoparticles (Zn(NP)) suspended in water. The concomitant hydrogen (H-2) evolution during synthesis was found to be linear, and it is dependent on the growth of the Zn/ZnO nano interface. The progressively increasing amount of ZnO relative to Zn(NP) was a limiting factor in H-2 evolution. Two different Zn/ZnO nanoscale heterointerfaces were created and samples were extracted at two different stages of the illumination process. The first sample, extracted from the most reactive illumination phase and named Zn(NP)/ZnO-R, had the highest hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate. The second sample, extracted from a less reactive illumination phase and named Zn(NP)/ZnO-S, had a lower HER rate. These in situ (solar light-induced) samples were characterized by XRD, HRTEM, and other methods. The optoelectronic features and the photoelectrochemical (PEC) investigations showed the optimal light-harvesting ability of Zn(NP)/ZnO-R and the effective separation of photoexcited charge carriers, leading to remarkable HER performance. During the visible-light-induced (in situ) conversion of Zn(NP) to Zn(NP)/ZnO-R, a concurrent HER rate of 1115 mu mol h(-1) was observed. Indeed, the photocurrent density value of the Zn(NP)/ZnO-R catalyst is significantly higher than that of Zn(NP)/ZnO-S, pristine Zn(NP), and ZnO. Thus, this study provides new insights into the optimal fabrication of the Zn(NP)/ZnO interface for PEC application with concomitant solar hydrogen generation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6369cd397523405a7dcf5bdc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"47","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"7312-7317","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["643546ab4097074edd6068aa","6369cd397523405a7dcf5bdc","643546ab4097074edd6068ab","643546ab4097074edd6068ac","643546ab4097074edd6068ad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479022","mniswId":"15035","title":"NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY","issn":"1144-0546","eissn":"1369-9261","documentHash":"513cf100-0afd-4286-91d6-389e15f9c0a5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"643546ab4097074edd6068a9","year":"2023","volume":"47","number":"15","documentHash":"d333d44a-fbfa-496a-9eca-b531254f8bad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058726724"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"648864174097072fd7703b98","name":"Alina","lastName":"Sekretareva","documentHash":"f560a590-54a7-4ac6-8adf-02214b5640f4"},{"objectId":"648864174097072fd7703b97","name":"Yocefu","lastName":"Hattori","documentHash":"7f38a02a-52a7-498d-b943-c7f7023e9d3b"},{"objectId":"648864174097072fd7703b96","name":"Onur","lastName":"Parlak","documentHash":"e7823d35-334c-4da0-b340-806d106f9a67"},{"objectId":"648864174097072fd7703b95","name":"Ziwen","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"276884fb-d934-4482-9cf7-919ebe287ebb"},{"objectId":"648864174097072fd7703b94","name":"Sagar","lastName":"Ganguli","documentHash":"531f146d-987f-4aa3-b89e-9b768724b656"},{"objectId":"622036397523402df08c206c","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sa","uuid":"87182E2E0888DA41C757B81B2143E2316665900AFDCDE55D96C088AFA76BAFB6A4F1AA06C4EDA6BD452B1F53C7A1CCDD6A3E7FE74E2E496F4852B0410671F4C6","documentHash":"b4c2efbd-ab85-495c-833b-083d3a9f0f35"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-04-20","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"648864174097072fd7703b92","doi":"10.1002/anie.202302394","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/anie.202302394","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Nano‐Impact Single‐Entity Electrochemistry Enables Plasmon‐Enhanced Electrocatalysis**","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plasmon-enhanced electrocatalysis (PEEC), based on a combination of localized surface plasmon resonance excitation and an electrochemical bias applied to a plasmonic material, can result in improved electrical-to-chemical energy conversion compared to conventional electrocatalysis.

We show that in conventional ensemble measurements, plasmonic effects have minimal impact on photocurrents. We suggest that this is due to the continuous equilibration of the Fermi level (E-F) of the deposited gold nanoparticles with the E-F of the working electrode, leading to fast neutralization of hot carriers by the measuring circuit. The photocurrents detected in the ensemble measurements are primarily caused by photo-induced heating of the supporting electrode material. In SEE, the E-F of suspended gold nanoparticles is unaffected by the working electrode potential. As a result, plasmonic effects are the dominant source of photocurrents under SEE experimental conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"62","issue":"25","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["648864174097072fd7703b94","648864174097072fd7703b95","648864174097072fd7703b96","648864174097072fd7703b97","648864174097072fd7703b98","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477026","mniswId":"1127","title":"Angewandte Chemie.

However, the efforts to create stable and long-lasting conducting polymer electrodes are challenged by biofouling and the physical failure of electrodes. Here, we develop a durable conducting polymer electrode based on EDOT copolymers expressing zwitterionic phosphorylcholine and DOPA moieties, which enable low impedance communication, excellent protein/cell resistance, and long-term stable operation. This antifouling conducting PEDOT electrode shows much enhanced interfacial adhesion with substrates and cohesion in water than all the other tested PEDOT conducting polymers. Its wet lap shear strength with substrates is three times higher than the pristine PEDOT; it can tolerate 20 h of sonication treatment in water, while the three control PEDOT electrodes all start to collapse within minutes. We further find that the antifouling PEDOT can tightly integrate with diverse substrates (Au, ITO, and stainless steel); this strengthening approach works effectively for all the tested three hydrophilic PEDOTs. We finally demonstrate the robustness of the antifouling PEDOT on a homemade electrode array with a not compromised impedance after being electrically stimulated in the physiological environment for 24 h."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e70940c878c28a0473b56a9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"621","pagesFromTo":"156902","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["643557a44097074edd61759c","643557a44097074edd61759d","643557a44097074edd61759e","643557a44097074edd61759f","643557a44097074edd6175a0","643557a44097074edd6175a1","643557a44097074edd6175a2","643557a44097074edd6175a3","643557a44097074edd6175a4","643557a44097074edd6175a5","5e70940c878c28a0473b56a9","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","643557a44097074edd6175a6","643557a44097074edd6175a7","643557a44097074edd6175a8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477156","mniswId":"1525","title":"Applied Surface Science","issn":"0169-4332","eissn":"0169-4332","documentHash":"798a2408-defa-4d93-ad47-c74137d35e37"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"643557a44097074edd61759b","year":"2023","volume":"621","documentHash":"cef2ace8-64ae-40fa-950b-615e8914aa3e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058732954"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6437bd644097076ac7d5d3c9","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Palczewski","documentHash":"908ba6b2-41b9-49e0-8655-a21e48a0a726"},{"objectId":"5f506a07752340073806a8cb","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Palczewska","uuid":"7463CF4AFEE35F5F88F8DFBF15A151D01376CCF46F3113D7C53A2CB7B0495C80005BA0AD3E199570AFD5607EA1E0312E06990084E4900B0C4F0DD8A7F910D350","documentHash":"f8d2cff6-c8a3-41e5-bb86-498b310731e8"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Wojtkowski","uuid":"72C7EFD6AE3C0FF6AB46F559605ACE983360A4E4C03769BB1C4D0D72A5671C8A9CF4B7F1DF377F7E2D985ACB38C7A2EE1DA60B3BE1A843F188600A590E526E53","orcidId":"0000-0003-0599-0878","documentHash":"380243f1-4e56-4426-bead-5a7a8a484819"}],"objectId":"6437bd644097076ac7d5d3c7","doi":"10.1016/j.preteyeres.2023.101170","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1350946223000095?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"From mouse to human: Accessing the biochemistry of vision in vivo by two-photon excitation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The eye is an ideal organ for imaging by a multi-photon excitation approach, because ocular tissues such as sclera, cornea, lens and neurosensory retina, are highly transparent to infrared (IR) light. The interface between the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is especially informative, because it reflects the health of visual (retinoid) cycle and its changes in response to external stress, genetic manipulations, and drug treatments. Vitamin A-derived retinoids, like retinyl esters, are natural fluorophores that respond to multi-photon excitation with near IR light, bypassing the filter-like properties of the cornea, lens, and macular pigments. Also, during natural aging some retinoids form bisretinoids, like diretinoid-pyridiniumethanolamine (A2E), that are highly fluorescent. These bisretinoids appear to be elevated concurrently with aging. Vitamin A-derived retinoids and bisretinoidss are detected by two-photon ophthalmoscopy (2PO), using a new class of light sources with adjustable spatial, temporal, and spectral properties. Furthermore, the two-photon (2P) absorption of IR light the visual pigments in rod and cone photoreceptors can initiate visual transduction by cis-trans isomerization retinal, enabling parallel functional studies.

At the same time, the STS nanoparticles exhibited high photon absorption and low quantum yield potentials, making them a possible candidate for photovoltaic cells and enhanced photoelectrochemical performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"299","pagesFromTo":"127456","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["643d3596409707219a50155b","6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","643d3596409707219a50155c","643d3596409707219a50155d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d8b","mniswId":"13972","title":"Materials Chemistry and Physics","issn":"0254-0584","eissn":"0254-0584","websiteLink":"http://www.elsevier.com/locate/matchemphys","documentHash":"3faf2b20-40af-4e76-9bed-955b4f95f3ba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f32cb2409707703559579c","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"299","documentHash":"3b7e99ce-6b51-40ba-a68d-810aba20afa8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Orthorhombic phase","Silver tin sulfide","Nanoparticles","Oleylamine","Dodecanethiol","Optical bandgap"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058743278"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643facc34097073cb69956e3","name":"Ariel","lastName":"Meyra","documentHash":"230066c0-a0e2-42ef-aee5-c91645014093"},{"objectId":"643facc34097073cb69956e2","name":"Andres","lastName":"De Virgiliis","documentHash":"e764c83e-dc9e-4953-aa41-7e95ab2aba00"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff21","name":"Marek","lastName":"Litniewski","uuid":"9AD3E3D3C77BF3C4432B814DCD0B0241149CB64041774EB85580C14B4EEEC98A826ED751C1A75EA66AC21430A6EC3AAA7050A1402282D55BC344486D1CC16296","orcidId":"0000-0002-0148-1809","documentHash":"bdfdda6a-df41-4ccf-b38f-d0fe36b44046"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","name":"Alina","lastName":"Ciach","uuid":"520AD5EF74AF15FA81FB18147E92D695E358B38A5F90389DF9A11C3C3623C0214250CFB548E34846D53DBA21ED79955D9F88250356F8AFEBD6A696B7263A658B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5556-401X","documentHash":"630645e8-c7ee-4652-a5a0-a0da6ec79d79"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"643facc34097073cb69956e1","doi":"10.3390/molecules28031366","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/3/1366/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Pattern Formation in Two-Component Monolayers of Particles with Competing Interactions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Competing interactions between charged inclusions in membranes of living organisms or charged nanoparticles in near-critical mixtures can lead to self-assembly into various patterns.

Stability of the low-temperature ordered patterns was verified by Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for a continuous model with interactions having similar features, but a larger range and lower strength than in the lattice model. Interactions with and without symmetry between different components were assumed. We investigated both the conglomerate formed in the center of a thin slit with repulsive walls, and the structure of a monolayer adsorbed at an attractive substrate. Both models give the same patterns for large chemical potentials or densities. For low densities, more patterns occur in the lattice model. Different phases coexist with dilute gas on the lattice and in the continuum, leading to different patterns in self-assembled conglomerates ('rafts')."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff21"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1366","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","643facc34097073cb69956e2","643facc34097073cb69956e3","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff21"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"c7ce6337-4158-4738-bc63-b621bf837311"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d7970f4097074c7425f580","year":"2023","volume":"28","number":"3","documentHash":"221ce8c1-d265-4ea9-b8fb-c855d92954f2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["molecular modeling","thermodynamic Casimir potential","pattern formation","mixture of charged particles","competing interactions","self-assembly"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058746487"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64a550b24097077a61350548","name":"Siva","lastName":"Umapathy","documentHash":"317e1060-bfb3-47ed-b70b-a9a048d6154a"},{"objectId":"622187b87523402df08ca588","name":"Om","lastName":"Prakash","uuid":"9F77E8664F7E7F7CAD9663FC7D83E551C4711B547EFEE2F6763722BF86CC2555A7BADDAE54BE73B11A769623900F7B71172629FA2F8B93EDE8737A74CE09E392","orcidId":"0000-0003-1134-0847","documentHash":"fe4a36fa-edc2-44e7-8cfd-b621ee1db04c"}],"objectId":"64a550b24097077a61350546","doi":"10.1063/5.0142702","publicUri":"https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0142702","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Raman spectroscopy study of CdS nanorods and strain induced by the adsorption of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, near- and off-resonance Raman spectra of cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum rods (NRs) and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) adsorbed CdS NRs are reported. The envelopes of characteristic optical phonon modes in the near-resonance Raman spectrum of CdS NRs are deconvoluted by following the phonon confinement model. As compared with off-resonant Raman spectra, optical phonon modes scattering cross section is amplified significantly in near-resonance Raman spectra through the Frohlich interaction. The Huang-Rhys factor defining the strength of the Frohlich interaction is estimated (similar to 0.468). Moreover, the adsorption of different concentrations of 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) onto CdS NRs produces surface strain in CdS NRs originating due to surface reconstruction and consequently blue and red shifts in off-resonance (514.5 nm) Raman spectra depending on the concentration of 4-MBA. These consequences are attributed to compressive and tensile strains, respectively. Relative to bulk CdS powder as the reference, strain in CdS NRs increases with decreasing 4-MBA concentrations.

Herein, we report the synthesis of [Ni{S2P(OH)(4-CH3OC6H4)}(2)] (1), [Fe{S2P(OH)(4-CH3OC6H4)}(3)] (2) and [Co{S2P(OC4H9)(4-CH3OC6H4)}(3)] (3) and their utilization to form Ni2P, Fe-Ni2P and Co-Ni2P in a solvent-less pyrolysis method. This solvent-free protocol involved the decomposition of complex (1) and the composites of complex (1) with (2) or (3) in the presence of triphenylphosphine (TPP) at 400 degrees C for one hour. The solvent-less decomposition of complex (1) without TPP formed nickel sulfide. A plausible explanation for this rare fabrication of pristine and doped Ni2P in the absence of any solvent is suggested. All the transition metal doped phosphides improved the HER performance of pristine Ni2P, with the 5 % Fe doped Ni2P having the best performance, requiring 137 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2). Similarly, the OER performance of un-doped Ni2P was improved by all the doped Ni2P catalysts, where 10 % Fe-doped Ni2P showed the best performance requiring 326 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA/cm(2).

MIP-based electrochemical sensors are versatile as they can be devised for different food contaminants. They offer simplicity in terms of sensor preparation and measurement and cost-efficiency. These sensors' affinity to target analytes is often high. In effect, the number of publications reporting MIP electrochemical chemosensors for food safety and quality monitoring applications has significantly increased.

Accordingly, studying modification strategies and interfacial interaction mechanisms is crucial. In this review, the current progress in the development and photocatalytic fundamentals of OIHPs is summarized. Furthermore, the structural modification strategies of OIHPs, including dimensionality control, heterojunction design, encapsulation techniques, and so on for the enhancement of charge-carrier transfer and the enlargement of long-term stability, are elucidated. Subsequently, the interfacial mechanisms and charge-carrier dynamics of OIHPs during the photocatalytic process are systematically specified and classified via diverse photophysical and electrochemical characterization methods, such as time-resolved photoluminescence measurements, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements, transient photocurrent densities, and so forth.

Using flow cytometry, it was possible to compare the frequency of cells before and after lymphocyte treatment. Real-time PCR was used to assess the gene expression levels of transcription factors, cytokines, and microRNAs. ELISA method was used to evaluate the level of secretion of cytokines in the serum. Primary evaluation of the immune profile between healthy controls and RPL cases showed a higher frequency of Th17, NK, B cells and a lower frequency of Treg cells in RPL cases. Also, pro-inflammatory cytokines showed increased expression at mRNA and protein levels in the RPL group in comparison with the control group. Whereas, anti-inflammatory cytokines showed decreased expression in RPL patients. Decreased and increased frequency of Th17 and Treg lymphocytes observed in RPL cases following LIT, respectively. The same results obtained for ROR & gamma;t and FoxP3 mRNA expression as transcription factor of Th17 and Treg cells, respectively. NK cell cytotoxicity decreased after LIT in RPL patients. miR-326a and miR-155 expression after LIT reduced, but miR-146a and miR-10a expression increased in RPL instances. LIT in RPL cases causes to elevation and modulation of anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines.

Nanozymes with peroxidase-like activities are prospective candidates for applications in biosensors. The purpose of the current work is to develop cholesterol oxidase-based amperometric bionanosensors using novel nanocomposites as peroxidase (HRP) mimetics. To select the most electroactive chemosensor on hydrogen peroxide, a wide range of nanomaterials were synthesized and characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry. Pt NPs were deposited on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) in order to improve the conductivity and sensitivity of the nanocomposites. The most HRP-like active bi-metallic CuFe nanoparticles (nCuFe) were placed on a previously nano-platinized electrode, followed by conjugation of cholesterol oxidase (ChOx) in a cross-linking film formed by cysteamine and glutaraldehyde. The constructed nanostructured bioelectrode ChOx/nCuFe/nPt/GCE was characterized by CV and chronoamperometry in the presence of cholesterol. The bionanosensor (ChOx/nCuFe/nPt/GCE) shows a high sensitivity (3960 A·M−1·m−2) for cholesterol, a wide linear range (2–50 µM) and good storage stability at a low working potential (−0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl/3 M KCl). The constructed bionanosensor was tested on a real serum sample. A detailed comparative analysis of the bioanalytical characteristics of the developed cholesterol bionanosensor and the known analogs is presented."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"315","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64df5a4a409707264ca14294","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","64df5a4a409707264ca14295","64df5a4a409707264ca14296","64df5a4a409707264ca14297","64df5a4a409707264ca14298"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c837","mniswId":"11176","title":"Journal of Functional Biomaterials","issn":"2079-4983","eissn":"2079-4983","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"28044081-d747-4686-ace7-97f466a7e3bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64df5a4a409707264ca14293","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"6","documentHash":"b938c89d-2474-4a1a-8d0e-ffd3854818db"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058807859"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fe839543c72336543828","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Pielach","uuid":"E060F0C13AA2A9E4D92F5FE0A9940220C1433A865A0FFC4E7EA776D9427BE30895DFC20A20B173679C837B679E5D7899F6136654328947FA96A1F4B0439074F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6849-1980","documentHash":"b2f527ea-9a6e-4f11-8786-677ced7c0873"},{"objectId":"6041f4369543c711bc6ea921","name":"Michał","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"E6399028E8A1A40FDA3839B478AEA6D612EA8757C31D99B5B75C4FCA872E23897B8A928D521E2D8E898BA1507132FEC69543C6462A3C4C04E7FFE6C3A0622E59","documentHash":"8f391ff4-a08a-43b0-987c-02930318183d"},{"objectId":"5e7094d9878c28a0473c538f","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Bartosewicz","uuid":"FBAB4CFDF2CB13525FB6992273EDB47FBC454B94A1285E9035BADEE842EA07F963287A782506DEA48F4265177F11708EB45D8016D3964F63312070D7AECBAC67","orcidId":"0000-0002-8053-6563","documentHash":"08d3d073-3fbc-4f7f-a62b-d8e4c37d5148"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c1779","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wojciechowski","uuid":"347F796AB5AA5944D649A812495082FF53B50C1D9A3D04B9A0DE2209BB7FFDF4854509DBC2B5F5AF3A3BC5B412E682F74445C97F2255DFFD5E0ED940766668E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-6424-988X","documentHash":"85c48b98-1027-4a01-8418-18e922f49a4e"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c59","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Chodorow","uuid":"B8D70AD84045E94B86A7278E58E105CFB7165649D813CDB1E74085278094D46AA0EAF51AAC095BF4C86A876BED717141F2D03BA900BA03D1C72AA978928F21BA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8875-4605","documentHash":"9d5a9ed1-1383-45f9-a1b3-973a2e90fa20"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Stepanenko","uuid":"BF57EE64971811A251374C75A08A64C7DC048997A86A87460BCC2CC8BC9E96C9DFF7EC1C40B0754A465BB2A8216565AC2EACDC66EAAA2EAAD983E233DEA89728","orcidId":"0000-0001-9919-4447","documentHash":"5f260202-2f2b-402d-83ac-ff29415a756b"},{"objectId":"5e7093ca878c28a0473b0d0f","name":"BOGUSZ","lastName":"STĘPAK","uuid":"E5D2D3575E0ACC0327761351EE80936AE8C409CCD1D9AF66FE355B6D630274557B51ABBDC7089FF380219AE25310A29213C94F67A73B91E443D2A87243055045","orcidId":"0000-0002-3414-7479","documentHash":"2cd2e4af-6224-4d55-9409-75e147bc8d4c"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a04739978b","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Wachulak","uuid":"53A4655696D0CA1A919D5FD98913CC448EB4DFE9A07586D9A10CCDD0880C59D578B732EEDCDA4390232EBB1C13A9CEF73D254EF31EBE60933B18B04FD3620E25","orcidId":"0000-0001-9853-7946","documentHash":"823a2e9d-c591-42ff-8b95-ac135e4a20d1"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399781","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Nyga","uuid":"204B64A871F2F24BFDC34709BD909D458BFF5BCC026FFAB47D0C8AF4862D987C04E698C90FABF3A51B31BA45EE486F028E31502A0548658BE2BB71EAF0403AC8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7591-7142","documentHash":"98468328-50f5-4a9b-aa92-e7c1538925d7"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"64c12e574097070a0ea576ff","doi":"10.1117/12.2621580","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2621580","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Femtosecond laser modification of plasmonic color and diffuse reflectance of semicontinuous aluminum film-insulator-metal mirror structures","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plasmonic nanostructures can efficiently absorb and scatter light, and thus exhibit vibrant colors. Colors originate from the excitation of plasmon resonances – collective oscillations of free electrons in metallic nanoparticles. Semicontinuous metal films (SMF) are a special type of disordered plasmonic structures that can be mass-produced in a rather inexpensive physical vapor deposition process. SMFs are comprised of random in their nature nano-island structures of various sizes and shapes resonating at different wavelengths. When irradiated with high-intensity laser radiation, the nanostructures can be locally modified. Spatially local restructuring originates from highly localized SMF absorption of light in hotspots, regions of a high local electric field. Thus, the optical response of the film can be altered in a spectrally selective manner. Hence, locally different colors are obtained. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of structural plasmonic colors through femtosecond laser-induced modification of thin semicontinuous aluminum films deposited on an aluminum mirror coated with an isolator layer. The structures show vivid colors in reflection. The effects of laser parameters on final color are explored. In addition, we report laser-induced control of diffuse reflectance of aluminum SMF structures. Self-passivation effect of aluminum results in the long-term stability of generated colors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e3","uid":"bWAncCFOOFggrGtc2DIwFog","uuid":"5ffa91bd-7336-4c07-959e-0d3f198f1d5a","name":"Instytut Optoelektroniki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d9878c28a0473c538f","6041f4369543c711bc6ea921","5e7092a1878c28a04739978b","5e7092a1878c28a047399781"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","60c2fe839543c72336543828"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ad878c28a0473c1779"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c59"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12131","pagesFromTo":"121310W-1 -

Ethylene glycol and periodic acid, both in their neutral forms, have been studied as noble substrate representatives in model reactions. The proposed reaction mechanism has been constructed based on and compared with previously published experimental kinetic, spectroscopic and temperature and pH-dependent studies. In the presented theoretical mechanistic considerations, four alternative molecular transformations have been analyzed from thermodynamic and kinetic points of view. Theoretically, the predicted activation energy barriers have been compared with experimental ones published elsewhere. The presented minimum energy pathway (MEP) unveiled the shape and conformation of the intermediate and transition state structures. The three-step reaction process involves the formation of a seven-membered quasi-ring assisted by an intramolecular hydrogen-bond intermediate structure forming one I–O bond (IC1_B), a cyclic ester intermediate forming two I–O bonds (IC2_C) and the final products formed at the two very last stages (HIO3, water and two formaldehyde molecules). The computed and energetically the most favourable reaction landscape proposed in this work uniforms and refines the mechanistic proposition given by Criegee for Malaprade type of reactions and further gives a detailed molecular understanding of the reaction rate and atomic connections en route the transformation. The molecular geometries of all stationary points (intermediate and transition state structures) lying on the potential energy hypersurface have been optimized at the four alternative DFT levels under the solvation model based on the density approximation: B3PW91, CAM-B3LYP, BMK, ωB97XD. The 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set for C, O, and H atoms and both the full (DGDZVP) and Ahlrichs-Weigend1 (def2-TZVP) basis sets for iodine atoms were used during the computations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The process utilizes pre-existing trap states within the semiconductorbandgap and involves three-photon absorption."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"27","pagesFromTo":"6255-6262","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ccacb54097074f2a27abb9","64ccacb54097074f2a27abba","64ccacb54097074f2a27abbb","64ccacb54097074f2a27abbc","64ccacb54097074f2a27abbd","64ccacb54097074f2a27abbe","64ccacb54097074f2a27abbf","64ccacb54097074f2a27abc0","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a3","mniswId":"12287","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters","eissn":"1948-7185","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"868f238f-25e2-43ac-a736-3e6a988a7e56"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ccace74097074f2a27c41c","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"27","doi":"","documentHash":"59a693e4-e11b-4fcd-a931-4b0aa7cd6a45"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058843747"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64d5ecc84097077cfae37d26","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Klepacka","documentHash":"6547d257-ecc3-466a-8ec8-e8080cf1a164"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd731","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Mazuryk","uuid":"13E0776D85F660DFE6F558DB5092FBA48757B9E5DB73994F3411CF9370C853106C4A86CAA57E4B9E1A04EF1C0434630A3B28C0DF688A9437A1F7BA74E6A6A99F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3311-7136","documentHash":"6c940586-7919-4ad1-b09e-524f950719a8"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","name":"Piyush","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"E13DBE297A73F2ACA1DA7F32D373EDA5FB882AC5C4DDE593B81140BAD5BD6DA80677830414B610AFC144957EF4E20FF1A8CC4A4F5367FEC382ACC689DAE8CD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-7729-8314","documentHash":"d3733567-ec08-40ae-9d79-439c8d659f9e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Kutner","uuid":"4DB1E113A4C8683FB6BC69134920B86E44C946E3D21F32F5F6CE1483179976E11B16608F3E02B532633CFF5B5216E4C96C7B94090438FDEA74135F1AE4F3BCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-5170","documentHash":"71f3755a-d420-46be-bb05-d5ea4b0bfa7c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"64d5ecc84097077cfae37d24","doi":"10.1021/acs.est.3c01269","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.est.3c01269","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Glyphosate Separating and Sensing for Precision Agriculture and Environmental Protection in the Era of Smart Materials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present articlecritically and comprehensively reviews themost recent reports on smart sensors for determining glyphosate (GLP),an active agent of GLP-based herbicides (GBHs) traditionally usedin agriculture over the past decades.

The model parameters were selected such that the system has a stable limit cycle and several distinct, discrete Turing patterns characterized by stationary concentrations at the nodes. In our interpretation, oscillations represent a blank memory unit, and Turing patterns code information. The considered memory can preserve information on one of six different symbols. The time evolution of the nodes was individually controlled by the inflow of ATP. We demonstrate that information can be written with a simple and short perturbation of the inflow. The perturbation applies to only one or two nodes, and it is symbol specific. The memory can be erased with identical inflow perturbation applied to all nodes. The presented idea of pattern-coded memory applies to other reaction networks that allow for discrete Turing patterns.

While there are numerous existing methods to facilitate their large-scale production, most face limitations, particularly in achieving reproducible processes and minimizing undesirable impurities. Common issues are varying particle sizes and aggregates with unfavorable spectral properties. Researchers are currently developing methods to separate or modify nanoparticle sizes and shapes post-synthesis and to eliminate impurities. One promising approach involves laser light irradiation and enables the changing of nanoparticle sizes and shapes while controlling crucial spectral parameters. In this work, we present a novel extension of this method by irradiating nanoparticle colloids with variable-wavelength nanosecond laser pulses on both sides of the extinction band. Our results demonstrate the use of gradual laser wavelength tuning to optimize the photothermal reshaping of gold nanorods and achieve precise control over the plasmon resonance band. By irradiating both sides of the plasmon resonance band, we execute a multistep tuning process, controlling the band's width and spectral position. A statistical analysis of SEM images reveals differences in the nanorod morphology when irradiated on the long- or short-wavelength side of the plasmon resonance band. The fine-tuning of plasmonic spectral properties is desirable for various applications, including the development of sensors and filters and the exploitation of the photothermal effect. The findings of this study can be extended to other plasmonic nanostructures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709490878c28a0473bf957","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b","621ee4b97523402df08b9726"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"5","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"3697-3704","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["621ee4b97523402df08b9726","64d627954097077cfae5d932","5e709490878c28a0473bf957","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f137","mniswId":"27874","title":"Nanoscale Advances","issn":"2516-0230","eissn":"2516-0230","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"570db27f-5279-4051-a072-5b0db028519c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64d627954097077cfae5d931","year":"2023","volume":"5","number":"14","documentHash":"523b745d-09e2-427a-b4bd-1478c531fcf5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058861624"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373b5","name":"Seyed Mohsen","lastName":"Aghaei-Zarch","documentHash":"07ca2853-e7e9-4999-9d12-ec611117a802"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373b4","name":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Talebi","documentHash":"12f7a2cf-1448-4387-bd7c-9afe2760f955"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373b3","name":"Kambiz","lastName":"Kalhor","documentHash":"c011eb8c-9491-4460-a772-ddb762019e0a"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373b2","name":"Jamal","lastName":"Majidpoor","documentHash":"737eae08-bcfa-4cdf-beb3-049702552183"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373b1","name":"Mehdi","lastName":"Jahani","documentHash":"45f86e55-32e5-4d99-b9c2-f9dd194303c0"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373b0","name":"Saman","lastName":"Karamipour","documentHash":"342c0924-a0cc-406a-965e-1969b69ed3a2"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373af","name":"Marzieh","lastName":"Zamany","documentHash":"3cddc7b6-00a8-4a49-9b7b-4ee781a722f3"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373ae","name":"Saameh","lastName":"Sanaaee","documentHash":"e7bb4ac0-be23-480c-81fc-9aac5d1d4d49"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373ad","name":"Sajad","lastName":"Najafi","documentHash":"17bb6ee5-a5f8-4905-8a08-138eda1c2ade"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373ac","name":"Amir","lastName":"Salami Naseriyan","documentHash":"3d3252bb-85a4-4e4d-8a05-036f28437e75"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373ab","name":"Negin","lastName":"Shahbakhti","documentHash":"5946422d-19a5-44ad-a338-5c5b3933a52b"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373aa","name":"Leila Bahari","lastName":"Khasraghi","documentHash":"b4f7b30e-fd3c-4517-bbdd-5f408def592b"},{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373a9","name":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Fardi","documentHash":"3ff27535-73ca-46d5-90ef-1b232738e648"},{"objectId":"60c2fc239543c7233654339a","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Alipourfard","uuid":"09F87F13C145EAA33D5D3E392CC52D6627B20E2FB071920A9AC8A55B4EFE06CCFDC635D1FBCFD0C3CE2E997891A272F5A4326A19832587B921FF5E5C935B8BC5","documentHash":"92b7f0ed-674e-4ca5-b512-5aa90affbef8"}],"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373a7","doi":"10.1016/j.diabres.2023.110739","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0168822723005028?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"An interplay between non-coding RNAs and gut microbiota in human health","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Humans have a complicated symbiotic relationship with their gut microbiome, which is postulated to impact host health and disease broadly. Epigenetic alterations allow host cells to regulate gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. The gut microbiome, offering environmental hints, can influence responses to stimuli by host cells with modifications on their epigenome and gene expression. Recent increasing data suggest that regulatory non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, circular RNAs, and long lncRNA) may affect host-microbe interactions. These RNAs have been suggested as potential host response biomarkers in microbiome-associated disorders, including diabetes and cancer. This article reviews the current understanding of the interplay between gut microbiota and non-coding RNA, including lncRNA, miRNA, and circular RNA. This can lead to a profound understanding of human disease and influence therapy. Furthermore, microbiome engineering as a mainstream strategy for improving human health has been discussed and confirms the hypothesis about a direct cross-talk between microbiome composition and non-coding RNA."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"201","pagesFromTo":"110739","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64d5ea904097077cfae373a9","64d5ea904097077cfae373aa","64d5ea904097077cfae373ab","64d5ea904097077cfae373ac","64d5ea904097077cfae373ad","64d5ea904097077cfae373ae","60c2fc239543c7233654339a","64d5ea904097077cfae373af","64d5ea904097077cfae373b0","64d5ea904097077cfae373b1","64d5ea904097077cfae373b2","64d5ea904097077cfae373b3","64d5ea904097077cfae373b4","64d5ea904097077cfae373b5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477944","mniswId":"5019","title":"Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice","issn":"0168-8227","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2ef4dae3-c84e-4764-8988-c8065860c752"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64d5ea904097077cfae373a8","year":"2023","volume":"201","documentHash":"4c632188-0304-4bb7-aeb6-629f41af04a3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058861959"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c9f","name":"Florian","lastName":"Hollfelder","documentHash":"c5bf3426-82aa-44af-9b84-226249b876f0"},{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c9e","name":"Sarah A.","lastName":"Teichmann","documentHash":"bb2b9267-16d7-4e1c-b149-8b8224b56854"},{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c9d","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zernicka-Goetz","documentHash":"6e005447-bcb3-41f0-98a5-d7fe2a5a2585"},{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c9c","name":"Gregory M.","lastName":"Findlay","documentHash":"56a6185b-3f5f-4105-8e19-f13e53bf277b"},{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c9b","name":"Charlotte E.","lastName":"Handford","documentHash":"135f1e7f-0d82-4f1f-a223-4dbc7340e7b7"},{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c9a","name":"Gianluca","lastName":"Amadei","documentHash":"64e855a6-f6d4-45e9-b144-cfe585914805"},{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c99","name":"Timo N.","lastName":"Kohler","documentHash":"c362c549-c608-47a8-a375-1b417a554fdd"},{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c98","name":"Anna L.","lastName":"Ellermann","documentHash":"b101f285-d296-45c8-92e3-cb41ac4ee6b6"},{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c96","name":"David B.","lastName":"Morse","documentHash":"f43d6f2a-16c2-4c66-99c0-08b03e21d827"},{"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c95","name":"Joachim","lastName":"De Jonghe","documentHash":"bacf1194-69ee-4cb3-b13e-1ea6ca3167da"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Tabaka","uuid":"63697FD3BAC09928F64280F5418390BE3D248F95AC2532A406A81FFDA2B3351C3C89A72952149CCABF5343B29938E60A387ABB4069187BF56A4F9F7573805C11","documentHash":"ceceaf5b-e17d-4fcf-8907-5fa306db3dfe"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff80","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kamiński","uuid":"FE07BAB15185E0FC18DFB07F15844D2535EBC6E3A6A9B646A718EE81D87044E7505E2E074FBBF745B874D9279A06E0CEDDB8D0812AA3AA84C992CA3632B9AF8C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5124-4548","documentHash":"34f39134-4dbc-4454-ab5b-ad296ad73cb0"}],"objectId":"64e5e3be409707485e791c94","doi":"10.1038/s41467-023-40322-w","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40322-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"spinDrop: a droplet microfluidic platform to maximise single-cell sequencing information content","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Droplet microfluidics enables high-throughput single-cell sequencing, but often with increased noise. Here the authors report spinDrop (sorting picoinjection inDrop) to increase gene detection and reduce noise; they use this to generate a high-quality molecular atlas of mouse brain development.\n\nDroplet microfluidic methods have massively increased the throughput of single-cell sequencing campaigns. The benefit of scale-up is, however, accompanied by increased background noise when processing challenging samples and the overall RNA capture efficiency is lower. These drawbacks stem from the lack of strategies to enrich for high-quality material or specific cell types at the moment of cell encapsulation and the absence of implementable multi-step enzymatic processes that increase capture. Here we alleviate both bottlenecks using fluorescence-activated droplet sorting to enrich for droplets that contain single viable cells, intact nuclei, fixed cells or target cell types and use reagent addition to droplets by picoinjection to perform multi-step lysis and reverse transcription. Our methodology increases gene detection rates fivefold, while reducing background noise by up to half. We harness these properties to deliver a high-quality molecular atlas of mouse brain development, despite starting with highly damaged input material, and provide an atlas of nascent RNA transcription during mouse organogenesis. Our method is broadly applicable to other droplet-based workflows to deliver sensitive and accurate single-cell profiling at a reduced cost."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff80"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64e5e3be409707485e791c95","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff80","64e5e3be409707485e791c96","5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","64e5e3be409707485e791c98","64e5e3be409707485e791c99","64e5e3be409707485e791c9a","64e5e3be409707485e791c9b","64e5e3be409707485e791c9c","64e5e3be409707485e791c9d","64e5e3be409707485e791c9e","64e5e3be409707485e791c9f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f7e","mniswId":"14814","title":"Nature Communications","issn":"2041-1723","eissn":"2041-1723","documentHash":"e40c6952-ce52-4407-9db9-d138811afced"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fb7a924097070abf6baa05","year":"2023","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"fe865c37-e3db-4018-9d45-5ce1bd87e54e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058871412"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66053661409707626335f09c","name":"Renata","lastName":"Solarska","documentHash":"65aff079-2eeb-42b4-8b62-e44c3ee228c5"},{"objectId":"66053661409707626335f09b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bieńkowski","documentHash":"c9527b28-caf9-4e36-b622-e79741b8def1"},{"objectId":"602e326c9543c7410626ee4e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gurgul","uuid":"7E4181ADA4B04C2228F357DA46F7466EA1ACA51683982F36F6E489C4DEC17BD1B07959525DEEDA3ABDDB81146461B7E2E2F72D41EB9DCD22CFC287AEE7CCF517","documentHash":"7e666d35-7828-4257-890b-7a3319302f56"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":"D0CA32E93E9BF9AA7A1FA0E9572784496A92D9583AD152770FB1A36E4763F14D4F58D56CE4A4D42AD08B96A41754B831979DEF89310D2583C4D0AAFD7906703A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5241-9610","documentHash":"abd02632-13c5-4997-8d0a-0ccb66df4ef4"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pisarek","uuid":"394C70A4B68190862754D0C9C71B0CB236E956007955224514CD5CC84EABBD07900FBD9AC8AACDBDD5E542D5CC809EC02A9E49AFFB1DCA527F248F357949EFB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7424-5954","documentHash":"f7a53170-9e7f-4afd-bea7-cb1ef6322bc6"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"},{"objectId":"5e709319878c28a0473a2ca1","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Zaraska","uuid":"4A3DF05AD74F1EF9A8FA62E81349DBFD230E5B06F3F429358B08164F4710A8B4A730D28D12BBC08C69120945FDAB052DE2EF88883065BD45A7F72D75C78FF99E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5330-7191","documentHash":"423652a9-54f9-4f62-9137-3653290ceb2d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"64edb1f74097076b095fe5cc","doi":"10.1021/acsanm.3c01278","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/epdf/10.1021/acsanm.3c01278","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Plasma-assisted N-doped $TiO_2$ nanotube array as an active UV–vis photoanode","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work shows the possibility of using plasma nitridingunderultra-high-vacuum conditions to introduce nitrogen into a titaniumdioxide structure in the form of nanotubes with a diameter of about110 nm. Nanotubes were produced by the anodic oxidation of Ti foilin a solution based on glycerine and water with the addition of ammoniumfluoride at a voltage of 25 V. Based on experimental evidence obtainedby X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, in situ), it has been shownthat alternating nitriding and annealing processes at 450 degrees Cleads to formation of Ti-N-O, Ti-N, and Ti-O-N chemical bonds in theTiO(2) crystal structure (anatase). The observed changeswere identified as interstitial or substitutional admixtures or variationsof these. The spectrophotometric and spectrophotoelectrochemical testsperformed showed that the photoactivity of the photoanodes doped withnitrogen and annealed at 450 degrees C in the UV-vis range wassignificantly greater than that of the photoanodes without nitrogen.The highest maximum photocurrent density, of about 30.0 mu A center dot cm(-2) at a wavelength of lambda = 350 nm, was obtainedfor the double-nitrided and once-annealed sample, where nitrogen wasmainly incorporated in the interstitial positions in the TiO2 lattice. For the materials not nitrided as well as annealed onlyat 450 degrees C and pristine, the worse photoresponse was receivedat the levels of similar to 16 and similar to 0.2 mu A center dot cm(-2), respectively. The thermo-chemical treatment applied also effectivelyextended the operational range of the photoanodes toward visible light,where a wide maximum of light absorption was observed from similar to 400to similar to 700 nm, with a maximum wavelength of 550 nm and an estimatedbandgap energy of 2.5 eV. Our investigations confirmed that photoelectrochemical(PEC) performance for TiO2 NT-based photoanodes was achievedby the optimum annealing condition and concentration of nitrogen,where the narrowed bandgap was observed by generating a new N 2p energylevel above the O 2p valence band. The following research techniqueswere used to identify the changes taking place in the materials produced:XPS spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, PEC measurements, X-raydiffraction structural measurements, and scanning electron microscopicobservations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709319878c28a0473a2ca1","602e326c9543c7410626ee4e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"10351-10364","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66053661409707626335f09b","66053661409707626335f09c","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","5e709319878c28a0473a2ca1","602e326c9543c7410626ee4e","5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f09c","mniswId":"27715","title":"ACS Applied Nano Materials","eissn":"2574-0970","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"43067aba-9151-4182-a5b9-b3e23bfa1c6a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058874577"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff4e","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Ogończyk","uuid":"76DF3FCD414DC97E8654AA365FCF793BC52279EF048401A6818F83E70912B2B995587FCACC52A5A9D0093EF2269836E89DCE53C43D53DA1BD49CA0782F0DBF1B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7191-4817","documentHash":"b11a6728-9cc6-4795-8000-4a6a4b3da570"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff14","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Jankowski","uuid":"F9461B66FB61F23AFE86918AC3B604D12FFC707A1DDB526AF41B389417B77754D384A1FC189D85AF2F729CE1E4EFCC842A5C088CDB4C41243954A06738666F12","orcidId":"0000-0002-0426-9221","documentHash":"e333fe4f-7028-4420-b470-368b176cc524"}],"objectId":"64ccab204097074f2a27894a","doi":"10.1002/elan.202300143","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elan.202300143","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Gold polycarbonate microchannels for electrochemical applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we present gold-plating polycarbonate (PC) microchannels. The fabrication of the gold microfluidic channels is achieved by tuning the sequence of reagent insertion into milled and closed submillimeter PC system channels. The resulting gold surface can be utilized in many applications where the benefits of microfluidics, (bio)chemistry of surfaces, and electrochemistry can be combined.Here, we combine the advantages of electrochemistry with microfluidics by mixing the gold sensor with microfluidics. This approach differs from the classic one - the sensor will undergo modifications (e. g., shape and size) depending on the specific scientific problem and will be designed individually; hence its characteristics will be changed. Our goal in this work is to indicate new possibilities for combining two methodologies - electrochemistry and microfluidics. In our work, we emphasize that it confirms the validity of our chosen concept (proof-of-concept).In this work, we present one such application, the use of a gold microfluidic channel as a working electrode (WE). We describe the microchip's construction and electrochemical characterization, including the gold flow-through WE, the Ag/AgCl wire pseudo-reference, and the Pt auxiliary electrode. The measured current is the result of the flow through a rectangular duct of the gold microchannel electrode embedded in the four walls of the chip."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff14","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff4e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"e2023001","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff4e","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff14"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a61","mniswId":"5548","title":"Electroanalysis","issn":"1040-0397","eissn":"1521-4109","documentHash":"f3a904f9-da82-4d12-b9fa-d8d361a636c3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ccab204097074f2a27894b","year":"2023","documentHash":"3f3753de-7ed0-48c4-80cb-8131987172f5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["flow-through gold electrode","gold microchannel","gold-plated polycarbonate microchannel","microchannel electrode"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058898341"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64de10414097071ff2b077f2","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Lipkowski","documentHash":"0546b5b1-d531-4e4c-913d-c12c7b366cf5"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff48","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pięta","uuid":"AAC33876BE4017A0BF483155E0138F3F608C83D6AA39C4ABF3134DC6948009F7901870AB03A378CEB5BF302B02D88DD03E3E66A2026415822996C783589F4040","orcidId":"0000-0003-0341-2310","documentHash":"c4d620f7-3216-4b62-817e-b4330092a1a0"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7c0d","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Sęk","uuid":"345151C02B3C9ACD86465B966CF15358A8A97595582BA1E970B956B64A70095166F3DF67C0454F4762897917D8BF8B1C8CC917669F5CE5328BF8A7AE4A780B12","orcidId":"0000-0002-7741-6448","documentHash":"81ced48e-1419-41b6-b81b-d51701e1b065"}],"objectId":"64d220a940970767b853e8ce","doi":"10.1016/j.coelec.2023.101318","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2451910323001114?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Imaging biomolecules in bilayers supported at electrode surfaces","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This short review describes our efforts to apply scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy to provide an understanding of the mechanism of phospholipid bilayer formation at a gold electrode surface.

However, these materials exhibit low specific energy due to the dominance of mesopores and a limited potential window. To overcome these shortcomings, herein, we synthesize Miscanthus sinensis (silver grass)-derived hierarchically-porous activated carbons (SHACs) via pyrolysis, carbonization, and KOH activation. We test the SHAC electrodes with different electrolytes, showing how an electrolyte–electrode pair can be tuned to boost energy and power densities. Owing to the synergetic effect of the size-balanced proportion of micropores matched with the size of electrolyte ions, in KOH electrolyte, the SHAC electrode produces a high specific capacitance (592 F g−1) while, simultaneously, providing faster charging compared to Na2SO4 electrolyte. We rationalize these findings with molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating the avoidance of power-density trade-off, typical for microporous SCs. Upon adding K3Fe(CN)6 redox species to KOH electrolyte (hybrid electrolyte), capacitance increases 2.53 fold (380 to 963 F g−1 at 5 A g−1) due to the synergy of capacitive and faradaic energy storage mechanisms. In the hybrid electrolyte, a SHAC electrode-embedded symmetric SC (SSC) offers a high cycling stability (97%) with 1.6 V wide operational voltage and permits energy storage and power density higher than those reported so far for aqueous electrolyte-based SSCs and asymmetric SCs. In addition, these SSCs provide long-lasting operational capabilities that are useful for driving various portable electronic devices.

The most utilised enzyme-based biosensors for creatinine assay are based on the detection of ammonia as a product of the creatinine deiminase (CDI)-catalysed reaction, but there are limited data on the monitoring of another CDI reaction product - N-methylhydantoin (NMH). The main drawback of the creatinine-selective biosensors which have been constructed to dateis a high negative working potential that is problematic for the monitoring of creatinine in biological liquids. An amperometric CDI-based biosensor for the direct measurement of creatinine, which works at low potentials due to using electrocatalytic nanocomposites is described in this paper. To choose the best chemosensor on NMH, hybrid CoCu nanoparticles were selected for the development of CDI-based amperometric biosensors. The structure and mechanism of the produced nCoCu-NMH complex on the electrode surface were also elucidated. The novel biosensor exhibited sufficient sensitivity (195 A center dot M-1 center dot m(-2) for creatinine), a broad linear range (10-800 mu M), a low limit of detection (0.5 mu M) and excellent selectivity towards the target analyte. The designed bioelectrode was used for estimation of creatinine in biological fluids."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e709490878c28a0473bf93e","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"393","pagesFromTo":"134276","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["652003a14097074657474be6","652003a14097074657474be7","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","5e709490878c28a0473bf93e","652003a14097074657474be8","652003a14097074657474be9","652003a14097074657474bea"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796ff","mniswId":"18385","title":"Sensors and Actuators B -

Pulse plasma sintering (PPS) was used to manufacture Mg-based composites with 1, 5 and 10 vol.% ceramic filler. As a reference, pure Mg was sintered. The results show that the addition of 1 vol.% Didymosphenia geminata frustules to the Mg matrix increases its corrosion resistance by supporting passivation reactions, and do not affect the morphology of L929 fibroblasts. Addition of 5 vol.% the filler does not cause cytotoxic effects, but it supports microgalvanic reactions leading to the greater corrosion rate. Higher content than 5 vol.% the filler causes significant microgalvanic corrosion, as well as increases cytotoxicity due to the greater micro-galvanic effect of the composites containing 10 and 15 vol.% diatoms. The results of contact angle measurements show the hydrophilic character of the investigated materials, with slightly increase in numerical values with addition of amount of ceramic reinforcement. The addition of Didymosphenia geminata frustules causes changes in a thermo-elastic properties such as mean apparent value of coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and thermal conductivity (λ). The addition of siliceous reinforcement resulted in a linear decrease of CTE and reduction in thermal conductivity over the entire temperature range. With the increasing addition of Didymosphenia geminata frustules, an increase in strength with a decrease in compressive strain is observed. In all composites an increase in microhardness was attained. The results clearly indicate that filler in the form of Didymosphenia geminata frustules may significantly change the most important properties of pure Mg, indicating its wide potential in the application of Mg-based composites with a special focus on biomedical use."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2853-2871","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70946c878c28a0473bca5c","65560d2040970749a8176358","65560d2040970749a8176359","65560d2040970749a817635a","65560d2040970749a817635b","5e709407878c28a0473b5110","65560d2040970749a817635d","65560d2040970749a817635e","65560d2040970749a817635f","65560d2040970749a8176360","65560d2040970749a8176361","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","65560d2040970749a8176363","65560d2040970749a8176364","5e7092e5878c28a04739ee13"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c918","mniswId":"11699","title":"Journal of Magnesium and Alloys","eissn":"2213-9567","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7a2d03c8-cb27-4b45-83da-219695bfc916"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6569e87f4097077c047b1d82","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"8","doi":"","documentHash":"fc458f96-49e3-4feb-8348-cb380010cbbe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Metal-matrix composites (MMCs)","Pulse plasma sintering (PPS)","Ceramic filler","Microstructure","Properties"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058940827"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6538f2f440970744d5b1f94a","name":"Majid","lastName":"Nazari","documentHash":"d4ffa3f0-0a5b-4171-a13d-1d1c63a3e5d2"},{"objectId":"6538f2f440970744d5b1f949","name":"Emad","lastName":"Babakhanzadeh","documentHash":"ceba7c02-d09f-47e9-bf2f-b6216d38067b"},{"objectId":"6538f2f440970744d5b1f948","name":"Ayeh","lastName":"Khorshidian","documentHash":"e085898e-870d-4b45-8e4a-d4cbce4756d2"},{"objectId":"60c2fc239543c7233654339a","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Alipourfard","uuid":"09F87F13C145EAA33D5D3E392CC52D6627B20E2FB071920A9AC8A55B4EFE06CCFDC635D1FBCFD0C3CE2E997891A272F5A4326A19832587B921FF5E5C935B8BC5","documentHash":"92b7f0ed-674e-4ca5-b512-5aa90affbef8"}],"objectId":"6538f2f440970744d5b1f946","doi":"10.1016/j.humgen.2023.201200","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2773044123000591?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Susceptibility to azoospermia by haplotype analysis of protamine 1 and protamine 2 variants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Infertility remains a major global problem, affecting 10-15% of couples worldwide, with half of the cases due to male factors. Protamines, found only in the testes, are essential for sperm chromatin condensation and paternal genome imprinting during spermatogenesis. Seventy testicular samples from infertile men were analyzed for the expression level of PRM1 and PRM2. 448 infertile males were additionally examined for PRM1 and PRM2 polymorphism. There was a significant association of rs2070923 polymorphism of PRM2 in both additive and recessive models (OR (95% CI) 1.32[0.92; 1.88, p = 0.023] and 2.26[1.12; 4.57, p = 0.017], respectively). The TT genotype of rs2070923 PRM2 was also correlated with lower gene expression of PRM2 in the infertile group (p = 0.03). Moreover, our result showed that the frequency of GTCT haplotype was higher than average in azoospermic patients (OR = 2.67; 95%CI = 1.17-2.53; p = 0.041) and that gene-gene interaction played a role in male infertility.

The detrimental effects of heavy metals on humans as well as on aquatic ecosystems are of great concern. In this regard, membrane technology is playing its role in the separation of these non-biodegradable heavy metal ions from the waste water, though improvement in the technology is still the need of time. The present work deals with the novel strategy of developing PVDF/rGO nanocomposite membrane with the inclusion of IL via phase inversion method to remove heavy metal ions. Inclusion of rGO and IL as filler into the PVDF hydrophobic matrix improved the antifouling characteristics and solvent contents of the hybrid ionogel membranes. In addition, the decrease in the contact angle from 90 degrees (Pure PVDF) to 46 degrees (PVDF/IL/rGO) was observed pointing towards the hydrophilic nature of the resulting membranes. Among various compositions, 0.5 w/v % rGO demonstrated maximum efficiency by removing up to 90% of various divalent cations including Cu2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, and Mn2+.The flux recovery ratio was observed to be 94% after testing the membrane several times. Up to 70% removal of As3+ from the same membrane is a hope to design a membrane with improved efficiency for removing As3+."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6375aab9752340568bfffcd4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"296","pagesFromTo":"116680","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6538e83240970744d5b06a16","6538e83240970744d5b06a17","6538e83240970744d5b06a18","6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","6538e83240970744d5b06a19","6538e83240970744d5b06a1a","6538e83240970744d5b06a1b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d99","mniswId":"13991","title":"Materials Science and Engineering B-Advanced Functional Solid-State Materials","issn":"0921-5107","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"e96361fd-e179-4c66-bccd-9ab614332854"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6538e86140970744d5b071d3","year":"2023","volume":"296","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"a64a5252-a004-4180-9527-fecd51020b09"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058944262"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6531014140970708a25342f3","name":"Markus","lastName":"Leisegang","documentHash":"244c7792-f3d4-440e-ac19-836743e304dd"},{"objectId":"6531014140970708a25342f2","name":"Matthias","lastName":"Bode","documentHash":"97009bf1-ac30-4554-b36f-42f5a4c52603"},{"objectId":"6531014140970708a25342f1","name":"Tobias","lastName":"Edelmann","documentHash":"8f24adfc-5107-4b17-a406-7d21fd86f0a1"},{"objectId":"6531014140970708a25342f0","name":"Manuel","lastName":"Seitz","documentHash":"08c5d9c9-a697-4fe6-8b85-77f87c74ca32"},{"objectId":"6531014140970708a25342ef","name":"Patrick","lastName":"Härtl","documentHash":"acb111c4-9482-49ea-bc03-9ae4dc26619d"},{"objectId":"6531014140970708a25342ee","name":"Andreas","lastName":"Christ","documentHash":"b6f863fd-89e6-41be-8460-5ea66ddf3ae4"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Waluk","uuid":"587A78D077C4375A4C980253E3D29FB2074174FC88F6A7341BDCBF8F80F6764FDE1461139B4C2337F132A7A1787A14076B55E79D57654F32E1BE17E03941A875","orcidId":"0000-0001-5745-583X","documentHash":"f8893a20-d629-4008-9c8c-d34c0e171106"}],"objectId":"6531014140970708a25342ec","doi":"10.1039/d3cp02911e","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/CP/D3CP02911E","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Anisotropic coupling of individual vibrational modes to a Cu(110) substrate","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a study on the excitation of individual vibrational modes with ballistic charge carriers propagating along the Cu(110) surface.

Among various materials, activated carbon is chosen as the host material, and its performance has been enhanced by employing few-layer graphene and ZnFe2O4. The presence of few-layer graphene in activated carbon enhanced the SC performance and the fabricated few-layer graphene/acti-vated carbon composite results in a maximum specific capacitance of 180 F g-1 at 5 mV/s and 176 F g-1 at 1 Ag-1.

More recently, this research has been oriented towards applications of emulsions in flow batteries. Such biphasic systems seem to provide a suitable environment for reactions at the liquid–liquid interface. Taking an emulsion consisting of microdroplets of decamethylferrocene solution in a hydrophobic ionic liquid/toluene mixture in acidic aqueous solution as an example, we have demonstrated that an electrochemical redox reaction involving the hydrophobic redox probe occurs at the glassy carbon electrode|organic liquid film interface. This reaction is followed by ion exchange between liquid phases. This effect is explained by the instability of the emulsion. A portion of the organic liquid stays on the electrode surface after transfer to a purely aqueous electrolyte and remains electroactive."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","60c2fd859543c723365436a5","5e7092b4878c28a04739b167"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"154","pagesFromTo":"107544","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["653a724b409707573421f39b","653a724b409707573421f39c","5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","60c2fd859543c723365436a5","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a66","mniswId":"5552","title":"Electrochemistry Communications","issn":"1388-2481","eissn":"1873-1902","documentHash":"544e60e0-d387-42b0-be84-7ff77cd271e1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653a724b409707573421f39a","year":"2023","volume":"154","documentHash":"ae6cec85-fe91-46e0-848a-713c21a7d1b0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058950804"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6540ee6f4097077467d1de8e","name":"Christopher","lastName":"Schlesiger","documentHash":"3ec17590-4fb9-4bd1-b2b5-a54f5687db7d"},{"objectId":"6540ee6f4097077467d1de8d","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Praetz","documentHash":"0af99dc8-b0dd-45db-b2d1-404b7e6e6933"},{"objectId":"616a392975234017e0545a1c","name":"Rafael","lastName":"De Lima Oliveira","uuid":"2A0952DDD5CA46FCB5F8E537449E7400054CA4D3A6CDED3C35A806C05ECCFE5E63CCA987EE7F1445FE8A8D1E0AFF7929A38B99AA638724CB2CE8BBD46A32C36D","documentHash":"fe127367-6cc0-4c99-b0c3-67135675feb1"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf93f","name":"Olga","lastName":"Chernyayeva","uuid":"D8616FD54954511340229E9B6612899E830FCB8E4620DFD5135927A3D2F2C2BBE0A5D2C0B9CC50C186B9C1504D781D6FEBF3A9E74BA6E3402FC46FADF20D3AE2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6813-4350","documentHash":"e2c193ec-d62c-4906-a22b-a0c29ad423c1"},{"objectId":"5e7093ca878c28a0473b0c5d","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Ledwa","uuid":"868A73B2F9BA3F9263BBF91DD5BFF6895BBFC63B316EF048B551984687C46BE6C8A5B643DAA38B3D2186680C1C493F5FA57607210511100608889367082D0C43","orcidId":"0000-0003-2826-7623","documentHash":"d0b50fdd-903b-429a-ab97-c0e3875e82f3"},{"objectId":"5e709366878c28a0473a8d29","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Kępiński","uuid":"A87849DB6A1F2119AD9EEFADCF3EC2DFCBB099AC76946DF3215EF29541EC82081B764656915FC4ABD0BFED8EA184C191B447EFABF57A2779A860CE2E641A40D8","orcidId":"0000-0003-1633-9183","documentHash":"40d65249-cc63-42c3-9e45-f9906d7cca3b"}],"objectId":"6540ee6f4097077467d1de89","doi":"10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01985","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.3c01985","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles Confined in Doped Mesoporous Carbons: A Strategy to Produce Catalysts for Imine Synthesis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A group of doped carbon materials weresynthesized by ahard template using starch as a carbon precursor.

On the other hand, Eu-doped ZnO has appeared to be an interesting material for red light applications. In this work, we are looking for a way to increase the red emission from ZnO:Eu by adding Mg to the ZnO host. We explore the effect of tunable wide-bandgap semiconductor host- Zn1–xMgxO on the photoexcitation–emission properties of dopant-europium ions. Eu-doped Zn1–xMgxO thin films with various Mg compositions were epitaxially grown on a-Al2O3 substrates via oxygen plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The elemental composition was modified during growth by varying the Zn and Mg fluxes at a constant oxygen flow or by changing the oxygen flow at fixed Zn and Mg fluxes. The Eu doping level is nearly constant at 0.6 ± 0.1 at %. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements show that europium doped in Zn1–xMgxO thin films are present in Eu3+/Eu2+ ionic states. Further, the ZnMgO:Eu thin films are explored through X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses. Photoluminescence (PL) analysis shows that the intensity of the 5D0 – 7F2 red emission of the Eu3+ ions depends critically on the Mg content. When the bandgap energy of Zn1–xMgxO:Eu samples varies from 3.61 to 4.00 eV, the Eu3+ PL intensity presents nearly a 60-fold increase. We interpret the increased PL efficiency of Eu3+ as a function of the Mg composition in terms of host-exciton energy transfer to the higher energy levels of Eu ions. The efficient energy transfer to Eu ions is attributed to the increased oscillator strength of excitons and their strong localization in Zn1–xMgxO due to the local fluctuations in the Mg content within the material."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii

(COD) method of growing ZnO nanowires (NWs). The “ordinary” carbothermal process of ZnO NW production involves a reduction of ZnO by carbon to the Zn vapor form and the subsequent reaction of the Zn vapor with additionally introduced oxygen in a large volume furnace. In the case of the COD method, the reaction between carbon (graphite) and ZnO produces Zn vapor and CO/CO2 gas mixtures, which subsequently react in a reduced reaction volume to produce the ZnO NWs. Studies conducted on individual NWs confirm that the ZnO NWs obtained by the COD method exhibit very good structural and optical properties, such as the ultranarrow spectral linewidth (0.5 meV) of the acceptor-bound exciton transition. By performing thermodynamic calculations based on free Gibbs energy and equilibrium constants of 10 theoretical reactions, we confirm that in a system without oxygen, the most preferable reaction to grow ZnO NWs is the reduction of CO by Zn."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ae878c28a0473c1810","5e7093e8878c28a0473b3155","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a6","5e709445878c28a0473b9722","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a4","5e7094ad878c28a0473c16f5","5e7092bc878c28a04739bac7","5e7092ba878c28a04739ba83"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af849"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","uid":"bnXIe5Gp0q3Tkxqm6btR47Q","uuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","name":"Instytut Wysokich Ciśnień Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092bc878c28a04739bac7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","parentUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","rootUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7dcf"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"6442-6449","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709445878c28a0473b9722","5e7093e8878c28a0473b3155","5e7092ba878c28a04739ba83","5e7093b5878c28a0473af849","5e709359878c28a0473a7dcf","5e7094ae878c28a0473c1810","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a4","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a6","5e7094ad878c28a0473c16f5","5e7092bc878c28a04739bac7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547784f","mniswId":"4571","title":"Crystal Growth & Design","issn":"1528-7483","eissn":"1528-7505","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a74fd0a5-1a2c-4144-b4de-f61e8704ecc7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"650178304097072b31950619","year":"2023","volume":"23","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"a1ea5f48-bdf5-4fca-8ea2-f171fc62ca55"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058974096"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65cb3242409707626357c04e","name":"Nicolas D.","lastName":"Boscher","documentHash":"2a54bca9-e123-4b21-a532-0069a46d3e6a"},{"objectId":"65cb3242409707626357c04d","name":"Helmut","lastName":"Zacharias","documentHash":"4ead10a8-fe90-454e-b3d0-42775cb759ba"},{"objectId":"65cb3242409707626357c04c","name":"Monika","lastName":"Góra","documentHash":"1e329d42-c1a1-447d-8e34-25be63059325"},{"objectId":"65cb3242409707626357c04b","name":"Tobias","lastName":"Reiker","documentHash":"8c59583f-6a49-489d-9e44-e68fc7332f0d"},{"objectId":"65cb3242409707626357c04a","name":"Marek K.","lastName":"Charyton","documentHash":"50172263-1440-42bf-818e-00b5367fbe5c"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b7698","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kotwica","uuid":"F03170F203AED38A8DF4CF1E65F6C1BA24A19075658A0227F515BDF8A92F21BAB42F603376D1FA6A95A07C24916665939AB39CB2D64CE67B00566CB6034EB172","orcidId":"0000-0003-3650-3307","documentHash":"166fd882-7b90-4a38-8b24-323958a79e43"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"650174ce4097072b3194d12f","doi":"10.1039/d3ma00197k","publicUri":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ma/d3ma00197k","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Unsubstituted thiophene–diketopyrrolopyrrole conjugated polymer thin films <i>via</i> oxidative chemical vapor deposition – electronic behavior","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Conjugated polymers (CPs) based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) constitue an important class of high-performance organic semiconductors.

Despite the commercial availability of high-quality ITO and some low-cost methods for direct deposition being in use by now, the definition of patterns is still a concern. Putting their popularity and extensive use aside, the manufacturing of ITO electrodes so far lacks a rapid, highly reproducible, flexible, cost-effective, easy patterning process that could surpass difficult, time-consuming techniques such as lithography. Herein, we present a low-cost method based on CO2 laser irradiation for preparing ITO microelectrodes and electrode arrays. Electrodes of different sizes and shapes were examined to identify the performance of the proposed methods. Direct ablation of the ITO layer was optimized for rectangular electrodes of 25, 50, and 100 & mu;m in width, while laser cutting of scotch tape stencils and subsequent wet etching were used to create circular electrodes with a diameter of 1.75 mm. A multielectrode array system consisting 8 of these circular electrodes was fabricated on a (25 x 25) mm(2) plate, characterized electrochemically through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), and as an example application used for monitoring the anchoring behavior of HeLa and HepG2 cell cultures through cell-based electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Together, the direct ablation method and preparation of laser cut stencils form a complete toolbox, which allows for low-cost and fast fabrication of ITO electrodes for a wide variety of applications. To demonstrate the general availability of the method, we have also prepared a batch of electrodes using a laser plotter in a local printing shop, achieving high intra-workshop reproducibility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","602e49369543c7410626f032","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cd","60c314de9543c72336543c79","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","5e7094a0878c28a0473c094a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"3802-3810","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e49369543c7410626f032","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cd","6540e95f4097077467d0e17a","60c314de9543c72336543c79","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","5e7094a0878c28a0473c094a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c63","mniswId":"13399","title":"LAB ON A CHIP","issn":"1473-0197","eissn":"1473-0189","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"83af583a-5332-442c-9662-2ca8c91cf669"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6540e9934097077467d0e974","year":"2023","volume":"23","number":"17","doi":"","documentHash":"04bc7f74-bc14-4166-8eeb-7a5e1a2bded5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058974369"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"650accd24097070d18c01855","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Brodnikovskyi","documentHash":"3cf0fb3e-794f-4828-935d-4737faf7e287"},{"objectId":"650accd24097070d18c01854","name":"Yehor","lastName":"Brodnikovskyi","documentHash":"f3edfc93-4e3d-48a4-850f-a90fa6dafaf4"},{"objectId":"650accd24097070d18c01853","name":"Larysa","lastName":"Khomenkova","documentHash":"23f6016e-a65e-44fe-af62-284e7537bd0f"},{"objectId":"650accd24097070d18c01852","name":"Nadiia","lastName":"Korsunska","documentHash":"52be23fc-0260-4766-b207-c6d6b9b85279"},{"objectId":"650accd24097070d18c01851","name":"Yevgen","lastName":"Syryanyy","documentHash":"b0dbb169-f052-4b5b-97bc-b1f6209b5c26"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Nikiforow","uuid":"E166453BA6868F48895D87A86E6702843A623A59A84923A7C78B7FFBB992983C7D95FE6E5E79D29AB2127112DC3887B27E8FB1E44DE4688F1367FD5EA5783F74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6135-8514","documentHash":"c96f36f3-357e-4938-9d4c-83e71d392895"},{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b7814","name":"Yevgen","lastName":"Melikhov","uuid":"788840D3288D30F0C2ED6EF6B16F67001929A7297E297A2404CEE952BE991F9D0A8443A103E05169FED618956DF40F910884BD616E3B1DAB4261989961DB60C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9787-5238","documentHash":"3497ad3f-b61b-449d-9f7c-78c204cb1ffa"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b49ae","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Chernyshova","uuid":"75EDAFD90763AAB6398B9E09C21A6F0E8D91271EE9F1374C518879758A7A3A94C3F0DB71979F7BE71F17FF4BDCDDF771A10A4028E247EB22C677EADE9DC7E875","orcidId":"0000-0002-4149-0259","documentHash":"5546ce6e-46a9-460d-b40d-f78b186e2b47"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7a3","name":"Iraida","lastName":"Demchenko","uuid":"97985D4CABBED009BA14C6F9D974DA6F046F713F6FB677114EA007117B9C9792FEEDC9973AF75D48223ADACD7D05AE5E8EB588017A9EEECDB27CDA632CE5FCB6","documentHash":"68d489c8-8390-4968-a144-dbdee3d05dbc"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"650accd24097070d18c0184e","doi":"10.3390/ma16165504","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/16/5504/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis of Scandia-Ceria-Stabilized Zirconia Composites with Different Transport Properties","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work aims to study a possible modification in the electronic structure of scandia-ceria-stabilized zirconia (10Sc1CeSZ) ceramics sintered at different temperatures. In addition to using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and impedance spectroscopy to investigate the structural and electrical properties, we employed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to determine the chemical state information of the atoms involved, along with compositional analysis. As expected, a significant increase in grain ionic conductivity with the sintering temperature was present. This increase was accompanied by a decrease in the porosity of the samples, an increase in the grain size, and a transformation from the rhombohedral to the cubic phase. The phase transformation was detected not only using XRD, but also using XPS and, for this type of ceramic, XPS detected this transformation for the first time. In addition to the changes in the structural characteristics, the increase in the ionic conductivity was accompanied by a modification in the electronic structure of the ceramic surface. The XPS results showed that the surface of the ceramic sintered at the lower temperature of 1100 °C had a higher amount of Zr–OH bonds than the surface of the ceramic sintered at the higher temperature of 1400 °C. The existence of these Zr–OH bonds was confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). From this result, taken together with the difference between the oxygen/zirconium ratios in these ceramics, also identified using XPS, we conclude that there were fewer oxygen vacancies in the ceramic sintered at the lower temperature. It is argued that these two factors, together with the changes in the structural characteristics, have a direct influence on the conductive properties of the studied ceramics sintered at different temperatures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a047385681","uid":"bgbtDmT2xNGaLxKwwFKbBUA","uuid":"af3897e6-5183-462d-8b0b-b6a6469b5fda","name":"Instytut Fizyki Plazmy i Laserowej Mikrosyntezy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ff878c28a0473b49ae","5e7092b9878c28a04739b7a3"],"parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385681","parentUuid":"af3897e6-5183-462d-8b0b-b6a6469b5fda","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a047385681","rootUuid":"af3897e6-5183-462d-8b0b-b6a6469b5fda","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","uid":"bL0dXXB9qN74NNNOmYDF46Q","uuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","name":"Instytut Podstawowych Problemów Techniki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942b878c28a0473b7814"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","parentUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","rootUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"5504","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b9878c28a04739b7a3","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e7093ff878c28a0473b49ae","5e70942b878c28a0473b7814","650accd24097070d18c01851","650accd24097070d18c01852","650accd24097070d18c01853","650accd24097070d18c01854","650accd24097070d18c01855"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"MATERIALS","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"0b45d09d-8047-4d83-bd73-c440396a0ba1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64de1bdf4097077ac1f60918","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"16","number":"16","documentHash":"2c24a521-d141-433f-b094-6ffbe1efa885"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058984394"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"619f03387523402fabdefaec","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Michałowska","uuid":"704753DDC9ED4ED0C3EA2ED92AA59908F3D4CAB1CAA6D7535B11DB320A19B02A7A61277EDAFD6839E73BD473D173D0DC975F9884B56835891F86BBE42BB4D5B6","documentHash":"93f39bce-3730-49b7-bd9e-1c7d08c49a7a"},{"objectId":"60dda4479543c7233654463c","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ambroziak","uuid":"E28B4465CC430F2FC9B36F74A3AB1503AC9E5B992341669F4113874245451DF1EE6537AC66406925F40C4F61CBC7D02FD50EFCBAADC1CFCA08644E8AC4FBA899","orcidId":"0000-0001-8581-9119","documentHash":"b3a0e440-6cef-4a22-8004-f43305b96a85"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac852","name":"Jan","lastName":"Krajczewski","uuid":"D2D819CE90BD6EE7AF63845986425333B86BCCCC159E65944D88D8A9F6F4C6888466075F1EECB75FA0A5A97820796F931EE3EDEEFF3E81D7C7E356AD90883DB7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9629-6448","documentHash":"a82bc041-0915-4757-a0ad-829fedeb350e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"650acf484097070d18c03b71","doi":"10.1007/s10853-023-08755-2","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10853-023-08755-2.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Tape of the truth: Ta2O5 nanopore array formed under broad potential range and SERS potential after silver sputtering","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The deposition of a plasmonic metal layer on a nanostructured oxide surface is one of the important methods of preparing a platform for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements.

The influence of various experimental anodization process parameters on the morphology of a Ta2O5 nanopore array was carefully studied. It was found that the formation of a Ta2O5 nanopore array is possible under a broad potential range (15–50 V) in a highly acidic solution containing F− ions. In some cases, the nanopore array structures were covered by an outer layer rich in F− and SO42− ions, which could easily be removed using adhesive tape or by sonication. The deposition of an Ag layer led to SERS activity. The optimal Ag layer thickness was specified based on SEM and DRS measurements. The SERS substrates formed exhibited high point-to-point, sample-to-sample and time durability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["619f03387523402fabdefaec","5e70938d878c28a0473ac852"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60dda4479543c7233654463c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"58","issue":"28","pagesFromTo":"11539-11550","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac852","619f03387523402fabdefaec","60dda4479543c7233654463c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478852","mniswId":"11762","title":"JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE","issn":"0022-2461","eissn":"1573-4803","documentHash":"03cf4b28-5495-4569-b50c-eeea242d31af"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"650acf484097070d18c03b72","year":"2023","volume":"58","number":"28","documentHash":"36db20ba-61d0-4f79-a448-db7e0f4e4d39"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058984536"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6555ea5a4097077145e3d33b","name":"Ville‐Veikko","lastName":"Telkki","documentHash":"dd08de49-7ba1-4f01-ba75-81aa8a997edb"},{"objectId":"6555ea5a4097077145e3d33a","name":"Otto","lastName":"Mankinen","documentHash":"0d9944b2-c727-4e39-ad49-b2a70e333724"},{"objectId":"6555ea5a4097077145e3d339","name":"Ville‐Veikko","lastName":"Telkki","documentHash":"75af57cf-84ff-43f4-b899-d6b4115d3e71"},{"objectId":"6555ea5a4097077145e3d338","name":"Yashu","lastName":"Kharbanda","documentHash":"a24b7a83-9a26-494d-99eb-74a65c6decfa"},{"objectId":"6555ea5a4097077145e3d337","name":"Jing","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"4f51a9f3-a37f-4686-9a85-b6ac624245a8"},{"objectId":"6555ea5a4097077145e3d336","name":"Otto","lastName":"Mankinen","documentHash":"992bc874-8a5f-47b6-8e44-713c34fc37d9"},{"objectId":"6555ea5a4097077145e3d335","name":"Sarah","lastName":"Mailhiot","documentHash":"23f09e41-d6c2-48fc-af2a-fdc7c87c636b"},{"objectId":"5e70935c878c28a0473a8005","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Urbańczyk","uuid":"AF444E1C978195263F4C2CD5A4DC7195A4371BE77AAB40A62FA044CE2580C85A2E65405BBE3D3FE2524D89205C7AA9301E9A593953F3680FAEF96891F12DD491","orcidId":"0000-0001-6085-1593","documentHash":"44d8669d-b8ac-47bb-9cc0-ec9d4717eeef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6555ea5a4097077145e3d333","doi":"10.1002/mrc.5376","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1002/mrc.5376","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"CAT on MOUSE: Control and automation of temperature for single‐sided NMR instruments such as NMR‐MOUSE","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Temperature-dependent experiments are a rapidly growing area of interest for low-field NMR.

However, the multistep regent manipulation still impedes the performance of the device for end-users. To address this issue, we present a novel sequential flow-through microfluidic device that incorporates dual flow behaviors (fast-flow/delayed) into a single device for assessing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVDs) using C-reactive protein (CRP) as the model analyte. The device features a fast-flow channel for automated washing of unbound CRP antigens and a delayed channel for flow of a redox reagent for electrochemical analysis. It requires only a single buffer loading, resulting in a total analysis time of 15 min. To overcome challenges related to storage stability and the affinity of antibodies in the manufacturing process, we integrated the P3-CRP peptide as a new bioreceptor for CRP detection. The performance of both the P3-CRP peptide and antibodies was assessed and examined using chronocoulometry. The proposed device exhibited a limit of detection at 47 pg mL−1 with a wide linear range (5 orders of magnitude). To validate its applicability, the device was tested with serum, plasma, and whole blood samples, yielding satisfactory results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d5878c28a0473b1879"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["617768287523400564d3afe2","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","5e7093a2878c28a0473ae2d9","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"397","pagesFromTo":"134659","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["617768287523400564d3afe2","5e7093a2878c28a0473ae2d9","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1879","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796ff","mniswId":"18385","title":"SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL","issn":"0925-4005","documentHash":"15661a96-2e87-40bc-aac2-9d4a2c23aa16"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"651d296440970737b844d14b","year":"2023","volume":"397","documentHash":"74e04b0c-e7fe-4d64-8fe9-5580ff105fa2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["C-reactive protein","Point-of-care testing","Peptide","Capillary-driven microfluidic device","Label-free immunoassay","Electrochemical detection"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059007917"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655dd19040970728e32d1981","name":"Sunita","lastName":"Mishra","documentHash":"7f8cd79d-fadd-4532-ab62-4d374a20c2ff"},{"objectId":"655dd19040970728e32d1980","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","documentHash":"104ddebb-d09e-43c1-a4e4-959784cd5df5"},{"objectId":"655dd19040970728e32d197f","name":"Isha","lastName":"Mudahar","documentHash":"c0a81700-e9f2-4f2f-93db-8f6abc7148b1"},{"objectId":"655dd19040970728e32d197e","name":"Akash","lastName":"Deep","documentHash":"c84a91f1-f0d9-4492-a517-d338ee6de31d"},{"objectId":"655dd19040970728e32d197d","name":"Prashant","lastName":"Dubey","documentHash":"39f4c709-41bc-4823-a547-4edb4de1c32c"},{"objectId":"655dd19040970728e32d197c","name":"Ashwinder","lastName":"Kaur","documentHash":"720e5cb6-3936-420f-95f7-c7c3408a46e4"},{"objectId":"632925a975234038513ec7cd","name":"Vishal","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"0D354B8FF99322E996FAD697B910B9306BF493B61B1F346347D695464BD50998A218E449DB5FC5607022C923AA46F5781E11CB0C661050D2DB1C6080ECBFEEED","documentHash":"7588df5d-7d93-4a1b-a3cc-2c5777e99ac2"}],"objectId":"655dd19040970728e32d197a","doi":"10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c01528","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c01528","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Waste Paper-Derived Porous Carbon Incorporated with Mesoporous ZIF-8 Crystals for Symmetrical Supercapacitors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Activated carbon (AC) is a low-cost porous material withhigh conductivityand a specific surface area.

Compared to pristine materials (ZIF-8 and PAC-800 alone), the electrochemicalperformance of the PAC-800/ZIF-8 composite electrode is greatly enhanceddue to the mesoporous nature of ZIF-8."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["632925a975234038513ec7cd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"37","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"11376-11387","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["655dd19040970728e32d197c","632925a975234038513ec7cd","655dd19040970728e32d197d","655dd19040970728e32d197e","655dd19040970728e32d197f","655dd19040970728e32d1980","655dd19040970728e32d1981"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00953ad49b31ccedc51dc","title":"Energy &amp; Fuels","issn":"0887-0624","documentHash":"2869cb10-d8e5-456f-a58a-812e7064c454"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655dd19040970728e32d197b","year":"2023","volume":"37","number":"15","documentHash":"e9c3d867-de03-4d6a-8223-d222fd39245f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059010985"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655dd22940970728e32d21a4","name":"Jean‐Claude","lastName":"Guillemin","documentHash":"c5ef970e-388c-46ee-8188-10102167351b"},{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53c9f","name":"Elavenil","lastName":"Ganesan","uuid":"5488C5FD6E3537E716A919E97EFBC1AF579F3C7D73F45AC60E09AF3E02BD2DB4FD2C266997CF1ED2D27133E08C33FA02DB8A751401A7E46C156BC96B88D30FED","documentHash":"70129e26-7424-48be-a618-2ed5de189bc5"},{"objectId":"613971a99543c7051ff01bb2","name":"Arunlibertsen","lastName":"Lawzer","uuid":"AC3E1B2488D88AA8CBD8128375C2F2CBD29A48673C3BA859FD09CA82B5603E72764D9B3B796D9A94D3C68BEC368CD269E77E3AA2E47DEC336A3F81198C187045","orcidId":"0000-0002-6020-1256","documentHash":"98140545-41cf-4f0a-ba5d-ce8009930d1b"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5ae6","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Gronowski","uuid":"39156AD5899D81C92DABC7019A11A0CC14B311DA68EEA259FDD0E6B5D969B0A4D9789B86063673C3446CEA6A024B22BF142D811157090015278E71ABD4358B3F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7547-4548","documentHash":"08729365-2f1b-4156-9f81-83d3e4e8d505"},{"objectId":"5e7093dd878c28a0473b222b","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Custer","uuid":"6DFEAC92D33F84CFF833BCDE82B54D1BC440A4B074460BCE30A1CEF232E61FA3E9A1BD07EB521B9D97C32E1F673BFA9D6CA88F27C2FA06A0493723A4530E8042","orcidId":"0000-0003-2336-4248","documentHash":"94eddde7-59d4-43b7-9876-02808ea4b3cd"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0b8","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kołos","uuid":"E2DE2A8BA8BD16D93A25D4877EE859A67941C0EC47371E80CA60E92199FFFECC377E95EDFF1CC401E8C2F35071F13C96BBAE5AE7B820AD1303F166C7896CE394","orcidId":"0000-0001-6103-9660","documentHash":"8841b962-f547-4474-9f81-627b80e2e5a5"}],"objectId":"655dd22940970728e32d21a2","doi":"10.1002/chem.202300887","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.202300887","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Free Ethynylarsinidene and Ethynylstibinidene: Heavier Analogues of Nitrenes and Phosphinidenes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Until now, there has been very little experimental evidence for the existence of free arsinidenes and stibinidenes, apart from the hydrides, AsH and SbH.

To circumvent the intrinsic issues of the nature of the halogen-bond (XB) and the resultant unresolved limitations in asymmetric catalysis, fine-tuned halogen–halogen interactions between the substrate and XB-donor were designed to preorganize the substrate in the catalyst's cavity and boost enantiocontrol. The present strategy exploits both the electron cloud (Lewis base site) and the sigma (σ)-hole site of the halogen substituent of the substrates to form a tight catalyst–substrate–counteranion chiral complex, thus enabling a controlled induction of high levels of chirality transfer.

(90 % ee) have been achieved in a model dearomatization reaction of halogen-substituted (iso)quinolines with tetrakis-iodotriazole multidentate anion-binding catalysts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7fe1bf085dcb410a25ec01"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"62","issue":"35","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["655e071240970728e33227f1","655e071240970728e33227f2","655e071240970728e33227f3","655e071240970728e33227f4","5f7fe1bf085dcb410a25ec01","655e071240970728e33227f5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477026","mniswId":"1127","title":"ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION","issn":"1433-7851","eissn":"1521-3773","documentHash":"2e22c515-48a8-4277-bd3a-488ee4361571"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655e071240970728e33227f0","year":"2023","volume":"62","number":"35","documentHash":"295f235b-379e-4557-96e3-25d9d90bd5b3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059031887"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324f6","name":"Ayesha","lastName":"Samreen","documentHash":"817d0700-38f9-43dc-9f8c-91e608e94282"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324f5","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Bilal","documentHash":"a1e5d5d6-6dcc-4e6b-bcb3-e36c2d7184d8"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324f4","name":"Muhammad Jamshaid","lastName":"Shabbir","documentHash":"93e6a383-b48c-4e65-81aa-b96c642f4457"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324f3","name":"Hira","lastName":"Tahseen","documentHash":"a0bc6f64-b3ba-47ea-83d2-7b3399d1f950"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324f2","name":"Fazal","lastName":"Rasheed","documentHash":"d8e52d54-755a-4ee5-bc2f-bab8c966541b"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324f1","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Danish","documentHash":"1b879211-5beb-473e-873f-2bc54863b8d4"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324f0","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Adnan","documentHash":"445ac155-a249-40b8-af02-15ebe75eb37b"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324ef","name":"Kanwal","lastName":"Shahbaz","documentHash":"d5636874-4208-42bb-83fa-e84a1e580523"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324ee","name":"Mubashira","lastName":"Bibi","documentHash":"a5bfc001-441b-4e4d-a6cb-215cde23f434"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324ed","name":"Shahid","lastName":"Atiq","documentHash":"1554de07-713a-4d35-91bf-e90efde0d9d1"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324ec","name":"Muhammad Ahmed","lastName":"Khan","documentHash":"c3b7d76d-d2c3-4bb3-ae98-b3d4a0961ed6"},{"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324eb","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Zahid","documentHash":"3fa4a527-fadb-48ce-8875-03092ba682cc"},{"objectId":"63c8b939752340715150f1c9","name":"Farooq","lastName":"Ahmad","uuid":"61440AE83BE88D8D1E75AA709E4E28DE1C231553E4E0B53F1331B3F125E48FEDAEE272F9AD09BE8C5B1C457F46A5BA395710ECEBF2AF1BEA99516D48A83EC28D","documentHash":"cb3e32a3-1ee4-486f-8259-1541b1825570"},{"objectId":"638971397523402e06153e9c","name":"Huma","lastName":"Jamil","documentHash":"2c7e10d7-8a65-4f3d-ae0d-c06089a410d1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6531004640970708a25324e9","doi":"10.1016/j.est.2023.108731","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352152X2302128X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Advances in graphene-based electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors: A review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The need for high-performance and environmental friendly energy storage systems has prompted researchers to develop novel and improved electrode materials that can meet the rapidly expanding worldwide market in various applications of energy consumption.

progressive retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa, arise from genetic and environmental perturbations of cellular and tissue homeostasis. These disruptions accumulate with repeated exposures to stress over time, leading to progressive visual impairment and, in many cases, legal blindness. Despite decades of research, therapeutic options for the millions of patients suffering from these disorders remain severely limited, especially for treating earlier stages of pathogenesis when the opportunity to preserve the retinal structure and visual function is greatest. To address this urgent, unmet medical need, we employed a systems pharmacology platform for therapeutic development. Through integrative single-cell transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics, we identified universal molecular mechanisms across distinct models of age-related and inherited retinal degenerations, characterized by impaired physiological resilience to stress. Here, we report that selective, targeted pharmacological inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which serve as critical regulatory nodes that modulate intracellular second messenger signaling pathways, stabilized the transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome through downstream activation of protective mechanisms coupled with synergistic inhibition of degenerative processes. This therapeutic intervention enhanced resilience to acute and chronic forms of stress in the degenerating retina, thus preserving tissue structure and function across various models of age-related and inherited retinal disease. Taken together, these findings exemplify a systems pharmacology approach to drug discovery and development, revealing a new class of therapeutics with potential clinical utility in the treatment or prevention of the most common causes of blindness"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"120","issue":"19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["655c9ca94097071dcb58f129","655c9ca94097071dcb58f12a","655c9ca94097071dcb58f12b","655c9ca94097071dcb58f12c","655c9ca94097071dcb58f12d","655c9ca94097071dcb58f12e","655c9ca94097071dcb58f12f","655c9ca94097071dcb58f130","655c9ca94097071dcb58f131","655c9ca94097071dcb58f132","655c9ca94097071dcb58f133","655c9ca94097071dcb58f134","655c9ca94097071dcb58f135","655c9ca94097071dcb58f136","655c9ca94097071dcb58f137","655c9ca94097071dcb58f138","655c9ca94097071dcb58f139","655c9ca94097071dcb58f13a","5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","655c9ca94097071dcb58f13b","655c9ca94097071dcb58f13c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793a7","mniswId":"16559","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","eissn":"0027-8424","documentHash":"6c7e55c8-7f5c-4cba-8821-15f816a6ebee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6512c21440970729414010c3","year":"2023","volume":"120","number":"19","documentHash":"b3bb6723-ce7c-4298-8e3d-e639dfadd533"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059031997"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6530fec540970708a25313d9","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Grotek","documentHash":"91e2e53c-f198-4c8e-af19-86c9055e4a6a"},{"objectId":"620b1e387523402df0840e1c","name":"Pumza","lastName":"Mente","uuid":"40350E0EFFEC8CCB7DB10B74B59D719E9B1CF1156238FD71538D6B5CDF9A60EDD01DA597EA9F2CC85EAB6D3AFF8F21E17A2DE5E302E11F584975942EADE07526","documentHash":"b1337c6d-9b49-4174-ba1f-eb78b9fdbe85"},{"objectId":"60c344639543c723365442c6","name":"Sada","lastName":"Raza","orcidId":"0000-0002-7409-4914","documentHash":"d31fa13d-70ec-4762-b908-adf5514aee27"},{"objectId":"60c2fce49543c72336543461","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Wdowiak","uuid":"F5BECBC8F8A9F5D587CC2E88EDF4FDD07EBAA5C3B6B2AACAB01368BD54777852964CA9152E868F8531C52E7412C63812CCE21360B0EDC398117660E5E5C891BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7822-9513","documentHash":"424e935a-387c-4d22-8b88-8b0edabb5042"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Nikiforow","uuid":"E166453BA6868F48895D87A86E6702843A623A59A84923A7C78B7FFBB992983C7D95FE6E5E79D29AB2127112DC3887B27E8FB1E44DE4688F1367FD5EA5783F74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6135-8514","documentHash":"c96f36f3-357e-4938-9d4c-83e71d392895"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","name":"Jan","lastName":"Paczesny","uuid":"22569BA0D9E03A26F0A64D7FCE396ED2ABE848430876A29510DE2522F2961D44598990961BF4B864621D02EECDE361E0D5D41E3F1FDFCA243A5BC52483EC38B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-3951","documentHash":"6d641bb0-96ee-402e-ac7c-55829c1da4b4"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea8","name":"Witold","lastName":"Adamkiewicz","uuid":"FBF310A430B16697C2E8EB33F018491B94532E797DD7E496549AD502626FC3CD99F66C857E50B113D41B4912AB002CA83B0EB1696FA6E2F091E4C91516798EAA","documentHash":"c7799f56-b806-4292-82cd-e4d5d89b6622"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"6530fec540970708a25313d7","doi":"10.1039/d3na00220a","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/NA/D3NA00220A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Enhancing the antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles against ESKAPE bacteria and emerging fungal pathogens by using tea extracts","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The sale of antibiotics and antifungals has skyrocketed since 2020.

Here, we propose a way to increase the antimicrobial efficiency of silver nanoparticles by using tea extracts (black, green, or red) for their synthesis. This allows for using lower concentrations of nanoparticles and obtaining the antimicrobial effect in a short time. We found that AgNPs synthesized using green tea extract (G-TeaNPs) are the most effective, causing approximately 80% bacterial cell death in Gram-negative bacteria within only 3 hours at a concentration of 0.1 mg mL-1, which is better than antibiotics. Ampicillin at the same concentration (0.1 mg mL-1) and within the same duration (3 h) causes only up to 40% decrease in the number of S. aureus and E. cloacae cells (non-resistant strains). The tested silver nanoparticles also have antifungal properties and are effective against C. auris and C. neoformans, which are difficult to eradicate using other means. We established that silver nanoparticles synthesized with tea extracts have higher antibacterial properties than silver nanoparticles alone. Such formulations using inexpensive tea extracts and lower concentrations of silver nanoparticles show a promising solution to fight various pathogens."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["620b1e387523402df0840e1c","60c344639543c723365442c6","60c2fce49543c72336543461","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e7093bb878c28a0473afea8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c344639543c723365442c6","60c2fce49543c72336543461","5e7093bb878c28a0473afea8","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","620b1e387523402df0840e1c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","6530fec540970708a25313d9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f137","mniswId":"27874","title":"Nanoscale Advances","issn":"2516-0230","eissn":"2516-0230","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"570db27f-5279-4051-a072-5b0db028519c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6530fec540970708a25313d8","year":"2023","documentHash":"4fdc6fc5-d43b-4a03-bdb6-03250a35b4a6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059032174"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7c6","name":"Jason D.","lastName":"Surratt","documentHash":"2d6cc9bc-735e-4c89-ac80-71168357e17e"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7c5","name":"Rebecca C.","lastName":"Fry","documentHash":"b24b1eb5-5a3a-4876-adfa-5ff062cd819c"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7c4","name":"Andrew P.","lastName":"Ault","documentHash":"36865d6a-cf2d-4788-a9d4-6a84f84c984f"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7c3","name":"Avram","lastName":"Gold","documentHash":"fa2feaeb-f648-4ab5-b7c7-9af9838861a4"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7c2","name":"Barbara J.","lastName":"Turpin","documentHash":"af6197d7-57bc-4fad-af4e-481849816abd"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7c1","name":"Andrew T.","lastName":"Lambe","documentHash":"c5bbcb48-421b-4fbd-9981-627a7bae56ab"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7c0","name":"Yue","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"9c6bb9e0-a716-4fb4-913c-3f18f7de993e"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7bf","name":"Zhenfa","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"6c2796d7-00f2-4278-b782-66ff796d6b42"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7be","name":"Anastasia","lastName":"Freedman","documentHash":"1093e836-6bda-48a2-923e-d95f6ca241de"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7bd","name":"Ying-Hsuan","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"103b8723-aff6-42b8-bc07-3e938864011e"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7bc","name":"Jin","lastName":"Yan","documentHash":"2a517248-25b8-4ab6-a628-4a0d1a284974"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7bb","name":"Hadley J.","lastName":"Hartwell","documentHash":"276223b5-ba91-49ab-83f6-353fae0c5944"},{"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7ba","name":"Yuzhi","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"ac3c85a1-26b3-4f94-8832-6603c70709af"},{"objectId":"60c9a35f9543c72336544549","name":"Faria","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"39E07C71126CB953A6B883C26E5F4C804EF2DC42D09B487F7ADE91C38454A282EA2A936446C3EC478FBC847A59A72B733F78A89BEF7FBEBDEBB7AEEB94E073CA","documentHash":"6e021189-63b7-4547-9e0d-f8adf3c62257"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Szmigielski","uuid":"8BA441832175E89B21F79F78CE35C01EAE6DA9568D355F2A4BFC7D823AB2D6D5C83D7B8E06C8BBC3896462D090D1BFEEFF6AC20665089B7B419A5802C9DAD013","orcidId":"0000-0003-3389-9318","documentHash":"b9e87d98-9f5d-4922-852b-1896bf4792e3"}],"objectId":"6568782340970771898be7b8","doi":"10.1021/acs.chemrestox.3c00278","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.3c00278","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Heterogeneous Oxidation Products of Fine Particulate Isoprene Epoxydiol-Derived Methyltetrol Sulfates Increase Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Gene Responses in Human Lung Cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hydroxyl radical (·OH)-initiated oxidation of isoprene, the most abundant nonmethane hydrocarbon in the atmosphere, is responsible for substantial amounts of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) within ambient fine particles. Fine particulate 2-methyltetrol sulfate diastereoisomers (2-MTSs) are abundant SOA products formed via acid-catalyzed multiphase chemistry of isoprene-derived epoxydiols with inorganic sulfate aerosols under low-nitric oxide conditions. We recently demonstrated that heterogeneous ·OH oxidation of particulate 2-MTSs leads to the particle-phase formation of multifunctional organosulfates (OSs). However, it remains uncertain if atmospheric chemical aging of particulate 2-MTSs induces toxic effects within human lung cells. We show that inhibitory concentration-50 (IC50) values decreased from exposure to fine particulate 2-MTSs that were heterogeneously aged for 0 to 22 days by ·OH, indicating increased particulate toxicity in BEAS-2B lung cells. Lung cells further exhibited concentration-dependent modulation of oxidative stress- and inflammatory-related gene expression. Principal component analysis was carried out on the chemical mixtures and revealed positive correlations between exposure to aged multifunctional OSs and altered expression of targeted genes. Exposure to particulate 2-MTSs alone was associated with an altered expression of antireactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes (NQO-1, SOD-2, and CAT) indicative of a response to ROS in the cells. Increased aging of particulate 2-MTSs by ·OH exposure was associated with an increased expression of glutathione pathway-related genes (GCLM and GCLC) and an anti-inflammatory gene (IL-10)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c9a35f9543c72336544549","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"36","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1814-1825","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c9a35f9543c72336544549","6568782340970771898be7ba","6568782340970771898be7bb","6568782340970771898be7bc","6568782340970771898be7bd","6568782340970771898be7be","6568782340970771898be7bf","6568782340970771898be7c0","6568782340970771898be7c1","6568782340970771898be7c2","6568782340970771898be7c3","6568782340970771898be7c4","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","6568782340970771898be7c5","6568782340970771898be7c6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775d7","mniswId":"3486","title":"Chemical Research in Toxicology","issn":"0893-228X","eissn":"1520-5010","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e9489c56-9161-4e11-aec1-790816908ef4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6568785240970771898beb21","year":"2023","volume":"36","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"484c14a0-28c7-4a75-8105-7440f301fc04"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059039055"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"653908e440970744d5b57a84","name":"Christian","lastName":"Holm","documentHash":"3dbe473f-0d4a-47c7-98f7-f0c0326bba73"},{"objectId":"653908e440970744d5b57a83","name":"Cheng","lastName":"Lian","documentHash":"96d15334-6184-4711-b42f-6fe51f7ead3f"},{"objectId":"653908e440970744d5b57a82","name":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"1fda8678-03b1-4362-9a43-5eee7859f81f"},{"objectId":"653908e440970744d5b57a81","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Schlaich","documentHash":"fcf61dfe-bf75-4c0d-b3b6-82a5fbc8f2a1"},{"objectId":"653908e440970744d5b57a80","name":"Henrik","lastName":"Jäger","documentHash":"61c93f25-3005-4855-8c66-36035821b4b5"},{"objectId":"5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","uuid":"4C8E231D76FA1FF9DEBFB40938EB36AF89D302A9BF4FB4483D4EB2BD2B36DFFFCE516493C98DF050048768547005AB2F2AB230D9F072ED3FD77064BDE749E112","orcidId":"0000-0003-4448-0686","documentHash":"22911df0-6857-4e43-8285-ca3bbbff21b2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"653908e440970744d5b57a7e","doi":"10.1039/d3fd00043e","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/FD/D3FD00043E","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A screening of results on the decay length in concentrated electrolytes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Screening of electrostatic interactions in room-temperature ionic liquids and concentrated electrolytes has recently attracted much attention as surface force balance experiments have suggested the emergence of unanticipated anomalously large screening lengths at high ion concentrations. Termed underscreening, this effect was ascribed to the bulk properties of concentrated ionic systems. However, underscreening under experimentally relevant conditions is not predicted by classical theories and challenges our understanding of electrostatic correlations. Despite the enormous effort in performing large-scale simulations and new theoretical investigations, the origin of the anomalously long-range screening length remains elusive. This contribution briefly summarises the experimental, analytical and simulation results on ionic screening and the scaling behaviour of screening lengths. We then present an atomistic simulation approach that accounts for the solvent and ion exchange with a reservoir. We find that classical density functional theory (DFT) for concentrated electrolytes under confinement reproduces ion adsorption at charged interfaces surprisingly well. With DFT, we study confined electrolytes using implicit and explicit solvent models and the dependence on the solvent's dielectric properties. Our results demonstrate how the absence vs. presence of solvent particles and their discrete nature affect the short and long-range screening in concentrated ionic systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"246","pagesFromTo":"520-539","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["653908e440970744d5b57a80","653908e440970744d5b57a81","653908e440970744d5b57a82","653908e440970744d5b57a83","5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","653908e440970744d5b57a84"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ca3","mniswId":"6517","title":"Faraday Discussions","doi":"10.1039/c8fd","issn":"1359-6640","eissn":"1364-5498","websiteLink":"http://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/faraday-discussions/","documentHash":"d779ee01-3194-4dc9-8268-499c8bc7378d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653908e440970744d5b57a7f","year":"2023","volume":"246","documentHash":"04c0b5f4-3092-47d1-bac6-23625e7930f0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059053222"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"653a6e4c409707573420548c","name":"Sunita","lastName":"Mishra","documentHash":"56fc8200-b78c-4977-99d8-a03dec7d3dcb"},{"objectId":"653a6e4c409707573420548b","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","documentHash":"3ea49fb2-52e5-4fd9-bf36-ecafc191d4a9"},{"objectId":"653a6e4c409707573420548a","name":"Isha","lastName":"Mudahar","documentHash":"7f89608a-6960-49ac-932f-ad834846b1b6"},{"objectId":"653a6e4c4097075734205489","name":"Prashant","lastName":"Dubey","documentHash":"a4db9421-eae4-4fc8-8014-042d8ebfdb8c"},{"objectId":"653a6e4c4097075734205488","name":"Ashwinder","lastName":"Kaur","documentHash":"1a007ffa-7cc2-405b-9026-9d4bffc229c7"},{"objectId":"632925a975234038513ec7cd","name":"Vishal","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"0D354B8FF99322E996FAD697B910B9306BF493B61B1F346347D695464BD50998A218E449DB5FC5607022C923AA46F5781E11CB0C661050D2DB1C6080ECBFEEED","documentHash":"7588df5d-7d93-4a1b-a3cc-2c5777e99ac2"}],"objectId":"653a6e4c4097075734205486","doi":"10.1021/acsanm.3c01897","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsanm.3c01897","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Surface and Diffusion Characteristics of Nanoporous UiO-66/Pineapple Peel-Derived Carbon Composites for Solid-State Supercapacitors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Supercapacitors (SCs) based on hierarchicalnanoporous frameworkcomposite materials and aqueous electrolytes are recent interestsfor the researchers.

After 5000 repeated charge-dischargecycles at 30 A g(-1), the specific capacitance ofthe device increased from 100% to 120% of its initial specific capacitance.This study emphasized the potential importance of incorporating MOFsinto pores of biowaste derived carbon as a strategy for enhancingthe charge storage kinetics of moderately conducting MOFs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["632925a975234038513ec7cd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["653a6e4c4097075734205488","632925a975234038513ec7cd","653a6e4c4097075734205489","653a6e4c409707573420548a","653a6e4c409707573420548b","653a6e4c409707573420548c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f09c","mniswId":"27715","title":"ACS Applied Nano Materials","issn":"2574-0970","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f73d5a60-05ef-4413-a88f-1f9aa61a0c30"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653a6e4c4097075734205487","year":"2023","documentHash":"882a4d3e-e659-4ae3-bf48-37b489420f00"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059055719"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656da4eb40970718551bc833","name":"Soumitra","lastName":"Satapathi","documentHash":"50876d20-290b-4665-8451-b1c963505170"},{"objectId":"656da4eb40970718551bc832","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"c3563bcd-9b35-4fe3-931b-a44034f68251"},{"objectId":"656da4eb40970718551bc831","name":"Naveen Kumar","lastName":"Tailor","documentHash":"667bab05-1167-45ad-ba14-1235e4980c64"},{"objectId":"60c301819543c723365439a6","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kruszyńska","uuid":"1F777AE05B68F47FCB90C9A543F50BFADEBC0C3E7A9D7AA41EEB4E98CFFF0E76E48911F3C0127FF5F1468ED98ECD75CF002FD533653E74BB57F4D6DC0AC1710C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5325-2496","documentHash":"62db7d6e-9c42-40c2-9924-e11570becb39"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"objectId":"656da4eb40970718551bc830","doi":"10.1002/adom.202301583","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adom.202301583","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Thermochromism in Bismuth Halide Perovskites with Cation and Anion Transmutation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bismuth halide perovskites are highly promising for various applications owing to their lower toxicity and greater environmental stability. The temperature-dependent color tunability of these materials renders them a strong contender for use in smart window applications and temperature sensors. To delve deeper into their properties, the thermochromism and fundamental lattice dynamics are investigated in bismuth halide perovskites through the transmutation of cation and anions, specifically focusing on Cs3Bi2Br9, MA3Bi2Br9, Cs2AgBiBr6, and Cs2AgBiCl6 perovskites. Absorption spectroscopy and powder-XRD patterns as a function of temperature reveal that 2D-layered Cs3Bi2Br9 and MA3Bi2Br9 perovskites exhibit significantly greater bandgap changes and thermal expansion compared to 3D connected Cs2AgBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskites attributed to more space in the 2D connected lattice. The reduction in bandgap and color variation in these perovskites stems from the intricate interplay between electron-phonon interactions and thermal expansion. Notably, it is found that the type of cation and anion play a crucial role in influencing the degree of thermochromism, as the electron-phonon coupling depends on this transformation. This study sheds new light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying the thermochromic behavior of bismuth halide perovskites and paves the way for the rational design and engineering of novel thermochromic materials with tailored properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c301819543c723365439a6","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656da4eb40970718551bc831","60c301819543c723365439a6","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","656da4eb40970718551bc832","656da4eb40970718551bc833"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e8a","mniswId":"435","title":"Advanced Optical Materials","issn":"2195-1071","eissn":"2195-1071","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"cde653be-07d7-4299-aabf-8f1d9787b119"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"643844514097076ac7dde301","year":"2023","documentHash":"39d43b2f-e133-4973-9532-27d4a0ef7a78"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059055748"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"653a6ec24097075734207d3f","name":"M.

Our experiments measuring the nonlinear absorption/refraction and leakage radiation microscopy (LRM) reveal that the intense Lorenz/Fano resonance of surface plasmon polaritons can occur in the PRGO-based waveguide. We also observe an increasing surface plasmon polaritons generation rate in PRGO-supported Au waveguide, a procedure similar to the spaser (surface plasmon nanolaser) mechanism. This, in turn, leads to increasing the propagation length. Furthermore, our analytical simulation results also suggest the suitability of PRGO as a superior optical material for spaser application. Our density functional calculations confirm that oxidised graphene has a more robust absorption spectrum in infrared wavelengths than pure graphene. Additionally, through van der Waals interaction, PRGO forms a more consistent and uniform bond with gold substrate than pristine graphene, reinforcing the suitability of PRGO as plasmonic waveguides."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61e634397523406748fb0476"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"639","pagesFromTo":"158120","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["653a6ec24097075734207d3c","653a6ec24097075734207d3d","653a6ec24097075734207d3e","61e634397523406748fb0476","653a6ec24097075734207d3f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477156","mniswId":"1525","title":"Applied Surface Science","issn":"0169-4332","eissn":"0169-4332","documentHash":"798a2408-defa-4d93-ad47-c74137d35e37"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"653a6ec24097075734207d3b","year":"2023","volume":"639","documentHash":"7f854756-ef40-4d66-bee7-5b3cbf60f60b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059055758"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"653a6ffb4097075734212180","name":"Erik M.

A perovskite solar cell architecture employs transporting layers to improve charge extraction and transport. Due to the wide variety of materials and preparation methods, it is critical to devise fast screening methods to rank transporting layers. Herein, we evaluate perovskite fluorescence quenching followed by time- and energy-resolved photoluminescence (TER-PL) and analyse the intensity dependence as a potential method to qualify charge-transporting layers rapidly. The capability of the technique was evaluated with TiO2/FAPbBr(3) and SnO2/FAPbBr(3), the most commonly used electron transporting layers, which were prepared using standard protocols to make best-performing devices. The results revealed that TiO2 is the most effective quencher due to the higher density of states in the conduction band, consistent with Marcus-Gerischer's theory. However, record-performance devices use SnO2 as the electron transport layer. This shows that the relationship between photoluminescence quenching and device performance is not bidirectional. Therefore, additional measurements like conductivity are also needed to provide reliable feedback for device performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"34","pagesFromTo":"22607-22613","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["653a6ffb409707573421217d","653a6ffb409707573421217e","653a6ffb409707573421217f","653a6ffb4097075734212180","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547925d","mniswId":"16075","title":"PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS","issn":"1463-9076","documentHash":"8e732841-944b-4696-92c7-03b5ad988f7d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f7161840970732fea71a44","year":"2023","volume":"25","number":"34","documentHash":"2fd8ad4c-8e4f-4eee-a2f3-36fe969878f3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059055910"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65cb329b409707626357e667","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Drużyński ","documentHash":"484e810f-0a8b-49e2-a6b1-3c434f4b646e"},{"objectId":"65cb329b409707626357e666","name":"Maria","lastName":"Jędrzejewska","documentHash":"1968d201-b594-4aed-b926-0c042eaaeb35"},{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b30aa","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wolska-Pietkiewicz","uuid":"14F1462CE6F77BB34DDF089C2BB8C1ED72D7B9F2957C7727A11D21F4421C2D3AA511C09BD9F88F05F92D7DF488E8992388FA03358A472D984DE89AE18E5ED80A","orcidId":"0000-0003-3161-8455","documentHash":"117bf24a-1f9c-49e0-8daf-883b398470d4"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"9BB0811617F37A3C112AC89C1AB184813530B9CAE96BA8B681D4AB1BAAAB23BD3D2582BB3010CF1C2228858BC7D1F3D96B655DFB488EF0C406CA60C54014C8EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3407-0395","documentHash":"5dab1440-5edf-40d2-afdd-05ff37f8a8af"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-10-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65689e904097077189931198","doi":"10.1039/d3tc02114a","publicUri":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2023/TC/D3TC02114A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Organometallic One-Pot Synthesis of ZnO Quantum Dots Coated by Sulfoxides as L–Type Ligands","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although an extraordinary amount of research into the chemistry of nanoscale zinc oxide (ZnO) has been conducted over the past three decades, application-driven design and reproducible fabrication of colloidal ZnO quantum dots (QDs) remain a great challenge. The application of low-molecular-weight, non-interfering protecting ligands may be potentially beneficial for the design of quantum-sized ZnO crystals, simultaneously providing colloidal stabilization and long-term functionality. Herein, we pursue the idea of ‘less is more’ and continue our systematic investigations on a non-external-surfactant-assisted organometallic approach for the preparation of colloidal ZnO QDs via direct injection of Et2Zn to ligand-like solvent followed by exposition towards atmospheric air as well as we introduce a novel approach toward ZnO QDs through the transformation of sulfoxide-modulated Et2Zn-based precursors in a THF solution. The application of sulfoxides as L-type protectors contributes to the formation of uniform ZnO QDs with average diameters of 5.4 to 8.2 nm, depending of the character of applied sulfoxide, and the low surface grafting density of the coating ligand without impeding their colloidal as well as solid-state stability. The reported QDs exhibit almost identical absorption parameters and show particularly long, multiexponential PL decays reaching recombination times up to 2.3–2.8 μs. In turn, preliminary control experiments involving photodegradation of methylene blue demonstrate dramatically different photocatalytic performance of QDs derived from the neat ligand-like solvent synthesis and the new approach based on the finetuning of precursors’ reactivity by Lewis-base chemical additives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65cb329b409707626357e666","5e709328878c28a0473a3f18"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"43","pagesFromTo":"15016-15029","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","65cb329b409707626357e666","5e7093e7878c28a0473b30aa","65cb329b409707626357e667"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547884c","mniswId":"11755","title":"Journal of Materials Chemistry C","issn":"2050-7534","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"35b18aa6-5c35-4cf5-8c51-6dad8fd7d081"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059056295"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"653fb44c4097076bc174ca67","name":"Akash","lastName":"Deep","documentHash":"83fb07af-929c-4132-a802-322e89681b57"},{"objectId":"653fb44c4097076bc174ca66","name":"Prashant","lastName":"Dubey","documentHash":"667dffb7-1bb1-4fec-abbe-ea18a5e331c1"},{"objectId":"653fb44c4097076bc174ca65","name":"-","lastName":"Mansi","documentHash":"49bff63c-1186-4f03-9aff-b2c148d7f3fe"},{"objectId":"653fb44c4097076bc174ca64","name":"Vaishali","lastName":"Shrivastav","documentHash":"0c2a326f-fa99-4e95-bc43-e6b65ab8a8be"},{"objectId":"632925a975234038513ec7cd","name":"Vishal","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"0D354B8FF99322E996FAD697B910B9306BF493B61B1F346347D695464BD50998A218E449DB5FC5607022C923AA46F5781E11CB0C661050D2DB1C6080ECBFEEED","documentHash":"7588df5d-7d93-4a1b-a3cc-2c5777e99ac2"},{"objectId":"62fef5a87523404ea24371aa","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","uuid":"6F9C3A0EF3007DEE8A2CC6A5051A1A4819F78767F8574EF11C2E9A4A894E3C14DDE5DCA35168189F7198156D76A2251C7F81CED040C57D4A631575AA76314E67","documentHash":"937c2285-0f6c-4107-bc0c-a0f5bd181b58"},{"objectId":"605d60749543c745d80e5a65","name":"Bhavana","lastName":"Gupta","uuid":"AC6B32A259B1EED07E7B7D122C124FA2584D1B82B4F45CC0C27768ECDC0E45D999F07DF9B0C583C66EC6E7ED36C4346B55C7FD0A32759764560A404DBD4DC401","orcidId":"0000-0001-9426-8750","documentHash":"fb539681-d025-47b3-a615-41ecb8bac193"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"}],"objectId":"653fb44c4097076bc174ca62","doi":"10.1016/j.cis.2023.102967","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0001868623001343?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Recent advances on surface mounted metal-organic frameworks for energy storage and conversion applications: Trends, challenges, and opportunities","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Establishing green and reliable energy resources is very important to counteract the carbon footprints and negative impact of non-renewable energy resources.

Recently, increased attention has been paid to surface mounted MOFs (SURMOFs), which is nothing but thin film of MOF, as a new category in nanotechnology having unique properties compared to bulk MOFs. With the advancement of material growth and synthesis technologies, the fine tunability of film thickness, consistency, size, and geometry with a wide range of MOF complexes is possible. In this review, we recapitulate various synthesis approaches of SURMOFs including epitaxial synthesis approach, direct solvothermal method, Langmuir-Blodgett LBL deposition, Inkjet printing technique and others and then correlated the synthesis-structure-property relationship in terms of energy storage and conversion applications.

However, improper interfacial charge transfer, perovskite degradation, and poor stability are major concerns for their commercialization and scale-up. Significant efforts have been made in recent years mainly by employing different strategies such as optimizing fabrication, developing novel materials, use of additives, and an interfacial layer in PSCs. Nowadays, carbon materials are widely recognized as promising candidates for alternative usage in PSCs because of their cost effectiveness, high conductivity, appropriate work function (5.0 eV), and low-temperature sintering process. In addition, the highly hydrophobic nature of the carbon-based materials prevents moisture penetration into the perovskite layer, resulting in enhanced stability. This review shows how effectively carbon-based materials can improve the performance of PSCs. First, the different carbon materials such as graphene and its derivatives, fullerenes and its derivatives, carbon quantum dots, and carbon nanotubes are described. Subsequently, the role of these carbon-based materials employed in electrontransport layers, hole-transport layers, and perovskite layers in PSCs is discussed. Thus, this review highlights the recent advancements made in carbon-based PSCs and their role in improving the performance of PSCs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6540f0954097077467d23f66","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","6540f0954097077467d23f67","6540f0954097077467d23f68","6540f0954097077467d23f69","6540f0954097077467d23f6a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ab8","mniswId":"5696","title":"Energy Technology","issn":"2194-4288","eissn":"2194-4296","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e764d95d-6fc8-4d99-aa65-5b232010cab5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6540f0954097077467d23f65","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"10","documentHash":"1249ab3f-47ac-4156-90a5-ae196365b574"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["additives","carbon nanotubes","carbon quantum dots","perovskite solar cells","graphene","fullerenes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059065928"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656da32740970718551b8e17","name":"S.","lastName":"Szymański","documentHash":"487c0867-8a6e-4022-9e27-fa9b3efb1445"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7cad","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bernatowicz","uuid":"40D29098F9743D6D91679CED45A43973D1A88464303D2A028CFEB3FE0C5030015CBF645DEF38136E22002A41DF2B95857F07E20977D64B0858903BD045636D6E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-0380","documentHash":"d73f2305-f1cd-4d43-a7d0-454ce3401fad"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ratajczyk","uuid":"D7BF159D17AA3F44A08389A461C0C453E3CFA0D80BDD70361E3C3FDAABAB66937DFBCBEDC5E928A5269A3370C62BD41F00F01DF11D10C408342FED73975BA671","orcidId":"0000-0003-1613-6933","documentHash":"aafca08f-0cdd-4319-8133-314824720e0a"}],"objectId":"656da32740970718551b8e15","doi":"10.1063/5.0167498","publicUri":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0167498/18138851/124304_1_5.0167498.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Non-uniform orientation of H2 molecules in a magnetic field as a critical condition for the appearance of partially negative NMR lines of o-H2 in hyperpolarization experiments using p-H2","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"In hyperpolarization experiments using parahydrogen, a partially negative line (PNL) of o-H2 is occasionally spotted in the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. This is a manifestation of the two-spin order (TSO) of the proton spins, appearing transiently in o-H2 molecules freshly derived from p-H2. For the TSO to be observable, the o-H2 NMR signal must be split into a doublet. In the literature, the splitting is believed to originate from a slow exchange of the dissolved dihydrogen with the dihydride moiety bound to a catalyst present in the reaction mixture. Because this hypothesis may be debatable, in this work a different splitting mechanism is proposed. It employs a residual dipolar coupling (RDC) between the hydrogen protons, originating from a partial orientation of the H2 molecules by the external magnetic field. The orientation effect is due to the anisotropic magnetic polarizability of H2. In a magnetic field of 11.74 T at room temperature, the currently predicted value of the RDC is -0.0024 Hz. Even such small RDC values are sufficient for the PNL effect to be clearly visible in NMR spectra for physically reasonable levels of the TSO in the o-H2 molecules. For RDC values much smaller than the natural linewidth of o-H2, the theoretical frequency distance between the minimum and maximum of PNL proves to be practically independent of the RDC and is of the order of the linewidth. The calculated amplitudes of the PNLs are proportional to the RDC values used in the calculations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7cad","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"159","issue":"12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709430878c28a0473b7cad","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","656da32740970718551b8e17"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478544","mniswId":"10440","title":"Journal of Chemical Physics","issn":"0021-9606","eissn":"1089-7690","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"20904248-8c4b-43a4-a2cb-343564302e7f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656da35340970718551b9435","year":"2023","volume":"159","number":"12","doi":"","documentHash":"53905184-0a4d-4414-84af-cbbee2f201e4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059068268"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656dc65640970718551f74eb","name":"Volkert","lastName":"van Steijn","documentHash":"c331bbd3-f902-4d16-8088-85d4bb4fe1d1"},{"objectId":"653c722a40e3ff4ef3f1c70b","name":"Tetuko","lastName":"Kurniawan","uuid":"BDDA132103A02CF275FA085A6B8C88905C2FC0F210B99E0816B30A2F8965FAA769742375DC749703D11EDEE2500D3919EBED51620C2B35FCEF39B580AC99EFFC","documentHash":"c1af3c6e-ea07-41ff-b075-56849ca01388"},{"objectId":"5fb3e020085dcb64f926a053","name":"Damian","lastName":"Zaremba","uuid":"F33C5C900714DDE927262AC0A3A4A6A5E446F4D9CB0638EA08E8BBEC21DF048C8D545DF57FDC146E3B1B455368BED805B2C84E2DE53FBEA9335C31F6092A03FC","orcidId":"0000-0001-9055-4960","documentHash":"1aaf0c01-5a6e-44d3-93e1-4f6cdbe0bf91"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c5942","name":"Mahsa","lastName":"Sahebdivani","uuid":"580A4984C62E388E548A43E062E5258B7BFABB52B4C120A7E5F13C5DD09679EA1B1EB3A6D9885207AA22D07931C7F16A9C261D5B5E30AB53C918883D5FD007A0","documentHash":"eb8f738e-f7c9-4d35-a8b7-e5cb19842a1c"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Garstecki","uuid":"75C65452002051CEFFE6071097E89DF6A74DD0FC1A118DE168CD40EFEDC485E8FF7DCB8A8288FEEBC45B2BDC2ADE2FC757D7CC1EB814D7EB9EAFD1588F4EB22E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9101-7163","documentHash":"cdc40e41-dc83-4780-be61-52db050a0f2d"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d79d","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Korczyk","uuid":"AD02C5DA330028429C1AA514AB6D789A3AE2875EAE2F09A11927AA7D74011336CAFA394E60C6BCC240D7BE48355F15296605336610F56FB167E87AB69BC56CD3","orcidId":"0000-0002-5445-7933","documentHash":"9ea6d230-aa20-4848-8e62-2eba51ce89f6"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396a6c","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Błoński","uuid":"8D06F70DB9A77B72B2042E4491146CA8CAD8D63A94D9BDEB0386C719E48101F99D4FECE957B559E92EFD671094453295C80E492D2DD6A0537A7334B66B177FC6","orcidId":"0000-0002-6998-8198","documentHash":"74dad8ee-31d0-411a-8169-4839c39b8529"}],"objectId":"656dc65640970718551f74e7","doi":"10.1016/j.cej.2023.145601","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1385894723043322?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Formation of droplets in microfluidic cross-junctions at small capillary numbers: Breakdown of the classical squeezing regime","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Two decades of research on droplet formation in microchannels have led to the widely accepted view that droplets form through the squeezing mechanism when interfacial forces dominate over viscous forces. The initially surprising finding that the volume of the droplets is insensitive to the relative importance of these two forces is nowadays well understood from the constrained deformation of the droplet interface during formation. In this work, we show a lower limit of the squeezing mechanism for droplets produced in microfluidic crossjunctions. Below this limit, in the leaking regime, which was recently discovered for droplets produced in Tjunctions, the volume of the produced droplets strongly depends on the relative importance of interfacial and viscous forces, as captured by the capillary number. We reveal a fundamental difference in the mechanisms at play in the leaking regime between T- and cross-junctions. In cross-junctions, the droplet neck elongates substantially, and unlike the case of the T-junction, the magnitude of this elongation depends strongly on the value of the capillary number. This elongation significantly affects the final droplet volume in a low capillary number regime. Generalizing the classical squeezing law by lifting the original assumptions and incorporating both identified mechanisms of leaking through gutters and neck elongation, we derive a model for droplet formation and show that it agrees with our experiments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii

molecular design of fullerene-based molecules with exceptional physical and electrical properties is in high demand to ensure efficient charge transport at the perovskite/electron transport layer interface. In this work, novel azahomofullerene (AHF) is designed, synthesized, and introduced as the interlayer between the SnO2/perovskite interface in planar n-i-p heterojunction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The AHF molecule (denoted as AHF-4) is proven to enhance charge transfer capability compared to the commonly used fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) due to its superior coordination interaction and electronic coupling with the SnO2 surface. In addition, the AHF-4 interlayer concurrently improves the quality of the perovskite film and reduces charge recombination in PSCs. The resultant AHF-4-based device exhibits a maximum efficiency of 21.43% with lower hysteresis compared to the PCBM device (18.56%). Benefiting from the enhanced stability of the AHF-4 film toward light soaking and elevated temperature, the AHF-4-based devices show improved stability under continuous 1 sun illumination at the maximum power point and 45 ?. Our work opens a new direction to the design of AHF derivatives with favorable physical and electrical properties as an interlayer material to improve both the performance and stability of PSCs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c301819543c723365439a6","629eb829752340212cd272f2","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"8309-8320","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629eb829752340212cd272f2","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","60c301819543c723365439a6","622ac2387523402df090302f","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d33","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","656f28a340970720e100db50","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","656f28a340970720e100db51","656f28a340970720e100db52","656f28a340970720e100db53","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775ef","mniswId":"3511","title":"Chemistry of Materials","issn":"0897-4756","documentHash":"24efdc86-948f-4ff8-9bbc-7299c29abdbf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656f28a340970720e100db4f","year":"2023","volume":"35","number":"19","documentHash":"a78387b7-49ff-459a-9a78-70d2a71dc55e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059075483"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656f375540970720e101c62d","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"aa841780-5752-4d8b-89ee-9a91024f40cc"},{"objectId":"656f375540970720e101c62c","name":"Soumitra","lastName":"Satapathi","documentHash":"f75b8826-d2f1-4df3-bca6-953870589730"},{"objectId":"656f375540970720e101c62b","name":"Seckin","lastName":"Akin","documentHash":"1f1e476d-0c07-4f76-bb58-358b167f0e84"},{"objectId":"656f375540970720e101c62a","name":"Abul","lastName":"Kalam","documentHash":"dc2c939f-54fa-43d4-8a8c-0bb8929f2757"},{"objectId":"656f375540970720e101c629","name":"Nishi","lastName":"Parikh","documentHash":"2d9110fa-f5ef-4bd9-a9b7-e8a92bc95c92"},{"objectId":"656f375540970720e101c628","name":"Siddhi Vinayak","lastName":"Pandey","documentHash":"070f4eba-e884-4efa-855e-853450658102"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"objectId":"656f375540970720e101c626","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c01850","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c01850","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Deconvoluting the Impedance Response of Halide Perovskite Single Crystals: The Distribution of Relaxation Time Method","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has beenemergingas a promising tool to study the core mechanisms occurring withinmetal halide perovskites (MHPs). Generally, MHPs show one or two semicirclesin the Nyquist spectra in the probed frequency range. However, inthe presence of external stimuli, often a Warburg diffusion or aninductive loop is observed at low frequencies. In such cases, a comparisonof low-frequency parameters in both cases cannot be drawn becauseof the lack of a unique electrical circuit (EC). To overcome the issueof lack of EC, transformation of the frequency-domain technique tothe time domain is carried out. In this work, we investigated threedifferent cases of MAPbI(3), MAPbBr(3), and surface-passivatedMAPbBr(3) single crystals (SCs), which showed one suppressedsemicircle, two semicircles, and a Warburg-like diffusion, respectively,in the Nyquist response of EIS. Next, we transformed these spectrainto the time domain using the distribution of relaxation times (DRT)technique, a machine-learning-assisted tool. The obtained resultssuggest that in the case of Nyquist spectra with one semicircle (thecase of MAPbI(3) SCs), the observed time constants usingEC and DRT are close enough. However, in the case of MAPbBr(3) SC, three different time constants are obtained, associated withhigh, medium, and low frequencies, although the Nyquist response showedtwo semicircles. At last, in the presence of surface-passivated SCs,the Warburg-like feature changes significantly for different passivationtimes.

After degassing, quantum yields of photodegradation are higher, but the photodecomposition rates decrease. Lower stability in deoxygenated solutions is due to much longer triplet lifetimes: 200-300 microseconds, compared to 200-360 ns in non-degassed toluene. For the zinc porphyrins, the LC-MS results show that the initial photoproduct contains two oxygen atoms. Based on electronic absorption and calculations, it is assigned to dehydrated zinc biladienone structure, relatively stable in toluene, but readily demetallated in dichloromethane. A similar species is formed also in the case of free bases, but it then undergoes hydration due to traces of water present in the solvent. Zinc derivatives were found to form biladienones even in degassed solutions. To explain this observation, we postulate formation of a complex with remaining oxygen or oxygen-containing species which is not removed by freeze-thaw procedure. This hypothesis is confirmed by MS results and by the analysis of photodegradation products obtained when zinc porphyrin is complexed with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Under these circumstances, changes in absorption are the same as in the absence of DMSO when non-degassed toluene is used, but irradiation of deoxygenated solutions leads to a different photoproduct. For both degassed and non-degassed solvents, complexation with DMSO results in the enhancement of photostability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942a878c28a0473b7799","5e7093b5878c28a0473af747","5e709490878c28a0473bf957","5e709490878c28a0473bf954","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709490878c28a0473bf954","5e7093b5878c28a0473af747","5e70942a878c28a0473b7799","5e709490878c28a0473bf957","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479240","mniswId":"16040","title":"PHOTOCHEMICAL & PHOTOBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","issn":"1474-905X","eissn":"1474-9092","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2fe10a90-1b87-49d7-9d6c-58f6fc8008cb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656f22b840970720e1ffebd7","year":"2023","documentHash":"9b712db9-b0e2-4a68-ab4e-592f8820d73f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059079054"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c32f759543c72336544028","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Zbonikowski","uuid":"E25732A6ACDE02743F9F906A933A6757F4B737A0260153E72970A6BCFDE691EA1C24C5547CC2F14AD23D2700E5102EEAB2D53C059CB3E79BEE06CD6DB7DDF399","documentHash":"5fd44a6e-8e9a-49c8-b194-772af721e253"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","name":"Jan","lastName":"Paczesny","uuid":"22569BA0D9E03A26F0A64D7FCE396ED2ABE848430876A29510DE2522F2961D44598990961BF4B864621D02EECDE361E0D5D41E3F1FDFCA243A5BC52483EC38B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-3951","documentHash":"6d641bb0-96ee-402e-ac7c-55829c1da4b4"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff78","name":"Michalina","lastName":"Iwan","uuid":"74D16E59F7C1714586F0AB24181DAA75D86E8C737B8094F63865BBCBF3F956AA09BB4CCE5C5B237EFB48A174C0AE3BB523BCAB220B0FDBE5D0D0EBE1086FB316","orcidId":"0000-0002-8590-883X","documentHash":"f66022c9-c39a-4539-b875-4f1fe5f78099"}],"objectId":"656f320c40970720e10173b2","doi":"10.1021/acsomega.3c01862","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.3c01862","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Stimuli-Responsive Langmuir Films Composed of Nanoparticles Decorated with Poly(<i>N</i>-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) at the Air/Water Interface","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The nanotechnology shift from static toward stimuli-responsivesystems is gaining momentum.

On the other hand, several recent experiments revealed a remarkable effect of spatial organization of an optical beam that propagates through a graded-index multimode optical fiber (MMF), a phenomenon termed beam self-cleaning. Our aim here is to evidence the qualitative impact of disorder (weak random mode coupling) on the process of Rayleigh–Jeans thermalization by considering two different experimental configurations. In a first experiment, we launch speckle beams in a relatively long MMF. Our results report a clear and definite experimental demonstration of Rayleigh–Jeans thermalization through light propagation in MMFs, over a broad range of kinetic energy (i.e., degree of spatial coherence) of the injected speckle beam. In particular, the property of energy equipartition among the modes is clearly observed in the condensed regime. The experimental results also evidence the double turbulence cascade process: while the power flows toward the fundamental mode (inverse cascade), the energy flows toward the higher-order modes (direct cascade). In a 2nd experiment, a coherent laser beam is launched into a relatively short MMF length. It reveals an effect of beam cleaning driven by an incipient process of Rayleigh–Jeans thermalization. As discussed through numerical simulations, the fast process of Rayleigh–Jeans thermalization observed in the 1st experiment can be attributed due to a random phase dynamics among the modes, which is favored by the injection of a speckle beam and the increased impact of disorder in the long fiber system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"545","pagesFromTo":"129716","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["655ca0334097071dcb59771e","655ca0334097071dcb59771f","655ca0334097071dcb597720","655ca0334097071dcb597721","655ca0334097071dcb597722","655ca0334097071dcb597723","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479114","mniswId":"15492","title":"Optics Communications","issn":"0030-4018","documentHash":"501677f9-2c4f-4124-a15d-326f45b0c2be"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64df4585409707264ca0acbc","year":"2023","volume":"545","documentHash":"e9f7580b-5adf-4388-a146-8f80de550b85"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059118079"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655cb3754097071dcb5bec97","name":"Almira","lastName":"Ramanaviciene","documentHash":"c64426dd-2dee-4f66-8d5c-94495296810d"},{"objectId":"655cb3754097071dcb5bec96","name":"Arunas","lastName":"Ramanavicius","documentHash":"d6e24343-3f6c-4f42-9e4a-f13e30074f9d"},{"objectId":"655cb3754097071dcb5bec95","name":"Mindaugas","lastName":"Kamarauskas","documentHash":"a67b41ca-12de-4b2d-a96f-7329d9e013ea"},{"objectId":"655cb3754097071dcb5bec94","name":"Benediktas","lastName":"Brasiunas","documentHash":"0fba8ded-1b73-4d97-a87b-068aeef49a93"},{"objectId":"655cb3754097071dcb5bec93","name":"Anton","lastName":"Popov","documentHash":"ad07ed4d-1046-4664-bbcd-e357e0f6c5a1"},{"objectId":"655cb3754097071dcb5bec91","name":"Aura","lastName":"Kisieliute","documentHash":"bff68417-b485-4b00-8979-a82b160ebbdb"},{"objectId":"655cb3754097071dcb5bec90","name":"Inga","lastName":"Morkvenaite-Vilkonciene","documentHash":"eccaca09-915b-4c2c-be4a-0be8431f02b2"},{"objectId":"602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b","name":"Steven","lastName":"Linfield","uuid":"8E09CFFFBEDD455A82435F50FC99FDB564D04FD8783608CF726C4868937FE5381DA040B0751F1336F128EB85FD58A7DCA2FB6DD92C5FD1DE85A22FCC89936D7A","orcidId":"0000-0001-9911-307X","documentHash":"41a79e77-8692-4c89-bd7f-14ed0eafee44"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"}],"objectId":"655cb3754097071dcb5bec8f","doi":"10.1016/j.electacta.2023.142790","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013468623009660?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Scanning electrochemical microscopy: Glucose oxidase as an electrochemical label in sandwich format immunoassay","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Electrochemical immunoassays can be developed in a way that allows them to become an alternative to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as clinical diagnostic tools. In this research, we propose an electrochemical sandwich immunoassay for the detection of human growth hormone (hGH) using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) on an array of 30 μm diameter gold micro-discs. The gold micro-discs were modified with a self-assembled monolayer, which was then used to covalently immobilize monoclonal antibodies against hGH (m-anti-hGH). After the hGH was captured by the m-anti-hGH, polyclonal detection antibodies conjugated with GOx (p-anti-hGH-GOx) interacted with the captured hGH, forming sandwich type immune complexes (Au-SAM/m-anti-hGH/hGH/p-anti-hGH-GOx). The substrate generation–tip collection (SG/TC) mode of SECM was then applied for the registration of GOx activity (which is proportional to the p-anti-hGH-GOx presence) using potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) as a redox mediator. It was shown that hGH concentrations as low as 40 nM could be detected by applying SECM to the sandwich immunoassay. The flux of the redox mediator from the gold micro-discs with formed sandwich type immune complexes after the addition of glucose was calculated using a mathematical model and the generation rate of [Fe(CN)6]4− in the presence of glucose was estimated to be 28 pmol s−1 cm−2. Thus, GOx was successfully applied as an electrochemical label for the detection of hGH in a sandwich type immunoassay by SECM operating in SG/TC mode. The methodology described herein could be adapted for the electrochemical detection of many other antigens of interest."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"463","pagesFromTo":"142790","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["655cb3754097071dcb5bec90","655cb3754097071dcb5bec91","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","655cb3754097071dcb5bec93","655cb3754097071dcb5bec94","655cb3754097071dcb5bec95","655cb3754097071dcb5bec96","602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b","655cb3754097071dcb5bec97"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a67","mniswId":"5553","title":"Electrochimica Acta","issn":"0013-4686","eissn":"1873-3859","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/electrochimica-acta/","documentHash":"9acc56c7-cbf9-4da3-b4ef-7d0a9cfd7d71"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64abac754097071386dc1c80","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"463","documentHash":"1d3a5734-30df-440f-8107-daafac6a5c35"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059118167"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655e0bbb40970728e33299a4","name":"Neerish","lastName":"Revaprasadu","documentHash":"bcc312c2-ebf1-425c-9a44-9dd4cd3506ca"},{"objectId":"655e0bbb40970728e33299a3","name":"Ram K.","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"3b0ac9cf-2515-45e8-a376-c96878e3aa5d"},{"objectId":"655e0bbb40970728e33299a2","name":"Jonghyun","lastName":"Choi","documentHash":"e2eedd4e-be29-4d91-a6b1-2a0314f2d823"},{"objectId":"655e0bbb40970728e33299a1","name":"Nyemaga Masanje","lastName":"Malima","documentHash":"ddd4139b-af49-481c-9f3b-2522c5ae8bd7"},{"objectId":"6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","name":"Malik","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"3F14D6BD4340633067804C270812A937F4E92325031BE1176142856E397CDDA3DE8C90CE8CB58D3FB67D87C91202A989955940DCCDD0BEF387B162A98B900235","orcidId":"0000-0002-3316-041X","documentHash":"b5f5ad91-b181-4281-9e6e-7bd70d906091"}],"objectId":"655e0bbb40970728e332999f","doi":"10.1016/j.matchemphys.2023.127770","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0254058423004789?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Alloying normal and inverse spinel (Zn–Co ferrite) nanostructures via direct precursor pyrolysis for enhanced supercapacitance and water splitting","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The nanocrystals comprising of multiple redox-active cations are generally proficient electrocatalysts for renewable and sustainable energy applications.

The solid solutions with composition Co0 center dot 4Zn0 center dot 6Fe2O4 demonstrated higher discharge time, indicating higher specific capacitance of the material than other electrode compositions. The Co0 center dot 8Zn0 center dot 2Fe2O4 showed relatively low overpotentials of 317 mV to afford the current density of 10 mA/cm(2) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while Co0 center dot 6Zn0 center dot 4Fe2O4 exhibited an overpotential of 169 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), outperforming most of the electrocatalysts reported in the literature.

Most importantly, the deposition of Ag/Au NPs on the Ge substrate and their size variation were thoroughly investigated by changing the precursor concentration. By increasing the precursor concentration (from 3 mM to 10 mM), the deposited Au NPs and Ag NPs' size on the Ge nanostructured surface was increased from & SIM;46 nm to & SIM;100 nm and from & SIM;43 nm to & SIM;70 nm, respectively. Subsequently, the as-fabricated hybrid (Ge-Au/Ge-Ag) NSs were effectively utilized to detect diverse hazardous molecules (e.g. picric acid and thiram) via the technique of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).

This property has a range of applications in various fields, from detecting small quantities of substances to studying the interactions between compounds and metals. Although the general mechanism of Raman signal enhancement by metal nanoparticles is accepted, details related to the interaction of the nanoparticle with the molecule are still unexplained because of its complexity. A versatile, high-resolution microscope system is required to investigate the spectroscopic properties of nanoparticles and the Raman signals enhanced by them. This study describes a multifunctional microscope system designed for comprehensive microspectroscopic analysis of plasmonic nanostructures functionalized with chemicals. The integrated system combines various excitation and detection modalities, enabling hyperspectral Raman mapping, Rayleigh (dark-field) scattering hyperspectral mapping, and angular scattering and emission mapping in defocused mode. The flexibility in excitation wavenumber choice ensures optimal measurement efficiency and the ability to perform all measurements as a function of excitation. We demonstrate the system's capabilities using malachite green deposited on gold nanorods, showcasing the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) excitation profiles and scattering directionality defocused imaging using the hyperspectral imaging of the angular distribution of Raman scattering technique. This integrated microscope system promises to advance the study of plasmonic nanostructures and their interactions with chemical compounds at the single-particle level. The construction of a multimodal Raman microscopic system that enables hyperspectral imaging of the angular distribution of Raman scattering and dark-field scattering, as well as Raman excitation profiles, is presented.

However, driving the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is challenging, because the linear molecular structure of CO2 is chemically inert with a low electron affinity. Thermal, light, and electrochemical energy are typically utilized to drive the CO2RR. One alternative route to reduce CO2 is via piezocatalysis. Piezocatalysis exploits the polarization of a material upon applying mechanical stress which enables spatial separation of the mechanically produced charge carriers to inhibit recombination. A piezocatalyst is uniquely suited to drive the CO2RR even in the dark without external heating and a sacrificial compound. Although the piezocatalytic CO2RR is just beginning to be explored, it is foreseen to become one of the most important scenarios for CO2 utilization. In this perspective, we discuss prospects and challenges of the piezocatalytic CO2RR. The received hypotheses on the piezocatalysis mechanism are critically discussed. Guidelines to obtain a potentially efficient piezocatalyst are outlined. We expect our contribution to inspire readers to get involved in this promising new area of research and bring it in the right direction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"45","pagesFromTo":"24566-24590","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6569cade4097077c0478744a","6569cade4097077c0478744b","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547884a","mniswId":"11753","title":"Journal of Materials Chemistry.

We show that the combination of carboxylated pillar[5]-arene with bis-(biguanidinium) guest alexidine results in the crystallization of open-type supramolecular architecture. This is also the first crystal structure of alexidine ever reported. The crystallization of pillar[5]-arene with biguanidinium drug phenformin affects a rare solid-state complex comprising two cavity inclusion modes within the same crystal lattice. The winner in the competition between ethanol molecules and an organic cation (phenformin) for access to the cavity of pillar[5]-arene is undecided, visualized as a \"snapshot\" of these two inclusion possibilities in one crystal structure. Our results demonstrate that carboxylated pillar-[n]-arenes can be a useful addition to the macrocyclic toolkit for the facilitation of the crystallization of bio-(macro)-molecules. Moreover, the IM-MS analysis of the precrystallization solutions of pillar[5]-arene host and biguanide guests has shown the presence of structures and conformations closely related to those observed in the crystal forms. The most intriguing results obtained for a pillar[5]-arene-alexidine complex imply a conformational evolution of the complex over 24 h. The IM-MS analysis complemented by theoretical calculations may be applied to predict and examine the crystallization process of host-guest systems, complementing crystallographic studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e8878c28a0473b314c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","5e7093ea878c28a0473b31fe","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"8230-8240","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b31fe","5e7093e8878c28a0473b314c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547784f","mniswId":"4571","title":"Crystal Growth & Design","issn":"1528-7483","documentHash":"f8c21ef7-a91a-4d7b-b09b-bf0b11c12815"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6569cc4b4097077c0478a921","year":"2023","volume":"23","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"972e42fc-9f63-4f70-9114-798c6b6b1816"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059134945"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6569e7ab4097077c047b0a3b","name":"Waheed","lastName":"Al-Masry","documentHash":"1080e785-32da-47c8-93df-a73d8eb80b64"},{"objectId":"6569e7ab4097077c047b0a3a","name":"Asif","lastName":"Mahmood","documentHash":"6277fa8c-62a6-4e60-a2a2-1afb12a82480"},{"objectId":"6569e7ab4097077c047b0a39","name":"Sadaf Ul","lastName":"Hassan","documentHash":"adb509ea-2fe9-483c-9e56-aa73176f4a73"},{"objectId":"6569e7ab4097077c047b0a38","name":"Toheed","lastName":"Akhter","documentHash":"cad8b1e0-2576-44f6-87b2-a9ce8b26c0ea"},{"objectId":"6569e7ab4097077c047b0a37","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Maqbool","documentHash":"7d27274e-cd93-4bc4-b719-29c8b4b98766"},{"objectId":"6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","name":"Shumaila","lastName":"Razzaque","uuid":"261A1A977BE4EBBB10518C9A7232243A314300947F089B5F096212DB1251D7A0E00CD43D305FDC10FC626B597CB0221BA7C0E5FD5D9A0908F94649ACF2D8F675","documentHash":"285a1ffb-e5f7-47d0-ad8f-de3058e74c54"}],"objectId":"6569e7ab4097077c047b0a35","doi":"10.1039/d3ra05858a","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/RA/D3RA05858A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Development of a chromium oxide loaded mesoporous silica as an efficient catalyst for carbon dioxide-free production of ethylene oxide","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ethylene oxide (EO) is a significant raw material used in many commodities for consumers, particularly ethoxylates, polymers, and certain other glycol derivatives. We synthesized a catalyst by incorporation of chromium oxide into a mesoporous silica material (Cr/MSM) via the hydrothermal method, an effective catalyst for partial ethylene oxidation for producing carbon dioxide (CO2) free EO. Subsequently, XRD, BET, XPS, and TEM were used to analyse the structural characteristics of the Cr/MSM catalyst. The catalytic performance of the synthesized catalyst was assessed in the liquid-phase epoxidation (LPE) of ethylene, utilizing peracetic acid (PAA) as an oxidant. This approach not only circumvented the generation of CO2 but also mitigated the risk of metal leaching. Confirmation of the successful production of EO was achieved through GC chromatography, where the presence of a peak with a retention time (RT) of 8.91 minutes served as conclusive evidence. We systematically explored a range of reaction parameters, including temperature, catalyst concentration, the molar ratio of ethylene to PAA, and solvent effect. This comprehensive investigation aimed to fine-tune the reaction conditions, ultimately improving ethylene conversion and enhancing the selectivity of the catalyst for EO production. This approach can effectively resolve the issues of greenhouse gas emissions and metal leaching that had been associated with previously reported catalysts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6375aab9752340568bfffcd4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"46","pagesFromTo":"32424-32432","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6569e7ab4097077c047b0a37","6569e7ab4097077c047b0a38","6569e7ab4097077c047b0a39","6569e7ab4097077c047b0a3a","6569e7ab4097077c047b0a3b","6375aab9752340568bfffcd4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547962f","mniswId":"18024","title":"RSC Advances","doi":"10.1039/c5ra","issn":"2046-2069","eissn":"2046-2069","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Journals/JournalIssues/RA","documentHash":"e0547e10-6160-4835-83e0-233c581cb0b6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6569e7ab4097077c047b0a36","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"46","documentHash":"3e63dedd-e2b4-4909-a80f-75cb34ddb078"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059138025"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"650907a940e3ff0176695d84","name":"Khrystyna","lastName":"Haydukivska","uuid":"98E8EDAA81383A1E1B76A7E25207678A68BBE8F196B09775F509B10AE946549E47834E2D2040D6157D742ABF864E2FE72A34675C30BBE949B75964D1EAAB4511","documentHash":"046681f5-7945-4ee4-9edf-cedad4752034"},{"objectId":"636dc1b87523405a7dd0411a","name":"Viktoriya","lastName":"Blavatska","uuid":"F461CD63D3BD823F0773DC006A87A8F76D6A2F4204D76AE1DB657ADB0E26F20F8B7F1CC5E50A9E86147DA9A605574508D73256D6C9900C0F7FCC52408A03895C","documentHash":"6887b7c0-cbde-4491-9d63-8c535234d918"},{"objectId":"5e7092a7878c28a047399f68","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Paturej","uuid":"49FC9EFBFD666E9234A9235CF202D56B55933A6C2A0175B91491F7FB6B31D84E72E507653C26B8ABD9CA84DC0BADF4900F57DBBCE6E333DC8BFF69432DAA69F3","documentHash":"89f5f73b-b89c-46da-aa4a-10adfdac9bf0"}],"objectId":"657f543a409707379c8468b5","doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2023.123430","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0167732223022365?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The size and shape of snowflake-shaped polymers in dilute solution: Analytical and numerical approaches","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate the conformational properties of a hyper-branched polymer structure with a dendrimer-like topology, known as a snowflake polymer.

To analyze the conformational properties, we have employed various approaches, including analytical methods based on direct polymer renormalization and the Wei’s approach as well as numerical molecular dynamics simulations.

This study purposed to use ubiquinone (Q10) as an antioxidant and catharanthine alkaloid as a cAMP inducer suppressing HepG2 cells by reducing Nrf2 level. The effects of Q10 and catharanthine on HepG2 cells in terms of viability were analyzed by MTT test. MTT results were used to determine the effective concentration of both drugs for the subsequent treatment and analysis. Subsequently, the effects of Q10 and catharanthine in a single and combined manner on oxidant/antioxidant status, apoptosis, metastasis, and drug resistance of HepG2 cells were investigated by related methods. Both Q10 and catharanthine decreased the level of oxidative stress products and increased antioxidant capacity in HepG2 cells. Nrf2 gene expression decreased by Q10, but catharanthine unexpectedly increased it. Following Nrf2 alterations, the expression levels of MMP-9 and MRP1 involved in metastasis and drug resistance were significantly and dose-dependently decreased by Q10, while catharanthine slightly increased both. However, both drugs increased caspase 3/7 activity and apoptosis rate, and the effect of Q10 on apoptosis was stronger than that of catharanthine. Most of the effects of the combination treatments were similar to those of the Q10 single treatment and indicated the dominant effect over the catharanthine component. Despite the antioxidant and apoptotic properties of both agents, Q10 was better than catharanthine in inducing apoptosis, counteracting drug resistance, and metastasis in HepG2 cells."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656d975a409707185519d92a","656d975a409707185519d92b","656d975a409707185519d92c","656d975a409707185519d92d","60c2fc239543c7233654339a","656d975a409707185519d92e","656d975a409707185519d92f","656d975a409707185519d930"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f9c","mniswId":"14856","title":"Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology","issn":"0028-1298","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3a12fc73-1aab-444e-9c05-18beae008a61"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656d975a409707185519d929","year":"2023","documentHash":"84917e72-6d42-4dfc-8bd6-ec3bc4babb4f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059147271"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656dd6504097071855221727","name":"Olga","lastName":"Abraimova","documentHash":"222b2e2c-db78-49b1-bc83-76716a56fc39"},{"objectId":"656dd6504097071855221726","name":"Ganna","lastName":"Maslak","documentHash":"e66555a8-02be-4c23-a9cd-b4e27f0a374a"},{"objectId":"62737fab75234020645676e7","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Poltavets","uuid":"C03D320CB07B7C146A55CA76CB9EDA4033F15C508254C9769F690EB2DC2E51CFDA2EAF9D91246367CBAA9F27BCEA8F98F851E9E04DF218F0667EDF7F86AA63CE","documentHash":"5ca15d56-5e2e-4faf-8fc8-a050af380885"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":"D0CA32E93E9BF9AA7A1FA0E9572784496A92D9583AD152770FB1A36E4763F14D4F58D56CE4A4D42AD08B96A41754B831979DEF89310D2583C4D0AAFD7906703A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5241-9610","documentHash":"abd02632-13c5-4997-8d0a-0ccb66df4ef4"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","name":"Anders","lastName":"Jonsson-Niedziółka","uuid":"3394A368CB0E6B611D461246FA8924DA0550D7AF68CD7EBB72456860833F46CDC79A875204939C5A2F631BE36B09951DDC56FAB1B1015A54CDFB0E1A1E128C0B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5642-5946","documentHash":"68cb99b8-33a0-4453-8724-820d86d19c36"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"656dd6504097071855221724","doi":"10.1039/d3dt02199h","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/DT/D3DT02199H","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Formation of MnO<sub>2</sub>-coated ITO electrodes with high catalytic activity for enzymatic glucose detection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present the formation of a cheap and environmentally friendly working electrode material for glucose biosensors with good catalytic properties. The classic electrode in such devices consists of a conductive material modified with the enzyme glucose oxidase. The working principle is the electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide as a product of the enzymatic transformation of glucose. As a base material, we offer manganese dioxide; it is a natural highly selective catalyst for the decomposition of H2O2 and is electrochemically deposited onto the surface of ITO. We approached the formation of MnO2 films systematically. By changing parameters such as the deposition method, pH of the electrolyte, and the drying temperature of the precipitate, a series of electrodes were formed. These electrodes were characterized by SEM, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and XPS and their electrocatalytic activity was studied. Significant differences in the sensitivity of the electrodes were detected. The manganese dioxide film with the best catalytic characteristics is formed in the electrolyte with pH 1 by cyclic voltammetry and then drying at 60 degree celsius. The surface of the electrode was then modified with a solution of GOx enzyme with a concentration of 2 mg ml(-1) (100-250 units per mg solid). The sensitivity of such an electrode is 117.8 mu A mmol(-1) cm(-2). The range of determined concentrations of glucose is from 0.1 mM to 3 mM. The sensitivity is comparable to that of electrodes based on expensive materials such as graphene and noble metals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62737fab75234020645676e7","5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"52","issue":"38","pagesFromTo":"13769-13780","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62737fab75234020645676e7","656dd6504097071855221726","656dd6504097071855221727","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","5e709491878c28a0473bfac0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778f6","mniswId":"4868","title":"Dalton Transactions","doi":"10.1039/c5dt","issn":"1477-9226","eissn":"1477-9234","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/dt","documentHash":"36c7053d-ce23-4ec3-9b37-3552e1f9c3ba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656dd6504097071855221725","year":"2023","volume":"52","number":"38","documentHash":"c8b5a548-ee2f-42fe-a2ab-8b645f6a09b1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059153781"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656dc96c40970718552014d1","name":"Yue","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"a29662ab-ca81-42b9-995e-6ec0415a35cf"},{"objectId":"656dc96c40970718552014d0","name":"Ruizhe","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"8de0c624-cb2e-429b-be33-dfff0a25dc13"},{"objectId":"656dc96c40970718552014cf","name":"Sahir","lastName":"Gagan","documentHash":"966de643-d4c4-4726-9ce2-e1c450f8a7aa"},{"objectId":"5fc4bba0085dcb1e6ae0b8d5","name":"Kumar","lastName":"Kumar Sarang","uuid":"EADCAB66EFAC0CB625A173B40003C54E95EE33E1593EA935CC23A15D6ACB90071DE05B7D2197AA65DA6BA707046C5D6470DE18F2FD9EE77CA14D48F55B2E919F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0613-1867","documentHash":"22e0d982-ea21-477e-b4c2-93b9d07f04e2"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5974","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rudziński","uuid":"3D506125510B3BBBBC100FED79F7B850A30F8D8147B86F25C7B7C88D7EE86B7DABC6B2827FC4B337FD7C25E356AF6293D4516CDEF0F0B5BB30FD46F7CBC466B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5785-9751","documentHash":"7412096e-82dd-41fd-a947-0b5456249825"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Szmigielski","uuid":"8BA441832175E89B21F79F78CE35C01EAE6DA9568D355F2A4BFC7D823AB2D6D5C83D7B8E06C8BBC3896462D090D1BFEEFF6AC20665089B7B419A5802C9DAD013","orcidId":"0000-0003-3389-9318","documentHash":"b9e87d98-9f5d-4922-852b-1896bf4792e3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"656dc96c40970718552014ce","doi":"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.120017","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1352231023004430?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Synthetic strategies for oxidation products from biogenic volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere: A review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by biogenic and anthropogenic sources undergo complex reactions with atmospheric oxidants to generate low-volatility organic species that can form secondary organic aerosols (SOA). SOA accounts for up to 80% mass of the tropospheric fine particulate matter and can significantly impact air quality, public health, and climate. Biogenic VOCs (BVOCs) emitted by terrestrial vegetation, including isoprene and terpenes, account for 90% of the global VOC emission and largely contribute to the total SOA budget. However, the formation of SOA from BVOCs is still under active research due to the complex chemistry involved. To accurately identify and quantify the SOA components and elucidate their formation mechanisms, authentic standards are necessary and often need to be synthesized due to their commercial unavailability. This review summarizes the tremendous progress made in synthesizing marker compounds that fingerprint SOA originating from key BVOCs. The up-to-date synthetic procedures in this article are systematically organized by the oxidation reaction pathways of each BVOC. This review demonstrates the importance of organic synthesis in understanding air quality and climate change, and provides future directions to further connect atmospheric sciences with organic chemistry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4bba0085dcb1e6ae0b8d5","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"312","pagesFromTo":"120017","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656dc96c40970718552014cf","5fc4bba0085dcb1e6ae0b8d5","656dc96c40970718552014d0","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","656dc96c40970718552014d1","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724e","mniswId":"2027","title":"Atmospheric Environment","issn":"1352-2310","documentHash":"8410b299-0ed5-4d8a-af23-45221cc3b089"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6548ce724097072019f216b4","year":"2023","volume":"312","documentHash":"ced40c1d-dade-4b3b-9c67-a52a0e245aae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059153923"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb067","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Żuk","uuid":"A2CF96DA8DBC0F0EC756C6ABC4425D960DE3CE0ABBAA543C816DF4A24FDC838930FFB8FDCE1B3C5232CB0C3FD9D93CDDF5F6336061F13F18AC43F6C77E9DD4F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0555-5913","documentHash":"323764fb-47c8-4632-b36c-1a2615cfd8d2"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Giżyński","uuid":"7AEDD73DD5B1257841075AC646D7AF5FC2472AC6E46D6B167FA3D962FDEFA3E257CD7B398C64DC6A04810369674D2DCA9ABA0C97270D398AA0B697F0E2F788ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-3547-1174","documentHash":"1424e1a0-06b3-460a-9b83-8855874b6421"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maciołek","uuid":"E3E9BCC7397B929B2C469D73E68AE44FB2E6F4892A7DC44C238F904FE76F9D470FD528254865B02108CA8B9311A7A421914ADC30598B3516CDD6CB7BF0F07C81","orcidId":"0000-0002-2371-4183","documentHash":"d2f0a437-c8a3-4dc0-9358-3f2e9c4648e4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","name":"Karol","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"30216860D4FCF71F80CCF2F14F9FA6358B5A0632271ACE53CD62EC8265F97928E335571E5A301CC0BA9C252A21169DB64AF4E27EC652B74805AD01BFF7BDF4DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9769-7646","documentHash":"3ea17df7-ffc6-4937-bb72-a24f676f97e3"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hołyst","uuid":"E92F295C3CC2CB6B18C450B2AB735CDA75E1B176DB096D3C43CB9E6E23F05E2B3448297032B471C71265740E595D30DAA6BA0B89CC0DB4589E73DB45075B7008","orcidId":"0000-0002-3211-4286","documentHash":"cbe7625d-9b95-4888-b28d-a8e3f921d07f"}],"objectId":"656f273240970720e1009020","doi":"10.3390/e25091295","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/9/1295/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Fundamental Relation for Gas of Interacting Particles in a Heat Flow","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"There is a long-standing question of whether it is possible to extend the formalism of equilibrium thermodynamics to the case of nonequilibrium systems in steady-states. We have made such an extension for an ideal gas in a heat flow. Here, we investigated whether such a description exists for the system with interactions: the van der Waals gas in a heat flow. We introduced a steady-state fundamental relation and the parameters of state, each associated with a single way of changing energy. The first law of nonequilibrium thermodynamics follows from these parameters. The internal energy U for the nonequilibrium states has the same form as in equilibrium thermodynamics. For the van der Waals gas, U(S*,V,N,a*,b*) is a function of only five parameters of state (irrespective of the number of parameters characterizing the boundary conditions): the effective entropy S*, volume V, number of particles N, and rescaled van der Waals parameters a*, b*. The state parameters, a*, b*, together with S*, determine the net heat exchange with the environment. The net heat differential does not have an integrating factor. As in equilibrium thermodynamics, the steady-state fundamental equation also leads to the thermodynamic Maxwell relations for measurable steady-state properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","5e709459878c28a0473bb067","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1295","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","5e709459878c28a0473bb067"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ae1","mniswId":"5774","title":"Entropy","issn":"1099-4300","eissn":"1099-4300","documentHash":"c2505e37-b3c1-4d6b-b857-767b4daf7a4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6500023040970739aa2d9ce9","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"25","number":"9","documentHash":"c9de9ce8-7d87-4c9a-a34d-21fc6be3bc30"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059160533"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658429664097075aba67f110","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bieńkowski","documentHash":"a440c9ae-d80c-495b-b25c-282bc5dc86f5"},{"objectId":"60dda4479543c7233654463c","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ambroziak","uuid":"E28B4465CC430F2FC9B36F74A3AB1503AC9E5B992341669F4113874245451DF1EE6537AC66406925F40C4F61CBC7D02FD50EFCBAADC1CFCA08644E8AC4FBA899","orcidId":"0000-0001-8581-9119","documentHash":"b3a0e440-6cef-4a22-8004-f43305b96a85"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":"D0CA32E93E9BF9AA7A1FA0E9572784496A92D9583AD152770FB1A36E4763F14D4F58D56CE4A4D42AD08B96A41754B831979DEF89310D2583C4D0AAFD7906703A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5241-9610","documentHash":"abd02632-13c5-4997-8d0a-0ccb66df4ef4"},{"objectId":"5e7093d9878c28a0473b1e03","name":"Agata","lastName":"Roguska","uuid":"9C022051902B18A4D49FF0030566FC0CCDE045469CE4657C6BB8F7EB57FCDFF21311456EB3F103705279302463DA7AB76ED80DBFBF525B1131EAB4142FCA1D27","orcidId":"0000-0001-9189-4879","documentHash":"e20eca24-ab1b-4b75-aa0a-7119b2db77d7"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pisarek","uuid":"394C70A4B68190862754D0C9C71B0CB236E956007955224514CD5CC84EABBD07900FBD9AC8AACDBDD5E542D5CC809EC02A9E49AFFB1DCA527F248F357949EFB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7424-5954","documentHash":"f7a53170-9e7f-4afd-bea7-cb1ef6322bc6"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb66","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kudelski","uuid":"7F8174ECD63E67E35E7B0327ECFC0DB86776062FA9081C0D24B59F08BE6AD1E6E4D671507EB6817C300B3DFE7A01D6E029CDD9A8579C1B6915C5A960109BEBAA","orcidId":"0000-0003-1452-5951","documentHash":"81ebc194-5fbf-4d09-a925-bb7e6d2e83dc"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac852","name":"Jan","lastName":"Krajczewski","uuid":"D2D819CE90BD6EE7AF63845986425333B86BCCCC159E65944D88D8A9F6F4C6888466075F1EECB75FA0A5A97820796F931EE3EDEEFF3E81D7C7E356AD90883DB7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9629-6448","documentHash":"a82bc041-0915-4757-a0ad-829fedeb350e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"658429664097075aba67f10c","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c04147","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c04147","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Hybrid Nanostructures Based on TiO2 Nanotubes with Ag, Au, or Bimetallic Au–Ag Deposits for Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) Applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The work shows the possibility of obtaining active platforms for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements based on TiO2 nanotubes decorated with Ag, Au, or Au–Ag bimetallic layers. Plasmonic metallic layers were produced under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions using the thermal evaporation method and heat treatment, which enabled them to be formed with a precisely defined thickness and size of metallic nanoparticles. The two-stage thermal treatment leads to the formation of an Ag–Au bimetallic alloy on the top of the nanotubes. In all cases, the thickness of the deposited metal layer was 10 nm. Therefore, the materials prepared in the form of decorated nanoplasmonic antennas (nanobrushes) were tested for their use as active and effective substrates in SERS spectroscopy. For this purpose, the probe molecule mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) was used. The highest SERS enhancement factor was determined for the substrate with a monometallic Ag layer (1.5̇̇ × 105), then for the Ag–Au alloy (1.7 × 104), monometallic Au layer (9.6 × 103), and gold/silver layer-by-layer systems (∼5.6 × 103). The practical usefulness of the prepared SERS substrates was determined based on vitamin B12 detection measurements. The results showed that the proposed SERS substrates have a high detection sensitivity of 10–8 M and measurement stability. Moreover, the conducted research showed that the most important factors influencing the enhancement due to the electromagnetic mechanism are geometric factors related to the distribution of plasmonic metals on the tops and walls of nanotubes, their size, and chemical composition. Moreover, the chemical composition of the examined deposits turned out to be an important factor affecting the plasmonic properties of the produced SERS platforms. Apart from SERS spectroscopy, other research methods were used to characterize the obtained materials, such as UV–vis spectroscopy, XPS spectroscopy (in situ), XRD structural analysis, and scanning electron microscopy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb66","5e70938d878c28a0473ac852"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60dda4479543c7233654463c","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","5e7093d9878c28a0473b1e03","5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"127","issue":"50","pagesFromTo":"24200–24210","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","60dda4479543c7233654463c","658429664097075aba67f110","5e7093d9878c28a0473b1e03","5e70938d878c28a0473ac852","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb66"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a2","mniswId":"12286","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry C","issn":"1932-7447","eissn":"1932-7455","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c69a966f-fba3-41b9-8902-e029fec3f1ca"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059167291"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65a650fc4097071977d9bf69","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Słowiński","documentHash":"6eef01af-531e-4300-ad61-2430ae0d5486"},{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6b70","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Berus","uuid":"7815C16291F02480DD49EBB8325DCA99B488C88A3FAFEF5DF72BC897B1E71A3B5298546D057A8D69AF1B529FD223FB58B390215962E0B4DF01BD71E7AD8E7CCF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1321-3884","documentHash":"d80e0c0a-2b2c-406a-9f70-bcef54688730"},{"objectId":"5e709415878c28a0473b5f14","name":"Ariadna","lastName":"Nowicka","uuid":"B318030CB012646CFC882DEC2887F50D32BD8DFE0C0F4AC751F0029D81CA23DA4440D3FB4BC49952FC8DFF63883DC78F99C00F05B568E8DB98717F29CDDE1AC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-5482-2427","documentHash":"bfd343a1-bf4b-4b3b-886d-8f017e22febd"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0030","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szymborski","uuid":"954854E6F2B443EC1CEB9F87B01EE762AF5FD41964DF487AECCC88636584A873D6A10C14419BE9300C7867D99C4B0428A933B1CC8AEFC11FFBA4EA05B9BB8898","orcidId":"0000-0002-7308-0609","documentHash":"947670c0-098e-4473-88a8-425f44f4fcbf"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Michota-Kamińska","uuid":"4EB7079300C2AFB8708927EEDB21FBD81AEF2FD51FC263E240C99C7038D1005DEC8459DA840507FBA6DE74655F99385CF34A6DC7B3F7B83FA17E470DC416A800","orcidId":"0000-0002-1713-4182","documentHash":"c1786c7a-c1fc-4ac2-aa4a-053360f9fd89"}],"objectId":"65a650fc4097071977d9bf66","doi":"10.3390/biomedicines12010167","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/12/1/167","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Machine Learning for COVID-19 Determination Using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The rapid, low cost, and efficient detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, especially in clinical samples, remains a major challenge.

In this study, we present a selective DNA-based surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) assay for the detection and determination of L-selectin in biological samples. Two calibration curves (linear in the 40–190 ng mL−1 region and exponential in the 40–500 ng mL −1 region) are fitted to the obtained SERS experimental data, i.e., the ratio of I732/I1334 band intensities (LOQ = 46 ng mL−1). Calculated determination coefficients are found to be R2 = 0.997 for the linear region of the calibration curve and R2 = 0.977 for the exponential region. Moreover, we demonstrate very good selectivity of the assay even in the presence of P- and E-selectin in a sample containing L-selectin. With our SERS assay, the L-selectin concentration in biological samples can be estimated directly from the calibration curves."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709415878c28a0473b5f14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfabb","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0030","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"416","pagesFromTo":"1189 - 1197","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709415878c28a0473b5f14","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0030","666967634097074fa1a57745","5e709491878c28a0473bfabb","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477011","mniswId":"1086","title":"Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry","issn":"1618-2642","eissn":"1618-2650","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4778ee06-4f74-4a43-ad22-4a125a5e5877"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"666967634097074fa1a57742","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"416","documentHash":"2fa2adf4-9dd4-41f2-b47d-2357e621a8f2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SERS","SERS assay","L-Selectin","DNA","Aptamer"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059283723"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b0d1a34097073c3fa0bde1","name":"Yuki","lastName":"Koyano","documentHash":"787734dc-1deb-472c-945e-abc60f7650fc"},{"objectId":"65b0d1a34097073c3fa0bde0","name":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Kitahata","documentHash":"8de2cffa-6079-4137-927d-a71d47b5c36f"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaba","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Roliński","uuid":"EC520BEB8EB7EC1DC73269D9AD4148B7D9F88E296703863882498EDB0426C770D89B9AEC2D1316B6075E1B7956B24D13627A1D2822BCB9F25AB2A98F78E7E29D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8606-3090","documentHash":"01b160c9-3288-4703-ab94-93a579a82a42"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Górecki","uuid":"5C1C88BEF5066E9C3874BDB6264294C1392BD86C12A9F48FB84DCDF91ECC0D7892866EA7D364E14630DDA5138F0746E07B789269886028DCDB2ABF6BD86EA9B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4574-0083","documentHash":"95958b83-8129-419e-8027-969462b967a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"65b0d1a34097073c3fa0bdde","doi":"10.3390/app14030959","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/3/959/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Quantitative Analysis of the Complex Time Evolution of a Camphor Boat","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The motion of a camphor boat on the water’s surface is a long-studied example of the direct transformation of chemical energy into a mechanical one. Recent experimental papers have reported a complex character of boat motion depending on the location of the camphor source. If the source is close to the stern, the boat moves at a constant speed. When it is shifted towards the boat center, oscillations of speed are observed. When the source is close to the boat center, pulses of speed followed by oscillations appear. Here, we focus on numerical simulations of camphor boat motion. We discuss approximations that allow us to reduce the numerical complexity of the problem and formulate a model in which the equation for boat velocity is coupled with a one-dimensional reaction–diffusion equation for camphor surface concentration. We scanned the phase space of model parameters and found the values that give qualitative agreement with the experiments. The model predicts all types of boat motion (continuous, oscillating, and pulsating) observed in experiments. Moreover, the model with selected parameter values shows that for specific locations of the camphor source, a spike in speed is followed by transient oscillations, which are an inherent part of speed relaxation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","5e709491878c28a0473bfaba"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"959","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709491878c28a0473bfaba","65b0d1a34097073c3fa0bde0","65b0d1a34097073c3fa0bde1","5e7092b4878c28a04739b050"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"976d1e86-5dd0-4e19-9276-7114f4dea573"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b0d1e74097073c3fa0e323","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"dddfeef1-e83e-449d-92a5-71ad60abd1ab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059307114"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b8dccc4097073f66fc3c94","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Sibirny","documentHash":"d457860b-66ea-4d52-933d-49532fdd43d5"},{"objectId":"65b8db054097073f66fbcd52","name":"Mykhailo","lastName":"Gonchar","documentHash":"5a0791c6-0050-438f-8aec-c22fd16b9697"},{"objectId":"65b8db054097073f66fbcd51","name":"Lyubov","lastName":"Fayura","documentHash":"7cca61ff-419d-4c88-a94d-45bb67b516a3"},{"objectId":"65b8db054097073f66fbcd50","name":"Olha","lastName":"Demkiv","documentHash":"ed710b6b-7b35-41e9-8d9c-918323eb7e52"},{"objectId":"65b8db054097073f66fbcd4d","name":"Galina","lastName":"Gayda","documentHash":"2c1bed9d-611a-4f85-9a95-d95e4d31ebaf"},{"objectId":"65b8db054097073f66fbcd4c","name":"Nataliya","lastName":"Stasyuk","documentHash":"fda5de20-6f53-4748-b6bf-0cdc83398786"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-22","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65b8db054097073f66fbcd4a","doi":"10.1007/s00604-023-06114-1","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00604-023-06114-1","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Ammonium nanochelators in conjunction with arginine-specific enzymes in amperometric biosensors for arginine assay","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Amino acid L-arginine (Arg), usually presented in food products and biological liquids, can serve both as a useful indicator of food quality and an important biomarker in medicine. The biosensors based on Arg-selective enzymes are the most promising devices for Arg assay. In this research, three types of amperometric biosensors have been fabricated. They exploit arginine oxidase (ArgO), recombinant arginase I (ARG)/urease, and arginine deiminase (ADI) coupled with the ammonium-chelating redox-active nanoparticles. Cadmium-copper nanoparticles (nCdCu) as the most effective nanochelators were used for the development of ammonium chemosensors and enzyme-coupled Arg biosensors. The fabricated enzyme/nCdCu-containing bioelectrodes show wide linear ranges (up to 200 µM), satisfactory storage stabilities (14 days), and high sensitivities (A⋅M-1⋅m-2) to Arg: 1650, 1700, and 4500 for ADI-, ArgO- and ARG/urease-based sensors, respectively. All biosensors have been exploited to estimate Arg content in commercial juices. The obtained data correlate well with the values obtained by the reference method. A hypothetic scheme for mechanism of action of ammonium nanochelators in electron transfer reaction on the arginine-sensing electrodes has been proposed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65b8dccc4097073f66fc3c94"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"191","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"47","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b8db054097073f66fbcd4c","65b8db054097073f66fbcd4d","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","65b8db054097073f66fbcd50","65b8db054097073f66fbcd51","65b8db054097073f66fbcd52","65b8dccc4097073f66fc3c94","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e73","mniswId":"14341","title":"MICROCHIMICA ACTA","issn":"0026-3672","eissn":"1436-5073","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"a37c1fe3-4945-4899-8266-122535cb1940"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667aadb4409707681dcb3ad1","year":"2023","volume":"191","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"c4b05d2f-ae06-4f72-b2d3-bf401329d5c2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ammonium sensing","amperometric biosensor","Arginase","arginine deiminase","L-arginine","L-arginine oxidase","nanoparticles","urease"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059354997"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ba878c28a0473c2990","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Chwojnowska","uuid":"9757A8BC2C51051ECEB8552D3C660D91B257654A45F006499B62290B513134DADAF747DB648AACFE6C0D23121E09E8D1241B42039109E2559D782B1CAB18C3BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4796-4611","documentHash":"30a1755b-4b19-4d39-9d22-3b068b3e6816"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1a86","name":"JUSTYNA","lastName":"GRZONKA","uuid":"88ACA715E093CCE47834CEA7401C964ADDA98B9FAFAFFEB9E211993A39EF0DACCF1B62D4E1B4924B6E82A7F4705AEE45D55B944BE10FF3890A26C481413C1FDD","documentHash":"8bf83ce3-dc65-4404-8559-b61b5719d4bf"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b587c","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Justyniak","uuid":"3249E5EE5B9D2B8E1E4F8CFF41B8188B509841A2DB4AFE2ECC68C77CE2DAD28C7BDF06ADDB39539D8AEDCAB5270B6FDE67A5143CDF5AD7C7DFBFC490F5EEFF86","orcidId":"0000-0002-4392-0267","documentHash":"4858b12b-ff49-4bd3-acb9-d92db32a8656"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ratajczyk","uuid":"D7BF159D17AA3F44A08389A461C0C453E3CFA0D80BDD70361E3C3FDAABAB66937DFBCBEDC5E928A5269A3370C62BD41F00F01DF11D10C408342FED73975BA671","orcidId":"0000-0003-1613-6933","documentHash":"aafca08f-0cdd-4319-8133-314824720e0a"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"9BB0811617F37A3C112AC89C1AB184813530B9CAE96BA8B681D4AB1BAAAB23BD3D2582BB3010CF1C2228858BC7D1F3D96B655DFB488EF0C406CA60C54014C8EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3407-0395","documentHash":"5dab1440-5edf-40d2-afdd-05ff37f8a8af"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65cb3248409707626357c116","doi":"10.1016/j.isci.2022.105759","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004222020326","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A modular design approach to polymer-coated ZnO nanocrystals","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hybrid materials based on inorganic nanocrystals with organic polymers feature peculiar and fascinating properties and various applications. However, there is still a need for simple synthesis procedures that provide precise control over the polymer/nanocrystal microstructure of these materials. Herein, a novel organometallic approach to polymer-coated ZnO nanocrystals was developed. The presented method merges the initial ring-opening polymerization of ϵ-caprolactone mediated by an organozinc alkoxide initiator and an air-promoted transformation of the resulting macromolecular organozinc species. This one-pot procedure results in quantum-sized ZnO crystals with a core diameter of ca 3 nm coated by poly(ϵ-caprolactone) covalently bonded to the surface. Overall, the ability to create well-defined hybrid composites should provide a unique ability to access various nanosystems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094af878c28a0473c1a86","5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","5e70940d878c28a0473b587c","5e7094ba878c28a0473c2990","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ba878c28a0473c2990","5e7094af878c28a0473c1a86","5e70940d878c28a0473b587c","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","5e709328878c28a0473a3f18"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed5a","mniswId":"27392","title":"iScience","issn":"2589-0042","eissn":"2589-0042","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fbe6d8df-3674-4cb5-b236-07dd3f0bc26a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d3b7bf4097070bb2fc26e6","year":"2023","volume":"26","number":"1","documentHash":"ff0d7c2f-56e8-440f-8e53-64208b460c16"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nanocomplex","nanotechnology","nanostructure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059370509"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65d231da409707172eb466f5","name":"Ute","lastName":"Resch-Genger","documentHash":"3b677018-513a-4ab7-b423-79c29759f165"},{"objectId":"65d231da409707172eb466f2","name":"Elina","lastName":"Andresen","documentHash":"4fc1bc0c-d8c5-493c-a724-70dc3f1f1117"},{"objectId":"65d231da409707172eb466f0","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ceborska","documentHash":"91cf0fc3-2ba9-45ab-9b24-01670c1db42f"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c66","name":"Mykhaylo","lastName":"Potopnyk","uuid":"9FE6D5C7FAD7A4CC468A3E06D808DAD1ACA12A9E186066873CACC84F0336A242B148639E47A473779945DC0837704EC3EFA0AB3980908D055C34D9749AC0C656","orcidId":"0000-0002-4543-2785","documentHash":"b3f8ea17-ad2b-4f16-989e-5863cd759438"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf949","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Gajek","uuid":"8AC814ED66AB40D610FCECF9B2CAEF4C4FB6E4DCCCC1C624D4878CDF20EBE7672C6A56D7421D671AB0665C7E1CE7EF4883064E44AA09FCE20FA59747405A642D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1323-4466","documentHash":"de6cbbcf-8e97-49d3-8a47-dce841ff5bd6"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8951","name":"JUSTYNA","lastName":"Mech-Piskorz","uuid":"E2E27DD72A2886E58B416997BFD345452765A1B192839FD802C11C871BE8375419FEBF4143745BA5FF52AC239784E91F15925AA47BED53A07BF47AAE7785629E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4778-7918","documentHash":"25a69a54-8eec-4d94-bcc7-09b021ec97dd"},{"objectId":"5e7093d6878c28a0473b1a1f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wiśniewska","uuid":"F95EC3E812E83DE9F35B7B9133C5CEF875D5D4AF6074C60BD1011411904E81C42C75E0057AFECE425F5FFCF9CA9C3B70E4C1CBC01E4BB7594C616587383DBEA3","orcidId":"0000-0001-5317-757X","documentHash":"9367d81a-0246-41b4-be48-8baa5ca7b7a4"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0046","name":"Gonzalo","lastName":"Angulo Nunez","uuid":"E991038FAEA399EEBBC94BA760C95F0B6034BA084D328F930A193ECE507D3E28360BA145ABF14AE563A0C356A6D4C62DAF2943DB392983D49B4A0272548A6954","orcidId":"0000-0002-6484-1795","documentHash":"5a0f1cd3-66e1-419a-a012-22e46e598522"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0fc","name":"Roman","lastName":"Luboradzki","uuid":"95216C83B6E9B4915934E4A2CFAA7B875E7246598CE9ECE348FCD368AF6A0666DD3646C87C556F89AFF79FB56BF2C02C3D9F3BCF9DA0693965A10BE2913EE232","documentHash":"9d00e680-7d5c-44b9-bf3f-c82acda74703"}],"objectId":"65d231da409707172eb466ed","doi":"10.1002/chem.202400004","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.202400004","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Aggregation/Crystallization‐Induced Emission in Naphthyridine‐Based Carbazolyl‐Modified Donor‐Acceptor Boron Dyes Tunable by Fluorine Atoms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Four donor-acceptor boron difluoride complexes based on the carbazole electron donor and the [1,3,5,2]oxadiazaborinino[3,4-a][1,8]naphthyridine acceptor were designed, synthesized, and systematically spectroscopically investigated in solutions, in dye-doped polymer films, and in the solid states.

These materials must encompass both surface and diffusion-driven charge storage mechanisms. While diffusion-driven reactions offer high capacitance by utilizing the bulk of the material, their effectiveness diminishes at higher discharge rates. Conversely, surface-controlled reactions provide rapid charge/discharge rates and high power density. To strike a balance between these attributes, we devised a tri-composite material, TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>/Carbon/MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (T10/MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>). This innovative design features a highly porous carbon core for efficient diffusion and redox-active MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> nanosheets on the surface. Leveraging these characteristics, the T10/MoS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> composite exhibited impressive specific capacitance (436 F/g at 5 mV/s), with a significant contribution from the diffusion-controlled process (82%). Furthermore, our symmetrical device achieved a notable energy density of ~ 50 Wh/kg at a power density of 1.3 kW/kg.

The results have shown that magnesium oxide is very highly active in CTH when physically mixed with zirconia. However, the same concentration of Mg2+ ions (Mg:Zr = 3:97) inserted into a zirconia lattice did not yield high activity in CTH. A higher concentration of Mg2+ ions (5%) was also tested in the two types of systems, i.e., a physical mixture of oxides and a solid solution. The increase in the concentration of Mg2+ ions in the physical mixture led to a pronounced increase in the activity of the system, whereas in the case of the solid solution it led to a slight decrease in activity. The impact of the zirconyl salt used in the synthesis was also examined, but showed little effect on the properties and activity of the systems. The study has also shown that the increase of the concentration of magnesium ions caused a decrease in the m-ZrO2 to t-ZrO2 ratio.

We have shown that the morphology of the modified polymer gradually changes from graphitic-like to amorphous, with increasing amounts of NaBH4 used for annealing. On the other hand, the boron doping has a very small influence on the band gap energy, as well as on the positions of the valence and conduction band edges of the polymer, but strongly improves the activity of g-C3N4 in the photocatalytic reduction of oxygen and degradation of methyl orange (8-fold increase of the degradation rate constant with respect to that of pure g-C3N4). The enhancement of the photocatalytic properties was explained by the increased rate of charge transport, both in the polymer plane and across the film, due to formation of N–B–N bonds between the adjacent heptazine units and the interlayer Coulomb interactions. The best photocatalytic activity was obtained for samples prepared from a mixture of g-C3N4 and NaBH4 at a moderate weight ratio (4:1), while increased amounts of NaBH4 led to significant and unfavorable changes in both the morphology and molecular structure of the polymer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947a878c28a0473be119","65d4dad74097074f286e5315","65d4dad74097074f286e5316","65d4dad74097074f286e531b","602ca8d29543c7410626e17c","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1855"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"128","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"894-907","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65d4dad74097074f286e5315","65d4dad74097074f286e5316","65d4dad74097074f286e5317","602ca8d29543c7410626e17c","5e70947a878c28a0473be119","5e709356878c28a0473a791c","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","65d4dad74097074f286e531b","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1855"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a2","mniswId":"12286","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry.

Unfortunately, their potential as imaging and therapeutic agents is often limited by their very low solubility in water and most biological media. Especially the “solubility problem” of Ir(III) complexes influence the imaging of live multicellular animal and plant species in their natural water-abundant habitats. Herein we bypass this difficulty by encapsulation of the two brightly luminescent iridium(III)(ppy)2L1 or L2 (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, L1 = 2-phenylpyridine-4-amine, L2 = 2-phenylpyridine-4-dimethylamine) complexes into pluronic F-127 block copolymer to form water soluble Ir-loaded micelles. These dye-loaded micelles are indeed rapidly internalized by the cells and no antiproliferative activity is observed in darkness. In contrast, 430 nm light irradiation of the same cells triggered singlet oxygen generation and oxidative stress what resulted in strong lethal effects. The water-soluble Ir-containing micelles could also be used as luminescent probes for studing complex multicellular organisms such as alive water-living phantom midge larva of Chaoborus flavicans M. and Lepidium sativum L. plant which elude of imaging with poorly-water soluble Ir(III) complexes. Iridium-containing micelles localized inside the digestive system and hydrostatic organs of larvae as well as in water-conducting tissues of the plant. Furthermore, although to a lesser extent, this new strategy of encapsulation of the Ir complexes allowed to circumvent the bacterial cell wall barrier and, thus, to penetrate inside S. aureus and E. coli cells. These results provide a reliable strategy for development of new theranostic agents and imaging probes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709490878c28a0473bf957"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"1006","pagesFromTo":"1-12","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947d878c28a0473be4e3","5e70939e878c28a0473adced","5e70947d878c28a0473be50d","5e709371878c28a0473a9c62","5e709490878c28a0473bf957","660c2a224097076263dd9483","660c2a224097076263dd9484","5e709360878c28a0473a8607"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547894b","mniswId":"12141","title":"Journal of Organometallic Chemistry","issn":"0022-328X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"92caeab1-fbc5-407d-94d0-836be4c45428"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ir(III) complexes","Imaging","Luminescence","Photocytotoxic activity","Encapsulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059526309"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"660bca1740970773c9ad9b57","name":"Agata","lastName":"Kaczmarek","documentHash":"8788ef4d-5e21-45c3-84a3-0fd7ab138c33"},{"objectId":"5e7093d6878c28a0473b1a1f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wiśniewska","uuid":"F95EC3E812E83DE9F35B7B9133C5CEF875D5D4AF6074C60BD1011411904E81C42C75E0057AFECE425F5FFCF9CA9C3B70E4C1CBC01E4BB7594C616587383DBEA3","orcidId":"0000-0001-5317-757X","documentHash":"9367d81a-0246-41b4-be48-8baa5ca7b7a4"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d98","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Hoffman","uuid":"7D81CD93BDC69D53A127B3611C6C60F4A09EF241A5BE6BA6FD175F125BD53A597C8BA8D7728AF7E9A32D989817073BA532BC20A74697612EC3A419B5F846DE07","orcidId":"0000-0002-1571-6808","documentHash":"45cbafc2-d4b4-4a59-a6a8-bc365b5d2759"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b23","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Mościcki","uuid":"76AFA158E57CF5CFDA5893C24D7B7A97AD65FAAE978C1AA14CCFF0655A77F7F87FD4B315B627765E0473D69DE0BF750EFC9CC5DBCC91018A94EA2810C20CAEC7","orcidId":"0000-0002-8407-903X","documentHash":"35c04be8-f9ab-4667-b370-e7e78d1e5938"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"660bca1740970773c9ad9b56","doi":"10.3390/ma17071573","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/7/1573/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Luminescence of Laser-Produced Carbon Nanodots: The Effect of Aggregation in PEI Solution","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Carbon nanodots (CNDs) produced in pure water by the ablation of graphite with a nanosecond laser pulse exhibit weak photoluminescence. A small addition of polyethyleneimine (PEI) to the aqueous suspension of CNDs causes a significant increase in emissions. This paper presents experimental and theoretical studies of the emission properties of CND/PEI systems. The obtained CNDs responded to even trace amounts of PEI in solution (similar to 0.014% v/v), resulting in a significant increase in the initial weak blue emission of CNDs and PEI taken separately. Morphology and size measurements showed that particle aggregation occurred in the presence of the polymer. A decrease in the calculated Stokes shift values was observed with increasing PEI content in the solution. This indicates a reduction in the number of non-radiative transitions, which explains the increase in the emission intensity of the CND/PEI systems. These results therefore confirmed that the increase in the emission of CND/PEI systems is caused by particle aggregation. Kinetic studies proved that the process is controlled mainly by diffusion, the initial stage of which has a dominant influence on determining the optical properties of the system."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","uid":"bL0dXXB9qN74NNNOmYDF46Q","uuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","name":"Instytut Podstawowych Problemów Techniki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d98","5e70927e878c28a047396b23"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","parentUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","rootUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d6878c28a0473b1a1f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1573","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["660bca1740970773c9ad9b57","5e70927e878c28a047396b23","5e70928e878c28a047397d98","5e7093d6878c28a0473b1a1f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"660524c64097076263326f17","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"7","documentHash":"0620dc44-68f3-402f-9a58-22a8bab6dd2d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059543749"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d16","name":"Hung-Yin","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"d05033ca-a107-4087-955e-9a737f4f4d46"},{"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d15","name":"Chien-Hsin","lastName":"Yang","documentHash":"51be7419-2e8d-43f9-b732-ceb17d5030a6"},{"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d14","name":"Yann-Wen","lastName":"Lan","documentHash":"2fee77b5-1c5a-4093-b925-dcafa4a4e793"},{"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d13","name":"Chien-Yu","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"8d451989-0338-4260-864e-a5d003452e4c"},{"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d12","name":"Yu-Seng","lastName":"Ku","documentHash":"3a24b3ef-3a8f-464e-9cd7-504ed41d5258"},{"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d11","name":"Chu-Yun","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"f7b54ef1-8893-45c0-92fb-f87878607f94"},{"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d10","name":"James L.","lastName":"Thomas","documentHash":"2b79e7a3-898d-42c0-b9de-0112a8293d4c"},{"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d0f","name":"Cheng-Chih","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"d6a7157e-db9a-4094-b0f6-5a2c40fc073f"},{"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d0e","name":"Mei-Hwa","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"3d870679-d0ec-4b3b-bc15-b2e514f524a8"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","name":"Piyush","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"E13DBE297A73F2ACA1DA7F32D373EDA5FB882AC5C4DDE593B81140BAD5BD6DA80677830414B610AFC144957EF4E20FF1A8CC4A4F5367FEC382ACC689DAE8CD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-7729-8314","documentHash":"d3733567-ec08-40ae-9d79-439c8d659f9e"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Borowicz","uuid":"D63B2D1CBAA9D153E2BD617283D505E334189960BF43C306B6800911E131A1DC46163DC826D5DBC9591F08210F55027FACEF450EFC439AC7D859B7E08287470B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6440-3568","documentHash":"a3264215-d1bb-4319-b51d-735971fa60f0"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7a","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Iskierko","uuid":"9FCFC93AE5A50E69179361D4EAE7782CD6D7F261518C22DBFF7486EF3D98E9191E307D8B0847C381D5BC32C36FD404E41FE293B3A42EBB96B4C4265C760D751E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3141-6626","documentHash":"544e1c71-88f8-4bcb-97f9-fc88d9795770"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Kutner","uuid":"4DB1E113A4C8683FB6BC69134920B86E44C946E3D21F32F5F6CE1483179976E11B16608F3E02B532633CFF5B5216E4C96C7B94090438FDEA74135F1AE4F3BCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-5170","documentHash":"71f3755a-d420-46be-bb05-d5ea4b0bfa7c"}],"objectId":"6628c85b4097073ca70f4d0c","doi":"10.1016/j.biosx.2022.100258","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2590137022001510?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Peptide-imprinted conductive polymer on continuous monolayer molybdenum disulfide transferred electrodes for electrochemical sensing of Matrix Metalloproteinase-1 in lung cancer culture medium","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is associated with lung cancer, and thus the monitoring of the concentration of this protein may be useful for assessing lung cancer progression.

TPEF is commonly used in cancer diagnostics, as it enables the direct observation of metabolism within living cells. The technique is now widely used in various medical fields, including ophthalmology. The eye is a complex and delicate organ with multiple layers of different cell types and tissues. Although this structure is ideal for visual perception, it generates aberrations in TPEF eye imaging. However, adaptive optics can now compensate for these aberrations, allowing for improved imaging of the eyes of animal models for human diseases. The eye is naturally built to filter out harmful wavelengths, but these wavelengths can be mimicked and thereby utilized in diagnostics via two-photon (2Ph) excitation. Recent advances in laser-source manufacturing have made it possible to minimize the exposure of in vivo measurements within safety, while achieving sufficient signals to detect for functional images, making TPEF a viable option for human application. This review explores recent advances in wavefront-distortion correction in animal models and the safety of use of TPEF on human subjects, both of which make TPEF a potentially powerful tool for ophthalmological diagnostics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["620b1e387523402df0840e24","60c967c39543c7233654453b","5ffecb96085dcb0e357dce0a","60c9e86a9543c72336544557","6136cea99543c7051ff01b84"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c9e86a9543c72336544557","6136cea99543c7051ff01b84","60c967c39543c7233654453b","620b1e387523402df0840e24","5ffecb96085dcb0e357dce0a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1b2","mniswId":"6847","title":"Frontiers in Medicine","issn":"2296-858X","eissn":"2296-858X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6c827de0-68f7-433c-bd4c-6f332f60833e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662657da4097071fab4cfba5","year":"2024","volume":"10","documentHash":"4521a639-9320-4d61-a684-19b03b226513"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059568438"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662658ee4097071fab4d02bb","name":"Paola","lastName":"Posocco","documentHash":"32a50117-a1c6-44e7-bbac-a0ac48e64ca9"},{"objectId":"662658ee4097071fab4d02ba","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szewczyk","documentHash":"c11385f0-e939-475d-af8e-874d55ae1c3c"},{"objectId":"662658ee4097071fab4d02b9","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Flaibani","documentHash":"c1460f57-2fc4-4b13-9e18-0dd91fa708f6"},{"objectId":"5fc4accd085dcb1e6ae0b89f","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Kravets","uuid":"154528D5FB8562DD66D348716C9CF291750E5CD55E523755DD6CFBD4DE003E3D33363F70FD4E5FD2D38C7F38B170F2D31DA01FA293A379E6B647E78DBE945E36","orcidId":"0000-0002-7751-3643","documentHash":"5dfefcf4-084c-41c3-924d-5a58999d929e"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Sashuk","uuid":"7B9E651603C44ECD7E173B7A34E505E79330EDF4DD04B973310915D4CB9C3A93FE2EC7E76F47936D6F44735FB425946716A2A46CE201074FC33F28CEE87FCD58","orcidId":"0000-0002-5907-8596","documentHash":"2b6c5410-3288-40e9-b679-a6627af57d6d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"662658ee4097071fab4d02b7","doi":"10.1021/acscatal.3c04435","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acscatal.3c04435","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Pursuing the Complete OFF State in Photoswitchable Catalysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Practically, all photoswitchable catalysts exhibit residual activity in the OFF state. Herein, we present a ruthenium initiator with a built-in photoswitch whose metathetical performance is completely shut off by light. The system is made of Hoveyda-Grubbs second-generation complexes appended, along with background ligands, to a gold nanoparticle surface via azobenzene linkers. Under dark or visible light the precatalysts, in the presence of an olefin, undergo initiation, diffuse from the surface into bulk solution, and commence metathesis reaction. When the conditions are changed to ultraviolet, the isomerization of the azo switches takes place, burying the precatalysts within the bulky organic monolayer, thus preventing their initiation and thereby halting the reaction. Despite the irreversibility of the process, this work opens up opportunities for the remote deactivation of catalysts without their chemical decomposition and control of more complex tasks such as chemical selectivity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","5fc4accd085dcb1e6ae0b89f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"15967-15976","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4accd085dcb1e6ae0b89f","662658ee4097071fab4d02b9","662658ee4097071fab4d02ba","662658ee4097071fab4d02bb","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dc6","mniswId":"127","title":"ACS Catalysis","doi":"10.1021/acscatal","issn":"2155-5435","eissn":"2155-5435","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/page/accacs/about.html","documentHash":"b7409d24-a953-465b-9af5-00b3e4eea445"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662658ee4097071fab4d02b8","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"24","documentHash":"741290e9-201a-4cdc-99d2-8e49b44bfc7d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059571278"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc4db0f085dcb1e6ae0b939","name":"James Lawrence","lastName":"Pogrebetsky","uuid":"C81EDC2D504014D35CF4A15E6108A66AE426CCF2602BCF742013457CF844F795F33F309D30C50E43819E92690FE175A5C610BEE7168F4E262D6684C81FF695FF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0879-1498","documentHash":"bb63cd97-c1d4-43be-8076-78675fda0bbe"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kubas","uuid":"5502D7BBD854811ACE4A362AACF7E8E88D472EBF744D8A7CA3375962360A19B8C994FD5882E9191B79B6745D5F7A3AB2529D5A4D64C8AFBB3B7204C8694C6382","orcidId":"0000-0002-5508-0533","documentHash":"9f31decc-1aaa-47ff-8296-c27349c11c1e"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf7ce","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Siklitckaia","uuid":"B12CA655C96933AC94FEE0D887AFD4211D5952A249A4671EABA03947C660C42E5867935B95C0C872A7549EBA96147AB59C5F0ECFB272582C65EAC58BF54F7659","orcidId":"0000-0003-2705-1572","documentHash":"9d793764-2183-48ec-9181-1963c61f6ed2"}],"objectId":"662a53014097074b67c6bb9b","doi":"10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00444","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00444","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"MP2-Based Correction Scheme to Approach the Limit of a Complete Pair Natural Orbitals Space in DLPNO-CCSD(T) Calculations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The domain-based local pair natural orbital (PNO) coupled-cluster DLPNO-CCSD(T) method has been proven to provide accurate single-point energies at a fraction of the cost of canonical CCSD(T) calculations. However, the desired \"chemical accuracy\" can only be obtained with a large PNO space and extended basis set. We present a simple yet accurate and efficient correction scheme based on a perturbative approach. Here, in addition to DLPNO-CCSD(T) energy, one calculates DLPNO-MP2 correlation energy with the same settings as in the preceding coupled-cluster calculation. In the next step, the canonical MP2 correlation energy is obtained in the same orbital basis. This can be efficiently performed for essentially all molecule sizes accessible with the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method. By taking the difference between the canonical MP2 and DLPNO-MP2 energies, we obtain a correction term that can be added to the DLPNO-CCSD(T) correlation energy. This way, one can obtain the total correlation energy close to the limit of the complete PNO space (cPNO). The presented approach allows us to significantly increase the accuracy of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) method for both closed- and open-shell systems. The latter are known to be especially challenging for locally correlated methods. Unlike the previously developed PNO extrapolation procedure by Altun, Neese, and Bistoni ((J. Chem.TheoryComput.2020,16, 6142-6149), this strategy allows us to get the DLPNO-CCSD(T) correlation energy at the cPNO limit in a cost-efficient way, resulting in a minimal overall increase in calculation time as compared to the uncorrected method."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5e70948d878c28a0473bf7ce","5fc4db0f085dcb1e6ae0b939"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"4023-4032","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4db0f085dcb1e6ae0b939","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5e70948d878c28a0473bf7ce"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478548","mniswId":"10444","title":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","issn":"1549-9618","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"cedfba2b-3cf9-422b-9674-7c0ec8928228"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662a53014097074b67c6bb9c","year":"2023","volume":"19","number":"13","documentHash":"8f812d35-2daf-4926-b863-733a218fd27b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059571789"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662a54324097074b67c6c55d","name":"Simone","lastName":"Berneschi","documentHash":"fd160aab-df89-4792-9614-c1d7835a67da"},{"objectId":"662a54324097074b67c6c55c","name":"Dorota A.","lastName":"Pawlak","documentHash":"00013d26-ffdd-415e-8b04-7c5db2d1d41b"},{"objectId":"662a54324097074b67c6c55b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Paszke","documentHash":"3fb4ca76-479d-4a47-b8c4-e8758cf8868e"},{"objectId":"662a54324097074b67c6c55a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Piotrowski","documentHash":"c101e5bb-235d-4e4f-ab00-bc6d35a8acbb"},{"objectId":"65bc647940e3ff0466a15d5b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Klepacka","uuid":"254D9EFA27A831CBE5A302D7CA0C2036A5876C23136A4C4365DB70E307DF06F83F959B2C8513E084A83062717712A3084B0DDF03DE4CF9A85E84C5A9A774B856","documentHash":"543ba1fa-ebd0-47b2-a268-74597d3a3a45"},{"objectId":"5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","name":"Ladislav","lastName":"Derzsi","uuid":"298610A9E3EFD4BD025EE078249F66C3169768A76BA240CFC716072496622CB734DDFCDAE10CFF3D6DCF9853F31A90480F1F1E643D5C8E3147B5E6B43B92C460","orcidId":"0000-0002-3562-0758","documentHash":"d22f43d7-cee1-47a3-9c48-45099bf80c18"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd731","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Mazuryk","uuid":"13E0776D85F660DFE6F558DB5092FBA48757B9E5DB73994F3411CF9370C853106C4A86CAA57E4B9E1A04EF1C0434630A3B28C0DF688A9437A1F7BA74E6A6A99F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3311-7136","documentHash":"6c940586-7919-4ad1-b09e-524f950719a8"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","name":"Piyush","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"E13DBE297A73F2ACA1DA7F32D373EDA5FB882AC5C4DDE593B81140BAD5BD6DA80677830414B610AFC144957EF4E20FF1A8CC4A4F5367FEC382ACC689DAE8CD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-7729-8314","documentHash":"d3733567-ec08-40ae-9d79-439c8d659f9e"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kałęcki","uuid":"9A55E22434DE512B22E198C0B70313B1365F26049E72E1BEBEFB40B80D4C4235D1A7C0767203F64C4058B1644E52242BC2E4377385480C13AED4B622364A7FC1","orcidId":"0000-0002-4286-2085","documentHash":"f71fc73f-c75c-4cde-bb90-86a86989d73c"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff46","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Piechowska","uuid":"6241497495D43484DDC242B6BC658DAFAAFDE4868990EAB4E1EF5F13487AE6795D8EC913B8CD12E01B1E1A9A76E75797CC0046778039AFE940C630BEA79D6ECD","orcidId":"0000-0001-5887-5895","documentHash":"17ed421b-0ae8-493d-a75a-58eb7b60d418"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Kutner","uuid":"4DB1E113A4C8683FB6BC69134920B86E44C946E3D21F32F5F6CE1483179976E11B16608F3E02B532633CFF5B5216E4C96C7B94090438FDEA74135F1AE4F3BCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-5170","documentHash":"71f3755a-d420-46be-bb05-d5ea4b0bfa7c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"662a54324097074b67c6c558","doi":"10.1021/acsapm.2c01461","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsapm.2c01461","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"In-Capillary Photodeposition of Glyphosate-Containing Polyacrylamide Nanometer-Thick Films","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present research reports on in-water, site-specific photodeposition of glyphosate (GLP)-containing polyacrylamide (PAAGLP) nanometer-thick films (nanofilms) on an inner surface of fused silica (fused quartz) microcapillaries presilanized with trimethoxy(octen-7yl)silane (TMOS). TMOS was chosen because of the vinyl group presence in its structure, enabling its participation in the (UV light) activated free-radical polymerization (UV-FRP) after its immobilization on a fused silica surface. The photodeposition was conducted in an aqueous (H2O/ACN; 3:1, v/v) solution, using UV-FRP (lambda = 365 nm) of the acrylamide (AA) functional monomer, the N,N & PRIME;-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BAA) cross-linking monomer, GLP, and the azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) UV-FRP initiator. Acetonitrile (ACN) was used as the porogen and the solvent to dissolve monomers and GLP. Because of the micrometric diameters of microcapillaries, the silanization and photodeposition procedures were first optimized on fused silica slides. The introduction of TMOS, as well as the formation of PAA and PAA-GLP nanofilms, was determined using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) spectroscopy, and confocal micro Raman spectroscopy. Particularly, AFM and SEM-EDX measurements determined nanofilms' thickness and GLP content, respectively, whereas in-depth confocal (micro-Raman spectroscopy)-assisted imaging of PAA-and PAA-GLP-coated microcapillary inner surfaces confirmed the successful photo deposition. Moreover, we examined the GLP impact on polymer gelation by monitoring hydration in a hydrogel and a dried powder PAA-GLP. Our study demonstrated the usefulness of the in-capillary micro Raman spectroscopy imaging and in-depth profiling of GLP-encapsulated PAA nanofilms. In the future, our simple and inexpensive procedure will enable the fabrication of polymer-based microfluidic chemosensors or adsorptive-separating devices for GLP detection, determination, and degradation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","65bc647940e3ff0466a15d5b","5e709474878c28a0473bd731","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff46"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"5","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"223-235","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709474878c28a0473bd731","65bc647940e3ff0466a15d5b","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff46","5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","662a54324097074b67c6c55a","662a54324097074b67c6c55b","662a54324097074b67c6c55c","662a54324097074b67c6c55d","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f09d","mniswId":"27716","title":"ACS Applied Polymer Materials","eissn":"2637-6105","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e5c49000-93d8-4d9b-b7a8-58ef76a365db"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662a54324097074b67c6c559","year":"2022","volume":"5","number":"1","documentHash":"8a3b0e63-9cf6-4b6d-9c2d-a6f7ebe62f89"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059572005"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662a51334097074b67c6a9b5","name":"David","lastName":"Gendron","documentHash":"441c9391-112c-460c-b78e-ab01993080b5"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b7687","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Bubak","uuid":"E70F5CD19671B827D065CACC0EBB0475F084AE5F4A03C411FECEBD60908C1489A45385C991AA687E432B261F29BC3352EA0F38652B88718AF27A7F94A9DF7F19","orcidId":"0000-0001-7938-4016","documentHash":"2077f6bb-4def-43c0-8522-6fc28be4a5ab"}],"objectId":"662a51334097074b67c6a9b3","doi":"10.3390/jox13040047","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2039-4713/13/4/47/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Carbon Nanotubes and Graphene Materials as Xenobiotics in Living Systems: Is There a Consensus on Their Safety?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Carbon nanotubes and graphene are two types of nanomaterials that have unique properties and potential applications in various fields, including biomedicine, energy storage, and gas sensing.

While some studies have provided recommendations for occupational exposure limits, more research is needed to fully understand the potential risks of these materials to human health and the environment. In this review, we will try to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of using carbon nanotubes and graphene as well as composites containing them in the context of their biocompatibility and toxicity to living systems. In addition, we overview current policy guidelines and technical regulations regarding the safety of carbon-based nanomaterials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709429878c28a0473b7687"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"740-760","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662a51334097074b67c6a9b5","5e709429878c28a0473b7687"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cb02","mniswId":"13224","title":"Journal of Xenobiotics","issn":"2039-4705","eissn":"2039-4713","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d39c6630-427e-4e7e-9d96-134927595921"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"662a51334097074b67c6a9b4","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"4","documentHash":"45e0faad-f70c-410a-a469-4ebef87f79c2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059574818"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"662a504d4097074b67c697ec","name":"Mathieu","lastName":"Etienne","documentHash":"14acf2a1-0941-4d4b-9116-099ed62c21c9"},{"objectId":"6153cfa99543c7051ff01dbe","name":"Nabila","lastName":"Yasmeen","uuid":"49A73BDDFB254C30E04EAF937B1C24F5F3F5D4DA1B542ED7CA0295839CF951AFFFF230767AFAF37F72401D32C3327FA56A746B292721699D3E76899FE8B1DDA9","documentHash":"447c5a35-333d-4590-88bc-9fcb987d5622"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","name":"Piyush","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"E13DBE297A73F2ACA1DA7F32D373EDA5FB882AC5C4DDE593B81140BAD5BD6DA80677830414B610AFC144957EF4E20FF1A8CC4A4F5367FEC382ACC689DAE8CD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-7729-8314","documentHash":"d3733567-ec08-40ae-9d79-439c8d659f9e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Kutner","uuid":"4DB1E113A4C8683FB6BC69134920B86E44C946E3D21F32F5F6CE1483179976E11B16608F3E02B532633CFF5B5216E4C96C7B94090438FDEA74135F1AE4F3BCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-5170","documentHash":"71f3755a-d420-46be-bb05-d5ea4b0bfa7c"}],"objectId":"662a504d4097074b67c697eb","doi":"10.1016/j.coelec.2023.101291","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2451910323000844?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Artificial receptors for electrochemical sensing of bacteria","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present review summarizes the molecular imprinting approach to bacteria electrochemical sensing developed over the last five years.

A potential approach for managing such bacteria involves the use of their natural killers, namely lytic bacteriophages. Another effective method involves the use of metal nanoparticles with antimicrobial properties. However, the use of lytic phages armed with nanoparticles as an effective antimicrobial strategy, particularly with respect to biofilms, remains unexplored. Here, we show that T7 phages armed with silver nanoparticles exhibit greater efficacy in terms of controlling bacterial biofilm, compared with phages or nanoparticles alone. We initially identified a novel silver nanoparticle-binding peptide, then constructed T7 phages that successfully displayed the peptide on the outer surface of the viral head. These recombinant, AgNP-binding phages could effectively eradicate bacterial biofilm, even when used at low concentrations. Additionally, when used at concentrations that could eradicate bacterial biofilm, T7 phages armed with silver nanoparticles were not toxic to eukaryotic cells. Our results show that the novel combination of lytic phages with phage-bound silver nanoparticles is an effective, synergistic and safe strategy for the treatment of bacterial biofilms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7de7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7de7","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5a3","5e7093b6878c28a0473af945","663a0bf64097077c1aa93f31","5e70940c878c28a0473b5733","5e709358878c28a0473a7bbd"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Due to the hygroscopic and volatile nature of the organic cations, i.e., methylammonium (MA(+)), they show very poor stability not only against thermal stress but also moisture. Therefore, a photoactive material free from organic components could offer great opportunities to prolong the operational stability of devices. In this context, all inorganic CsPbIxBr3-x perovskites are meticulously developed in terms of their structural/thermal stability and have triggered increasing research interest due to great prospects in the commercialization of perovskite technology. However, besides relatively low performance, the poor phase stability of inorganic perovskites associated with lattice strain and vacancies still requires a thorough understanding and permanent solutions for tackling these problems. In this comprehensive review, the recently reported B-site doping strategy in inorganic CsPbIxBr3-x perovskite thin films, which has been elucidated to passivate the defects, tune the grain orientation, and enhance the lifetime of charge-carriers, is presented based on different B-site elements belonging to group IIIA, IVA and VA, alkaline-earth, transition, and lanthanide metals. Solutions for confronting these current problems are elaborated and an outlook on further strategies is given."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"372-403","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66446ba540970771f715d914","66446ba540970771f715d915","66446ba540970771f715d916","66446ba540970771f715d917","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","66446ba540970771f715d918","66446ba540970771f715d919","66446ba540970771f715d91a","66446ba540970771f715d91b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aac","mniswId":"5676","title":"Energy & Environmental Science","issn":"1754-5692","eissn":"1754-5706","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ece8e512-a708-4bba-9656-a49538c8cc77"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66446ba540970771f715d913","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"2","documentHash":"1cb295dc-e322-4c8e-808b-6137b7a35cbd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059596840"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66446f2540970771f7164d11","name":"Teresa J.","lastName":"Bandosz","documentHash":"5d1eed53-a5eb-485b-a6e0-ad58304907c3"},{"objectId":"66446f2540970771f7164d10","name":"Stephen","lastName":"O'Brien","documentHash":"d38bc02c-cc50-4572-bd46-aa535a9d2321"},{"objectId":"66446f2540970771f7164d0f","name":"Marc","lastName":"Florent","documentHash":"eba67bcb-ba19-4393-b33a-d06aaf8f1511"},{"objectId":"66446f2540970771f7164d0e","name":"Nasim","lastName":"Farahmand","documentHash":"0a91ca5b-3cde-45b1-abca-da910e9212fc"},{"objectId":"5fc4b6f2085dcb1e6ae0b8c3","name":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Giannakoudakis","uuid":"EF7A9B541B546414AC99804FF7756D3398515753227A5640A461BE05B80210E972A5A20423DCF52E80F4AAFD513AD043C600959BDF4FE208E8324086AF858E8C","documentHash":"38ec48bc-cd6c-4461-ab65-1bd1cbf05429"}],"objectId":"66446f2540970771f7164d0c","doi":"10.1016/j.cej.2023.144576","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1385894723033077?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Europium barium titanate perovskite nano-photocatalysts: Mechanistic analysis of a chloro-dialkyl sulfide decomposition/detoxification","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mixed europium-barium titanate perovskites, EuxBa1-xTiO3, were investigated as nanocatalysts for the photodetoxification of a mustard gas surrogate, 2-chloroethylethyl sulfide, CEES.

A lanthanide valence and nanostructure was altered by applying a heat treatment in either oxidizing or reducing atmospheres. The results demonstrated a high adsorption capacity and improved catalytic decomposition activity in comparison to a set of previously explored transition metal oxide photocatalysts, including barium titanate. Analysis of the decomposition products indicated hydrolysis as the predominant reactive detoxification mechanism in the dark. Upon light irradiation, radicals were formed and contributed to the degradation and oxidation of CEES, especially in the sample rich in Eu(III) and oxygen, with a more developed porosity.

Without a functional ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 4 (ABCA4), there is an elevation of all-trans-retinal and prolonged buildup of all-trans-retinal adducts, resulting in a retinal degenerative disease known as Stargardt-1 disease. Even in this monogenic disorder, there is significant heterogeneity in the time to onset of symptoms among patients. Using a combination of molecular techniques, we studied Abca4 knockout (simulating human noncoding disease variants) and Abca4 knock-in mice (simulating human misfolded, catalytically inactive protein variants), which serve as models for Stargardt-1 disease. We compared the two strains to ascertain whether they exhibit differential responses to agents that affect cytokine signaling and/or ceramide metabolism, as alterations in either of these pathways can exacerbate retinal degenerative phenotypes. We found different degrees of responsiveness to maraviroc, a known immunomodulatory CCR5 antagonist, and to the ceramide-lowering agent AdipoRon, an agonist of the ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 receptors. The two strains also display different degrees of transcriptional deviation from matched WT controls. Our phenotypic comparison of the two distinct Abca4 mutant-mouse models sheds light on potential therapeutic avenues previously unexplored in the treatment of Stargardt disease and provides a surrogate assay for assessing the effectiveness for genome editing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fae2146085dcb5a2b98da14","5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","5e709373878c28a0473a9ddb","5e709388878c28a0473ac194","5f505f00752340073806a8ca"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"120","issue":"50","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6644736540970771f716879c","6644736540970771f716879d","6644736540970771f716879e","6644736540970771f716879f","6644736540970771f71687a0","5e709373878c28a0473a9ddb","5fae2146085dcb5a2b98da14","5e709388878c28a0473ac194","5f505f00752340073806a8ca","5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","6644736540970771f71687a1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793a7","mniswId":"16559","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","eissn":"0027-8424","documentHash":"6c7e55c8-7f5c-4cba-8821-15f816a6ebee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65798399409707070197880a","year":"2023","volume":"120","number":"50","documentHash":"d72a7d46-a13b-445d-ad80-e9b4e857deb0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059597389"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6644ab6240970771f71b123d","name":"Soumitra","lastName":"Satapathi","documentHash":"c42f80d9-b623-4eaf-9789-3762caa35076"},{"objectId":"6644ab6240970771f71b123c","name":"Goutam","lastName":"De","documentHash":"36f1a574-bdb5-4320-a398-a1bd56fc8680"},{"objectId":"6644ab6240970771f71b123b","name":"Hanlin","lastName":"Hu","documentHash":"3493ae79-c6c5-4e5f-8969-75b86296dd20"},{"objectId":"6644ab6240970771f71b123a","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"4e5cfc4e-627c-4801-8c49-0fd1c81c5b8b"},{"objectId":"6644ab6240970771f71b1239","name":"Parameswar K.","lastName":"Iyer","documentHash":"157f241b-61d6-4fff-b3c5-cf37f32b1388"},{"objectId":"6644ab6240970771f71b1238","name":"S.

However, major concerns like toxicity and stability issues of lead (Pb) based perovskites have tempted researchers to explore the potential of alternative Pb-free perovskite structures by replacing the Pb with nontoxic, or at least less-toxic, and less moisture/oxygen sensitive elements. In this review, we have discussed the effect of Pb2+ replacement with alternative metal ions on their band structures, thus illustrating their impact on the fundamental optoelectronic properties (band gap, binding energy, dielectric constant, effective mass, diffusion length, charge carrier lifetime, mobility, and defects) and identified the reasons, which make them lag behind their Pb-based counterparts. Additionally, the current scenario of the Pb-free perovskite photovoltaics, i.e., the effects of doping and interfacial engineering on the stability and photovoltaic performances, have been presented. The strategies of Pb replacement, such as isovalent or heterovalent substitution resulting in ABX(3), A(2)B(i)B(iii)X-6, A(3)B(iii)(2)X-9 and A(2)B(iv)X-6 materials have been highlighted (here denotes vacancy).

The low-grade kaolins were sourced from the Alvara similar to es (A) and Barqueiros (B) deposits in Portugal. Various sets of geopolymers were obtained by replacing MK with up to 75 wt% zeolite and adding cork residue, 20 wt% of the total powder mass, to all geopolymers (A25-C, B25-C - 25 % MK 75 % zeolite; A50-C, B50-C - 50 % MK 50 % zeolite; A75-C, B75-C -75 % MK 25 % zeolite; A100-C, B100-C - 100 % MK). To keep the environmental footprint of the chemicals to a minimum, the Na2O/Al2O3 and SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios were kept at 1. Geo-polymers were characterized to understand the influence of different ratios of MK and zeolite and also cork residue incorporation on their structure and surface morphology. The crystallinity of the geopolymers increased with increasing zeolite in the structure. The addition of cork residue appeared to yield compact geopolymer materials. Maximum compressive strengths of 26.7 and 25.3 MPa were obtained for Alvara similar to es and Barqueiros MK geopolymers, respectively, with only MK and cork residue in the structure, indicating that zeolite addition does not improve the compressive strength values. The adsorption of divalent Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ cations and the trivalent Cr3+ cation indicated high adsorption capacities of Portuguese MK-based geopolymers. The adsorption of the cations is dependent on the composition of the geopolymers yielding selective adsorption. The geopolymers adsorb Pb2+ in the highest amounts followed by Cd2+ and Cu2+. Zn2+ is adsorbed in slightly lower amounts and Cr3+ is adsorbed in the least amounts. The cork residue and zeolite appear to significantly affect the structure, morphology and properties of geopolymers Overall, the Portuguese MK geopolymers containing cork residue can be effective replacements for commercial MK geopolymers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4b8c9085dcb1e6ae0b8cc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"366","pagesFromTo":"130125","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4b8c9085dcb1e6ae0b8cc","664749604097071861eb106e","664749604097071861eb106f","664749604097071861eb1070","664749604097071861eb1071","664749604097071861eb1072"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777d3","mniswId":"4336","title":"Construction and Building Materials","issn":"0950-0618","eissn":"0950-0618","documentHash":"c45e8eee-1b27-4448-9846-76627aa99baf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664749604097071861eb106d","year":"2023","volume":"366","documentHash":"7f970fa0-3f4c-4f92-a5a0-9064e9d96069"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059600876"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb067","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Żuk","uuid":"A2CF96DA8DBC0F0EC756C6ABC4425D960DE3CE0ABBAA543C816DF4A24FDC838930FFB8FDCE1B3C5232CB0C3FD9D93CDDF5F6336061F13F18AC43F6C77E9DD4F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0555-5913","documentHash":"323764fb-47c8-4632-b36c-1a2615cfd8d2"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Giżyński","uuid":"7AEDD73DD5B1257841075AC646D7AF5FC2472AC6E46D6B167FA3D962FDEFA3E257CD7B398C64DC6A04810369674D2DCA9ABA0C97270D398AA0B697F0E2F788ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-3547-1174","documentHash":"1424e1a0-06b3-460a-9b83-8855874b6421"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maciołek","uuid":"E3E9BCC7397B929B2C469D73E68AE44FB2E6F4892A7DC44C238F904FE76F9D470FD528254865B02108CA8B9311A7A421914ADC30598B3516CDD6CB7BF0F07C81","orcidId":"0000-0002-2371-4183","documentHash":"d2f0a437-c8a3-4dc0-9358-3f2e9c4648e4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","name":"Karol","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"30216860D4FCF71F80CCF2F14F9FA6358B5A0632271ACE53CD62EC8265F97928E335571E5A301CC0BA9C252A21169DB64AF4E27EC652B74805AD01BFF7BDF4DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9769-7646","documentHash":"3ea17df7-ffc6-4937-bb72-a24f676f97e3"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hołyst","uuid":"E92F295C3CC2CB6B18C450B2AB735CDA75E1B176DB096D3C43CB9E6E23F05E2B3448297032B471C71265740E595D30DAA6BA0B89CC0DB4589E73DB45075B7008","orcidId":"0000-0002-3211-4286","documentHash":"cbe7625d-9b95-4888-b28d-a8e3f921d07f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6661abd8409707458fba44ca","doi":"10.3390/e25111505","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/11/1505/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Parameters of State in the Global Thermodynamics of Binary Ideal Gas Mixtures in a Stationary Heat Flow","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we formulate the first law of global thermodynamics for stationary states of the binary ideal gas mixture subjected to heat flow. We map the non-uniform system onto the uniform one and show that the internal energy 𝑈(𝑆∗,𝑉,𝑁1,𝑁2,𝑓∗1,𝑓∗2) is the function of the following parameters of state: a non-equilibrium entropy 𝑆∗, volume V, number of particles of the first component, 𝑁1, number of particles of the second component 𝑁2 and the renormalized degrees of freedom. The parameters 𝑓∗1,𝑓∗2, 𝑁1,𝑁2\n satisfy the relation (𝑁1/(𝑁1+𝑁2))𝑓∗1/𝑓1+(𝑁2/(𝑁1+𝑁2))𝑓∗2/𝑓2=1 (𝑓1 and 𝑓2 are the degrees of freedom for each component respectively). Thus, only 5 parameters of state describe the non-equilibrium state of the binary mixture in the heat flow. We calculate the non-equilibrium entropy 𝑆∗and new thermodynamic parameters of state 𝑓∗1,𝑓∗2 explicitly. The latter are responsible for heat generation due to the concentration gradients. The theory reduces to equilibrium thermodynamics, when the heat flux goes to zero. As in equilibrium thermodynamics, the steady-state fundamental equation also leads to the thermodynamic Maxwell relations for measurable steady-state properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","5e709459878c28a0473bb067","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1505","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","5e709459878c28a0473bb067"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ae1","mniswId":"5774","title":"Entropy","issn":"1099-4300","eissn":"1099-4300","documentHash":"326c4a3d-8fe2-43e4-b926-8473e54837e2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661abd8409707458fba44cb","year":"2023","volume":"25","number":"11","documentHash":"b9956ff6-41d1-4c4a-9cd7-44f22ac51a2b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059611562"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664473da40970771f7168efa","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"e347e686-ab58-4b79-ac14-d87593703aa9"},{"objectId":"664473da40970771f7168ef9","name":"Abul","lastName":"Kalam","documentHash":"20cd56a7-6813-4a5a-9b37-9b592e9a02b7"},{"objectId":"664473da40970771f7168ef8","name":"Seckin","lastName":"Akin","documentHash":"22d67d17-7e1f-423d-bb66-bbabe4ffe212"},{"objectId":"664473da40970771f7168ef7","name":"Nishi","lastName":"Parikh","documentHash":"26bb066a-0dbf-48aa-b690-44308839f824"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"objectId":"664473da40970771f7168ef5","doi":"10.1021/acsami.3c00269","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsami.3c00269","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Probing the Low-Frequency Response of Impedance Spectroscopy of Halide Perovskite Single Crystals Using Machine Learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has emergedas a versatiletechnique for characterization and analysis of metal halide perovskitesolar cells (PSCs). The crucial information about ion migration andcarrier accumulation in PSCs can be extracted from the low-frequencyregime of the EIS spectrum. However, lengthy measurement time at lowfrequencies along with material degradation due to prolonged exposureto light and bias motivates the use of machine learning (ML) in predictingthe low-frequency response. Here, we have developed an ML model topredict the low-frequency response of the halide perovskite singlecrystals. We first synthesized high-quality MAPbBr(3) singlecrystals and subsequently recorded the EIS spectra at different appliedbias and illumination intensities to prepare the dataset comprising8741 datapoints. The developed supervised ML model can predict thereal and imaginary parts of the low-frequency EIS response with an R (2) score of 0.981 and a root mean squared error(RMSE) of 0.0196 for the testing set. From the ground truth experimentaldata, it can be observed that negative capacitance prevails at a higherapplied bias. Our developed model can closely predict the real andimaginary parts at a low frequency (50 Hz-300 mHz). Thus, ourmethod makes recording of EIS more accessible and opens a new wayin using the ML techniques for EIS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"27801-27808","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["664473da40970771f7168ef7","664473da40970771f7168ef8","664473da40970771f7168ef9","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","664473da40970771f7168efa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec00e2bad49b31ccedf6901","title":"ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces","issn":"1944-8244","documentHash":"e8d74358-b736-45ce-8356-c88d6c7f7975"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664473da40970771f7168ef6","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"23","documentHash":"0c733e00-a022-4882-b237-746a44e58836"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059611585"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a9c2409707458fb9d364","name":"Neerish","lastName":"Revaprasadu","documentHash":"861b6ac4-12a2-4bb2-ad45-0760fe069d91"},{"objectId":"6661a9c2409707458fb9d363","name":"Ram K.","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"e5800cc6-cc02-422f-a4d3-cba76f8b85d9"},{"objectId":"6661a9c2409707458fb9d362","name":"Jonghyun","lastName":"Choi","documentHash":"e6931f21-7767-4c41-8906-38ab4ca31bf0"},{"objectId":"6661a9c2409707458fb9d361","name":"Felipe M.","lastName":"de Souza","documentHash":"226df4a8-6296-4c54-95b5-3992d53fe700"},{"objectId":"6661a9c2409707458fb9d360","name":"Siphamandla C.","lastName":"Masikane","documentHash":"6dd35c87-740d-42e0-b211-abc98c5f7d68"},{"objectId":"6661a9c2409707458fb9d35f","name":"Nene","lastName":"Lethukuthula","documentHash":"6ee21a1d-3f99-4ace-9566-5045374c8012"},{"objectId":"6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","name":"Malik","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"3F14D6BD4340633067804C270812A937F4E92325031BE1176142856E397CDDA3DE8C90CE8CB58D3FB67D87C91202A989955940DCCDD0BEF387B162A98B900235","orcidId":"0000-0002-3316-041X","documentHash":"b5f5ad91-b181-4281-9e6e-7bd70d906091"}],"objectId":"6661a9c2409707458fb9d35d","doi":"10.1016/j.mssp.2022.107252","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1369800122007788?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Green synthesis of non-stoichiometric indium sulfide (In2.77S4) nanoparticles for water splitting and supercapacitance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The synthesis of electroactive multifunctional materials with high performance is an inherently challenging process. Furthermore, finding a green approach to make the process more feasible and convenient is highly desirable. Based on these challenges, herein, a facile and green microwave-assisted approach for the synthesis of phase pure sulfur-deficient indium sulfide (In2.77S4) nanoparticles is demonstrated. Green, economical and readily available reagents, such as castor oil and olive oil, were employed as green dispersants, solvents, and capping agents. Moreover, different sulfur-containing reagents, i.e., sodium sulfide, thioacetamide and thiourea, were employed in the synthesis to elucidate the effect of sulfur source on synthesized nanoparticles. Since electrocatalytic properties are significantly affected by the nature of the ligand on the surface of catalysts, therefore their performance for supercapacitance and water splitting is investigated. High-quality In2.77S4 prepared in castor oil, using thiourea as a sulfur source, showed satisfactory properties for energy storage such as specific capacitance of 540 F/g at 1 A/g current density as well as for both HER and OER with overpotentials of 158 and 346 mV, respectively."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"156","pagesFromTo":"107252","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6661a9c2409707458fb9d35f","6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","6661a9c2409707458fb9d360","6661a9c2409707458fb9d361","6661a9c2409707458fb9d362","6661a9c2409707458fb9d363","6661a9c2409707458fb9d364"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d9b","mniswId":"13993","title":"Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing","issn":"1369-8001","eissn":"1873-4081","documentHash":"fb0fe70e-110b-4ebc-a6ae-f219459f0965"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661a9c2409707458fb9d35e","year":"2023","volume":"156","documentHash":"47ffd97d-1ea6-4fda-85d0-b7068f9fdc9d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059611917"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6644692940970771f715c9e7","name":"Olena","lastName":"Oranska","documentHash":"e7ee0a00-1356-4681-a8e6-2e1e9974425f"},{"objectId":"6644692940970771f715c9e6","name":"Olena","lastName":"Goncharuk","documentHash":"021f12ef-4eaa-4612-8d72-0da62ebecd14"},{"objectId":"6644692940970771f715c9e5","name":"Vitaliy","lastName":"Diuyk","documentHash":"3536b7f7-7387-4544-a2c0-8a75fcc07fc4"},{"objectId":"6644692940970771f715c9e4","name":"Olena","lastName":"Ischenko","documentHash":"6102005a-dc87-4259-b576-45861c78a3de"},{"objectId":"6644692940970771f715c9e3","name":"Alla","lastName":"Dyachenko","documentHash":"68e24b2f-b9ea-4324-923b-c7cef395a19d"},{"objectId":"6644692940970771f715c9e2","name":"Olha","lastName":"Pryhunova","documentHash":"63de5376-5d07-40ff-9094-68464cc86066"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf93e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bonarowska","uuid":"21F496BADEA1603A60B3BC0B550C9BDC48275EB56F9CDB4CC1C5F650844D5864C5733E50F68A3B809C8BF7B8BED5B67431EE5357365FDF42F01428BB1C0577A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3152-4400","documentHash":"3636a35f-940d-4f01-926a-3e4c22bb4c32"}],"objectId":"6644692940970771f715c9e0","doi":"10.1007/s13204-023-02781-x","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13204-023-02781-x.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"NiFe(CoFe)/silica and NiFe(CoFe)/alumina nanocomposites for the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The fumed SiO2 and Al2O3 oxides with a specifc surface area of about 80 m2 g–1 were used for the synthesis of Ni(80) Fe(20)/SiO2, Co(93)Fe(7)/SiO2, Ni(80)Fe(20)/Al2O3 and Co(93)Fe(7)/Al2O3 nanocomposites, and numbers between brackets indicate the metal content in wt%, being 10 wt% of the mass of catalysts.

nanoparticles selective for glyphosate, MIP-Gly NPs, were devised, synthesized, and subsequently integrated onto platinum screen-printed electrodes (Pt-SPEs) to fabricate a chemosensor for selective determination of glyphosate (Gly) without the need for redox probe in the test solution. That was because, ferrocenylmethyl methacrylate was added to the polymerization mixtures during the NPs synthesis so that the resulting MIP-Gly NPs contained covalently immobilized ferrocenyl moieties as the reporting redox ingredient, conferring these NPs with electroactive properties. MIP-Gly NPs of four different compositions were evaluated. The herein described approach represents a simple and effective way to endow MIP NPs with electrochemical reporting capabilities with neither the need to functionalize them post-synthesis nor to use electrochemical mediators present in the tested solution during the analyte determinations. MIP-Gly NPs synthesized using allylamine and squaramide-based monomers appeared most selective to Gly. The Pt-SPEs modified with MIP-Gly NPs were characterized with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Changes in the DPV peak originating from the oxidation of the ferrocenyl moieties in these MIP-Gly NPs served as the analytical signal. The DPV limit of detection and the linear dynamic concentration range for Gly were 3.7 pM and 25 pM-500 pM, respectively. Moreover, the selectivity of the fabricated chemosensors was sufficiently high to determine Gly successfully in spiked river water samples."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e70940c878c28a0473b56a9","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","5e709325878c28a0473a3a72","6549af3840e3ff4ef3f4deb5","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"236","pagesFromTo":"115381","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["664470df40970771f7166b43","664470df40970771f7166b44","664470df40970771f7166b45","6549af3840e3ff4ef3f4deb5","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e70940c878c28a0473b56a9","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","664470df40970771f7166b46","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e709325878c28a0473a3a72","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477391","mniswId":"2540","title":"Biosensors and Bioelectronics","issn":"0956-5663","documentHash":"1e742c4e-6298-4e16-828d-c99c0ac7190c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664470df40970771f7166b42","year":"2023","volume":"236","documentHash":"2c9bc09e-6d8d-4858-9534-043c75365405"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059614881"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664467f440970771f715bedf","name":"Zahra Momayez","lastName":"Sanat","documentHash":"58fc1d57-0e2c-4956-933b-a6e404288215"},{"objectId":"664467f440970771f715bede","name":"Bahman","lastName":"Fouladi","documentHash":"bc40e02a-8b16-4de0-8ad0-14ae31e06af9"},{"objectId":"664467f440970771f715bedd","name":"Milad","lastName":"Shahdkar","documentHash":"683b93e4-e52d-471e-9f29-97e1012b0bf1"},{"objectId":"664467f440970771f715bedc","name":"Mahdi","lastName":"Orang Gorabzarmakhi","documentHash":"8428ed86-f342-4726-a8fb-e902347bbcd6"},{"objectId":"664467f440970771f715bedb","name":"Ehsan","lastName":"Amini-Salehi","documentHash":"a819cbd3-54b9-4bbf-8af7-5176c5653072"},{"objectId":"664467f440970771f715beda","name":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Naghipour","documentHash":"d5686812-e1db-4dda-b22e-d2aaa12712b2"},{"objectId":"60c2fc239543c7233654339a","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Alipourfard","uuid":"09F87F13C145EAA33D5D3E392CC52D6627B20E2FB071920A9AC8A55B4EFE06CCFDC635D1FBCFD0C3CE2E997891A272F5A4326A19832587B921FF5E5C935B8BC5","documentHash":"92b7f0ed-674e-4ca5-b512-5aa90affbef8"}],"objectId":"664467f440970771f715bed8","doi":"10.1186/s13643-023-02299-x","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13643-023-02299-x.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effects of gut microbial therapy on lipid profile in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: an umbrella meta-analysis study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common liver disease, is closely associated with metabolic conditions such as obesity and diabetes mellitus, which significantly impact human health outcomes. The impaired lipid profiles observed in NAFLD individuals can further contribute to cardiovascular events. Despite the high prevalence of NAFLD, there is currently no confirmed intervention approved for its treatment. This study aimed to summarize the results of meta-analysis studies of randomized control trials assessing the impact of gut microbial therapy (probiotics, synbiotics, and prebiotics) on the lipid profile of individuals with NAFLD.\nMethods\nA systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to November 1, 2022. Meta-analyses surveying the impact of microbial therapy on lipid profile parameters (triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol (TC)) in the NAFLD population were included in our umbrella review. The final effect size (ES) was estimated, and sensitivity and subgroup analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity.\nResults\nFifteen studies were included in this umbrella review. Microbial therapy significantly reduced TG (ES − 0.31, 95% CI − 0.51, − 0.11, P < 0.01), TC (ES − 1.04, 95% CI − 1.46, − 0.61, P < 0.01), and LDL (ES − 0.77, 95% CI − 1.15, − 0.39, P < 0.01) in individuals with NAFLD. However, the effect on HDL was not statistically significant (ES − 0.06; 95% CI − 0.19, 0.07, P = 0.39).\nConclusion\nConsidering the absence of approved treatments for NAFLD and the promising role of microbial therapies in improving the three lipid profiles components in individuals with NAFLD, the use of these agents as alternative treatment options could be recommended. The findings underscore the potential of gut microbial therapy, including probiotics, synbiotics, and prebiotics, in managing NAFLD and its associated metabolic complications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["664467f440970771f715beda","664467f440970771f715bedb","664467f440970771f715bedc","664467f440970771f715bedd","664467f440970771f715bede","60c2fc239543c7233654339a","664467f440970771f715bedf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547eae5","mniswId":"26683","title":"Systematic Reviews","issn":"2046-4053","eissn":"2046-4053","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2964c687-3ac5-4402-b0b5-73a485259168"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664467f440970771f715bed9","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"c7bf1ac2-f3e8-4d9a-af46-f22f8733f233"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059614915"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664476a040970771f716be92","name":"Soumitra","lastName":"Satapathi","documentHash":"035c4167-4eed-4bd0-9a92-4c8f5fcfa74d"},{"objectId":"664476a040970771f716be91","name":"Parameswar K.","lastName":"Iyer","documentHash":"b9a276e6-9c67-41f5-8ead-d614c0c2614c"},{"objectId":"664476a040970771f716be90","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"b1108200-829d-477d-91e6-a295a390b42e"},{"objectId":"664476a040970771f716be8f","name":"-","lastName":"Yukta","documentHash":"3f6fb585-be45-4276-9d88-74a398bd346e"},{"objectId":"629eb829752340212cd272f2","name":"Rohit Dinkar","lastName":"Chavan","uuid":"42A4419351507C5EFF57A56FBFE83E1427C39AFCCFFE11312EE91407D09E063653D764F0C3E0A44E6E077C8C8285F6E7094D1AD7141AAAB755D357F2A203B403","orcidId":"0000-0001-9254-5048","documentHash":"911a2b07-da41-4a94-b31a-c3f1e2ca1b35"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"objectId":"664476a040970771f716be8d","doi":"10.1021/acsami.3c09887","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsami.3c09887","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Improved Efficiency and Stability in 1,5-Diaminonaphthalene Iodide-Passivated 2D/3D Perovskite Solar Cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Engineering multidimensional two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) perovskite interfaces as light harvesters has recently emerged as a potential strategy to obtain a higher photovoltaic performance in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with enhanced environmental stability. In this study, we utilized the 1,5-diammonium naphthalene iodide (NDAI) bulky organic spacer for interface modification in 3D perovskites for passivating the anionic iodide/uncoordinated Pb2+ vacancies as well as facilitating charge carrier transfer by improving the energy band alignment at the perovskite/HTL interface. Consequently, the NDAI-treated 2D/3D PSCs showed an enhanced open-circuit voltage and fill factor with a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.48%. In addition, 2D/3D perovskite devices without encapsulation exhibit a 77% retention of their initial output after 1000 h of aging under 50 +/- 5% relative humidity. Furthermore, even after 200 h of storage in 85 degrees C thermal stress, the devices maintain 60% of their initial PCE. The defect passivation and interface modification mechanism were studied in detail by UV vis absorption, photoluminescence spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), solid-state NMR, space-charge-limited current (SCLC) mobility measurement, and impedance spectroscopy. This study provides a promising path for perovskite surface modification in slowing their degradation against external stimuli, providing a future direction for increasing the perovskite device efficiency and durability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629eb829752340212cd272f2","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"46","pagesFromTo":"53351-53361","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["664476a040970771f716be8f","629eb829752340212cd272f2","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","664476a040970771f716be90","664476a040970771f716be91","664476a040970771f716be92"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dc5","mniswId":"125","title":"ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES","issn":"1944-8244","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/aamick","documentHash":"27b6e464-7a88-4cfc-a099-7ec8b65dc4b1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6644771840970771f716c4af","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"46","doi":"","documentHash":"fcd65fc0-d9ae-4205-a182-02e3b49d5610"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059614917"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66446aa540970771f715d0a1","name":"Ned S.","lastName":"Wingreen","documentHash":"9eebc97c-81a9-4bd0-aa5d-6fbd3c2b67c3"},{"objectId":"66446aa540970771f715d0a0","name":"Jens","lastName":"Elgeti","documentHash":"e3f9c91d-905e-497b-8a5f-9ad87f1f86c4"},{"objectId":"66446aa540970771f715d09f","name":"Jörn","lastName":"Dunkel","documentHash":"84cbb983-545c-4774-a41a-59d7921eb8f3"},{"objectId":"66446aa540970771f715d09e","name":"Knut","lastName":"Drescher","documentHash":"90b8e019-1c3d-4317-ae18-c1bef221d743"},{"objectId":"66446aa540970771f715d09d","name":"Sujit S.","lastName":"Datta","documentHash":"fb8b61d5-a4d4-4fa0-9ffa-810616536e0c"},{"objectId":"66446aa540970771f715d09c","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Hallatschek","documentHash":"0f192291-78c3-4a15-8e8e-cf23543a27f4"},{"objectId":"5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Wacław","uuid":"2C1F0B1E5915A2AE7C6A21FEB74B6EAAB6EEADBA510F9B9D6D976A06BE525AA1AFAB518E365046A9C632BC0912D06D7695FAAB325F685926EF96B780C3032E6A","documentHash":"2c71e559-80a7-4340-a94e-549f533b55f2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66446aa540970771f715d09a","doi":"10.1038/s42254-023-00593-0","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-023-00593-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Proliferating active matter","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The fascinating patterns of collective motion created by autonomously driven particles have fuelled active-matter research for over two decades. So far, theoretical active-matter research has often focused on systems with a fixed number of particles. This constraint imposes strict limitations on what behaviours can and cannot emerge. However, a hallmark of life is the breaking of local cell number conservation by replication and death. Birth and death processes must be taken into account, for example, to predict the growth and evolution of a microbial biofilm, the expansion of a tumour, or the development from a fertilized egg into an embryo and beyond. In this Perspective, we argue that unique features emerge in these systems because proliferation represents a distinct form of activity: not only do the proliferating entities consume and dissipate energy, they also inject biomass and degrees of freedom capable of further self-proliferation, leading to myriad dynamic scenarios. Despite this complexity, a growing number of studies document common collective phenomena in various proliferating soft-matter systems. This generality leads us to propose proliferation as another direction of active-matter physics, worthy of a dedicated search for new dynamical universality classes. Conceptual challenges abound, from identifying control parameters and understanding large fluctuations and nonlinear feedback mechanisms to exploring the dynamics and limits of information flow in self-replicating systems. We believe that, by extending the rich conceptual framework developed for conventional active matter to proliferating active matter, researchers can have a profound impact on quantitative biology and reveal fascinating emergent physics along the way.\nActive matter locally dissipates energy to produce systematic motion. This Perspective highlights proliferation as a special type of activity that breaks particle number conservation and thereby gives rise to a unique set of collective phenomena characteristic of life."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"5","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"407-419","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66446aa540970771f715d09c","66446aa540970771f715d09d","66446aa540970771f715d09e","66446aa540970771f715d09f","66446aa540970771f715d0a0","66446aa540970771f715d0a1","5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f51a","mniswId":"28918","title":"Nature Reviews Physics","eissn":"2522-5820","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"6e325cd9-7aed-4849-b28b-c9d5dd00e7ec"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66446aa540970771f715d09b","year":"2023","volume":"5","number":"7","documentHash":"67976105-aeda-4ae6-92d6-ed255175b793"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059615323"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6649043a40970727c4c808a5","name":"Albert","lastName":"Poater","documentHash":"819bfddd-444f-4857-a16e-f632d5479e33"},{"objectId":"6649043a40970727c4c808a4","name":"Michele","lastName":"Tomasini","documentHash":"0d5664c2-d7ff-4e60-847e-7921bebd9484"},{"objectId":"6649043a40970727c4c808a3","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wierzbicki","documentHash":"209b0219-5333-4aab-aa95-4f228b2d8c28"},{"objectId":"6649043a40970727c4c808a1","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Musioł","documentHash":"25a6a1c7-9780-4e10-a976-f8751799f38d"},{"objectId":"60c335899543c723365440fb","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Śniady - Maciążek","uuid":"910E1BF0454497A7F468E25A55F40561B2717A5C6BF9FB9F9CAF5FC4CF4FD42CE9CAE63DB9ADE93A8AB21174EE389949AD8F52B07E69831C31B19584C813E7CB","documentHash":"857239f8-6d46-467c-9c87-6f7269b13e55"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3200","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Czerwiński","uuid":"499AA554BE0EBA36E777E25E7096F21581863725F0CC710650E5561665A08D671F35DAA838E579FC8AF783A3895F162ECC89B5F51B4FDA80AA5BA3163305B4EB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0022-3813","documentHash":"3826bb66-2e03-4ded-a24e-ed0f21dd5326"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Danylyuk","uuid":"76C9B1CC8BF786B245E6E064FB1EF762E68427200C6553653512B713F436D343D13A0FB2F4895E1A41BC3AF4C15135CAD6F23994A9FF03CEFCD8BF9C0FB1D1C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3653-2418","documentHash":"f0349659-5182-4ae8-aa50-8a56d0ae53e1"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa8fc","name":"Michał","lastName":"MICHALAK","uuid":"A714AF40FB0C2CA0B3725F83D90D2DAC716B0980C4AC8C83A14F91512BFF9E89DF3687AF83040D8002D5F88A2B4CC32830908E7A99A71175CFAE5A6A7D1C3794","orcidId":"0000-0002-1193-1551","documentHash":"6e023e8e-6b40-4fce-a8d5-7395ca86949c"}],"objectId":"6649043a40970727c4c8089e","doi":"10.1002/chem.202303241","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.202303241","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Chiral NHC Ligands for Enantioselective Gold(I) Catalysis Under Aerobic Conditions: the Importance of Conformational Flexibility and Steric Hindrance of NHC Ligand on Reactivity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Gold(I) catalysis has been recognized as a valuable tool for the unique transformation of multiple carbon-carbon bonds. Enantioselective π-catalysis based on gold(I) complexes is, however, still underdeveloped due to lack of privileged ligands. Herein, we present an accessible method to a new family of stable yet catalytically active chiral NHC−Au(I)−Cl complexes. The key to preserving a simultaneous fine balance between reactivity and stability in this newly developed family appears to be sterically hindered, but conformationally flexible NHC ligands. These could be easily accessed on a multigram scale by merging sterically hindered anilines with commercially available amino alcohols and amines via a four-steps synthetic sequence without the need for chromatographic purification. Further investigations of the catalytic activity of NHC−Au−Cl complexes identified the OH functionality incorporated into the NHC core as crucial for the level of enantioselectivity as well as the TsO− anion responsible for the activation of NHC−Au(I)−Cl. Finally, NMR studies and X-ray investigations revealed for the first time that the widely accepted ion metathesis (NHC−Au−Cl to NHC−Au−OSO2R) responsible for the activation of NHC−Au−Cl complexes does not take place (or it is very slow) in commonly used MeNO2 in contrast to DCM."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c335899543c723365440fb","5e7093ea878c28a0473b3200","5e70937a878c28a0473aa8fc","6649043a40970727c4c808a3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"e202303241","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa8fc","5e7093ea878c28a0473b3200","60c335899543c723365440fb","6649043a40970727c4c808a1","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c","6649043a40970727c4c808a3","6649043a40970727c4c808a4","6649043a40970727c4c808a5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f1","mniswId":"3513","title":"Chemistry-A European Journal","doi":"10.1002/chem.","issn":"0947-6539","eissn":"1521-3765","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1521-3765","documentHash":"56606be2-854e-47eb-92eb-2de5acecfa73"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6649043a40970727c4c8089f","year":"2024","volume":"30","number":"13","documentHash":"7bae1d0f-de1c-4de0-a8df-e078d0b3959c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gold(I) complexess","N-heterocyclic carbene ligand","enantioselective catalysis","allenol cyclization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059615479"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fd1","name":"Hsien‐Yi","lastName":"Hsu","documentHash":"5fcf2e9e-2dc4-4b5f-b997-fbcba0f9d95f"},{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fd0","name":"Ji‐Jung","lastName":"Kai","documentHash":"3a3c41d7-8b48-4f3e-b1e1-15766c2636ec"},{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fcf","name":"Shijun","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"0406ee5c-daca-4844-bb25-dd8387d6de81"},{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fce","name":"Mingjian","lastName":"Yuan","documentHash":"59ad6f1f-3916-44b6-94a5-861773127077"},{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fcd","name":"Haisheng","lastName":"Song","documentHash":"fd048086-f52d-448c-b725-ecfcc5d2f350"},{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fcc","name":"Kuan‐Chen","lastName":"Cheng","documentHash":"1d92ca59-9c20-48ea-9eb1-f4934ba03617"},{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fcb","name":"Guohua","lastName":"Jia","documentHash":"367d72b2-3926-439c-8a67-ab4e8cb3c905"},{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fca","name":"Jun","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"3a18bef7-407b-42c3-be44-3f55372881f2"},{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fc9","name":"Chun Hong","lastName":"Mak","documentHash":"1c606af4-40da-41fc-8073-89bec5b7be23"},{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fc8","name":"Yunqi","lastName":"Tang","documentHash":"db8fe387-400a-40ef-ae7b-b6603f514694"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fc6","doi":"10.1002/adma.202207835","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adma.202207835","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Unravelling the Interfacial Dynamics of Bandgap Funneling in Bismuth‐Based Halide Perovskites","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An environmentally friendly mixed-halide perovskite MA(3)Bi(2)Cl(9-)(x)I(x) with a bandgap funnel structure has been developed. However, the dynamic interfacial interactions of bandgap funneling in MA(3)Bi(2)Cl(9-)(x)I(x) perovskites in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) system remain ambiguous. In light of this, single- and mixed-halide lead-free bismuth-based hybrid perovskites-MA(3)Bi(2)Cl(9-)(y)I(y) and MA(3)Bi(2)I(9) (named MBCl-I and MBI)-in the presence and absence of the bandgap funnel structure, respectively, are prepared. Using temperature-dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques, the photophysical and (photo)electrochemical phenomena of solid-solid and solid-liquid interfaces for MBCl-I and MBI halide perovskites are therefore confirmed. Concerning the mixed-halide hybrid perovskites MBCl-I with a bandgap funnel structure, stronger electronic coupling arising from an enhanced overlap of electronic wavefunctions results in more efficient exciton transport. Besides, MBCl-I's effective diffusion coefficient and electron-transfer rate demonstrate efficient heterogeneous charge transfer at the solid-liquid interface, generating improved photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Consequently, this combination of photophysical and electrochemical techniques opens up an avenue to explore the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials for elucidating the correlation between material characterization and device performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66446d4840970771f7162fc8","66446d4840970771f7162fc9","66446d4840970771f7162fca","66446d4840970771f7162fcb","66446d4840970771f7162fcc","66446d4840970771f7162fcd","66446d4840970771f7162fce","66446d4840970771f7162fcf","66446d4840970771f7162fd0","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","66446d4840970771f7162fd1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e86","mniswId":"430","title":"ADVANCED MATERIALS","issn":"0935-9648","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"82b622a2-d6b8-43b2-b322-bc899ab26c0c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66446d4840970771f7162fc7","year":"2022","volume":"35","number":"2","documentHash":"5c7b9447-568f-4b52-8c37-39f007950560"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059615507"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664b078740970745fde54ab9","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"542277bd-fb20-4c94-b6c8-7c18fec0916a"},{"objectId":"664b078740970745fde54ab8","name":"Abul","lastName":"Kalam","documentHash":"d1c66f30-8d61-4df6-bca5-51fe92b077a8"},{"objectId":"664b078740970745fde54ab7","name":"Mohammad Mahdi","lastName":"Tavakoli","documentHash":"13cd9e8a-d32f-44d6-a87b-62cdbe877dc1"},{"objectId":"664b078740970745fde54ab6","name":"Soumitra","lastName":"Satapathi","documentHash":"03b83944-81c7-45ef-a3b4-a4d143a83498"},{"objectId":"664b078740970745fde54ab5","name":"Seckin","lastName":"Akin","documentHash":"742bf966-12b6-445a-93bc-6501b4980a74"},{"objectId":"664b078740970745fde54ab4","name":"Nishi","lastName":"Parikh","documentHash":"c98b2248-126b-4c05-a8fb-a03fa94ffecb"},{"objectId":"664b078740970745fde54ab3","name":"Siddhi Vinayak","lastName":"Pandey","documentHash":"36895bd9-8798-4b7b-aa3d-09085cc0ecea"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"objectId":"664b078740970745fde54ab1","doi":"10.1039/d2se01209j","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/SE/D2SE01209J","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Predicting the state parameters of lithium ion batteries: the race between filter-based and data driven approaches","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) have revolutionized the era of electrical energy storage by offering high energy density and longer life cycles in various applications such as electric vehicles, electronic gadgets, satellites and power grids.

Filter-based and data driven techniques estimate these parameters accurately even under dynamic battery operation. In this paper, first, we have given details about experimental techniques through which LIB state parameters are estimated, but due to poor nonlinearity handling capacity of these models, we showcase the potential of various filter-based and data driven techniques with a variety of features extracted from LIBs. Subsequently, we discuss the working and performance of various filter based and data driven algorithms utilised in predicting the state parameters of batteries such as SOC, SOH & RUL in detail. Additionally, a comparative table comprising features, predictive techniques and performance is made to highlight the effectiveness of each method. Finally, we propose a strategy to improve the estimation accuracy of LIBs. Overall, the paper provides a comprehensive review of various estimating lgorithms and their potential in predicting the state parameters of LIBs with an aim to develop an intelligent framework for required applications and highlights the challenges which are yet to be overcome."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"598-628","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["664b078740970745fde54ab3","664b078740970745fde54ab4","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","664b078740970745fde54ab5","664b078740970745fde54ab6","664b078740970745fde54ab7","664b078740970745fde54ab8","664b078740970745fde54ab9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d419","mniswId":"19181","title":"Sustainable Energy & Fuels","issn":"2398-4902","eissn":"2398-4902","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f6d6dd82-2bcc-4b30-9385-92a786d3b651"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664b078740970745fde54ab2","year":"2023","volume":"7","number":"3","documentHash":"fff1bcc2-cbe2-4a82-9624-b37a640d4b12"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059618387"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664b081140970745fde54e51","name":"M.

Our calculated IMFPs, designated as optical IMFPs, could be fitted to a modified form of the relativistic Bethe equation for inelastic scattering of electrons in matter from 50 eV to 200 keV. The root mean square (RMS) deviations in these fits were less than 1% for Si3N4 and LiF. The IMFPs were also compared with the relativistic version of our predictive Tanuma–Powell–Penn (TPP-2M) equation. We found that IMFPs calculated from the TPP-2M equation are systematically larger than the optical IMFPs for both LiF and Si3N4. The RMS differences between IMFPs from the TPP-2M equation and the optical IMFPs were 49.3% for LiF and 17.3% for Si3N4 for energies between 50 eV and 200 keV. These RMS differences are much larger than those for most of the inorganic compounds in our previous IMFP calculations where the average RMS difference was 10.7% for 42 inorganic compounds. We also report the development of an improved predictive IMFP formula, which we designate as the JTP equation. This formula is a refinement of the TPP-2M equation and is based on the recent IMFP calculations for 100 materials including the present IMFPs for Si3N4 and LiF (41 elemental solids, 45 inorganic compounds, and 14 organic compounds) for 83 electron energies between 50 eV and 200 keV. Our predictive JTP equation gave satisfactory results in comparisons of optical IMFPs and IMFPs calculated from the JTP equation. The RMS difference between the 8300 optical IMFPs used for optimization and the IMFPs calculated from the JTP equation was 10.2%. This value is appreciably less than the RMS difference of 16.0% found in a similar comparison of the optical IMFPs and IMFPs from the TPP-2M equation. Furthermore, IMFPs from the JTP equation were compared with measured IMFPs for energies between 50 eV and 200 keV for 16 elemental solids and 37 inorganic compounds. We found that the JTP equation gave satisfactory results that were comparable with previous comparisons of the optical IMFPs and measured IMFPs.

Opin. Electrochem. 2020, 22, 170−177]. Attainable limits of quantification are made much larger by greater background currents and insufficient instrumentation, which restricts progress in sensing and single-entity applications. This limitation can be overcome by converting electrochemical charges into photons, which can be detected with much greater sensitivity, even down to a single-photon level. In this work, we demonstrate the use of fluorescence, induced through a closed bipolar setup, to monitor charge-transfer processes below the detection limit of electrochemical workstations. During this process, the oxidation of ferrocenemethanol (FcMeOH) in one cell is used to concurrently drive the oxidation of Amplex Red (AR), a fluorogenic redox molecule, in another cell. The spectroelectrochemistry of AR is investigated and new insights on the commonplace practice of using deprotonated glucose to limit AR photooxidation are presented. The closed bipolar setup is used to produce fluorescence signals corresponding to the steady-state voltammetry of FcMeOH on a microelectrode. Chronopotentiometry is then used to show a linear relationship between the charge passed through FcMeOH oxidation and the integrated AR fluorescence signal. The sensitivity of the measurements obtained at different timescales varies between 2200 and 500 electrons per detected photon. The electrochemical detection limit is approached using a diluted FcMeOH solution in which no faradaic current signal is observed. Nevertheless, a fluorescence signal corresponding to FcMeOH oxidation is still seen, and the detection of charges down to 300 fC is demonstrated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b","602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"95","issue":"30","pagesFromTo":"11227-11235","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477015","mniswId":"1091","title":"Analytical Chemistry","issn":"0003-2700","eissn":"1520-6882","documentHash":"8f3773b7-6df0-4b93-a2cc-a2900cc9dcb3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66474a094097071861eb1764","year":"2023","volume":"95","number":"30","documentHash":"074ad396-f30d-48ed-8e93-ce4e8057aa35"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059619004"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6666ffa840970767cfbf6346","name":"Booki","lastName":"Min","documentHash":"0ea7fbec-ae25-480a-9d39-00f12d29c6bf"},{"objectId":"6666ffa840970767cfbf6345","name":"Umesh K.","lastName":"Tiwari","documentHash":"a8de4665-bdbd-43b9-b756-9269950c864c"},{"objectId":"6666ffa840970767cfbf6344","name":"Balendu Sekhar","lastName":"Giri","documentHash":"980e5257-65d9-4325-83c1-429df60e0c6a"},{"objectId":"6666ffa840970767cfbf6343","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","documentHash":"8e631635-4355-4c95-bae6-16fd54df00b2"},{"objectId":"6666ffa840970767cfbf6342","name":"-","lastName":"Mansi","documentHash":"c2d86c3a-ac15-4eb5-b585-e8ec67659e51"},{"objectId":"6666ffa840970767cfbf6341","name":"Md Tabish","lastName":"Noori","documentHash":"929c0e9a-1989-4244-8ba3-714bd5b3fe88"},{"objectId":"632925a975234038513ec7cd","name":"Vishal","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"0D354B8FF99322E996FAD697B910B9306BF493B61B1F346347D695464BD50998A218E449DB5FC5607022C923AA46F5781E11CB0C661050D2DB1C6080ECBFEEED","documentHash":"7588df5d-7d93-4a1b-a3cc-2c5777e99ac2"},{"objectId":"605d60749543c745d80e5a65","name":"Bhavana","lastName":"Gupta","uuid":"AC6B32A259B1EED07E7B7D122C124FA2584D1B82B4F45CC0C27768ECDC0E45D999F07DF9B0C583C66EC6E7ED36C4346B55C7FD0A32759764560A404DBD4DC401","orcidId":"0000-0001-9426-8750","documentHash":"fb539681-d025-47b3-a615-41ecb8bac193"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"}],"objectId":"6666ffa840970767cfbf6340","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-49246-3","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49246-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Copper foam supported g-C3N4-metal–organic framework bacteria biohybrid cathode catalyst for CO2 reduction in microbial electrosynthesis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) presents a versatile approach for efficiently converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable products. However, poor electron uptake by the microorganisms from the cathode severely limits the performance of MES. In this study, a graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4)-metal-organic framework (MOF) i.e. HKUST-1 composite was newly designed and synthesized as the cathode catalyst for MES operations. The physiochemical analysis such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy showed the successful synthesis of g-C3N4-HKUST-1, whereas electrochemical assessments revealed its enhanced kinetics for redox reactions. The g-C3N4-HKUST-1 composite displayed excellent biocompatibility to develop electroactive biohybrid catalyst for CO2 reduction. The MES with g-C3N4-HKUST-1 biohybrid demonstrated an excellent current uptake of 1.7 mA/cm(2), which was noted higher as compared to the MES using g-C3N4 biohybrid (1.1 mA/cm(2)). Both the MESs could convert CO2 into acetic and isobutyric acid with a significantly higher yield of 0.46 g/L.d and 0.14 g/L.d respectively in MES with g-C3N4-HKUST-1 biohybrid and 0.27 g/L.d and 0.06 g/L.d, respectively in MES with g-C3N4 biohybrid.

Despite the large number of studies on the properties of perovskite single-crystals (SCs) photodetectors (PDs), the underlying mechanism that governs the spectral line shape of transient photocurrent is not fully understood. Here, methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3)SC based PDs are used to study the effect of different electrode spacing and bias on the transient photocurrent response under blue and green light irradiation. The observed differences in the spectral line shape of the transient photocurrent are explained using three-step carrier transport model, which reveals the occurrence of carrier trapping and a recombination process in MAPbBr3 SC. The findings are further corroborated by intensity-dependent photocurrent and impedance spectroscopy analysis of the resulting PDs. This work provides a basic insight into the origin of the different behavior of transient photocurrent response under variable electrode distance, bias, and irradiance light, which is expected to help to further understand and optimize the performance of perovskite based PDs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629eb829752340212cd272f2","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622ac2387523402df090302f","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb","666053cb409707400752e9c9","629eb829752340212cd272f2","666053cb409707400752e9ca","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b859","mniswId":"422","title":"Advanced Electronic Materials","issn":"2199-160X","eissn":"2199-160X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"eb6fea33-0fe7-42d7-827f-23f091b7b5b0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64e348b74097073a37720a1d","year":"2023","volume":"9","number":"8","documentHash":"4468abb1-3d2d-4c20-a76b-9159801acfe0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059631573"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661944a409707458fb5f803","name":"Peter T.","lastName":"Ndifon","documentHash":"5cc044f4-8252-48b6-b255-e674297fd1e5"},{"objectId":"6661944a409707458fb5f802","name":"Neerish","lastName":"Revaprasadu","documentHash":"7a12b790-0635-4299-9783-34cc542c5ebc"},{"objectId":"6661944a409707458fb5f801","name":"Ram K.","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"248d209c-5943-4037-8bc9-f6cac0235a16"},{"objectId":"6661944a409707458fb5f800","name":"Wang","lastName":"Lin","documentHash":"a2b0e402-2c37-4004-a950-9a0561af5150"},{"objectId":"6661944a409707458fb5f7ff","name":"Felipe M.","lastName":"de Souza","documentHash":"294e5a39-39bc-481a-a400-3242bd678cfe"},{"objectId":"6661944a409707458fb5f7fe","name":"Linda D.","lastName":"Nyamen","documentHash":"ff7452ca-b253-408d-a15e-eb24bb09ac54"},{"objectId":"6661944a409707458fb5f7fd","name":"Gervais A.","lastName":"Tigwere","documentHash":"17d296ba-12f5-494d-920d-52e9845f332b"},{"objectId":"6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","name":"Malik","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"3F14D6BD4340633067804C270812A937F4E92325031BE1176142856E397CDDA3DE8C90CE8CB58D3FB67D87C91202A989955940DCCDD0BEF387B162A98B900235","orcidId":"0000-0002-3316-041X","documentHash":"b5f5ad91-b181-4281-9e6e-7bd70d906091"}],"objectId":"6661944a409707458fb5f7fb","doi":"10.1016/j.mssp.2023.107365","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1369800123000586?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Transition metal (Ni, Cu and Fe) doped MnS nanostructures: Effect of doping on supercapacitance and water splitting","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Increasing demand for sustainable energy has boosted the exploration of inexpensive and efficient catalysts.

The morphology of pristine and TM-doped MnS nanoparticles was studied using transmission electron micro-scopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, while optical and structural properties were studied using UV-visible spectroscopy and powder X-ray diffraction (p-XRD), respectively. p-XRD analysis confirmed the successful incorporation of dopants into MnS lattice structure and suitability of heterocyclic dithiocarbamate complexes for phase/composition controlled synthesis of nanomaterials. The effect of doping on electrocatalytic properties was also investigated. The MnS-based electrodes doped with Ni and Fe presented satisfactory specific capacitances of 840 and 900 F/g at 2 mV/s scan rate. In addition, the testing for electro-catalysis for the water-splitting process demonstrated that Ni-MnS had a superior performance for HER with a eta of 132 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 44 mV/dec. On the other hand, Fe-MnS showed better performance towards OER with a eta of 280 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 60 mV/dec."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"158","pagesFromTo":"107365","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6661944a409707458fb5f7fd","6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","6661944a409707458fb5f7fe","6661944a409707458fb5f7ff","6661944a409707458fb5f800","6661944a409707458fb5f801","6661944a409707458fb5f802","6661944a409707458fb5f803"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d9b","mniswId":"13993","title":"Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing","issn":"1369-8001","eissn":"1873-4081","documentHash":"fb0fe70e-110b-4ebc-a6ae-f219459f0965"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661944a409707458fb5f7fc","year":"2023","volume":"158","documentHash":"f289354d-d97a-493b-8e42-0f0be136569e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059631784"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661925e409707458fb5ac37","name":"S.","lastName":"Dietrich","documentHash":"440e054d-5e9d-4b01-98c9-1f2184d5a3ea"},{"objectId":"6661925e409707458fb5ac36","name":"Oleg A.","lastName":"Vasilyev","documentHash":"ae0967da-c880-47cb-93e8-e5e1a1fef31c"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maciołek","uuid":"E3E9BCC7397B929B2C469D73E68AE44FB2E6F4892A7DC44C238F904FE76F9D470FD528254865B02108CA8B9311A7A421914ADC30598B3516CDD6CB7BF0F07C81","orcidId":"0000-0002-2371-4183","documentHash":"d2f0a437-c8a3-4dc0-9358-3f2e9c4648e4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6661925e409707458fb5ac34","doi":"10.1016/j.physa.2023.128960","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378437123005150?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Sensitivity of the thermodynamics of two-dimensional systems towards the topological classes of their surfaces","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Using Monte Carlo simulations we study the two-dimensional Ising model on closed manifolds of various topologies near the critical point of the planar bulk system. To this end we consider triangular, square, and hexagonal lattices.

In particular, for each lattice decoration the maxima of the scaling functions of chi grow as K increases. For the specific heat this relationship is inverted: e.g., for each lattice decoration the maxima of the scaling functions of C on the spherical surface (Euler characteristic K = 2) is smaller than on the projective plane (K = 1) which, in turn, is smaller than on the torus and on the Klein bottle (both with K = 0). We find that if the aspect ratio of the lattices is conform to a square geometrical shape, the magnetic susceptibility scaling functions for different lattice types differ only by a non-universal amplitude.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Herein, we report a facile transformation of waste date seeds into highly porous activated carbon (D-800) via simple one pot hydrothermal carbonization followed by KOH activation route. The resultant date seeds derived activated carbon was then co-doped with nitrogen and sulphur (NSD-800) via effective binary heteroatom doping method. The NSD-800 material has interconnected pores like framework, which facilitate significant ion storage and fast ion transport. Heteroatom doping produces a faradaic contribution in addition to the EDLC (electric double layer capacitor) characteristics of the carbon which facilitates the faster diffusion process. Hence, NSD-800 demonstrate promising electrochemical performance achieving a high specific capacitance of 298.5 F/g at 0.5 A/g using 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte. Furthermore, symmetrical and asymmetrical supercapacitor (SC) devices were fabricated using these electrode materials for comparison purpose. It is found that D-800//NSD-800 asymmetric SC device shows superior electrochemical performance delivering high energy density of similar to 30 Wh/kg at a power density of 394 W/kg along with extraordinary cyclic stability of 92.7 % after 10,000 charge-discharge cycles.

However, the processes rely almost exclusively on expensive noble metal complexes, most notably iridium complexes, to absorb light and transfer a single charge to a substrate or a catalyst to initiate cascade transformations. Light-triggered plasmon resonances generate a non-Fermi-Dirac energy distribution with many hot carriers that decay in ∼1 ps. Their ultrafast relaxation makes performing single electron transfer (SET) transformations challenging. Herein, a novel photosystem is proposed based on surface-modified gold nanoparticles (aka plasmon \"molecularization\"), which improved charge separation and, more importantly, enabled SET reactions, expanding the portfolio of photocatalysts available for photoredox catalysis. The photosystem was made into an electrode, permitting its use in photoelectrochemical arrangements that leverage electro- and photo-chemical approaches' benefits and chemical engineering solutions, helping the synthetic chemistry efforts towards greener synthesis and synthesis of more complex structures on a scale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","pagesFromTo":"101783","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6661aaac409707458fb9ffcf","6661aaac409707458fb9ffd0","6661aaac409707458fb9ffd1","6661aaac409707458fb9ffd2","6661aaac409707458fb9ffd3","6661aaac409707458fb9ffd4","6661aaac409707458fb9ffd5","6661aaac409707458fb9ffd6","6661aaac409707458fb9ffd7","6661aaac409707458fb9ffd8","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc39","mniswId":"13999","title":"Materials Today Chemistry","issn":"2468-5194","eissn":"2468-5194","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"c855d6ed-5f98-42d7-80a8-9265675a9b87"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661aaac409707458fb9ffce","year":"2023","volume":"34","documentHash":"14516820-bf15-4eaa-9cde-32c8fda87638"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059635130"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cf1","name":"Maria","lastName":"Tirelli","uuid":"882E8F14E51EDA1525C2D1F1D129406658AD36E2E9267D10899D6D79F2B07077A29805B0EB309375A2A08B606565E701B830F180302A1DC1BC99431890574253","documentHash":"ce393929-5a2c-475d-a7ed-65ecf134da91"},{"objectId":"5fc4cd7c085dcb1e6ae0b90c","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Nalin","uuid":"F44413A9AE2D03C55A336C526D322069FDEBED70AA6EEC2A68B1775297C16CD0AF9EDD36FCE0EA0565E74DD90FEAF47CDBC9373C0016257806E75536A7985101","orcidId":"0000-0003-3392-0359","documentHash":"d0c07d2c-5ff8-4649-94de-a656b51b27b6"},{"objectId":"5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","name":"Marco","lastName":"Costantini","uuid":"39AF91D3BD887DDA9D7064C2EEA4EC3EA3433737B56F1680E3899FD57F4B56CF80C6CBF0037AABC256FFEBAA40368FC799B344097649E00467A4677CD64AE0F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2756-5872","documentHash":"cb8eda43-6975-486d-98a0-48f4cabbf744"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Garstecki","uuid":"75C65452002051CEFFE6071097E89DF6A74DD0FC1A118DE168CD40EFEDC485E8FF7DCB8A8288FEEBC45B2BDC2ADE2FC757D7CC1EB814D7EB9EAFD1588F4EB22E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9101-7163","documentHash":"cdc40e41-dc83-4780-be61-52db050a0f2d"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a176b","name":"Witold","lastName":"Postek","uuid":"47D349CB03FF194CE2D0465994215AF15F8684B8B7237E34026159CBA81DA08DCA2BBA4B33B832E70390259C54DD735BB27E95D8BD4E6BE0CB8DB79F5AD66F70","orcidId":"0000-0003-0329-4983","documentHash":"ce83d57e-25e9-460d-919b-271b4a88052d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6661aeec409707458fbabe2b","doi":"10.1039/d3lc00658a","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/LC/D3LC00658A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Tuna-step: tunable parallelized step emulsification for the generation of droplets with dynamic volume control to 3D print functionally graded porous materials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present tuna-step, a novel microfluidic module based on step emulsification that allows for reliable generation of droplets of different sizes.

To overcome this, we incorporate a thin membrane underneath the step nozzle that can be actuated by pressure, enabling the tuning of the nozzle size on-demand. By controllably reducing the height of the nozzle, we successfully achieved a three-order-of-magnitude variation in droplet volume without adjusting the flow rates of the two phases. We developed and applied a new hydrophilic surface modification, that ensured long-term stability and prevented swelling of the device when generating oil-in-water droplets. Our system produced functionally graded soft materials with adjustable porosity and material content. By combining our microfluidic device with a custom 3D printer, we generated and extruded oil-in-water emulsions in an agarose gel bath, creating unique self-standing 3D hydrogel structures with porosity decoupled from flow rate and with composition gradients of external phases. We upscaled tuna-step by setting 14 actuatable nozzles in parallel, offering a step-emulsification-based single chip solution that can accommodate various requirements in terms of throughput, droplet volumes, flow rates, and surface chemistry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cf1","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","5e709307878c28a0473a176b","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","5fc4cd7c085dcb1e6ae0b90c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"113-126","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4cd7c085dcb1e6ae0b90c","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cf1","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeeb","5e709307878c28a0473a176b","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c63","mniswId":"13399","title":"LAB ON A CHIP","issn":"1473-0197","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a2c3b3a5-6d0f-4204-97a3-69954624c2b7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661aeec409707458fbabe2c","year":"2024","volume":"24","number":"1","documentHash":"a8899bb3-574b-481c-95a5-aeca0ce0a82b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059635472"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66753b0240970754df505804","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Pierno","documentHash":"7c2f1a90-aca6-4738-b911-0b918558443c"},{"objectId":"66753b0240970754df505803","name":"Giampaolo","lastName":"Mistura","documentHash":"95826664-6f50-4d46-aa94-9ebde1660028"},{"objectId":"66753b0240970754df505802","name":"Annamaria","lastName":"Zaltron","documentHash":"1c6de1b4-9ee7-4d1f-b052-54b2be93302b"},{"objectId":"66753b0240970754df505801","name":"Davide","lastName":"Ferraro","documentHash":"d84c3251-97ca-49d8-bd89-a0b7106809c6"},{"objectId":"66753b0240970754df505800","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Vezzani","documentHash":"feedbe13-c56c-4e4d-be7d-83b484aff5cc"},{"objectId":"66753b0240970754df5057ff","name":"Daniele","lastName":"Filippi","documentHash":"111958d7-e1a9-4e92-a488-0b741dcd055a"},{"objectId":"5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","name":"Ladislav","lastName":"Derzsi","uuid":"298610A9E3EFD4BD025EE078249F66C3169768A76BA240CFC716072496622CB734DDFCDAE10CFF3D6DCF9853F31A90480F1F1E643D5C8E3147B5E6B43B92C460","orcidId":"0000-0002-3562-0758","documentHash":"d22f43d7-cee1-47a3-9c48-45099bf80c18"},{"objectId":"5fc4cd7c085dcb1e6ae0b90c","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Nalin","uuid":"F44413A9AE2D03C55A336C526D322069FDEBED70AA6EEC2A68B1775297C16CD0AF9EDD36FCE0EA0565E74DD90FEAF47CDBC9373C0016257806E75536A7985101","orcidId":"0000-0003-3392-0359","documentHash":"d0c07d2c-5ff8-4649-94de-a656b51b27b6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66753b0240970754df5057fd","doi":"10.1002/admt.202201748","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/admt.202201748","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Boost and Contraction of Flow by Herringbone Surface Design on the Microfluidic Channel Wall","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The handling of yield-stress fluids typically involves a jammed-to-flow transition that is pivotal for many injection and transport technologies on different scales, such as additive manufacturing, injection molding, food rheology, and oil transport. For all of these applications, it is crucial to be able to tune the fluidization under constant load. The pressure-driven flow of emulsions is reported within a microfluidic channel, one wall of which is patterned by a herringbone-riblet roughness comprising a regular array of V-shaped grooves. With respect to the pressure gradient, this pattern displays a convergent (divergent) orientation that provides a forward (backward) direction. At the tip of the herringbone pattern, the forward and backward flows are almost identical for a viscous Newtonian fluid and a diluted emulsion, whereas a surprising flow boost in the forward direction is observed as the emulsion approaches a jammed state. The flow boost is more effective at small herringbone angles and low pressure loads. 3D velocity profiles along the channel cross-section unravel unexpected heterogeneous stress, band-like distributed, with evidence of nonlocal correlations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","5fc4cd7c085dcb1e6ae0b90c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66753b0240970754df5057ff","5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","5fc4cd7c085dcb1e6ae0b90c","66753b0240970754df505800","66753b0240970754df505801","66753b0240970754df505802","66753b0240970754df505803","66753b0240970754df505804"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b85c","mniswId":"433","title":"Advanced Materials Technologies","issn":"2365-709X","eissn":"2365-709X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3263498c-0e52-41ea-a7e4-5bbee44ab6ef"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66753b0240970754df5057fe","year":"2023","volume":"8","number":"13","documentHash":"af767df0-19b8-44d7-9718-2e233aac30c8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059638047"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66755b1840970754df55661c","name":"Priyanka H.","lastName":"Maheshwari","documentHash":"6b22b455-8224-40af-a362-d2ee9dd25fc7"},{"objectId":"66755b1840970754df55661b","name":"Kamal Kishore","lastName":"Pant","documentHash":"b27c755e-05d4-417e-b51b-f7c6cd1f647a"},{"objectId":"66755b1840970754df55661a","name":"Marut","lastName":"Jain","documentHash":"675f4d60-3b55-4490-83eb-c1eee526dccb"},{"objectId":"66755b1840970754df556619","name":"Prashant","lastName":"Dubey","documentHash":"86bb4f8f-04f9-4669-b5f0-3cffa7fe0021"},{"objectId":"632925a975234038513ec7cd","name":"Vishal","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"0D354B8FF99322E996FAD697B910B9306BF493B61B1F346347D695464BD50998A218E449DB5FC5607022C923AA46F5781E11CB0C661050D2DB1C6080ECBFEEED","documentHash":"7588df5d-7d93-4a1b-a3cc-2c5777e99ac2"},{"objectId":"62fef5a87523404ea24371aa","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","uuid":"6F9C3A0EF3007DEE8A2CC6A5051A1A4819F78767F8574EF11C2E9A4A894E3C14DDE5DCA35168189F7198156D76A2251C7F81CED040C57D4A631575AA76314E67","documentHash":"937c2285-0f6c-4107-bc0c-a0f5bd181b58"}],"objectId":"66755b1840970754df556617","doi":"10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00995","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.3c00995","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Facile Synthesis of Pineapple Waste-Derived Carbon and Polyaniline Composite for High-Energy-Density Asymmetric Supercapacitors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pineapplepeel has been chosen as a biowaste precursor to synthesizeactivated carbon via KOH activation at 800 degrees C(PP-800).

We obtain charge-and density profiles, as well as the excess grand potential as a function of the slit width L in the self-consistent Gaussian approximation. For large density of ions, the obtained disjoining pressure exhibits oscillatory asymptotic decay for increasing L, with the decay length that agrees with the results of recent experiments. On a general level, we show that if the charge density decays with a distance from a charged surface in the oscillatory way, then the electrostatic energy of the slit with charged walls also decays with L in an oscillatory way with the same characteristic lengths. The oscillatory decay disagrees with the asymptotic repulsion obtained in the surface force balance experiments. We argue that in the experiment, the lack of the attraction between the confining surfaces for large L may follow from slow ordering of the isotropic fluid absorbed in the expanding slit into layers with alternating charge."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"382","pagesFromTo":"121949","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","667558ae40970754df553c94"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788ad","mniswId":"11911","title":"Journal of Molecular Liquids","issn":"0167-7322","eissn":"1873-3166","documentHash":"be68a988-b1a2-4170-9777-f821874d753b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"644637244097070d1f515b5f","year":"2023","volume":"382","documentHash":"2dff2dc5-fbc3-4f3b-9ea9-fa66fe5102cb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059638479"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667a9cef409707681dca815e","name":"Vladyslav V.","lastName":"Lisnyak","documentHash":"2f0e7a6e-6f91-4061-bee1-a66dd546c0c2"},{"objectId":"667a9cef409707681dca815d","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Mischanchuk","documentHash":"4a636652-20ef-4871-be02-a85e172391dc"},{"objectId":"667a9cef409707681dca815c","name":"Olena","lastName":"Goncharuk","documentHash":"84ecaa65-d276-47eb-99c3-c28b1375ec39"},{"objectId":"667a9cef409707681dca815b","name":"Vitaliy","lastName":"Diyuk","documentHash":"858dfc04-f206-4890-befc-9f104074dcec"},{"objectId":"667a9cef409707681dca815a","name":"Snizhana","lastName":"Gaidai","documentHash":"20747635-7a43-41ac-a657-f696206c1d12"},{"objectId":"667a9cef409707681dca8159","name":"Olha","lastName":"Pryhunova","documentHash":"37b22e91-412f-4855-9789-b9bec91bb1e5"},{"objectId":"667a9cef409707681dca8158","name":"Olena","lastName":"Ischenko","documentHash":"a355151c-70f1-479e-9fb0-7f0d3f334314"},{"objectId":"6243c0a87523402df099a303","name":"Alla","lastName":"Dyachenko","uuid":"5111AF0AEDD620451C94AF513B6855E490D9FBF95139304CEEBBF517F410035CE340D3116A01780FA85C4DC516C293948075B1F141F97D5093C36EDB3832353C","documentHash":"da609206-2ab6-4dbc-81b4-db000a4ef5a1"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Nikiforow","uuid":"E166453BA6868F48895D87A86E6702843A623A59A84923A7C78B7FFBB992983C7D95FE6E5E79D29AB2127112DC3887B27E8FB1E44DE4688F1367FD5EA5783F74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6135-8514","documentHash":"c96f36f3-357e-4938-9d4c-83e71d392895"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf93e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bonarowska","uuid":"21F496BADEA1603A60B3BC0B550C9BDC48275EB56F9CDB4CC1C5F650844D5864C5733E50F68A3B809C8BF7B8BED5B67431EE5357365FDF42F01428BB1C0577A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3152-4400","documentHash":"3636a35f-940d-4f01-926a-3e4c22bb4c32"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeef","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Kaszkur","uuid":"36A9F5D596E9D1A01077413D56F16101545819AAEADBEDC7E0678B53BF12D9C8E1D995252D01E6CD11F1828D97A71B076E06459AF0BC11C775871ABE88A52DC7","orcidId":"0000-0003-4733-4334","documentHash":"82a5f009-0dc1-4b82-973b-511cbd231a4a"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"}],"objectId":"667a9cef409707681dca8156","doi":"10.1016/j.envres.2024.119203","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013935124011083?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"NiFe and CoFe nanocatalysts supported on highly dispersed alumina-silica: Structure, surface properties, and performance in CO2 methanation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The hydrogenation of CO2 to CH4 has gained considerable interest in terms of sustainable energy and environmental mitigation. In this regard, the present work aims to investigate the adsorptive concentration and CO2 methanation performance over CoFe and NiFe bimetallic catalysts supported on fumed alumina-silica SA96 support at 170-450 degrees C and under atmospheric pressure. The catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method, subjected to calcination and further reduced with hydrogen, and their performance in CO2 methanation was investigated in a hydrogen-rich 2%CO2-55%H2-43%He gas mixture. In this study, we describe the crystal and mesoporous structures of the prepared catalysts by in -situ XRD and ex -situ nitrogen adsorption, evaluate the NiFe and CoFe metal surface states before and after catalysis by XPS, visualize the surface morphology by SEM, estimate the catalytic activity by gas chromatography, and investigate the adsorbed surface species, showing the presence of *HCOO/*HCO and *CO intermediates, determine two possible pathways of CH4 formation on the studied catalysts by temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry, and correlate the structural and surface properties with high CO2 conversions up to 100% and methanation selectivities up to 72%. The latter is related to changes in the elemental chemical states and surface composition of CoFe and NiFe nanocatalysts induced by treatment under reaction conditions, and the surface reconstruction during catalysis transfers the part of active 3d transition metals into the pores of the SA96 support. Our thorough characterization study with complementary techniques allowed us to conclude that this high activity is related to the formation of catalytically active Ni/Ni3Fe and Co/CoFeOx nanoscale crystallites under H2 reduction and their maintenance under CO2 methanation conditions. The successfully applied combination of CO2 chemisorption and thermodesorption techniques demonstrates the ability to adsorb the CO2 molecules by supported NiFe and CoFe nanocatalysts and the pure alumina-silica SA96 support."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6243c0a87523402df099a303","5e709490878c28a0473bf93e","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"255","pagesFromTo":"119203","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6243c0a87523402df099a303","667a9cef409707681dca8158","667a9cef409707681dca8159","667a9cef409707681dca815a","667a9cef409707681dca815b","667a9cef409707681dca815c","667a9cef409707681dca815d","5e709490878c28a0473bf93e","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeef","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","667a9cef409707681dca815e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b10","mniswId":"5839","title":"Environmental Research","doi":"10.1016/j.envres","issn":"0013-9351","documentHash":"32c2ca88-ff69-422c-a4dc-40a1a7e85500"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667a9cef409707681dca8157","year":"2024","volume":"255","documentHash":"a69e6439-cb10-40d7-8502-3f41ad8c909f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059645071"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e1e","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Giersz","documentHash":"9944322a-209d-4b17-b684-4bbad239bc46"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e1d","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Przadka‐Giersz","documentHash":"8bb6116e-530f-45f4-b228-702ea297071e"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e1c","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Środek","documentHash":"732b6cfe-748b-45ca-9d6b-cc69eb10f467"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e1b","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kotowski","documentHash":"bacc3e6d-668f-41a3-a0df-aedfee58f41e"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e1a","name":"Petras","lastName":"Jokubauskas","documentHash":"86b7dbc0-af86-486c-bd36-121787451ab0"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e19","name":"Beata","lastName":"Marciniak‐Maliszewska","documentHash":"d342a1f5-324d-4876-94be-1ba12dd94a82"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e18","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kaproń","documentHash":"5e461812-f722-418f-abd0-5d71e4aefb9b"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e17","name":"Paula","lastName":"Sierpień","documentHash":"a3fe39bd-b279-472e-9af2-5b13bb31d520"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e16","name":"Branden Cesare","lastName":"Rizzuto","documentHash":"01746b89-5649-485a-a8aa-77454e29aedf"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e15","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kałaska","documentHash":"ff6d6c01-35d7-448e-a6e1-2531e1750351"},{"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e14","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Warchulski","documentHash":"bd627de2-c1ce-4775-b469-b95143ea5e05"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pisarek","uuid":"394C70A4B68190862754D0C9C71B0CB236E956007955224514CD5CC84EABBD07900FBD9AC8AACDBDD5E542D5CC809EC02A9E49AFFB1DCA527F248F357949EFB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7424-5954","documentHash":"f7a53170-9e7f-4afd-bea7-cb1ef6322bc6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"667aab50409707681dcb1e12","doi":"10.1111/arcm.13000","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/arcm.13000","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"In‐depth study of a speiss/matte sample from Castillo de Huarmey, North Coast of Peru, and its implications for the pre‐Columbian production of arsenic bronze in the Central Andes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aims to characterize the phase composition and chemistry of the speiss/matte sample from the Metallurgist's Burial at Castillo de Huarmey and to use the information derived from these analyses to infer the temperatures, furnace conditions, and ores associated with the smelting processes, which created the speiss/matte sample.

The single-crystal form of these materials exhibits superior characteristics compared to their polycrystalline counterparts. However, despite considerable efforts to understand hysteresis, there is still limited knowledge about the underlying mechanisms driving resistance changes in MHPSCs under external stimuli, such as scan rate and bias. This article presents a comprehensive investigation into the origin and evolution of resistive effects in the switching behavior of MAPbBr3 single crystals. Our aim is to fill these gaps in understanding and provide valuable insights for the development of memristor devices. To observe and interpret the switching behavior, we employ various characterization techniques, including current–voltage (J–V) measurements, current–time (I–T) measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements under different scan rates and bias levels. Our findings suggest that during switching, the single crystals (SCs) exhibit high resistance at low applied bias, whereas higher applied bias results in a lower resistance value. We attribute the stable switching response at lower bias to the lower concentration of accumulated ions and electronic charge carriers. Conversely, an excess of charge accumulation at high bias leads to transient or decay responses in the I–T measurements. By gaining a deeper understanding of resistive effects in MHPSCs, this study contributes to the design and optimization of MHPSC-based devices, particularly in the context of halide-based perovskite memory devices. The insights gained from this research pave the way for the enhanced performance and improved reliability of perovskite memory devices, bringing us closer to realizing their full potential in various electronic applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"127","issue":"36","pagesFromTo":"18185-18191","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6670268d4097073d001704f7","6670268d4097073d001704f8","6670268d4097073d001704f9","6670268d4097073d001704fa","6670268d4097073d001704fb","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","6670268d4097073d001704fc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a2","mniswId":"12286","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry.

Supercapacitors may contribute, as they can convert waste heat to electricity through cyclic charging and discharging at different temperatures. Herein, we use an analytically-solvable model of a cylindrical pore filled with a single file of ions to identify optimal conditions for heat-to-electricity con -version with supercapacitors. We consider Stirling and Ericsson-like charging cycles and show that the former or latter yields more work when a supercapacitor operates under charge or voltage limitations, respectively. Both cycles yield the most work for pores almost as narrow as the size of the ions they con-tain, as is the case for energy storage with supercapacitors. In contrast to energy storage, which can be maximised by ionophobic pores, such pores do not yield the best heat-to-electricity conversion, indepen-dently of the applied potential. Instead, we find that for a given pore size, a moderately ionophilic pore harvests more work than ionophobic and strongly ionophilic pores.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

We assume hard-cores of the same size a for both components. For r > a, like particles attract and repel each other at short and large distances, respectively, with the same potential u(r) for both species, and the cross-interaction is -u(r). The model is inspired by oppositely charged particles or macromolecules with preferential solubility in different components of a solvent that is close to a miscibility critical point, in particular by inclusions in biological membranes. We obtain the phase diagram in the chemical potentials and temperature variables as well as in the concentration, density and temperature variables, using the mean-field one-shell approximation. We find that the presence of the second component significantly extends the temperature range of stability of the ordered phases. We obtain three stable phases with periodic concentration: the lamellar L phase with alternating stripes of the two components for similar chemical potentials, and a hexagonal arrangement of the clusters of the minority component in the liquid of the majority component. The latter two phases, however, are stable only at relatively high temperatures. At lower temperatures, the L phase coexists with a disordered one-component fluid or with very dilute gas with mixed components. At still lower temperatures, the one-component phase coexisting with the L phase can be disordered or ordered, depending on the chemical potentials.

These layers included porous materials, permselective membranes, hydrogels, silicate sol-gels, proteins, and sp(3) hybridized carbon. To evaluate the protective effects of the antifouling modification as well as its impact on the catalyst, we adsorbed a redox mediator on the electrode surface. Five of the tested coatings allowed us to preserve the electrochemical properties of the tested mediator. Later studies showed that sol-gel silicate layer, poly-l-lactic acid, and poly(l-lysine)-g-poly(ethylene glycol) were the only ones capable of sustaining the catalyst's performance during prolonged incubation in a cell culture medium. The highest signal deterioration was observed, as expected during the first few hours of incubation in a cell culture environment. Tested layers exhibited different dynamics of the protective effect. The poly-l-lactic acid layer presented lower changes in the first hours of the study but suffered complete signal deterioration after 72 h. Whereas the signal intensity of the silicate layer was lowered by half after just 3 h but was still visible after 6 weeks of constant incubation of the electrode in the cell culture."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c314de9543c72336543c79","5e7094a0878c28a0473c094a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"4572-4580","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c314de9543c72336543c79","668529a8fdbe83043b5d01ad","5e7094a0878c28a0473c094a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b800","mniswId":"138","title":"ACS Omega","issn":"2470-1343","eissn":"2470-1343","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/page/acsodf/about.html","documentHash":"97264f81-7bd1-468f-8fdb-1f4116564c77"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e806e64097076263110c74","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"9","number":"4","documentHash":"257425c1-d8a0-4f1a-9f13-5bc21dda213d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059658975"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667a8a56409707681dc93f6b","name":"Jaroslava","lastName":"Nováková","documentHash":"3ecff837-5187-4e6e-a6cb-46651bca3103"},{"objectId":"667a8a56409707681dc93f6a","name":"Mikaela","lastName":"Görlin","documentHash":"c2935b8e-bf58-4b29-857c-9694ad5658f6"},{"objectId":"667a8a56409707681dc93f69","name":"Viktor","lastName":"Toth","documentHash":"96675186-964d-4560-9623-e65942b97a2c"},{"objectId":"667a8a56409707681dc93f68","name":"Cécile","lastName":"Kalk","documentHash":"bdf88fe9-a07e-415a-9b2b-842e8e2154af"},{"objectId":"667a8a56409707681dc93f67","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Hof","documentHash":"babe68f1-fafb-4e4c-8e51-245369037b9a"},{"objectId":"667a8a56409707681dc93f66","name":"Stylianos","lastName":"Kioumourtzoglou","documentHash":"d5b5ff6b-2a83-4d35-b358-b73dac99a682"},{"objectId":"622036397523402df08c206c","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sa","uuid":"87182E2E0888DA41C757B81B2143E2316665900AFDCDE55D96C088AFA76BAFB6A4F1AA06C4EDA6BD452B1F53C7A1CCDD6A3E7FE74E2E496F4852B0410671F4C6","documentHash":"b4c2efbd-ab85-495c-833b-083d3a9f0f35"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"667a8a56409707681dc93f64","doi":"10.1039/d4nh00174e","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/NH/D4NH00174E","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Nanomaterials as a Service (NaaS) concept: on-demand protocols for volume synthesis of nanomaterials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Establishing scalable nanomaterials synthesis protocols remains a bottleneck towards their commercialisation and, thus, a topic of intense research and development.

Implementing unsupervised Bayesian optimisation with Gaussian processes reduces the optimisation time and the need for prior knowledge to initiate the process.

Ultimately, the platform substitutes the labour-intensive trial-and-error synthesis and provides a pathway to standardisation and volume synthesis, slowing down the translation and commercialisation of high-quality nanomaterials.

The heart of this unique membrane–protein complex comprises the Mn4CaO5 cluster, in which the Ca2+ ion acts as a critical cofactor in the splitting of water in PSII. However, there is still a lack of studies involving Ca-based reactive oxygen species (ROS) systems, and the exact nature of the interaction between the Ca2+ center and ROS in PSII still generates intense debate. Here, harnessing a novel Ca-TEMPO complex supported by the β-diketiminate ligand to control the activation of O2, we report the isolation and structural characterization of hitherto elusive Ca peroxides, a homometallic Ca hydroperoxide and a heterometallic Ca/K peroxide. Our studies indicate that the presence of K+ cations is a key factor controlling the outcome of the oxygenation reaction of the model Ca-TEMPO complex. Combining experimental observations with computational investigations, we also propose a mechanistic rationalization for the reaction outcomes. The designed approach demonstrates metal-TEMPO complexes as a versatile platform for O2 activation and advances the understanding of Ca/ROS systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","5e70940d878c28a0473b587c","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5e7094dd878c28a0473c5a01"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094dd878c28a0473c5a01","667aa9ac409707681dcb0359","667aa9ac409707681dcb035a","667aa9ac409707681dcb035b","5e70940d878c28a0473b587c","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5e709328878c28a0473a3f18"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478aed","mniswId":"12814","title":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","issn":"0002-7863","eissn":"1520-5126","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"bfde5f28-5ddd-412d-ace7-deb7f19a57b1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6648f8cd40970727c4c77b17","year":"2024","documentHash":"ec1bdb31-fb50-42d1-a25b-190156787378"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ACTIVATION","OXYGEN-EVOLVING COMPLEX","DRIVEN WATER OXIDATION","PHOTOSYSTEM-II","ATOM ABSTRACTION","BOND FORMATION","ACTIVE-SITE","ZINC ALKYLS","REACTIVITY","REDUCTION"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059659555"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667a92ba409707681dc9e2a9","name":"Mathias O.","lastName":"Senge","documentHash":"affcbe61-933f-4876-b596-0cb6107524ee"},{"objectId":"667a92ba409707681dc9e2a8","name":"Claudia","lastName":"Ryppa","documentHash":"f1ddf565-0772-4e1a-806f-a6a94e4167e6"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfacf","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Orzanowska","uuid":"FE33F2E0F4628EA7BCBB2CF5E747558423CF056145CDED2F2E38270679FF49EFEC80534942800E08CA2B64111C7F402F0EA44E96A91825DBD45600E6611A1FBE","documentHash":"edf6dd69-9b53-4543-8718-40a939c1647d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Waluk","uuid":"587A78D077C4375A4C980253E3D29FB2074174FC88F6A7341BDCBF8F80F6764FDE1461139B4C2337F132A7A1787A14076B55E79D57654F32E1BE17E03941A875","orcidId":"0000-0001-5745-583X","documentHash":"f8893a20-d629-4008-9c8c-d34c0e171106"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-06-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"667a92ba409707681dc9e2a6","doi":"10.1039/d4cp01502a","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/CP/D4CP01502A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Fine-tuning of radiative properties by “mild” substituents: searching for a perfectly soft chromophore","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Controlling spectral properties to achieve desired characteristics is an attractive goal in application-oriented research, e.g., in the design of fluorescence sensors. \"Soft\" chromophores, molecules with strong spectral responses to internal or external perturbations are good candidates for such studies. In this work, absorption, fluorescence, and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra were obtained for a series of porphyrins, substituted at the meso-positions with n-hexyl groups. As the number of substituents increases from 1 to 4, significant changes are observed. The intensity of the S0-S1 transition (Qx) in the 0-0 region strongly decreases in mono-substituted porphyrin, but upon additional substitutions it increases to values larger than in the parent, unsubstituted molecule. Such behavior can be explained, using the perimeter model, by changes in the energy splittings between the two highest (HOMO) and two lowest (LUMO) frontier molecular orbitals. Single substitution makes porphyrin a nearly perfect soft chromophore, but upon introduction of a larger number of n-hexyl groups it is transformed into a hard one. DFT simulations incorrectly predict a continuous transition from a soft to hard chromophore, because the calculated ordering of two HOMO orbitals is opposite to that obtained by experiment. On the other hand, for those porphyrins that can be classified as hard chromophores, the calculations nicely reproduce contributions of Franck-Condon and Herzberg-Teller terms to absorption and fluorescence spectra."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfacf","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709491878c28a0473bfacf","667a92ba409707681dc9e2a8","667a92ba409707681dc9e2a9","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547925d","mniswId":"16075","title":"PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS","issn":"1463-9076","documentHash":"8e732841-944b-4696-92c7-03b5ad988f7d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667a92ba409707681dc9e2a7","year":"2024","documentHash":"ce775b23-77d6-4fd2-b071-0b1c54d41242"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MAGNETIC CIRCULAR-DICHROISM","INDUCED SIGN VARIATION","N-CONFUSED PORPHYRIN","REDUCED PORPHYRINS","SPECTRA","SPECTROSCOPY","MODEL","BAND"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059659630"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667a87b8409707681dc9175d","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Trari","documentHash":"90f1672f-cb42-4031-8b8c-921d2a68386e"},{"objectId":"667a87b8409707681dc9175c","name":"Leonardo","lastName":"Palmisano","documentHash":"91452efb-d977-4386-aa97-a09f23a364e1"},{"objectId":"667a87b8409707681dc9175b","name":"Radia","lastName":"Bagtache","documentHash":"39232f24-7188-42f4-8485-acdc7c3a86f1"},{"objectId":"667a87b8409707681dc9175a","name":"Marianna","lastName":"Bellardita","documentHash":"47f61e96-30a3-4686-9a76-77ab0cbc028f"},{"objectId":"667a87b8409707681dc91759","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Umair","documentHash":"ef8ec27b-adc7-46be-afd4-574592bfb61d"},{"objectId":"65fcfb3a40e3ff2524a0c3e4","name":"Ahmed Malek","lastName":"Djaballah","uuid":"3D4AC101CBC90E893A7B732E5944E547AD8A64A62BB51DDB979F73A3EBBE5F1949E3DCFCEF43B265BCEE01F1F6B4F2F1D9A1FF20D50211B828246BBD86622B04","documentHash":"ae2ae6db-da1d-461c-b8f4-2d4bc2a0c301"}],"objectId":"667a87b8409707681dc91758","doi":"10.1002/adsu.202400298","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adsu.202400298","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Visible‐Light Photoreforming of Biomass Derivatives through MBi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>‐P25 Heterostructures: Study of the Influence of Metals (M = Cu, Ni, Zn, Co)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this work, MBi2O4-P25 (M = Cu, Ni, Co, Zn) composites are successfully synthesized by a simple ball milling method by varying some parameters (rotation speed, rotation time, metal/TiO2 ratio) to optimize the preparation conditions. The noble metal-free TiO2-based photocatalysts are used to carry out the partial oxidation of glucose and glycerol with the simultaneous H-2 production under simulated solar light irradiation. Starting from glucose, 2.6 mmol of H-2 are obtained with a conversion of 34%, along with arabinose, formic acid and gluconic acid as main intermediates. By using glycerol, 3.2 mmol of H-2 are produced, with 17% conversion and the production of dihydroxyacetone and glycolic acid. The composites exhibit higher activity than pure P25 and CuBi2O4 (CBO). The produced H-2 amount is comparable to that reported in the literature by using Pt-TiO2 photocatalysts. This study offers a paradigm for the future design of bifunctional photocatalysts for simultaneous noble metal-free H-2 production and biomass valorization under environmentally friendly conditions with a possible scale up of the process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65fcfb3a40e3ff2524a0c3e4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["667a87b8409707681dc91759","65fcfb3a40e3ff2524a0c3e4","667a87b8409707681dc9175a","667a87b8409707681dc9175b","667a87b8409707681dc9175c","667a87b8409707681dc9175d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b861","mniswId":"444","title":"Advanced Sustainable Systems","issn":"2366-7486","eissn":"2366-7486","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"823b41f4-a285-4bfb-9e5c-70582973d2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d864f54097071e5460db55","year":"2024","documentHash":"2d5e5a8b-e4dc-403f-8f73-3f06d2715011"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biomass photoreformingsis","H-2 production","heterogeneous photocataly","high added value chemicals","spinel/TiO2 composites"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059659666"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cef","name":"Ariba","lastName":"Aziz","uuid":"62A6FF9BCEF62B4CD6C891AE392275B1B1116234D5F2B28DE4EE3D081FAB2B828C697C81BAD3A9DC233E6B034CCEAA33C9238CC37EFD30FF7EE273075E5629CB","documentHash":"1fdde41f-f781-4234-aa53-3750ab8707c1"},{"objectId":"632925a975234038513ec7cd","name":"Vishal","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"0D354B8FF99322E996FAD697B910B9306BF493B61B1F346347D695464BD50998A218E449DB5FC5607022C923AA46F5781E11CB0C661050D2DB1C6080ECBFEEED","documentHash":"7588df5d-7d93-4a1b-a3cc-2c5777e99ac2"},{"objectId":"62fef5a87523404ea24371aa","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","uuid":"6F9C3A0EF3007DEE8A2CC6A5051A1A4819F78767F8574EF11C2E9A4A894E3C14DDE5DCA35168189F7198156D76A2251C7F81CED040C57D4A631575AA76314E67","documentHash":"937c2285-0f6c-4107-bc0c-a0f5bd181b58"},{"objectId":"60caeb349543c72336544565","name":"Ashwin Melvin","lastName":"Ambrose","uuid":"F6BA098A2960025F62C4275A6FA450A931F5C11A61845DE621A4B1921ECE33F0A7C7AAC412E71DDF144515F4002494908DCAD94E3630608DF2B3C98A3F0BDF50","documentHash":"8eaa182f-cf9f-4045-8aaa-d2b49530dc0e"},{"objectId":"605d60749543c745d80e5a65","name":"Bhavana","lastName":"Gupta","uuid":"AC6B32A259B1EED07E7B7D122C124FA2584D1B82B4F45CC0C27768ECDC0E45D999F07DF9B0C583C66EC6E7ED36C4346B55C7FD0A32759764560A404DBD4DC401","orcidId":"0000-0001-9426-8750","documentHash":"fb539681-d025-47b3-a615-41ecb8bac193"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"666ae61d4097072419010f2a","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-32210-6","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32210-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Evaluation of local oxygen flux produced by photoelectrochemical hydroxide oxidation by scanning electrochemical microscopy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Several in-situ electrochemical approaches have been developed for performing a localized photoelectrochemical investigation of the photoanode.

In traditional SECM analysis of photocatalysts, evaluation of the influence of radiation on the rate of studied reaction requires an additional dark background experiment. Here, using SECM and an inverted optical microscope, we demonstrate the determination of O-2 flux caused by light-driven photoelectrocatalytic water splitting. Photocatalytic signal and dark background are recorded in a single SECM image. We used an indium tin oxide electrode modified with hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) by electrodeposition as a model sample. The light-driven flux of oxygen is calculated by analysis of SECM image recorded in substrate generation/tip collection mode. In photoelectrochemistry, the qualitative and quantitative knowledge of oxygen evolution will open new doors for understanding the local effects of dopants and hole scavengers in a straightforward and conventional manner."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["632925a975234038513ec7cd","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","62fef5a87523404ea24371aa","605d60749543c745d80e5a65","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","60caeb349543c72336544565","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["605d60749543c745d80e5a65","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cef","62fef5a87523404ea24371aa","632925a975234038513ec7cd","60caeb349543c72336544565","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059662532"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb067","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Żuk","uuid":"A2CF96DA8DBC0F0EC756C6ABC4425D960DE3CE0ABBAA543C816DF4A24FDC838930FFB8FDCE1B3C5232CB0C3FD9D93CDDF5F6336061F13F18AC43F6C77E9DD4F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0555-5913","documentHash":"323764fb-47c8-4632-b36c-1a2615cfd8d2"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Giżyński","uuid":"7AEDD73DD5B1257841075AC646D7AF5FC2472AC6E46D6B167FA3D962FDEFA3E257CD7B398C64DC6A04810369674D2DCA9ABA0C97270D398AA0B697F0E2F788ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-3547-1174","documentHash":"1424e1a0-06b3-460a-9b83-8855874b6421"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maciołek","uuid":"E3E9BCC7397B929B2C469D73E68AE44FB2E6F4892A7DC44C238F904FE76F9D470FD528254865B02108CA8B9311A7A421914ADC30598B3516CDD6CB7BF0F07C81","orcidId":"0000-0002-2371-4183","documentHash":"d2f0a437-c8a3-4dc0-9358-3f2e9c4648e4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","name":"Karol","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"30216860D4FCF71F80CCF2F14F9FA6358B5A0632271ACE53CD62EC8265F97928E335571E5A301CC0BA9C252A21169DB64AF4E27EC652B74805AD01BFF7BDF4DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9769-7646","documentHash":"3ea17df7-ffc6-4937-bb72-a24f676f97e3"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hołyst","uuid":"E92F295C3CC2CB6B18C450B2AB735CDA75E1B176DB096D3C43CB9E6E23F05E2B3448297032B471C71265740E595D30DAA6BA0B89CC0DB4589E73DB45075B7008","orcidId":"0000-0002-3211-4286","documentHash":"cbe7625d-9b95-4888-b28d-a8e3f921d07f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"666ad08c4097072419ffdd83","doi":"10.3390/e25111483","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/11/1483/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Fundamental Relation for the Ideal Gas in the Gravitational Field and Heat Flow","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We formulate the first law of global thermodynamics for stationary states of the ideal gas in the gravitational field subjected to heat flow.

Through the integration of polyaniline (PANI) into the poly sulfone (PSF) matrix via the phase inversion method, a composite membrane was fabricated. Balancing the PANI concentration was crucial, as exceeding 2 wt% led to membrane brittleness and reduced mechanical strength. To address this, the graphene oxide (GO) concentration was optimized. This optimization enhanced the mechanical properties of the nanocomposite membrane. Nanocomposite membranes were well characterized for structural and chemical properties. Batch adsorption studies with MB revealed pseudo-second order kinetics and Langmuir isotherms. The ternary nanocomposite membranes (TCM) exhibited improved water permeability (100 to 534 L m-2 h-1), showcasing enhanced filtration capacity. TCM demonstrated a high flux recovery ratio, effectively removing 98% of 70 mg L-1 dye at 0.1 MPa. The optimized TCM was successful in filtering real wastewater samples from the Faisalabad textile industry, demonstrating its potential for practical dye removal.\n\nUtilizing PSF/PANI/GO membranes for dual-action detoxification of textile dyes demonstrates their integrated synergy, leading to cleaner wastewater in the textile industry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6375aab9752340568bfffcd4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"5","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"4736-4752","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66869d9dfdbe836e432d5f86","66869d9dfdbe836e432d5f87","66869d9dfdbe836e432d5f88","66869d9dfdbe836e432d5f89","6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","66869d9dfdbe836e432d5f8a","66869d9dfdbe836e432d5f8b","66869d9dfdbe836e432d5f8c","66869d9dfdbe836e432d5f8d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb827","mniswId":"30104","title":"Materials Advances","eissn":"2633-5409","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"29cfe746-1686-4af4-a7e2-552c3e947f18"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66869d9dfdbe836e432d5f85","year":"2024","volume":"5","number":"11","documentHash":"abc9ed6e-2bda-468c-8578-0088432f9793"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059665759"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66869eb3fdbe836e432d6acc","name":"Saber","lastName":"Saharkhiz","documentHash":"d9bf6ca8-1212-4db6-9f8b-197f7aae21c5"},{"objectId":"66869eb3fdbe836e432d6acb","name":"Zahrasadat","lastName":"Razavi","documentHash":"11db6720-f16a-4582-81ed-90c197492999"},{"objectId":"66869eb3fdbe836e432d6aca","name":"Naba","lastName":"Najar","documentHash":"945324e2-ab58-4440-b7ae-348c0cd2b5b4"},{"objectId":"66869eb3fdbe836e432d6ac9","name":"Niusha","lastName":"Sabeti","documentHash":"5e218a75-8be4-4824-be6d-d3c4b4389885"},{"objectId":"66869eb3fdbe836e432d6ac8","name":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Taheripak","documentHash":"aea3752a-4687-4fca-9302-30d70202d47a"},{"objectId":"60c2fc239543c7233654339a","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Alipourfard","uuid":"09F87F13C145EAA33D5D3E392CC52D6627B20E2FB071920A9AC8A55B4EFE06CCFDC635D1FBCFD0C3CE2E997891A272F5A4326A19832587B921FF5E5C935B8BC5","documentHash":"92b7f0ed-674e-4ca5-b512-5aa90affbef8"}],"objectId":"66869eb3fdbe836e432d6ac6","doi":"10.1007/s11033-024-09250-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11033-024-09250-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"SIRT1 activation attenuates palmitate induced apoptosis in C2C12 muscle cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, which manifests mainly in skeletal muscles. SIRT1 has been found to play a role in the insulin signaling pathway. However, the molecular underpinnings of SIRT1's function in palmitate fatty acid-induced apoptosis still need to be better understood. Methods In this research, skeletal muscle cells are treated with palmitate to be insulin resistant. It is approached that SIRT1 is downregulated in C2C12 muscle cells during palmitate-induced apoptosis and that activating SIRT1 mitigates this effect. Results Based on these findings, palmitate-induced apoptosis suppressed mitochondrial biogenesis by lowering PGC-1 expression, while SIRT1 overexpression boosted. The SIRT1 inhibitor sirtinol, on the other hand, decreased mitochondrial biogenesis under the same conditions. This research also shows that ROS levels rise in the conditions necessary for apoptosis induction by palmitate, and ROS inhibitors can mitigate this effect. This work demonstrated that lowering ROS levels by boosting SIRT1 expression inhibited apoptotic induction in skeletal muscle cells. Conclusion This study's findings suggested that SIRT1 can improve insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes by slowing the rate of lipo-apoptosis and boosting mitochondrial biogenesis, among other benefits."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"51","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66869eb3fdbe836e432d6ac8","66869eb3fdbe836e432d6ac9","66869eb3fdbe836e432d6aca","66869eb3fdbe836e432d6acb","66869eb3fdbe836e432d6acc","60c2fc239543c7233654339a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ede","mniswId":"14529","title":"Molecular Biology Reports","issn":"0301-4851","eissn":"1573-4978","documentHash":"f50f16c3-5d4b-4e98-9f5e-458812a16fa1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66869eb3fdbe836e432d6ac7","year":"2024","volume":"51","number":"1","documentHash":"521615a6-7fe7-4fef-93c5-44daab5c60c0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059665917"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66702f1c4097073d00177d0c","name":"Suresh S.","lastName":"Umare","documentHash":"5a2535d4-9532-4885-806a-6434ed49db51"},{"objectId":"66702f1c4097073d00177d0b","name":"Devthade","lastName":"Vidyasagar","documentHash":"80ae18ea-96d2-4e67-a2c1-d3066b0718a7"},{"objectId":"66702f1c4097073d00177d0a","name":"Surendar","lastName":"Tonda","documentHash":"a0c4078d-d103-49f3-95f0-c03ccee3d251"},{"objectId":"66702f1c4097073d00177d09","name":"Naresh","lastName":"Mameda","documentHash":"85811148-180f-49ec-bc0f-af0dbecc7dbc"},{"objectId":"66702f1c4097073d00177d08","name":"Akanksha","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"b1396f88-2475-40a5-a8a1-88f8839e9503"},{"objectId":"66702f1c4097073d00177d07","name":"B.

Recently, we introduced a photosystem comprising NiO/Au plasmon/TiO2 that can selectively convert nitrate to ammonia at neutral pH and room temperature using visible light in a photo-electrochemical approach. The study evaluated the role of adding alcohol to the overall process activity and selectivity. Adding small quantities of alcohol to the electrolyte leads to changes in the catalytic behaviour, which cannot be attributed exclusively to improvement in counter-electrode reaction kinetics. Analysis of product Faradaic efficiency and photo-current measurements revealed that alcohols act as proton donors in nitrate/nitrite reduction, possibly through a concerted proton-couple electron transfer mechanism. These initial findings offer new handles for nitrate reduction to ammonia efficacy at neutral pH. Ultimately, this opens up avenues for agricultural practices that recycle nutrients, improve process circularity, and reduce fertilizer costs, thus contributing to economic sustainability.\nA strategy to upcycle nitrate waste (a pollutant) into valuable chemicals (ammonia) is proposed. Through a photoelectrocatalytic process, we demonstrate that ammonia can be generated with little hydrogen production (unwated by product).

However, there is ongoing controversy regarding the involvement of hot carriers in the catalytic process. In this study, we demonstrate the direct utilisation of plasmon hot electrons in the hydrogen evolution reaction with visible light. We intentionally assemble a plasmonic nanohybrid system comprising NiO/Au/[Co(1,10-Phenanthrolin-5-amine)2(H2O)2], which is unstable at water thermolysis temperatures. This assembly limits the plasmon thermal contribution while ensuring that hot carriers are the primary contributors to the catalytic process. By combining photoelectrocatalysis with advanced in situ spectroscopies, we can substantiate a reaction mechanism in which plasmon-induced hot electrons play a crucial role.

Studies of molecules undergoing single or double proton or hydrogen transfer in the ground or excited electronic state reveal that tunneling can dominate under conditions usually considered to favor the thermal process. Moreover, the tunneling probability strongly varies for excitation of certain vibrational modes, which changes the effective barrier and/or proton transfer distance. When the reaction is fast compared to vibrational relaxation, the mode selectivity can still be maintained for molecules in solutions at 293 K. These observations point to dangers of relating the calculated minimum energy paths and the associated barriers to the experimentally obtained activation energies. The multidimensional character of the reaction coordinate is obvious; it can dramatically change for slowly and rapidly relaxing environments. We postulate that the hydrogen bond definition should be extended by specifically including the role of molecular vibrations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"598-607","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a3","mniswId":"12287","title":"JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS","issn":"1948-7185","documentHash":"20e7ee0a-0379-406e-b5a0-28906e68d7b4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66850e5dfdbe83043b5b7758","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"ff652b42-123b-405d-acea-5a91b236c8fc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059673026"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82dd","name":"Spyros N.","lastName":"Pandis","documentHash":"eb10db32-424d-400b-8241-39942d35c947"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82dc","name":"Ioannis","lastName":"Kioutsioukis","documentHash":"8af93539-d571-4741-b743-3e087cee2f2f"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82db","name":"David","lastName":"Patoulias","documentHash":"66ec9624-7ca9-42c2-a90f-0354e94a2d07"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82da","name":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Eleftheriadis","documentHash":"320f29d0-b163-4fa9-ad33-f0a7153e6ff7"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d9","name":"Stefanos","lastName":"Papagiannis","documentHash":"c9ddc8e7-827e-4f85-b734-675d1c2aaa94"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d8","name":"Athanasios","lastName":"Nenes","documentHash":"27b23c33-d32b-489e-8026-3cb62b51cc36"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d7","name":"Evangelia","lastName":"Kostenidou","documentHash":"ba89e26f-5455-4fde-acd5-d1884162bdb2"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d6","name":"Evangelia","lastName":"Siouti","documentHash":"70993b31-1b9a-4469-b487-19c122e6b92f"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d5","name":"Christos","lastName":"Kaltsonoudis","documentHash":"9e1640bc-f539-42ae-85dd-4d5348cf21f0"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d4","name":"Kalliopi","lastName":"Florou","documentHash":"581d62f8-7d3d-427f-a681-d87b1f1e26c5"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d3","name":"Andreas","lastName":"Aktypis","documentHash":"01d1c2ea-7cdd-4605-b2de-8c9204f90ba5"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d2","name":"Maria","lastName":"Georgopoulou","documentHash":"fb9b9ef8-0465-4795-8cd0-dcfe5266f3da"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d1","name":"Ksakousti","lastName":"Skyllakou","documentHash":"ebf3607a-4fd4-4126-a37f-b435685e33aa"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82d0","name":"Angeliki","lastName":"Matrali","documentHash":"a702d4bf-aa45-47c2-a502-c276ee0663d3"},{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82cf","name":"Christina N.","lastName":"Vasilakopoulou","documentHash":"1d86febe-1865-4879-83af-60ff840e0d13"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Błaziak","uuid":"AEDB2ECC32F737F5077EC9208A4CE78A44A394111443167820E6EF5EA4670E5AE09D9D49AF5EAB18FB5968748B3CBACB9FA54CC956C74EBBC14197011907BBAB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9270-5304","documentHash":"b0419532-30c3-4540-9c4d-f50db1e70699"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82cd","doi":"10.1038/s41612-023-00544-7","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-023-00544-7.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Rapid transformation of wildfire emissions to harmful background aerosol","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Wildfires are a significant source of organic aerosol during summer, with major impacts on air quality and climate. However, studies in Europe suggest a surprisingly low (less than 10%) contribution of biomass burning organic aerosol to average summertime fine particulate matter levels. In this study we combine field measurements and atmospheric chemical transport modeling, to demonstrate that the contribution of wildfires to fine particle levels in Europe during summer is seriously underestimated. Our work suggests that the corresponding contribution has been underestimated by a factor of 4–7 and that wildfires were responsible for approximately half of the total OA in Europe during July 2022. This discrepancy with previous work is due to the rapid physicochemical transformation of these emissions to secondary oxidized organic aerosol with an accompanying loss of its organic chemical fingerprints. These atmospheric reactions lead to a regionally distributed background organic aerosol that is responsible for a significant fraction of the health-related impacts caused by fine particles in Europe and probably in other continents. These adverse health effects can occur hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away from the fires. We estimate that wildfire emissions are responsible for 15–22% of the deaths in Europe due to exposure to fine particulate matter during summer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6672c9324097074b6ceb82cf","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d0","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d1","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d2","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d3","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d4","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d5","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d6","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d7","5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d8","6672c9324097074b6ceb82d9","6672c9324097074b6ceb82da","6672c9324097074b6ceb82db","6672c9324097074b6ceb82dc","6672c9324097074b6ceb82dd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f13c","mniswId":"27879","title":"npj Climate and Atmospheric Science","issn":"2397-3722","eissn":"2397-3722","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3ee3532a-e37e-4e28-a26c-b5030f1b6018"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6672c9324097074b6ceb82ce","year":"2023","volume":"6","number":"1","documentHash":"3521d639-8e75-44fb-9226-3c70f859107f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059673063"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"668511eafdbe83043b5b9ece","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"8ac4e86d-c518-4e66-b71c-ff10ef23a147"},{"objectId":"668511eafdbe83043b5b9ecd","name":"Peter","lastName":"Siffalovic","documentHash":"383b47b1-7502-4e5c-b91d-5c361043979c"},{"objectId":"668511eafdbe83043b5b9ecc","name":"Nada","lastName":"Mrkyvkova","documentHash":"b0265507-735c-4769-a263-8248e6840a16"},{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","name":"Vishnu","lastName":"Anilkumar","uuid":"E6BC82950E1CF64BECDB4E8D419567829CC492010A2E46B331EFC93341CB90928D97A6E5D8D5F2AF41D1CFFB86D4ADC11ADEB9CC375327B4151EE8C1B4037AA1","documentHash":"49a79fc7-7dc7-4e98-a3f0-b2ba16d63798"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"},{"objectId":"60c301819543c723365439a6","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kruszyńska","uuid":"1F777AE05B68F47FCB90C9A543F50BFADEBC0C3E7A9D7AA41EEB4E98CFFF0E76E48911F3C0127FF5F1468ED98ECD75CF002FD533653E74BB57F4D6DC0AC1710C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5325-2496","documentHash":"62db7d6e-9c42-40c2-9924-e11570becb39"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"objectId":"668511eafdbe83043b5b9eca","doi":"10.1039/d3tc04511k","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/TC/D3TC04511K","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Ionic liquid-assisted growth of high-quality methylammonium lead bromide single crystals for photodetection applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The control of nucleation temperature and growth kinetics during inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) is critical for achieving high-quality perovskite single crystals (SCs) for various optoelectronic applications. Here, we show that the addition of a 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (BMIB) ionic liquid to the methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) precursor solution not only reduces the nucleation temperature from 80 degrees C to 60 degrees C but also substantially improves the crystal quality and optoelectronic properties. Specifically, MAPbBr3 SCs grown in the presence of BMIB exhibit better crystallinity with reduced lattice strain, nonradiative recombination and trap density compared to the MAPbBr3 SCs grown by the conventional ITC method at 80 degrees C. The high quality of the BMIB-based MAPbBr3 SCs enabled us to build an efficient planar-structured photodetector with high responsivity to green light (530 nm). This study shows that the ionic liquid-assisted growth of perovskite SCs has a significant influence on the crystal properties, which is beneficial for optoelectronic SC-based devices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c301819543c723365439a6","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2953-2960","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622ac2387523402df090302f","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","60c301819543c723365439a6","668511eafdbe83043b5b9ecc","668511eafdbe83043b5b9ecd","668511eafdbe83043b5b9ece","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547884c","mniswId":"11755","title":"Journal of Materials Chemistry C","doi":"","issn":"2050-7526","eissn":"2050-7534","documentHash":"d0d21333-e727-4798-a7b5-5c8d7b86ffe9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"668511eafdbe83043b5b9ecb","year":"2024","volume":"12","number":"8","documentHash":"294b222e-105a-458a-b992-9b174dcbb58c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["HALIDE PEROVSKITE","OPTOELECTRONIC PROPERTIES","RECENT PROGRESS","SOLAR-CELLS","CRYSTALLIZATION","DENSITY","SURFACE"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059673390"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5f","name":"Irshad","lastName":"Hussain","documentHash":"df791d66-1ce7-4edc-ad96-05c6a6d25e0e"},{"objectId":"6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5e","name":"Memoona","lastName":"Kanwal","documentHash":"1b4eac56-1706-460b-9685-bf94f29f135c"},{"objectId":"6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5d","name":"Humaira","lastName":"Razzaq","documentHash":"44973a77-15c5-4b60-a3b2-0caade558cfd"},{"objectId":"6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5c","name":"Mehwish","lastName":"Ehsan","documentHash":"039afe96-9ad8-4d57-b512-9b86499e3fc3"},{"objectId":"6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","name":"Shumaila","lastName":"Razzaque","uuid":"261A1A977BE4EBBB10518C9A7232243A314300947F089B5F096212DB1251D7A0E00CD43D305FDC10FC626B597CB0221BA7C0E5FD5D9A0908F94649ACF2D8F675","documentHash":"285a1ffb-e5f7-47d0-ad8f-de3058e74c54"}],"objectId":"6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5a","doi":"10.1016/j.jece.2022.109185","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2213343722020589?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Engineering nanocomposite membranes of sodium alginate-graphene oxide for efficient separation of oil-water and antifouling performance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The consistent oil spill incidents and industrial wastewater disposal impart an adverse impact on human health and nature. The utilization of porous membranes to address these problems has been predominantly investigated. Recently, hydrophilic membranes, have revealed the promising potential in oil-water separation. Thus, the present work focuses on the fabrication of hydrophilic nanocomposite membranes by incorporating the graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets to develop cost-effective, environmentally friendly and sustainable membranes of sodium alginate (SA) for separating oil/water mixtures. The pristine sodium alginate (pSA) and composite membranes (SA-GO) were developed by solution casting and crosslinking approach. Permeation experiments confirmed that the composite membranes possess porosity, hydrophilicity and high pure water flux (PWF) in comparison to pSA membranes. The structural and morphological features of fabricated membranes were confirmed by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and tensile testing results confirmed that the composite membranes have high mechanical endurance and thermal stability over pSA membranes. In addition, the wettability and surface hydrophilicity were further assured by measuring the water contact angle. The nanocomposite membranes significantly outperformed than the pristine SA membranes in the antifouling test without the requirement for alkaline or acidic washing. These membranes were then employed for oil-water separation utilizing a pressure-driven filtration method. The separation efficiency (% S), flux recovery ratio (% FRR) and protein rejection (% R) were also evaluated for the engineered membranes. The results depict that introducing 1.5 wt% GO to the SA matrix improved oil removal efficiency by 93.26%, antifouling performance with a protein rejection rate of 90%, and the flux recovery ratio of > 88%, repeated over the three filtration cycles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6375aab9752340568bfffcd4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"109185","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5c","6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5d","6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5e","6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c800","mniswId":"10984","title":"Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering","issn":"2213-3437","eissn":"2213-3437","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2b8fa9a1-bef5-45be-b442-4a9583b8fcb1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6672c9a94097074b6ceb8d5b","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"1","documentHash":"7c8672e7-497c-4ac9-a53b-4983b5417305"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059673393"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be087","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Węgrzyn","uuid":"5BAE6FD3E0A6779218C7D02AD9D0D4159AEED56C46C1CB4DA823F9F58F41A44F78A5C4DD054A302222B60589D66857BA128D977BFC39BC4E4B5EF1560174AC96","orcidId":"0000-0002-3269-6722","documentHash":"b89df386-b698-4a14-9f8d-1781dda6169c"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc8e4","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Tomczewski","uuid":"F7C7001B958E6BF2C731A69A5A530BDE6E77AB28A1E73A52C6BE95B7B01205F0C7327573C65AF0EED45B25713558B791CE26CF0EBC02A6C44B191DAE90F4C399","orcidId":"0000-0001-7938-2088","documentHash":"d8819745-737f-4619-9c49-54943d910a9e"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc8c9","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Liżewski","uuid":"59EF14065B25F920C41C03FC65F37D6354267605955A2F066171BD5C318A08E02D85FAA10A25E6B4D0A8A6F40AC7284A0E0CD840B42EB73E60D3B7FF60FDF142","orcidId":"0000-0002-3350-4622","documentHash":"f6fea5cb-9869-4785-acd1-fd69eff21fdd"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c372","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Borycki","uuid":"8FFFCAE436E598237AF17388C1DC0BEE0B7EBBEFE8098349D95C1CA962C751C11B87DB46A4DFFEBA4F8D9C404FC7EC7EB98000D6EFED8DE01F21FEA352394D85","orcidId":"0000-0002-1235-889X","documentHash":"8c9b1d19-6c92-441e-8e4e-379e92d77c25"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Wojtkowski","uuid":"72C7EFD6AE3C0FF6AB46F559605ACE983360A4E4C03769BB1C4D0D72A5671C8A9CF4B7F1DF377F7E2D985ACB38C7A2EE1DA60B3BE1A843F188600A590E526E53","orcidId":"0000-0003-0599-0878","documentHash":"380243f1-4e56-4426-bead-5a7a8a484819"}],"objectId":"66851309fdbe83043b5ba72e","doi":"10.1016/j.bbe.2023.12.002","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0208521623000748?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Imaging the retinal and choroidal vasculature using Spatio-Temporal Optical Coherence Tomography (STOC-T)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Spatio-Temporal Optical Coherence Tomography (STOC-T) is a novel imaging technique using light with controlled spatial and temporal coherence.

Previous studies on the vascularization dynamics have typically focused only on the phase of intense growth and often lacked spatial control over the initial cell arrangement. Here, we perform long-term day-by-day analysis of tens of isolated microvasculatures sprouting from endothelial cell-coated spherical beads embedded in an external fibrin gel. We systematically study the topological evolution of the sprouting networks over their whole lifespan, i.e., for at least 14 days. We develop a custom image analysis toolkit and quantify (i) the overall length and area of the sprouts, (ii) the distributions of segment lengths and branching angles, and (iii) the average number of branch generations-a measure of network complexity. We show that higher concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) lead to earlier sprouting and more branched networks, yet without significantly affecting the speed of growth of individual sprouts. We find that the mean branching angle is weakly dependent on VEGF and typically in the range of 60(degrees)-75(degrees), suggesting that, by comparison with the available diffusion-limited growth models, the bifurcating tips tend to follow local VEGF gradients. At high VEGF concentrations, we observe exponential distributions of segment lengths, which signify purely stochastic branching. Our results-due to their high statistical relevance-may serve as a benchmark for predictive models, while our new image analysis toolkit, offering unique features and high speed of operation, could be exploited in future angiogenic drug tests."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef7b","5f6b1d34752340073806aa62","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709486878c28a0473bef7b","66852b98fdbe83043b5d1634","66852b98fdbe83043b5d1635","66852b98fdbe83043b5d1636","66852b98fdbe83043b5d1637","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","5f6b1d34752340073806aa62"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f0a6","mniswId":"27725","title":"APL Bioengineering","issn":"2473-2877","eissn":"2473-2877","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7ac1da5e-1b64-4c3e-9b63-fbc85584d674"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66852b98fdbe83043b5d1633","year":"2024","volume":"8","number":"1","documentHash":"7e068d36-0ec4-4634-86c2-443452e42979"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059676724"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66755a7140970754df55605d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","documentHash":"f24a958d-57d6-46f9-a7d7-a4ada0a9c471"},{"objectId":"66755a7140970754df55605c","name":"Volker","lastName":"Presser","documentHash":"0b87a34c-1f4c-4314-9801-b483af207476"},{"objectId":"66755a7140970754df55605b","name":"Andrij","lastName":"Kuzmak","documentHash":"39424ec7-e503-4b93-be14-383534d68752"},{"objectId":"66755a7140970754df55605a","name":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Pameté","documentHash":"7e77435f-9854-4bbf-aee2-87d9c5e2a150"},{"objectId":"66755a7140970754df556059","name":"Taras","lastName":"Verkholyak","documentHash":"613950ff-c1fb-426e-80c4-33a098a4f5d0"},{"objectId":"66755a7140970754df556058","name":"Anna","lastName":"Seltmann","documentHash":"a7856b83-de47-4310-9195-ce346a7a59e7"},{"objectId":"602f7bc29543c7410626f525","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Gołowicz","uuid":"862878730BE8A4B42868F64994CD2D316007C65A80F9AB17F67A0B4F00F5056643524632B60FC0B481F56D0E8F25992A091604B935F6AE9C35ABEB7709366841","documentHash":"76ead020-8503-4a30-ae35-f5590383a120"}],"objectId":"66755a7140970754df556057","doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2023.123369","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S016773222302175X?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effect of cation size of binary cation ionic liquid mixtures on capacitive energy storage","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ionic liquid mixtures show promise as electrolytes for supercapacitors with nanoporous electrodes.

We reveal subtle effects of how the distribution of pores accessible to different types of ions correlates with charge storage and suggest approaches to increase capacitance and stored energy density with ionic liquid mixtures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f7bc29543c7410626f525"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"391","pagesFromTo":"123369","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66755a7140970754df556058","66755a7140970754df556059","602f7bc29543c7410626f525","66755a7140970754df55605a","66755a7140970754df55605b","66755a7140970754df55605c","66755a7140970754df55605d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788ad","mniswId":"11911","title":"Journal of Molecular Liquids","issn":"0167-7322","eissn":"1873-3166","documentHash":"be68a988-b1a2-4170-9777-f821874d753b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6641dede40970755576e35ce","year":"2023","volume":"391","documentHash":"8cdbe649-e6aa-484c-98fd-e7baeaaed594"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059679787"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667a9f5a409707681dca91a2","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Przeździecki","documentHash":"1f8d0b2e-f7f5-45d3-b1b0-b23f142b0c30"},{"objectId":"667a9f5a409707681dca91a1","name":"Mohadese","lastName":"Yaghoobi Anzabi","documentHash":"5f5f5d88-c1f4-4487-8b73-242d161d0845"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c0686","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Chaładaj","uuid":"E4C1C6061053030F3D4933F93DF98E9CB61A4DD388E05478E727A84DD67962854A0D0693213332D0DB428570B5AB58AE3CA7A7B28EEC0B8A7979080F688EE509","orcidId":"0000-0001-8143-3788","documentHash":"440cf2b4-8cd2-46c9-a1c3-90896cb1173a"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Danylyuk","uuid":"76C9B1CC8BF786B245E6E064FB1EF762E68427200C6553653512B713F436D343D13A0FB2F4895E1A41BC3AF4C15135CAD6F23994A9FF03CEFCD8BF9C0FB1D1C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3653-2418","documentHash":"f0349659-5182-4ae8-aa50-8a56d0ae53e1"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa965","name":"Dorota","lastName":"GRYKO","uuid":"440D7FFFC856B88CBDC67281FC8AC11A142B7F0C34B6FDF5562B68562072290C05AF821761D28C4CD31C5EBA77D02F0F687A64A3BB73ABCD7D421672A9DD7C1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-5197-4222","documentHash":"6bd7ccda-1d32-4e93-88d3-704aed0c678d"},{"objectId":"5e709337878c28a0473a526c","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Wosińska-Hrydczuk","uuid":"A8F8408EB63A15B90668B6EBA894506D5852BEAF061436C636F784B04F62AB95871C7324558F1A762EC7FB20A22BD5C8A707709A2CA225215784114E3521D57A","documentHash":"00b90baa-f5bb-448d-b012-b468416252fa"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"667a9f5a409707681dca919f","doi":"10.1021/acsorginorgau.4c00019","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsorginorgau.4c00019","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Unique Reactivity of Triazolyl Diazoacetates under Photochemical Conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Under light irradiation, aryldiazo acetates can generate either singlet or triplet carbenes depending on the reaction conditions, but heteroaryl diazo compounds have remained underexplored in this context.

As a multifactorial disease, the gene-associated mechanisms are important to know. This study applied a bioinformatics approach to explore the molecular underpinning of type 2 diabetes mellitus through differential gene expression analysis. We used microarray datasets GSE16415 and GSE29226 to identify differentially expressed genes between type 2 diabetes and normal samples using R software. Following that, using the STRING database, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed and further analyzed by Cytoscape software. The EnrichR database was used for Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analysis to explore key pathways and functional annotations of hub genes. We also used miRTarBase and TargetScan databases to predict miRNAs targeting hub genes. We identified 21 hub genes in type 2 diabetes, some showing more significant changes in the PPI network. Our results revealed that GLUL, SLC32A1, PC, MAPK10, MAPT, and POSTN genes are more important in the PPI network and can be experimentally investigated as therapeutic targets. Hsa-miR-492 and hsa-miR-16-5p are suggested for diagnosis and prognosis by targeting GLUL, SLC32A1, PC, MAPK10, and MAPT genes involved in the insulin signaling pathway.Insight: Type 2 diabetes, as a rising global and multifactorial disorder, is important to know the gene-associated mechanisms. In an integrative bioinformatics analysis, we integrated different finding datasets to put together and find valuable diagnostic and prognostic hub genes and miRNAs. In contrast, genes, RNAs, and enzymes interact systematically in pathways. Using multiple databases and software, we identified differential expression between hub genes of diabetes and normal samples. We explored different protein-protein interaction networks, gene ontology, key pathway analysis, and predicted miRNAs that target hub genes.

Therefore, we used nanobodies as they are more suitable for fabricating electrochemical biosensors with near-field communication (NFC) technology. Moreover, a flow-through microfluidic device was implemented in this system for the detection of C-reactive protein (CRP), an inflammation biomarker, and a model analyte. The resulting sensors not only have high sensitivity and portability but also retain automated sequential flow properties through capillary transport without the need for an external pump. We also compared the accuracy of CRP quantitative analyses between commercial PalmSens4 and NFC-based potentiostats. Furthermore, the sensor reliability was evaluated using three biological samples (artificial serum, plasma, and whole blood without any pretreatment).

Parahydrogen is used for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance signal enhancement, which is hyperpolarization of other molecules, including biorelevant ones. Hyperpolarization can be achieved by using Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE). SABRE can also convert parahydrogen into orthohydrogen, and surprisingly, in some cases, it has been discovered that orthohydrogen's resonance has the Partially Negative Line (PNL) pattern. Here, an approach for obtaining orthohydrogen with a PNL signal is presented for two catalysts: Ir-IMes, and Ir-IMesBn. The type of solvent in which SABRE is conducted is crucial for the observation of PNL. Specifically, a PNL signal can be easily generated in benzene using both catalysts, but it is more intense for Ir-IMesBn. In acetone, PNL is observed only for Ir-IMesBn. In methanol, no PNL is detected. The PNL effect is only detectable during the initial steps of pre-catalyst activation, and disappears as the activation process progresses. We have proposed a working hypothesis that explains our results. The presented data may facilitate the further investigation of PNL and its applications in material science and catalysis.\nThe conditions under which orthohydrogen with a unique Partial Negative Line (PNL) can be observed were determined by one of the essential Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) hyperpolarization methods, called Signal Amplification by Reversible Exchange (SABRE).

The incorporation of nanomaterials (polypyrrole, carboxyl methyl cellulose, carbon nanotubes, titania nanotubes, graphene, graphene oxide, mesoporous silica) into these polymers has significantly enhanced their performance, opening up new avenues for diverse applications. The self-healing capability in polymer nanocomposites depends on several factors, including heat, quadruple hydrogen bonding, pi-pi stacking, Diels-Alder reactions, and metal-ligand coordination, which collectively govern the interactions within the composite materials. Among possible interactions, only quadruple hydrogen bonding between composite constituents has been shown to be effective in facilitating self-healing at approximately room temperature. Conversely, thermo-responsive self-healing and shape memory polymer nanocomposites require elevated temperatures to initiate the healing and recovery processes. Thermo-responsive (TRSMPs), light-actuated, magnetically actuated, and Electrically actuated Shape Memory Polymer Nanocomposite are discussed. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the different types of interactions involved in SMP and SHP nanocomposites and examines their behavior at both room temperature and elevated temperature conditions, along with their biomedical applications. Among many applications of SMPs, special attention has been given to biomedical (drug delivery, orthodontics, tissue engineering, orthopedics, endovascular surgery), aerospace (hinges, space deployable structures, morphing aircrafts), textile (breathable fabrics, reinforced fabrics, self-healing electromagnetic interference shielding fabrics), sensor, electrical (triboelectric nanogenerators, information energy storage devices), electronic, paint and self-healing coating, and construction material (polymer cement composites) applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f2878c28a04739fb7d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d35"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1267-1 - 1267-30","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d35","669100d0fdbe83399d798cdb","669100d0fdbe83399d798cdc","5e7092f2878c28a04739fb7d","669100d0fdbe83399d798cdd","669100d0fdbe83399d798cde"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65f307a140970775cd351764","year":"2024","volume":"29","number":"6","documentHash":"281fc3e7-9098-45f0-8ed2-8c01a27809d9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["shape recovery","functional materials","biomedical applications","nanomaterials","materials design engineering","nanocomposites"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059695506"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667ea63efdbe836b519b5525","name":"Ankur","lastName":"Gupta","documentHash":"cb1fa022-a740-454d-b48a-0c6ac8fe79e0"},{"objectId":"667ea63efdbe836b519b5524","name":"Filipe","lastName":"Henrique","documentHash":"81f6030a-7b5a-4523-a82b-c5f61e55feaa"},{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb067","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Żuk","uuid":"A2CF96DA8DBC0F0EC756C6ABC4425D960DE3CE0ABBAA543C816DF4A24FDC838930FFB8FDCE1B3C5232CB0C3FD9D93CDDF5F6336061F13F18AC43F6C77E9DD4F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0555-5913","documentHash":"323764fb-47c8-4632-b36c-1a2615cfd8d2"}],"objectId":"667ea63efdbe836b519b5522","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2401656121","publicUri":"https://pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.2401656121","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A network model to predict ionic transport in porous materials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Understanding the dynamics of electric-double-layer (EDL) charging in porous media is essential for advancements in next-generation energy storage devices. Due to the high computational demands of direct numerical simulations and a lack of interfacial boundary conditions for reduced-order models, the current understanding of EDL charging is limited to simple geometries. Here, we present a network model to without restrictions on EDL thickness and pore radii. We demonstrate that electrolyte transport is described by Kirchhoff's laws in terms of the electrochemical potential of charge (the valence-weighted average of the ion electrochemical potentials) instead of the electric potential. By employing the equivalent circuit representation suggested by these modified Kirchhoff's laws, our methodology accurately captures the spatial and temporal dependencies of charge density and electric potential, matching results obtained from computationally intensive direct numerical simulations. Our network model provides results up to six orders of magnitude faster, enabling the efficient simulation of a triangular lattice of five thousand pores in 6 min. We employ the framework to study the impact of pore connectivity and polydispersity on electrode charging dynamics for pore networks and discuss how these factors affect the time scale, energy density, and power density of capacitive charging. The scalability and versatility of our methodology make it a rational tool for designing 3D-printed electrodes and for interpreting geometric effects on electrode impedance spectroscopy measurements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709459878c28a0473bb067"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"121","issue":"22","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["667ea63efdbe836b519b5524","5e709459878c28a0473bb067","667ea63efdbe836b519b5525"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793a7","mniswId":"16559","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","eissn":"0027-8424","documentHash":"6c7e55c8-7f5c-4cba-8821-15f816a6ebee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667ea63efdbe836b519b5523","year":"2024","volume":"121","number":"22","documentHash":"68025c1a-60ff-4921-95ea-25e4008e724c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059695948"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667e93eefdbe836b519a6eab","name":"Priyanka H.","lastName":"Maheshwari","documentHash":"95c00dc7-4d16-4714-ba0a-9818d5725b64"},{"objectId":"667e93eefdbe836b519a6eaa","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","documentHash":"fe699d3f-b3a8-4541-9f22-4bf29eec5274"},{"objectId":"667e93eefdbe836b519a6ea9","name":"Prashant","lastName":"Dubey","documentHash":"2a933d29-909a-4317-9155-8f9fd02636a3"},{"objectId":"632925a975234038513ec7cd","name":"Vishal","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"0D354B8FF99322E996FAD697B910B9306BF493B61B1F346347D695464BD50998A218E449DB5FC5607022C923AA46F5781E11CB0C661050D2DB1C6080ECBFEEED","documentHash":"7588df5d-7d93-4a1b-a3cc-2c5777e99ac2"}],"objectId":"667e93eefdbe836b519a6ea8","doi":"10.1021/acsanm.4c01697","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsanm.4c01697","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Sustainable Nanoporous Metal–Organic Framework/Conducting Polymer Composites for Supercapacitor Applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An economically and environmentally sustainable course of action to address energy crisis concerns is to recycle discarded PET (polyethylene terephthalate) plastics into value-added products for the aforementioned application. Herein, a high surface area Cu-metal organic framework (Cu-MOF) has been synthesized through an economically feasible approach using trash PET plastic. However, electrochemical properties of pristine MOFs are hindered due to their poor stability and low intrinsic conductivity. Hence, high-performance nanocomposites of Cu-MOF with conducting polymers like PANI (polyaniline) and PPy (polypyrrole) have been synthesized via an in situ hydrothermal technique. PANI and PPy not only improve the conductivity of the nanocomposite but also create additional MOF-PANI-MOF transport channels, which ensures effective electrolyte ion transportation and hence enhances the overall electrochemical performance. Cu-MOF/PANI and Cu-MOF/PPy nanocomposites exhibit high specific capacitances of 160.5 and 132.5 F/g, respectively, at a current density of 0.5 A/g, which is more than that of pristine Cu-MOF (104.8 F/g). Furthermore, asymmetric hybrid supercapacitor devices (Cu-MOF//Cu-MOF/PANI and Cu-MOF//Cu-MOF/PPy) have been assembled that have shown immense potential as energy storage devices.

Nowadays, GBHs have reached 350 million hectares of crops in over 140 countries, with an annual turnover of 5 billion and 11 billion USD in the U.S.A. and worldwide, respectively. Because of the highly efficient inhibitory activity of GLP targeted to the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase pathway, present in plants and several bacterial strains, the GLP-resistant crop-based genetic agricultural revolution has decreased famine and improved the costs and quality of living in developing countries. However, this progress has come at the cost of the 50-year GBH overuse, leading to environmental pollution, animal intoxication, bacterial resistance, and sustained occupational exposure of the herbicide farm and companies’ workers. According to preclinical and clinical studies covered in the present review, poisoning with GLP, GLP-SH, and GBHs devastatingly affects gut microbiota and the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis, leading to dysbiosis and gastrointestinal (GI) ailments, as well as immunosuppression and inappropriate immunostimulation, cholinergic neurotransmission dysregulation, neuroendocrinal system disarray, and neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral alterations. Herein, we mainly focus on the contribution of gut microbiota (GM) to neurological impairments, e.g., stroke and neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. The current review provides a comprehensive introduction to GLP’s microbiological and neurochemical activities, including deviation of the intestinal Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, excitotoxicity, and mind-altering processes. Besides, it summarizes and critically discusses recent preclinical studies and clinical case reports concerning the harmful impacts of GBHs on the GI tract, MGB axis, and nervous system. Finally, an insightful comparison of toxic effects caused by GLP, GBH-SH, and GBHs is presented. To this end, we propose a first-to-date survey of clinical case reports on intoxications with these herbicides."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e709474878c28a0473bd731","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"271","pagesFromTo":"115965","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709474878c28a0473bd731","66a23df0fdbe837215775dcf","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a30","mniswId":"5410","title":"Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety","issn":"0147-6513","eissn":"1090-2414","documentHash":"c945d49a-d7e5-4884-90b5-1792d5f61292"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a23df0fdbe837215775dce","year":"2024","volume":"271","documentHash":"ab3e9e5b-5eab-47c9-9dfb-8858567bdd3a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059699454"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66852cf8fdbe83043b5d3585","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ostrowski","documentHash":"f17843a4-09e2-401a-ae78-dee4ada27640"},{"objectId":"66852cf8fdbe83043b5d3584","name":"Ewa M.","lastName":"Iwanek (nee Wilczkowska)","documentHash":"8f149c19-1f4e-450c-b2c0-9786fee0bd40"},{"objectId":"66852cf8fdbe83043b5d3583","name":"Kasper","lastName":"Drozdowski","documentHash":"87f1ca8f-67f5-4bfc-a1f9-c4b170cb0b43"},{"objectId":"66852cf8fdbe83043b5d3582","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Czerwiński","documentHash":"652d4045-ae3b-43a8-b003-719535273762"},{"objectId":"66852cf8fdbe83043b5d3581","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gidzińska","documentHash":"60e6f139-b90b-491f-bc1e-88584ca316ff"},{"objectId":"66852cf8fdbe83043b5d3580","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gliński","documentHash":"c2edac2f-d992-4643-8aec-e4d5314f700d"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Łomot","uuid":"9AD36137223F2722603D98969D279F5AB25CDBFDC76A5D950100F7F869850EC0FF7080AD835DF490058317885BB46E2FA8C68ECFF5811377F69FFFD0A2288626","orcidId":"0000-0003-3663-1122","documentHash":"15b687f0-a174-44c7-97e5-cebe3bb751ea"}],"objectId":"66852cf8fdbe83043b5d357f","doi":"10.3390/molecules29030584","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/3/584/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Catalytic Ketonization over Oxide Catalysts (Part XIV): The Ketonization and Cross-Ketonization of Anhydrides, Substituted Acids and Esters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A series of 20 wt.% MO2/S catalysts (where M = Ce, Mn or Zr and S = SiO2 or Al2O3) were prepared using various precursors of the active phases.

engineering of organic hole-transporting materials (HTMs) plays an important role in enhancing the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as well as reducing their fabrication cost. Here, two low-cost spiro-OMeTAD analogues, namely SP-Naph and SP-SMe, featuring a spiro[fluorene-9,9-xanthene] (SFX) central core and asymmetric subunits are designed and synthesized. Specifically, the SFX core in the SP-Naph molecule is substituted with dimethoxyphenylnaphthylamine subunits to enhance conductivity and charge transport properties by expansion of the π-conjugated structure. On the other hand, in the molecular structure of SP-SMe, the methoxy groups (–OMe) from diphenylamine units were partially replaced with the methylsulfanyl groups (–SMe) to increase interaction with the perovskite surface through the “Lewis soft” S atoms. By combining various experimental and simulation methods, thestructure–property relationship of the newly synthesized HTMs was thoroughly investigated. The suitable HOMO energy level with the perovskite layer together with superior photoelectric properties and enhanced thermostability and humidity resistivity are obtained for the SP-SMe HTM. As a result, the planar n–i–p PSC with the dopant-free SP-SMe HTM yields a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.95%, which outperforms that with SP-Naph (20.51%) and doped spiro-OMeTAD (19.23%). Importantly, the device with SP-SMe also reveals enhanced operational stability under continuous 1 sun illumination and thermal stability at 65 °C. These findings provide valuable insight for the rational design of dopant-free organic HTMs based on the SFX core, which would promote the development of highly efficient and stable devices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c301819543c723365439a6","629eb829752340212cd272f2","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"8370-8380","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66c30a4ffdbe8314fa3dcd13","66c30a4ffdbe8314fa3dcd14","629eb829752340212cd272f2","66c30a4ffdbe8314fa3dcd15","66c30a4ffdbe8314fa3dcd16","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d33","60c301819543c723365439a6","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","66c30a4ffdbe8314fa3dcd17","66c30a4ffdbe8314fa3dcd18","66c30a4ffdbe8314fa3dcd19","66c30a4ffdbe8314fa3dcd1a","66c30a4ffdbe8314fa3dcd1b","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547884a","mniswId":"11753","title":"Journal of Materials Chemistry.

The majority of studies have focussed on Aβ(1-40/42) amyloids and their Cu(II)-Aβ(1-40/42) complexes which are responsible for production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), which are highly toxic to neurons. According to recent studies on amyloid plaques, Aβ(4–42), which is an N-truncated version of Aβ(1–42), is as prevalent as Aβ(1–42) in the brain. Although Cu(II) ions, bounded by Aβ(4–42), can be oxidized to highly reactive Cu(III) ions, its Cu(II) complexes do not appear to contribute to ROS/RNS formation. In this paper, the pH-dependent voltammetric response of Aβ(4–16)-Cu(II) complexes is investigated to understand the influence of the deprotonation of tyrosine within the complex towards the Cu(II)/Cu(III) reaction. The results will help to better understand the scavenging role of tyrosine in quenching highly reactive Cu(III) ions not only in Aβ(4-x)-Cu(II) complexes but also provide clues to the reactive properties of other tyrosine-containing amyloid-metal complexes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6fb","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"485","pagesFromTo":"144089","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6fb","602e5b8a9543c7410626f18b","66c32aa1fdbe8314fa3f1acb","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a67","mniswId":"5553","title":"Electrochimica Acta","issn":"0013-4686","eissn":"1873-3859","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/electrochimica-acta/","documentHash":"9acc56c7-cbf9-4da3-b4ef-7d0a9cfd7d71"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66c32aa1fdbe8314fa3f1aca","year":"2024","volume":"485","documentHash":"9752404a-4b3a-4f24-8eb2-c398e0d2c06c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059719297"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66c30c59fdbe8314fa3de1b1","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wróbel","documentHash":"4cfe9e3e-4215-4672-9140-18964d8cffef"},{"objectId":"66c30c59fdbe8314fa3de1b0","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Waleszczyk","documentHash":"6bedd104-59cf-43b5-909b-7497ec342ecf"},{"objectId":"66c30c59fdbe8314fa3de1af","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Dzwiniel","documentHash":"8b8cda24-25ec-453f-af8f-04bf4371996c"},{"objectId":"66c30c59fdbe8314fa3de1ae","name":"Ida","lastName":"Raciborska","documentHash":"d5ff6953-ff16-44fb-943a-8363c1f92347"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9ddb","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kordecka","uuid":"98675834E589D42E2B4B21C0CBD69C05114D4409F90D2A4FE08AD8E7D73C5A632C4789C4C318444FCDAB85E629266F4EF704B6BBF5063F30B22C03570F25A937","documentHash":"b533d218-daa5-4596-ab4c-d62f8ed18e1a"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b40","name":"Anna","lastName":"Posłuszny","uuid":"B4E71F1C8BCB6CA0230093D1C93548AED0553E4022E9EBB7203700091037962929C5113B1B6CC237D29289C1CF2634034C2606FE421C1D0D93DA2FDEFEE527E5","documentHash":"a70218a7-5958-4210-9c88-632d00b999da"}],"objectId":"66c30c59fdbe8314fa3de1ac","doi":"10.55782/ane-2024-2397","publicUri":"https://ane.pl/index.php/ane/article/download/2397/2437","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Optical imaging of the intrinsic signal as a tool to characterize orientation sensitivity in the primary visual cortex of the young mouse","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We employed intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) to investigate orientation sensitivity bias in the visual cortex of young mice. Optical signals were recorded in response to the moving light gratings stimulating ipsi-, contra- and binocular eye inputs. ISOI allowed visualization of cortical areas activated by gratings of specific orientation and temporal changes of light scatter during visual stimulation. These results confirmed ISOI as a reliable technique for imaging the activity of large populations of neurons in the mouse visual cortex. Our results revealed that the contralateral ocular input activated a larger area of the primary visual cortex than the ipsilateral input, and caused the highest response amplitudes of light scatter signals to all ocular inputs. Horizontal gratings moved in vertical orientation induced the most significant changes in light scatter when presented contralaterally and binocularly, surpassing stimulations by vertical or oblique gratings. These observations suggest dedicated integration mechanisms for the combined inputs from both eyes. We also explored the relationship between point luminance change (PLC) of grating stimuli and ISOI time courses under various orientations of movements of the gratings and ocular inputs, finding higher cross-correlation values for cardinal orientations and ipsilateral inputs.

An important effect to be accounted for in these models is the phenomenon of elastic scattering of signal electrons on atoms constituting a studied solid. A convenient representation of the elastic scattering cross sections (DCS) for a given interaction is the expansion into the series of Legendre polynomials. Knowledge of the expansion coefficient provides a useful tool for the software developers when a large number of the DCSs is needed in the course of calculations. The enclosed computer program AL_CREATE makes possible to calculate the expansion coefficients from three different algorithms. Much attention is devoted to evaluate the accuracy of the DCSs. High accuracy of the DCS is reported when the expansion coefficients are calculated from the relativistic phase shifts. The database of these coefficients for all elements and for the energy range from 50 eV to 20 keV is accompanying the program AL_CREATE. Taking advantage of smooth variation of expansion coefficients with energy, this database makes possible a convenient and accurate determination of the expansion coefficients for any analytical conditions. It is shown that a number of different parameters needed for quantification of electron spectroscopies can be expressed by a relatively simple formalism based on known expansion coefficients. An attention is drawn to a possibility of creating a universal sampler of the elastic scattering angles that requires only the input of the complete series of expansion coefficients. This would greatly facilitate development of programs designed for Monte Carlo simulations of electron transport. A proposition of such a generator is implemented in the program SAMPLER which is also enclosed to the present report. The program AL_CREATE has an option of testing the performance of this generator. It is shown that the frequency histogram reproduces the DCS even when a sharp and narrow features are observed. Program summary: Program title: AL_CREATE CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/9vx554yd34.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 Programming language: Fortran 90 Nature of problem: In computational practice in the field of electron transport in solids, it is convenient to use the expansion of a differential elastic scattering cross section (DCS) into a series of Legendre polynomials. Numerous parameters needed for quantitative applications of surface sensitive electron spectroscopies may be then expressed by the series of expansion coefficients. To facilitate these applications, we need a tool that provides the series of expansion coefficients for a particular atomic species and for a given electron energy. Three options of the program AL_CREATE implement algorithms that are processing different input data: (i) input of the differential elastic scattering cross section expressed by a dense grid of scattering angles; (ii) input of the series of relativistic phase shifts; (iii) interpolation based on an accompanying database of expansion coefficients calculated for numerous elements and energies. The latter approach takes advantage of a smooth and typically monotonic dependence of expansion coefficients on energy for a particular element. Consequently, this approach is the most convenient in practical applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afeb9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"297","pagesFromTo":"109084","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afeb9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777a0","mniswId":"4242","title":"COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS","issn":"0010-4655","documentHash":"b8a152f3-5740-488f-8850-2d4176f78097"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66869966fdbe836e432d0748","year":"2024","volume":"297","documentHash":"03b0949a-d459-4420-a60c-3ec20713544d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Parameterization of electron transport in solids","Elastic electron scattering on atoms","Differential elastic scattering cross section","Sampler of elastic scattering angles"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059722796"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66c878affdbe8366c670c319","name":"Karolis","lastName":"Adomavičius","documentHash":"1d3bc779-2051-4426-9f50-83f313f79516"},{"objectId":"66c878affdbe8366c670c318","name":"Ieva","lastName":"Žičkienė","documentHash":"96b6d7ad-6384-4594-920f-bc5a00b26cf0"},{"objectId":"5e7094e9878c28a0473c6b1d","name":"Egidijus","lastName":"Auksorius","uuid":"D1880BED721FE245EDE39F05B8BAE6493122F953EBA9A20864F8D6D1C3273F041E84703D2346D511211E90EB7AE437DA6B04316D89B582AE638F43B85BD4DBC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-3742-067X","documentHash":"c621b275-6b56-486f-81cb-6c9858414dfc"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be087","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Węgrzyn","uuid":"5BAE6FD3E0A6779218C7D02AD9D0D4159AEED56C46C1CB4DA823F9F58F41A44F78A5C4DD054A302222B60589D66857BA128D977BFC39BC4E4B5EF1560174AC96","orcidId":"0000-0002-3269-6722","documentHash":"b89df386-b698-4a14-9f8d-1781dda6169c"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc8e4","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Tomczewski","uuid":"F7C7001B958E6BF2C731A69A5A530BDE6E77AB28A1E73A52C6BE95B7B01205F0C7327573C65AF0EED45B25713558B791CE26CF0EBC02A6C44B191DAE90F4C399","orcidId":"0000-0001-7938-2088","documentHash":"d8819745-737f-4619-9c49-54943d910a9e"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc8c9","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Liżewski","uuid":"59EF14065B25F920C41C03FC65F37D6354267605955A2F066171BD5C318A08E02D85FAA10A25E6B4D0A8A6F40AC7284A0E0CD840B42EB73E60D3B7FF60FDF142","orcidId":"0000-0002-3350-4622","documentHash":"f6fea5cb-9869-4785-acd1-fd69eff21fdd"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b5291","name":"Karol","lastName":"Karnowski","uuid":"331A827868CB8E345E7746499EC7E2D9A8CF0E3031FA3CFBE6B6754949E6C61506FB5F94CC2957E58F534D4BCF5C6F0D9B61631FB2F49832479287B26B8440C1","orcidId":"0000-0002-5426-5878","documentHash":"2ea311ae-1299-4efc-afd0-2030a46e2bb1"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c372","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Borycki","uuid":"8FFFCAE436E598237AF17388C1DC0BEE0B7EBBEFE8098349D95C1CA962C751C11B87DB46A4DFFEBA4F8D9C404FC7EC7EB98000D6EFED8DE01F21FEA352394D85","orcidId":"0000-0002-1235-889X","documentHash":"8c9b1d19-6c92-441e-8e4e-379e92d77c25"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Wojtkowski","uuid":"72C7EFD6AE3C0FF6AB46F559605ACE983360A4E4C03769BB1C4D0D72A5671C8A9CF4B7F1DF377F7E2D985ACB38C7A2EE1DA60B3BE1A843F188600A590E526E53","orcidId":"0000-0003-0599-0878","documentHash":"380243f1-4e56-4426-bead-5a7a8a484819"}],"objectId":"66c878affdbe8366c670c316","doi":"10.1016/j.bbe.2024.03.002","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0208521624000111?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Multiwavelength laser doppler holography (MLDH) in spatiotemporal optical coherence tomography (STOC-T)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Spatiotemporal optical coherence tomography (STOC-T) is the novel modality for high-speed, crosstalk- and aberration -free volumetric imaging of biological tissue in vivo. STOC-T extends the Fourier -Domain holographic Optical Coherence Tomography by the spatial phase modulation that enables the reduction of spatial coherence of the tunable laser. By reducing the spatial coherence of the laser, we suppress coherent noise, and, consequently, improve the imaging depth. Furthermore, we remove geometrical aberrations computationally in postprocessing. We recently demonstrated high-speed, high -resolution STOC-T of human retinal imaging in vivo. Here, we show that the dataset produced by STOC-T can be processed differently to reveal blood flow in the human retina in vivo. To render the blood flow, we first pre-process STOC-T holographic data to access the approximated information about the Doppler -shifted optical field backscattered from the sample. Then, we analyze it using methods from the laser Doppler flowmetry, namely, by analyzing the Doppler broadening caused by moving light scatterers (red blood cells). However, contrary to conventional approaches, we use multiple illumination wavelengths. This enables us to render the structural volumetric and blood flow images from the same dataset concurrently. Our method, denoted as multiwavelength laser Doppler holography (MLDH), links laser Doppler flowmetry with multiwavelength holographic detection to enable noninvasive visualization and possible blood flow quantification at different human retina layers at high speeds and high transverse resolution in vivo."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e9878c28a0473c6b1d","5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","5e709469878c28a0473bc8c9","5e709408878c28a0473b5291","5e709469878c28a0473bc8e4","5e70947a878c28a0473be087","5e7092c3878c28a04739c372"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"44","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"264-275","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c3878c28a04739c372","5e7094e9878c28a0473c6b1d","5e70947a878c28a0473be087","5e709469878c28a0473bc8c9","5e709469878c28a0473bc8e4","66c878affdbe8366c670c318","66c878affdbe8366c670c319","5e709408878c28a0473b5291","5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477324","mniswId":"2396","title":"Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering","issn":"0208-5216","eissn":"0208-5216","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7aa795bf-73ee-4dbd-b2d8-42dc2480016b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6593b91c4097076c148c24d5","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"44","number":"1","documentHash":"5cb47c56-61e9-4f05-9f38-b4927b7a1cd1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059729549"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e4","name":"Mikaela","lastName":"Görlin","documentHash":"ac3c4c3d-58fe-4900-9b26-97559800af6a"},{"objectId":"66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e3","name":"Dan","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"a850e9c3-0936-46e5-b80f-ae4b67dd2a11"},{"objectId":"66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e2","name":"Vitor R.","lastName":"Silveira","documentHash":"72c2acb7-ff5f-4841-9730-a965fd280e91"},{"objectId":"66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e1","name":"Robert","lastName":"Berical-Vadell","documentHash":"6d05cd20-5c71-44c2-bbd0-d3b21e085b5e"},{"objectId":"66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e0","name":"Stylianos","lastName":"Kioumourtzoglou","documentHash":"18685e28-efb7-4442-8065-c03cc6e6c8b2"},{"objectId":"622036397523402df08c206c","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sa","uuid":"87182E2E0888DA41C757B81B2143E2316665900AFDCDE55D96C088AFA76BAFB6A4F1AA06C4EDA6BD452B1F53C7A1CCDD6A3E7FE74E2E496F4852B0410671F4C6","documentHash":"b4c2efbd-ab85-495c-833b-083d3a9f0f35"}],"objectId":"66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992de","doi":"10.1039/d4nj02015d","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/NJ/D4NJ02015D","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Plasmonic Fabry–Pérot nanocavities produced <i>via</i> solution methods","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plasmonic nanomaterials have garnered considerable attention in the scientific community due to their applicability in light-mediated technologies, owing to tunability, large optical cross-sections and scalability.

This study presents a successful approach for enhancing light absorption in a plasmonic photoelectrode system through a Fabry-P & eacute;rot nanocavity created using bottom-up solution methods. This approach technique overcomes some of the existing scalability issues while enabling the fabrication of a photocathode that can be rendered semitransparent or opaque. Such versatility opens up many application possibilities for these photosystems, from photocatalysis to optical devices"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"48","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"9390-9395","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e0","66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e1","66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e2","66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e3","66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992e4","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479022","mniswId":"15035","title":"New Journal of Chemistry","issn":"1144-0546","eissn":"1369-9261","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/nj#!recentarticles&all","documentHash":"634be8c9-b330-4800-9f9d-df12b1f91d56"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d062f0fdbe8307ad2992df","year":"2024","volume":"48","number":"20","documentHash":"0499c81d-1a73-4b41-b788-105f627e3b58"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059732690"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fd859543c723365436a5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dusiło","uuid":"39B0D6E76B70F7168320D3265772A117770C2B5094291BC4EA306A9CA945B941AF71218E83FCFC84B062457F9179CCBFE65929F7499EE4F418051CF43D52C54C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6847-063X","documentHash":"c03e16a4-90ad-4d2d-aa48-130a48f446e8"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea3","name":"Monika","lastName":"Asztemborska","uuid":"FB06FBD85548759213D9EFF8F64A1DDDB4315FCED178453EA389B9D0A36561A476C7D58833851C6B3FF9FDD40217BFD85C757B2EFFF297F8D9CCFB1E38742CD7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7785-5379","documentHash":"455e5b25-4541-4c08-b405-54aba46e3411"},{"objectId":"5e7093ad878c28a0473aeef6","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Płatkowska-Siwiec","uuid":"D0D384717F80788E6AD2F437D609DBCD5BD19637226D36672C2AECAD7325A2246F3BE31F1DE9931C256370EF78464C6E38452E620FD20E08D4090521EE760ACC","documentHash":"097a6f66-69b4-48dd-9895-c949752b9c4a"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Opałło","uuid":"ECB569ECB4125066F1DCDB9F48064E76F971F64BACACA1AFD7DBBBE80107D088337CBD1844ADDF79163AEED6F4FB8E817D076BC1662EF431F114EA1356D7929A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5872-7059","documentHash":"71cabfc4-5832-4f70-97cb-7c9b9abea0ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-03-03","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"66cdfaaffdbe8324384cc4a2","doi":"10.1016/j.elecom.2024.107694","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1388248124000377?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Electrocatalysis at vegetable oil water interface","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biphasic oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution are studied for almost two decades, because of favourable overpotential decrease as compared to aqueous solution.

Endobronchial polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) is a promising quantitative imaging approach that is in the early stages of clinical translation. To date, only animal tissues have been used to assess the accuracy of PS-OCT to quantify absolute (rather than relative) ASM in cross sections with directly matched histological cross sections as validation. We report the use of whole fresh human and pig airways to perform a detailed side-by-side qualitative and quantitative validation of PS-OCT against gold-standard histology. We matched and quantified 120 sections from five human and seven pig (small and large) airways and linked PS-OCT signatures of ASM to the tissue structural appearance in histology. Notably, we found that human cartilage perichondrium can share with ASM the properties of birefringence and circumferential alignment of fibers, making it a significant confounder for ASM detection. Measurements not corrected for perichondrium overestimated ASM content several-fold (P < 0.001, paired t test). After careful exclusion of perichondrium, we found a strong positive correlation (r = 0.96, P < 0.00001) of ASM area measured by PS-OCT and histology, supporting the method's application in human subjects. Matching human histology further indicated that PS-OCT allows conclusions on the intralayer composition and in turn potential contractile capacity of ASM bands. Together these results form a reliable basis for future clinical studies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) may facilitate in vivo measurement of airway smooth muscle (ASM). We present a quantitative validation correlating absolute ASM area from PS-OCT to directly matched histological cross sections using human tissue. A major confounder for ASM quantification was observed and resolved: fibrous perichondrium surrounding hyaline cartilage in human airways presents a PS-OCT signature similar to ASM for birefringence and optic axis orientation. Findings impact the development of automated methods for ASM segmentation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b5291"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"326","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"L393-L408","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a1","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a2","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a3","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a4","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a5","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a6","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a7","5e709408878c28a0473b5291","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a8","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a9","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7aa","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7ab","66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7ac"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145476fc6","mniswId":"957","title":"American Journal of Physiology-Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology","issn":"1040-0605","eissn":"1522-1504","documentHash":"53128371-8cdc-4945-b6ba-59725c9132d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d04686fdbe8307ad28d7a0","year":"2024","volume":"326","number":"3","documentHash":"cb810b8c-47ea-4f98-b863-f6facc000bf8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059733032"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c4","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Umar","documentHash":"01fb0bb7-1354-4369-a730-3186654dc2ae"},{"objectId":"66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c3","name":"Humaira","lastName":"Razzaq","documentHash":"fd6901da-fd6d-48ff-b890-1c1a4112ecc3"},{"objectId":"66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c2","name":"Hugh","lastName":"Gong","documentHash":"815c5f0b-fd14-42d9-b210-ed045d9b18f1"},{"objectId":"66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c1","name":"Anila","lastName":"Tabasum","documentHash":"e09f8b07-5c97-4662-afbc-73b1fbaa0687"},{"objectId":"66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c0","name":"Hifza","lastName":"Nawaz","documentHash":"19051ed5-191e-40db-9bf5-62ffde09a88d"},{"objectId":"66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1bf","name":"Amna","lastName":"Siddique","documentHash":"08a7493c-d463-479f-a9d1-2310f80189bf"},{"objectId":"6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","name":"Shumaila","lastName":"Razzaque","uuid":"261A1A977BE4EBBB10518C9A7232243A314300947F089B5F096212DB1251D7A0E00CD43D305FDC10FC626B597CB0221BA7C0E5FD5D9A0908F94649ACF2D8F675","documentHash":"285a1ffb-e5f7-47d0-ad8f-de3058e74c54"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1be","doi":"10.3390/polym16050699","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/16/5/699/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"PVDF-Based Piezo-Catalytic Membranes—A Net-Zero Emission Approach towards Textile Wastewater Purification","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Among the various water purification techniques, advancements in membrane technology, with better fabrication and analysis, are receiving the most research attention.

At the beginning of this article, the classification of piezoelectric materials is discussed. Among the various membrane-forming polymers, PVDF is a piezoelectric polymer discussed in detail due to its exceptional piezoelectric properties. Polyvinylidene difluoride can show excellent piezoelectric properties in the beta phase. Therefore, various methods of beta-phase enhancement within the PVDF polymer and various factors that have a critical impact on its piezo-catalytic activity are briefly explained. This review article also highlights the major aspects of piezoelectric membranes in the context of dye degradation and a net-zero approach. The beta-phase of the PVDF piezoelectric material generates an electron-hole pair through external vibrations. The possibility of piezo-catalytic dye degradation via mechanical vibrations and the subsequent capture of the resulting CO2 and H2 gases open up the possibility of achieving the net-zero goal."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6375aab9752340568bfffcd4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"699","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1bf","66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c0","6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c1","66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c2","66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c3","66d04530fdbe8307ad28d1c4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479331","mniswId":"16369","title":"Polymers","doi":"10.3390/polym","issn":"2073-4360","eissn":"2073-4360","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers","documentHash":"ab72f1ee-fa4b-4e2f-b2c6-7053b68d0ac9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65de56664097077091a76e32","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"5","documentHash":"902bea8e-5cbb-4bad-ae02-b2982445e7a5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059733333"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05cf","name":"Akash","lastName":"Deep","documentHash":"2c9ce641-2ef8-4feb-b4d0-bba79eecd517"},{"objectId":"66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05ce","name":"Umesh K.","lastName":"Tiwari","documentHash":"5763b0b1-d8d1-4ebf-9ddb-f561f07a6f95"},{"objectId":"66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05cd","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","documentHash":"f85d959b-652c-47ab-8e61-cf6bdae17348"},{"objectId":"66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05cc","name":"Prashant","lastName":"Dubey","documentHash":"51efa7d2-6992-4f90-a4e4-bab608a39e8f"},{"objectId":"66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05cb","name":"-","lastName":"Mansi","documentHash":"ac80a2c8-a7ac-4c8c-8e49-de9341eca52b"},{"objectId":"659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","name":"Vaishali","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"72EF0A9A2F1F1D0FDA23FA779E2BAEC74C87EFB7A5BB4FA60CF45CFB2429D9644EC13498E252AAA787939A6FFB04B078F1763848379CAFBE5614F2C602DDB02F","documentHash":"923bb0db-1204-40b7-9692-95d01a661e5c"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"}],"objectId":"66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05ca","doi":"10.1002/adsu.202400043","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adsu.202400043","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"An insight Into Surface and Diffusion Characteristics of UiO‐66@ZIF‐8 Core–Shell MOF for Asymmetric Supercapacitors with Unprecedented Energy Density","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, nanosized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) crystal has been produced on the universitetet i oslo-66 (UiO-66) metal-organic framework (MOF) to make core-shell structure using a layer-by-layer deposition method.

Remarkably, the core-shell structure achieves an impressive specific capacitance of 588.8 F g-1 at a current density of 0.5 A g-1 using 1 m sulfuric acid (H2SO4) aqueous electrolyte. Additionally, the UiO-66@ZIF-8 core-shell material is demonstrated as a positive electrode, coupled with activated carbon (AC) derived from waste tissue paper serving as the negative electrode, in the fabrication of an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device. At a power density of 400 W kg-1, this assembled asymmetric device delivers a notably high energy density of 53 Wh kg-1 along with a cyclic stability of 94.8% after 10 000 cycles. This study substantiates the superior performance of the UiO-66@ZIF-8 core-shell MOF structure as a highly effective supercapacitor electrode material, surpassing the performance of its pristine MOF counterparts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05cb","659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05cc","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05cd","66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05ce","66c3281efdbe8314fa3f05cf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b861","mniswId":"444","title":"Advanced Sustainable Systems","issn":"2366-7486","eissn":"2366-7486","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"823b41f4-a285-4bfb-9e5c-70582973d2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d864f54097071e5460db55","year":"2024","documentHash":"2d5e5a8b-e4dc-403f-8f73-3f06d2715011"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059739544"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae5597","name":"Vladyslava","lastName":"Kovalska","documentHash":"61a93fd3-cbae-44a9-8c55-4b7640ef8005"},{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae5596","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Pekhnyo","documentHash":"6e22f162-51c5-4b32-95b8-207687d45c53"},{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae5595","name":"Alexandr","lastName":"Starukhin","documentHash":"8e721af3-a6ae-4a76-8eba-54d8113c8d22"},{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae5594","name":"Mykhaylo","lastName":"Losytskyy","documentHash":"619da546-f679-4270-85cf-38223bcbd467"},{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae5593","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Chernii","documentHash":"be772ca1-fe1c-46b3-bcd4-cf2f480d4c3f"},{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae5592","name":"Yan","lastName":"Dovbii","documentHash":"090a5c98-7363-4b80-997e-67e0d006aa8f"},{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae5591","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Fedosova","documentHash":"11d86075-e8b4-45d2-8e93-d4cb40e2865f"},{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae5590","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Tretyakova","documentHash":"f7a7e903-941d-4670-8008-1727cfd31df8"},{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae558f","name":"Viktor","lastName":"Chernii","documentHash":"f4bbc33b-165f-487f-af08-c029b03fdecf"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf957","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Gorski","uuid":"1D8E2193C2D32711254DD8F366D0C0C66CB2C3C9E0481142362C059E93CDB6DE2D6A24199E49E4187C635C25BD57F9E4BDCB975E1EF5DC2B4CF6F618DB3FAB14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5182-5614","documentHash":"b0baac37-c9b5-4b5f-af94-17e25e01722f"}],"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae558d","doi":"10.1016/j.inoche.2024.112066","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1387700324000492?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Synthesis and spectral properties of mixed-ligand Zr and Hf phthalocyanine complexes with out-of-plane coordinated alkylamino-β-ketoenolate chromophores and decanoate","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The development of novel materials based on modification of phthalocyanines is promising for various applications in science, medicine and technology. Here mixed-ligand Zr and Hf phthalocyanine complexes with out-ofplane coordinated alkylamino-beta-ketoenolate chromophores and decanoate were synthesized for the first time. Complexes were obtained by one stage reaction of bis(decanoato)zirconium and hafnium phthalocyanines with alkylamino-beta-ketoenols that resulted in replacement of only one decanoate ligand with the alkylamino beta-ketoenol. Therefore, mixed-ligand Zr and Hf complexes with two chromophore systems (phthalocyanine and alkylamino-beta-ketoenol) were synthesized by using four different alkylamino-beta-ketoenols, and their structural characterizations were carried out by using some spectroscopic methods: H-1 NMR, UV-Vis, IR and MALDI TOF MS. In the UV-Vis spectra of the obtained complexes, the absorption bands characteristic for phthalocyanine system were observed along with additional absorption band of out-of-plane ligand (in the region 440-480 nm). The fluorescence spectra of investigated compounds are characterized by a maximum at about 690 nm, which corresponds to the emission of the phthalocyanine macrocycle, while the emission of alkylamino-beta-ketoenol ligand is not observed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709490878c28a0473bf957"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"161","pagesFromTo":"112066","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66990715fdbe83588aae558f","66990715fdbe83588aae5590","66990715fdbe83588aae5591","66990715fdbe83588aae5592","66990715fdbe83588aae5593","66990715fdbe83588aae5594","5e709490878c28a0473bf957","66990715fdbe83588aae5595","66990715fdbe83588aae5596","66990715fdbe83588aae5597"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780f5","mniswId":"8388","title":"INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS","issn":"1387-7003","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"2147202e-e2cc-48fd-b7eb-6cacaa88833d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66990715fdbe83588aae558e","year":"2024","volume":"161","documentHash":"447ec390-c7e1-4f3b-88d1-db43f1ecfa11"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059746499"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66a0c443fdbe837883b26dc4","name":"László","lastName":"Kövér","documentHash":"46be26fb-0149-4722-8de4-06fef12083cb"},{"objectId":"66a0c443fdbe837883b26dc3","name":"József","lastName":"Tóth","documentHash":"73feb17b-f3d9-4330-b000-4490366d95c1"},{"objectId":"66a0c443fdbe837883b26dc1","name":"Roksana","lastName":"Koronkiewicz","documentHash":"2450206d-5b34-4b65-bf71-9dfcfd414611"},{"objectId":"5fc4ba0d085dcb1e6ae0b8cf","name":"Neha","lastName":"Rangam","uuid":"7E845891996F420D44BDED234AA41B05C9791674A8DAC82D89E63BC22C8E1E3612EB2C7FF92C26566DBBEC7BD044173497E24130249BD929CFEC6B5A4A1A3D22","orcidId":"0000-0002-3461-804X","documentHash":"4d2d9dea-6b82-4845-8b0e-89083c254960"},{"objectId":"5fc4b8c9085dcb1e6ae0b8cc","name":"Alcina","lastName":"Sudagar","uuid":"5B2123C5D55E6DBA3FE36F02F1FE6BEC7F075BCA692259E551036D6A7681319975D4507E89F1FCDF4ED7AD3EDA65CDA163E5774D5BBCC910C206638343556B33","orcidId":"0000-0001-5478-0928","documentHash":"0e92e9f0-2535-441d-a885-e9826e398feb"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf720","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Michałowska","uuid":"3C86BF221054E0DA638132A262E735B5FE3D56538D97B5BC92E3042316086870CA18020EAA276AC6A2A538830016D8E26EE844D701125EDD06FBC2F5D0ADFFF7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0417-000X","documentHash":"627d10e0-4032-442e-8eb0-5930e9018c10"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","name":"Karina","lastName":"Kwapiszewska","uuid":"B5FE41F14EEC666D304654994E6250629F4F330AF6CF26B5585E2C99E5641B03DFEB8EA8A3A168084B7D1ED1D12DA60714C2ED67A21A919BC975D9B8456110D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7396-9571","documentHash":"eb6a4320-99ed-48fa-8778-37744fd76b87"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4808","name":"Marek","lastName":"Roszko","uuid":"BBE386C05F358BCFC242B25F0684A50B75B08D2AD913A6910AFB51EB2C5A4CC32CC0CDFFF706EB241CBECFF11756078E1A480468234C3699A40E2D80B956FD24","orcidId":"0000-0003-1848-2100","documentHash":"5a516718-6582-4314-99ac-0b56a65130e8"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2c5e","name":"Marta","lastName":"Pilz","uuid":"41EF2DF2D04821A8D4F339F11930AECC087963612532B8A427C108A2BB5AFA9DC40941E9700EF0AFDE38BC7E2EF26C9AE30715EF537C146CD7E648E35EEADF09","orcidId":"0000-0002-7519-2532","documentHash":"953880a8-6a6b-4861-8cc7-627c16624393"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b09e7","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Borowicz","uuid":"D63B2D1CBAA9D153E2BD617283D505E334189960BF43C306B6800911E131A1DC46163DC826D5DBC9591F08210F55027FACEF450EFC439AC7D859B7E08287470B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6440-3568","documentHash":"a3264215-d1bb-4319-b51d-735971fa60f0"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff24","name":"Beata","lastName":"Lesiak-Orłowska","uuid":"568072B8F795A59A4469526D64724F7F6F8F2618DA71B4B3A9EDEC60CD39056859AC4029BE30E48544BE9B39BAB9FDF91C3E1C831AB9E81624539A39BA95AD56","orcidId":"0000-0003-2633-8483","documentHash":"dc99ae88-6c95-471d-bb47-54d64d716fce"}],"objectId":"66a0c443fdbe837883b26dbd","doi":"10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.133723","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0141813024045288?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Surface and composition effects on the biphasic cytotoxicity of nanocomposites synthesized using leaf extracts","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Malus sylvestris L.

leads to three carboxylic acids: norpinonic acid (NPA), pinic acid (PA), and 3-methyl-1,2,3-butanetricarboxylic acid (MBTCA). In this study, the OH radical kinetics in the aqueous phase of these carboxylic acids were investigated at different temperatures and pH values of solutions. Activation parameters and the corresponding atmospheric lifetimes of the acids in the troposphere were derived. The overall second-order rate constants for the individual speciation forms of the acids (AH and A– for NPA; AH2, AH– and A2– for PA; and AH3, AH2–, AH2– and A3– for MBTCA) were determined. At 298 K, the rate constants for reactions of protonated forms (AHx) of NPA, PA, and MBTCA with •OH, were (1.5 ± 0.2) × 109 L mol–1 s–1, (2.4 ± 0.1) × 109 L mol–1 s–1, and (4.1 ± 0.6) × 108 L mol–1 s–1, respectively. For the fully deprotonated forms (Ax–) of studied acids, the second-order rate constants were (2.2 ± 0.2) × 109 L mol–1 s–1, (2.8 ± 0.1) × 109 L mol–1 s–1, and (10.2 ± 0.7) × 108 L mol–1 s–1 at 298 K, respectively. It was found that the reactions of NPA and PA with OH radicals are faster than with MBTCA. For MBTCA, the reaction rate depends on pH more strongly at elevated temperatures (>298 K). The atmospheric lifetimes of the acids considered due to their reactivity with •OH were calculated for different model scenarios at a temperature of 283 K and pH = 2 in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, liquid water content (LWC) was used for aerosols and clouds under storm conditions and at various aqueous-phase concentrations of OH radicals. The lifetimes decreased with increasing LWC (from 10–12 m3 m–3 in aerosol to 10–5 m3 m–3 in storms), indicating that the acids undergo significant aqueous processing under realistic atmospheric conditions. Besides, the aerosol systems appeared less effective in removing PA and NPA, with lifetimes ranging from hundreds of days to tens and hundreds of hours, respectively. Clouds were more effective, with lifetimes ranging from tens of hours to a single second or less. MBTCA, which dissolves better in water, was effectively removed in all systems, with the longest lifetime of approximately 90 min."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"128","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"4507-4516","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","66a23aaafdbe837215771d7f","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974","66a23aaafdbe837215771d80"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a0","mniswId":"12284","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry A","issn":"1089-5639","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/jpcafh","documentHash":"dd26774c-f35e-4fec-b822-62440e5db448"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a23ac9fdbe8372157720e3","year":"2024","volume":"128","number":"22","doi":"","documentHash":"dc41b4e8-0312-4b1f-9af6-56525abf58c4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059759963"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63574a29752340623bc01cc5","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Kamiński","uuid":"91D694F9E571CBF5E3F4F2795839295665A3AC8C722867488872D80AE68366A61DBF120E497F6A14FABBB258B7E7D60255D4288F058EA702D80B22644C10CBC8","documentHash":"bd78d9da-9e59-4094-b0a8-057c0f01f05e"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","name":"Jan","lastName":"Paczesny","uuid":"22569BA0D9E03A26F0A64D7FCE396ED2ABE848430876A29510DE2522F2961D44598990961BF4B864621D02EECDE361E0D5D41E3F1FDFCA243A5BC52483EC38B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-3951","documentHash":"6d641bb0-96ee-402e-ac7c-55829c1da4b4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"66a23f7afdbe837215776981","doi":"10.3390/pathogens13020152","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/13/2/152/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Bacteriophage Challenges in Industrial Processes: A Historical Unveiling and Future Outlook","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Humans have used fermentation processes since the Neolithic period, mainly to produce beverages. The turning point occurred in the 1850s, when Louis Pasteur discovered that fermentation resulted from the metabolism of living microorganisms. This discovery led to the fast development of fermented food production. The importance of industrial processes based on fermentation significantly increased. Many branches of industry rely on the metabolisms of bacteria, for example, the dairy industry (cheese, milk, yogurts), pharmaceutical processes (insulin, vaccines, antibiotics), or the production of chemicals (acetone, butanol, acetic acid). These are the mass production processes involving a large financial outlay. That is why it is essential to minimize threats to production. One major threat affecting bacteria-based processes is bacteriophage infections, causing substantial economic losses. The first reported phage infections appeared in the 1930s, and companies still struggle to fight against phages. This review shows the cases of phage infections in industry and the most common methods used to prevent phage infections."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63574a29752340623bc01cc5","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"152","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63574a29752340623bc01cc5","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d75f8240970704cae507c3","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"2","documentHash":"69e8fe8f-3e27-4a57-aad3-00982f495465"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059760008"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773ef7","name":"Toheed","lastName":"Akhter","documentHash":"ea05ced7-f704-45cf-ad80-5d626574a9a3"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773ef6","name":"Zulfiqar","lastName":"Ali","documentHash":"08c4aa33-f1b6-4b0b-8d88-40cbc01375d3"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773ef5","name":"Shahid","lastName":"Nazir","documentHash":"000470d8-57bb-4ec3-9916-d1655cc85999"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773ef4","name":"Chan Ho","lastName":"Park","documentHash":"13de4b3f-7695-4fc8-b4b4-937204d6c4d8"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773ef3","name":"Soo‐Kyung","lastName":"Han","documentHash":"b615de22-d6e9-4037-ad3f-f98137c68f08"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773ef2","name":"Taewook","lastName":"Kim","documentHash":"1423371c-78d9-4135-bbe0-df20936eaf2a"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773ef1","name":"Waheed","lastName":"Al‐Masry","documentHash":"d6bc08b7-5aa4-46f6-8df7-8931ce67ae63"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773ef0","name":"Asif","lastName":"Mahmood","documentHash":"bac16881-6c00-45a7-ba0f-63ec1f0ecefa"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773eef","name":"Aamal","lastName":"Rehman","documentHash":"b7a37b57-b02d-4dad-8ad7-2548746f78ff"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773eee","name":"Sadaf ul","lastName":"Hassan","documentHash":"7529a7b2-5561-4637-bdf9-e896e2ba9ad0"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773eed","name":"Asma Anam","lastName":"Hanif","documentHash":"745eb27c-0368-4fa7-a833-d4b56ac54cf0"},{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773eec","name":"Nazia","lastName":"Parveen","documentHash":"e117f15f-43a6-4aad-a60a-492770fd5373"},{"objectId":"6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","name":"Shumaila","lastName":"Razzaque","uuid":"261A1A977BE4EBBB10518C9A7232243A314300947F089B5F096212DB1251D7A0E00CD43D305FDC10FC626B597CB0221BA7C0E5FD5D9A0908F94649ACF2D8F675","documentHash":"285a1ffb-e5f7-47d0-ad8f-de3058e74c54"}],"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773eea","doi":"10.1002/pc.28503","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pc.28503","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Tailored <scp>Ni‐Zn‐Cu</scp> ferrite/<scp>EPDM</scp> nanocomposites: Synthesis, characterization, and multifaceted properties for mechanical and electrical applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, we prepared Ni-Zn-Cu Fe2O4 ferrite/ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) rubber nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical and electrical properties. First, Ni-Zn-Cu Fe2O4 ferrite nanoparticles were synthesized with a tailored composition of NiZn(0.3)Cu(0.2)Fe2O4(2). Subsequently, these nanoparticles were incorporated into the EPDM rubber matrix through a two-roll mixing mill. Scanning electron microscopy and x-rays diffraction techniques were used to explore their morphology and structure. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to identify metal-oxygen bonds in the nanoparticles and their incorporation in the nanocomposites. Similarly, curing properties, including optimum cure time, scorch time, and torque profiles, were evaluated using a moving die rheometer. While, mechanical properties of these composites, such as tensile strength and Young's modulus, were determined with a universal testing machine. Tensile strength improved from 0.11 MPa to 0.22 MPa (100% increase), whereas, the Young's modulus increased from 0.03 MPa to 0.052 MPa (86% increase). Additionally, we investigated the dielectric properties of these nanocomposites, encompassing permittivity, resistivity, and dielectric constant, using a dielectric properties analyzer. Our findings revealed a significant reduction in dielectric resistivity of nanocomposites (from 33.2 G Omega to 23.38 G Omega) upon the introduction of Ni-Zn-Cu Fe2O4 ferrite nanoparticles, indicating the formation of a continuous nanofiller network within the EPDM matrix. Interestingly, as the nanofiller loading increased, both dielectric permittivity and dielectric constant exhibited a gradual rise. The permittivity value increased from 2.31 to 2.39 (Fm-1), while the dielectric constant increased from 0.0091 to 0.0179."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6375aab9752340568bfffcd4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66a23b99fdbe837215773eec","66a23b99fdbe837215773eed","66a23b99fdbe837215773eee","66a23b99fdbe837215773eef","6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","66a23b99fdbe837215773ef0","66a23b99fdbe837215773ef1","66a23b99fdbe837215773ef2","66a23b99fdbe837215773ef3","66a23b99fdbe837215773ef4","66a23b99fdbe837215773ef5","66a23b99fdbe837215773ef6","66a23b99fdbe837215773ef7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479325","mniswId":"16357","title":"Polymer Composites","issn":"0272-8397","eissn":"1548-0569","documentHash":"0ba0afca-e8a0-4bdd-ab74-015d7c076bdd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a23b99fdbe837215773eeb","year":"2024","documentHash":"a87e2068-73a8-4087-864f-a599342ab250"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059760266"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66fbb707fdbe837a1e188e17","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Majchrowicz","documentHash":"7a6a451e-7c50-4445-9d1a-9b3bc9d10180"},{"objectId":"66fbb707fdbe837a1e188e11","name":"Agata","lastName":"Szwanda","documentHash":"342cf0f3-da89-4376-bb65-7941b5002394"},{"objectId":"66fbb707fdbe837a1e188e10","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bulowski","documentHash":"febd02e9-d74d-4137-9c7f-b43dc76ad15c"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"},{"objectId":"5e709483878c28a0473bece3","name":"Marek","lastName":"Lipiński","uuid":"E09D8F6C1A6124D84FA48992436091DA6C0815E706D3C67497D82ABA57B0327942630B2DF333ED959CD1C51F9B953A957C742A7E64B1949E09CCBB169BB40F33","documentHash":"ccbc46f7-cadd-4631-9a82-46d654add3bf"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8e83","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Starowicz","uuid":"EDB42F143D59FD41EE2A3300E5CFA1BDDFF2185545FF7C78AF1FC7B44C0BBB9B8C950878EA8B8B26E65BE85509F92014237C06DE06246D0383FB4C71C85A6EDB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7175-4921","documentHash":"32209b76-4b8d-4c8b-b120-ee05ad6fe7c6"},{"objectId":"5e70943d878c28a0473b8b64","name":"Marta","lastName":"Janusz - Skuza","uuid":"65F860C45214CC509F326A740F7CFFBC25150DD556422D424295F31B8D6E5B86C68E40ED33DFB25DACEBB52E5B2D7E2BC1B2AD50DE3FF19AA03173C6854D3F15","orcidId":"0000-0002-5434-6571","documentHash":"4ebe216f-a22d-4514-893f-788124c12d9a"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af104","name":"maciej","lastName":"szczerba","uuid":"41F9E33020B50D0B16FB15F657A6E7BE1F57D7ED47343995B43A9B1C435255A345D03F91D3F377EA788191C56433C08F717E512ED5AC14B3CD38A11395653A96","orcidId":"0000-0002-5435-6788","documentHash":"75ccefa2-8cde-470c-bc7f-41eafb703639"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0f3","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Panek","uuid":"1D21A1A77AED7A6A1D562884B8C69343B2B329D66385313DC4DEE9D08C77B8F09E1EFE6FE09744CD5EC93FF0EB1D212D50D499160FC4D780ECDB0DA2090FFD54","orcidId":"0000-0001-8150-3985","documentHash":"952d5b17-6528-418d-8acd-5511b28cd352"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0d5f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Gawlińska - Nęcek","uuid":"416949530670BBED6A5574EBF9540B41A421F95CD5DA97E09D0BBC786ED0BC39D2FECABC91CB8E145153DFC29F0D9880B0A183D86BD5E3A663A0C33FC2B32AE1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7243-3855","documentHash":"4442fc67-7180-4a31-96a4-c979e05b068b"}],"objectId":"66fbb707fdbe837a1e188e0e","doi":"10.1007/s10853-024-09581-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10853-024-09581-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Optimization of the ETL titanium dioxide layer for inorganic perovskite solar cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Titanium dioxide layers are the most popular electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells. However most studies focuses on mesoporous structure and application with organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite. In this study, the topic of ETL in planar structure of inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite solar cells was tackled, the presented approach will reduce production costs and improve cell stability, which is the greatest drawback of perovskite cells especially organic-inorganic perovskite. The potential application of these technology are greenhouses and building integrated PV sector. Here, the two TiO2 precursors titanium(IV) ethoxide in ethanol and titanium(IV) bis(acetylacetonate) diisopropoxide (Tiacac) were investigated, optimized and compared. TiO2 layers were deposited on high roughness FTO, without the use of a mesoporous layer, by spin coating method. The correlation between stock solution concentration and thickness of manufactured layers was tracked for both precursors as well as their difference in morphology of the final films and other properties. In particular, conformality and optical properties are better for Tiacac. Slightly lower refractive index of Tiacac-based titania reduced the reflective losses from 7.3 to 6.9% effectively. The obtained layers were used for inorganic solar cells of CsPbBr3 perovskite to finally settle the issue of optimal thickness and precursor. It is interesting that despite the supremacy in investigated properties of commonly used of the precursor Tiacac, the results of the cells pointed to the Tieth. The efficiency of the champion cell is 6.08% for Tieth, while 5.62% is noted for Tiacac. Trying to figure out this riddle, we shed a new light on the phenomena going on the ETL/inorganic perovskite interface investigating nanoroughness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","uid":"bFdp5gORDGmB2AOTB2xubqg","uuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","name":"Instytut Metalurgii i Inżynierii Materiałowej im.

IPF is a lethal lung disease, annually causing nearly as many deaths as breast cancer. Moreover, the coronavirus recently triggered acute exacerbation of patients suffering from IPF. Here, epitopes specific to the chosen IPF biomarkers were molecularly imprinted in a polymer as an alternative to imprinting fragile whole biomarkers' molecules. A thin molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film-based recognition units were integrated by electropolymerization with gates of extended-gate field-effect transistors (EG-FETs) to fabricate biomarker-selective chemical sensors suitable as point-of-care testing (POCT) diagnostic devices. Either AQDDIDGIQAI or FKGNKYWAVQGQNV single-epitope imprinting allowed determining the MMP-1 biomarker in the 10 to 250 nM linear dynamic concentration range with a LOD of 7.5 or 2 nM, respectively. Simultaneous imprinting of three MMP-1 epitopes, vis., MIAHDFPGIGHK, HGYPKDIYSS, and FKGNKYWAVQGQNV, decreased this LOD to 0.1 nM, allowing for determining this biomarker in serum. Moreover, by FSSNGQSIT or YSDGTPVNYTNWYR single-epitope imprinting, chemosensors for SP-A were fabricated to show the versatility of epitope imprinting.

The participation of hot carriers (photocatalysis) remains a subject of vigorous debate, often argued on the basis that carriers have ultrashort lifetime incompatible with drive photochemical processes. This study utilises plasmon hot electrons directly in the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO via a Ppasmonic nanohybrid. Through the deliberate construction of a plasmonic nanohybrid system comprising NiO/Au/ReI(phen-NH2 )(CO)(3)Cl (phen-NH2 = 1,10-Phenanthrolin-5-amine) that is unstable above 580 K; it was possible to demonstrate hot electrons are the main culprit in CO2 reduction. The engagement of hot electrons in the catalytic process is derived from many approaches that cover the processes in real-time, from ultrafast charge generation and separation to catalysis occurring on the minute scale. Unbiased in situ FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the stepwise reduction of the catalytic system. This, coupled with the low thermal stability of the ReI(phen-NH2 )(CO)(3)Cl complex, explicitly establishes plasmonic hot carriers as the primary contributors to the process. Therefore, mediating catalytic reactions by plasmon hot carriers is feasible and holds promise for further exploration. Plasmonic nanohybrid systems can leverage plasmon's unique photophysics and capabilities because they expedite the carrier's lifetime."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66fd3766fdbe836fcb7cb946","66fd3766fdbe836fcb7cb947","66fd3766fdbe836fcb7cb948","66fd3766fdbe836fcb7cb949","66fd3766fdbe836fcb7cb94a","66fd3766fdbe836fcb7cb94b","66fd3766fdbe836fcb7cb94c","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bda7","mniswId":"4077","title":"Communications Chemistry","issn":"2399-3669","eissn":"2399-3669","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"111b45b5-ea4b-4aba-8d47-589b9fe1faab"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd3766fdbe836fcb7cb945","year":"2024","volume":"7","number":"1","documentHash":"93863b8c-9b13-4db9-93c3-e9475367890a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059777187"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ea97f5fdbe836650ad3be6","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"66348bc4-5689-4b0e-a00c-609ddc5e8397"},{"objectId":"66ea97f5fdbe836650ad3be5","name":"Seckin","lastName":"Akin","documentHash":"05b56b47-c2ac-41be-ae95-c06124bf9a8c"},{"objectId":"66ea97f5fdbe836650ad3be4","name":"Abdullah","lastName":"Alodhayb","documentHash":"fbea2f14-5fa5-43be-ab28-092d19fdeda4"},{"objectId":"66ea97f5fdbe836650ad3be3","name":"Saravanan","lastName":"Pandiaraj","documentHash":"985e8aff-60a7-42a6-9d21-a4bd9031cf24"},{"objectId":"66ea97f5fdbe836650ad3be2","name":"Siddhi Vinayak","lastName":"Pandey","documentHash":"f9132187-153c-492f-9bb1-0e0eceb2ae8d"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"objectId":"66ea97f5fdbe836650ad3be0","doi":"10.1016/j.jechem.2024.02.041","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2095495624001670?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The circuitry landscape of perovskite solar cells: An in-depth analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The extensive research and development in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rekindled the hopes of converting solar energy into electricity.

However, their performance is highly reliant on specific material properties and measurement conditions. In this study, we have prepared dataset by reviewing over 150 papers on high quality 2D MHP-PDs to predict responsivity and detectivity using machine learning (ML) through web of science search. The dataset comprises various material properties such as anion size, layer thickness of inorganic octahedral (n), layer shift factor (LSF) (t1), (LSF) (t2), bandgap, molecular weight of spacer cation, nitrogen content of spacer cation, contact material, work function of contact material, and structure type for various compositions, along with the experimental conditions such as bias and irradiance. Our findings reveal that nitrogen content in spacer cation has monotonic decreasing association with responsivity, whereas it has a monotonic increasing relation with detectivity. The LSF (t1) and LSF (t2) showed positive association with detectivity unlike responsivity. Furthermore, we built six different predictive models, out of which decision tree-based models showed an RMSE of 0.0092 for responsivity and 0.0695 for detectivity. Moreover, we further validated the model by using our experimental data with five different 2D MHPSC PDs. The residual error between the predicted and actual value are found to be very less with RMSE of 1.09 x 10-2 and 7.41 x 10-6.

The VAF deposition results in a dense MXene layer suitable for SERS with high spot-to-spot and substrate-to-substrate reproducibility, with a significant limit of detection (LoD) of 20 nM for Rhodamine B analyte. The spray-coated MXenes film revealed lower uniformity, with a LoD of 50 nM for drop-casted analytes. Moreover, we concluded that the distribution of the analyte deposited onto the MXene layer is affected by the presence of MXene aggregates created during the deposition of the MXene layer. Accumulation of the analyte molecules in the vicinity of MXene aggregates was observed for drop-casted deposition of the analyte, which affects the resulting SERS enhancement. Ti3C2Tx MXene layers deposited on filter paper by VAF offer great potential as a cost-effective, easy-to-manufacture, yet robust, platform for sensing applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abf28"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1385","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["670508defdbe835645798eeb","670508defdbe835645798eec","670508defdbe835645798eed","670508defdbe835645798eee","670508defdbe835645798eef","670508defdbe835645798ef0","670508defdbe835645798ef1","670508defdbe835645798ef2","670508defdbe835645798ef3","5e709386878c28a0473abf28","670508defdbe835645798ef4","670508defdbe835645798ef5","670508defdbe835645798ef6","670508defdbe835645798ef7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","documentHash":"dabdab85-fe1a-4772-a251-125543dc975c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65f005a34097076263c27e13","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"6","documentHash":"49c59f20-3b43-4bae-a7c1-388ed7052bfc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059784444"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c396","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Komar","uuid":"8456E5EC328BB816A6DF37FF83516FAAF966078E2BCCA65B4D09A87E9887AF9223C276DDBB5B5C70A92A648DC82DCC072733C6E89AA737389655C575A39E70DA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0229-3735","documentHash":"1117a857-fabf-4fc1-ad40-5149f3b54a7a"}],"objectId":"66c3293ffdbe8314fa3f11f9","doi":"10.1016/j.visres.2024.108404","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0042698924000488?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Two-photon vision – Seeing colors in infrared","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This review discusses the current state of knowledge regarding the phenomenon called two-photon vision.

However, the impact of surface irregularities on the population dynamics of biofilms remains elusive, as most experiments are conducted on flat surfaces. Here, we show that the shape of the surface on which a biofilm grows influences genetic drift and selection within the biofilm. We culture Escherichia coli biofilms in microwells with a corrugated bottom surface and observe the emergence of clonal sectors whose size corresponds to that of the corrugations, despite no physical barrier separating different areas of the biofilm. The sectors are remarkably stable and do not invade each other; we attribute this stability to the characteristics of the velocity field within the biofilm, which hinders mixing and clonal expansion. A microscopically detailed computer model fully reproduces these findings and highlights the role of mechanical interactions such as adhesion and friction in microbial evolution. The model also predicts clonal expansion to be limited even for clones with a significant growth advantage-a finding which we confirm experimentally using a mixture of antibiotic - sensitive and antibiotic - resistant mutants in the presence of sublethal concentrations of the antibiotic rifampicin. The strong suppression of selection contrasts sharply with the behavior seen in range expansion experiments in bacterial colonies grown on agar. Our results show that biofilm population dynamics can be affected by patterning the surface and demonstrate how a better understanding of the physics of bacterial growth can be used to control microbial evolution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6365d8b97523405a7dce8d92","5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe","5e709307878c28a0473a176b","602e3c6e9543c7410626ef20"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"121","issue":"17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709307878c28a0473a176b","6365d8b97523405a7dce8d92","602e3c6e9543c7410626ef20","5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793a7","mniswId":"16559","title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","eissn":"0027-8424","documentHash":"6c7e55c8-7f5c-4cba-8821-15f816a6ebee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66c32654fdbe8314fa3ef8de","year":"2024","volume":"121","number":"17","documentHash":"cfee2e80-1d13-4a1f-be96-6b544e944554"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059787458"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfabb","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"A43E02DD56D97130FB557B1170B3ECC60D6B846F14E17ECAF295B91DD22E0E78EB30FDCEA47C95AA87D5C0B1F534A8439F0A639134D2305C36B7DDB342E7A131","orcidId":"0000-0002-1904-9459","documentHash":"42719eb5-a19e-4150-a61d-d9d457ec8b41"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf9b5","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kędra","uuid":"23FCCD4048052A32338AE9AD55F4CBA31ECEAD2B9292D718E9EE2ABCC3F2877CB1E2901F1BEEB8BC252294DBB3D5F6D44E078619A7A0DA2717FB8E3D74269026","orcidId":"0000-0002-3696-1618","documentHash":"67f910a2-70f2-4d84-a624-eb2c50422479"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf7ce","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Siklitckaia","uuid":"B12CA655C96933AC94FEE0D887AFD4211D5952A249A4671EABA03947C660C42E5867935B95C0C872A7549EBA96147AB59C5F0ECFB272582C65EAC58BF54F7659","orcidId":"0000-0003-2705-1572","documentHash":"9d793764-2183-48ec-9181-1963c61f6ed2"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739afe8","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ceborska","uuid":"CB30641AAF77DFA8E639793BDC2762D222CFD4DBE0666125F3E8142124E0954730F2AB4F572C86CA324225062A2B0720740FFB1DEF0C822882B617A9CCC6DE01","orcidId":"0000-0001-5555-771X","documentHash":"adb472dc-10c5-4156-9d5f-86262530e9c4"}],"objectId":"6708f9e2fdbe833af654b4a7","doi":"10.3390/pharmaceutics16091161","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/16/9/1161/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Synergetic Effect of β-Cyclodextrin and Its Simple Carbohydrate Substituents on Complexation of Folic Acid and Its Structural Analog Methotrexate","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Folic acid (FA) and its structural analog, anticancer medicine methotrexate (MTX), are known to form host/guest complexes with native cyclodextrins, of which the most stable are formed with the medium-sized beta-cyclodextrin.

Methods and results Fifty healthy subjects were included in this study. The frequency of exhausted T lymphocytes was measured in isolated PBMCs using flow cytometry. PD-1, TIM-3, and related miRNAs gene expression were assessed using qRT-PCR. The analyses revealed a significant decline in PD-1 and Tim-3 expression in PBMCs from RPL women (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.001, respectively). In addition, PD-1 and TIM-3 expression increased significantly in the 2nd trimester compared with the 1st trimester of healthy pregnant women (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, respectively). PD-1 and TIM-3 expression was down-regulated in the 3rd trimester compared with the 1st and 2nd trimesters. In the present study, we demonstrated that TIM-3+/CD4+, TIM-3+/CD8+, PD-1+/CD4+, and PD-1+/CD8 + exhausted T lymphocytes increased in the circulation of women in the 2nd trimester compared to the 1st and 3rd trimester. In the 3rd trimester, the expression of miR-16-5p increased significantly (p < 0.0001). miR-125a-3p expression was down and upregulated in 2nd (p < 0.0001) and 3rd (p = 0.0007) trimesters compared to 1st trimester, respectively. This study showed a significant elevation of miR-15a-5p in 3rd trimester compared to 1st trimester of pregnant women (p = 0.0002). Conclusions Expression pattern of PD-1 and TIM3 in exhausted T lymphocytes is different not only between normal pregnant and RPL women but also in different trimesters of pregnancy. So, our results showed the role of these markers in the modulation lymphocytes activity in different stages of pregnancy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"51","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaea1","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaea2","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaea3","60c2fc239543c7233654339a","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaea4","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaea5","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaea6","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaea7","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaea8","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaea9","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaeaa","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaeab","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaeac","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaead","66fbdbe5fdbe837a1e1aaeae"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ede","mniswId":"14529","title":"Molecular Biology Reports","issn":"0301-4851","eissn":"1573-4978","documentHash":"f50f16c3-5d4b-4e98-9f5e-458812a16fa1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66869eb3fdbe836e432d6ac7","year":"2024","volume":"51","number":"1","documentHash":"521615a6-7fe7-4fef-93c5-44daab5c60c0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059793823"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66fbd081fdbe837a1e19d658","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Klepacka","documentHash":"5a6343b3-9dd2-4854-bf92-c7916cfac37d"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd731","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Mazuryk","uuid":"13E0776D85F660DFE6F558DB5092FBA48757B9E5DB73994F3411CF9370C853106C4A86CAA57E4B9E1A04EF1C0434630A3B28C0DF688A9437A1F7BA74E6A6A99F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3311-7136","documentHash":"6c940586-7919-4ad1-b09e-524f950719a8"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","name":"Piyush","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"E13DBE297A73F2ACA1DA7F32D373EDA5FB882AC5C4DDE593B81140BAD5BD6DA80677830414B610AFC144957EF4E20FF1A8CC4A4F5367FEC382ACC689DAE8CD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-7729-8314","documentHash":"d3733567-ec08-40ae-9d79-439c8d659f9e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Kutner","uuid":"4DB1E113A4C8683FB6BC69134920B86E44C946E3D21F32F5F6CE1483179976E11B16608F3E02B532633CFF5B5216E4C96C7B94090438FDEA74135F1AE4F3BCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-5170","documentHash":"71f3755a-d420-46be-bb05-d5ea4b0bfa7c"}],"objectId":"66fbd081fdbe837a1e19d656","doi":"10.1021/acsptsci.4c00046","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsptsci.4c00046","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Glyphosate: Hepatotoxicity, Nephrotoxicity, Hemotoxicity, Carcinogenicity, and Clinical Cases of Endocrine, Reproductive, Cardiovascular, and Pulmonary System Intoxication","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Glyphosate (GLP) is an active agent of GLP-based herbicides (GBHs), i.e., broad-spectrum and postemergent weedkillers, commercialized by Monsanto as, e.g., Roundup and RangerPro formulants. The GBH crop spraying, dedicated to genetically engineered GLP-resistant crops, has revolutionized modern agriculture by increasing the production yield. However, abusively administered GBHs' ingredients, e.g., GLP, polyoxyethyleneamine, and heavy metals, have polluted environmental and industrial areas far beyond farmlands, causing global contamination and life-threatening risk, which has led to the recent local bans of GBH use. Moreover, preclinical and clinical reports have demonstrated harmful impacts of GLP and other GBH ingredients on the gut microbiome, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney, and endocrine, as well as reproductive, and cardiopulmonary systems, whereas carcinogenicity of these herbicides remains controversial. Occupational exposure to GBH dysregulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, responsible for steroidogenesis and endocrinal secretion, thus affecting hormonal homeostasis, functions of reproductive organs, and fertility. On the other hand, acute intoxication with GBH, characterized by dehydration, oliguria, paralytic ileus, as well as hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock, pulmonary edema, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis, may occur fatally. As no antidote has been developed for GBH poisoning so far, the detoxification is mainly symptomatic and supportive and requires intensive care based on gastric lavage, extracorporeal blood filtering, and intravenous lipid emulsion infusion. The current review comprehensively discusses the molecular and physiological basics of the GLP- and/or GBH-induced diseases of the endocrine and reproductive systems, and cardiopulmonary-, nephro-, and hepatotoxicities, presented in recent preclinical studies and case reports on the accidental or intentional ingestions with the most popular GBHs. Finally, they briefly describe modern and future healthcare methods and tools for GLP detection, determination, and detoxification. Future electronically powered, decision-making, and user-friendly devices targeting major GLP/GBH's modes of actions, i.e., dysbiosis and the inhibition of AChE, shall enable self-handled or point-of-care professional-assisted evaluation of the harm followed with rapid capturing GBH xenobiotics in the body and precise determining the GBH pathology-associated biomarkers

Stacks consisting of thin, disordered semicontinuous metal films are attractive plasmonic color media, as they can be mass-produced using industry-proven physical vapor deposition techniques. These films are comprised of random nano-island structures of various sizes and shapes resonating at different wavelengths. When irradiated with short-pulse lasers, the nanostructures are locally restructured, and their optical response is altered in a spectrally selective manner. Therefore, various colors are obtained. We demonstrate the generation of structural plasmonic colors through femtosecond laser modification of a thin aluminum film–isolator–metal mirror (TAFIM) structure. Laser-induced structuring of TAFIM’s top aluminum film significantly alters the sample’s specular and diffuse reflectance depending on the fluence value and the number of times a region is scanned. A “negative image” effect is possible, where a dark field observation mode image is a negative of a bright field mode image.

Given the coincidental differences of hepatocellular carcinoma in men and women, we investigated the effects of beta-estradiol and testosterone on the cell cycle, apoptosis, and Wnt signaling in a model of hepatocellular carcinoma to understand the sex hormone-related etiology. To determine the effective concentration of both hormones, an MTT assay was performed. The effects of beta-estradiol and testosterone on cell proliferation and death were evaluated by specific staining and flow cytometry. In addition, gene expression levels of estimated factors involved in GPC3-Wnt survival signaling were analyzed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Both hormones inhibited hepatic cell proliferation through arresting the cell cycle at S/G2 and increased the apoptosis rate in HepG2 cells. Both hormones dose-dependently decreased GPC3, Wnt, and DVL expression levels as activators of the Wnt-signaling pathway. In the case of Wnt-signaling inhibitors, the effects of both hormones on WIF were negligible, but they increased DKK1 levels in a dose-dependent manner. In each of the effects mentioned above, beta-estradiol was notably more potent than testosterone. In contrast to the primary hypothesis of the project, in which testosterone was considered a stimulating carcinogenic factor in HCC pathogenesis, testosterone inhibited the occurrence of HCC similarly to beta-estradiol. However, this inhibitory effect was weaker than that of beta-estradiol and requires further study."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"397","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"6121-6133","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d059cffdbe8307ad29675b","66d059cffdbe8307ad29675c","60c2fc239543c7233654339a","66d059cffdbe8307ad29675d","66d059cffdbe8307ad29675e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f9c","mniswId":"14856","title":"Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology","issn":"0028-1298","documentHash":"9469190e-3a3c-4f92-91a6-4c4bb07ae87c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d059cffdbe8307ad29675a","year":"2024","volume":"397","number":"8","documentHash":"5ef34ddb-c81d-4034-945b-05e7c52a3b0d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059800611"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66d06356fdbe8307ad299494","name":"Shashank","lastName":"Sundriyal","documentHash":"1b5a0ddd-7fde-4c38-9899-899f0272a68d"},{"objectId":"66d06356fdbe8307ad299493","name":"Aristides","lastName":"Bakandritsos","documentHash":"9218e7b4-9ff7-4ebd-9f26-014812031837"},{"objectId":"66d06356fdbe8307ad299492","name":"Radek","lastName":"Zbořil","documentHash":"38ea2741-d312-4aa5-aca0-70bc728f525b"},{"objectId":"66d06356fdbe8307ad299491","name":"Giorgio","lastName":"Zoppellaro","documentHash":"7979dc2e-f65b-4a04-8e22-c343486d41fa"},{"objectId":"66d06356fdbe8307ad299490","name":"Tribani","lastName":"Boruah","documentHash":"7b451137-1f6a-4b4e-a342-22ae6c15d31e"},{"objectId":"66d06356fdbe8307ad29948f","name":"Prashant","lastName":"Dubey","documentHash":"551f7ee4-8266-44b5-b372-73e13abcc057"},{"objectId":"659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","name":"Vaishali","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"72EF0A9A2F1F1D0FDA23FA779E2BAEC74C87EFB7A5BB4FA60CF45CFB2429D9644EC13498E252AAA787939A6FFB04B078F1763848379CAFBE5614F2C602DDB02F","documentHash":"923bb0db-1204-40b7-9692-95d01a661e5c"}],"objectId":"66d06356fdbe8307ad29948d","doi":"10.1002/aenm.202400521","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/aenm.202400521","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Unveiling the Potential of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Energy Storage: Developments, Challenges, and Future Prospects","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous structures emerging as promising electrode materials due to their high structural diversity, controlled and wide pore network, and amenability to chemical modifications. COFs are solely composed of periodically arranged organic molecules, resulting in lightweight materials. Their inherent properties, such as extended surface area and diverse framework topologies, along with their high proclivity to chemical modification, have positioned COFs as sophisticated materials in the realm of electrochemical energy storage (EES). The modular structure of COFs facilitates the integration of key functions such as redox-active moieties, fast charge diffusion channels, composite formation with conductive counterparts, and highly porous network for accommodating charged energy carriers, which can significantly enhance their electrochemical performance. However, ascribing intricate porosity and redox-active functionalities to a single COF structure, while maintaining long-term electrochemical stability, is challenging. Efforts to overcome these hurdles embrace strategies such as the implementation of reversible linkages for structural flexibility, stimuli-responsive functionalities, and incorporating chemical groups to promote the formation of COF heterostructures. This review focuses on the recent progress of COFs in EES devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors, through a meticulous exploration of the latest strategies aimed at optimizing COFs as advanced electrodes in future EES technologies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"24","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d06356fdbe8307ad29948f","659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","66d06356fdbe8307ad299490","66d06356fdbe8307ad299491","66d06356fdbe8307ad299492","66d06356fdbe8307ad299493","66d06356fdbe8307ad299494"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e81","mniswId":"424","title":"Advanced Energy Materials","issn":"1614-6832","documentHash":"e525177f-e355-4aac-a48c-819c3a05a806"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d06356fdbe8307ad29948e","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"24","documentHash":"5b0e4659-4836-40f8-9ef5-54bcc60e2c6e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059800855"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92b04","name":"Gaël","lastName":"De Paëpe","documentHash":"8ab7dd9c-91b5-44b7-bd42-af03dcfb782e"},{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92b03","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"a815d852-a410-4682-abb1-26b5181f3a3c"},{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92b02","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wolska-Pietkiewicz","documentHash":"97b8d607-dc7f-45af-ba84-b432c1d7613f"},{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92b01","name":"Hanako","lastName":"Okuno","documentHash":"b75fef74-4ef6-4d39-807a-03655afa468b"},{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92b00","name":"Thibault","lastName":"Charpentier","documentHash":"6a97f342-464e-450a-9cc5-fbf3ebb5be4e"},{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92aff","name":"Jean-François","lastName":"Poisson","documentHash":"4cef8b08-8d17-4470-9664-99755f1ad821"},{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92afe","name":"Sebastien","lastName":"Carret","documentHash":"8135da48-d7c0-49f0-a806-4d1cbd629b0e"},{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92afd","name":"Michał","lastName":"Terlecki","documentHash":"91170780-700d-4203-9adb-41d14a9f92eb"},{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92afc","name":"Saumya","lastName":"Badoni","documentHash":"9feda645-8030-4c93-a5b6-f5a8498876b6"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"9BB0811617F37A3C112AC89C1AB184813530B9CAE96BA8B681D4AB1BAAAB23BD3D2582BB3010CF1C2228858BC7D1F3D96B655DFB488EF0C406CA60C54014C8EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3407-0395","documentHash":"5dab1440-5edf-40d2-afdd-05ff37f8a8af"}],"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92afa","doi":"10.1021/jacs.4c09113","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.4c09113","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Atomic-Level Structure of the Organic-Inorganic Interface of Colloidal ZnO Nanoplatelets from Dynamic Nuclear Polarization-Enhanced NMR","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Colloidal semiconductor nanoplatelets (NPLs) have emerged as a new class of nanomaterials that can exhibit substantially distinct optical properties compared to those of isotropic quantum dots, which makes them prime candidates for new-generation optoelectronic devices. Insights into the structure and anisotropic growth of NPLs can offer a blueprint for their controlled fabrication. Here, we present an atomic-level investigation of the organic-inorganic interface structure in ultrathin and stable benzamidine (bza)-supported ZnO NPLs prepared by the modified one-pot self-supporting organometallic approach. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analysis showed a well-faceted hexagonal shape of ZnO NPLs with lateral surfaces terminated by nonpolar (1010) facets. The basal surfaces are flat and well-formed on one side and corrugated on the other side, which indicates that the layer-by-layer growth in the thickness of the NPLs likely occurs only in one direction via the expansion of 2D islands on the surface. The ligand coordination modes were elucidated using state-of-the-art dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy supported by density functional theory chemical shift calculations. Specifically, it was found that (1010) nonpolar facets are stabilized by neutral L-type bza-H ligands with hydrogen bond-supported eta 1-coordination mode, while polar (0001) and (0001) facets are covered by mu 2-coordinated X-type anionic bza ligands with different conformations of aromatic rings. Moreover, the ligand packing on (1010) lateral facets was determined using 13C natural abundance (similar to 1.1%) homonuclear dipolar correlation experiments. Overall, an in-depth understanding of the growth mechanism and the unique bimodal X-type/L-type ligand coordination shell of ZnO NPLs is provided, which will facilitate further design of anisotropic nano-objects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3f18"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"146","issue":"40","pagesFromTo":"27655-27667","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["671785a4fdbe83553de92afc","671785a4fdbe83553de92afd","671785a4fdbe83553de92afe","671785a4fdbe83553de92aff","671785a4fdbe83553de92b00","671785a4fdbe83553de92b01","671785a4fdbe83553de92b02","671785a4fdbe83553de92b03","5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","671785a4fdbe83553de92b04"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec005b6ad49b31cced9095a","title":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","issn":"0002-7863","eissn":"1943-2984","documentHash":"7fef26f3-1985-4675-b6ac-f550e1ef92ee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"671785a4fdbe83553de92afb","year":"2024","volume":"146","number":"40","documentHash":"e5bcec7d-cc5f-4577-a42e-c061bb45b2d9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059814091"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd7","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Swieszkowski","documentHash":"48b98099-d777-4c06-9bfb-7fe956c261e5"},{"objectId":"671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd6","name":"Cesare","lastName":"Gargioli","documentHash":"1b37f2c4-8489-4556-97b3-9d357a1897ae"},{"objectId":"671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd5","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Walejewska","documentHash":"7bd3cac1-0309-4cd2-bed7-bf4a1dbf626e"},{"objectId":"671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd4","name":"Alessia","lastName":"Paradiso","documentHash":"b3b4552e-4945-4cad-9deb-b0e10d4cb88c"},{"objectId":"671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd3","name":"Marina","lastName":"Volpi","documentHash":"612b6c08-f39d-470b-b1b3-a917127d2d2b"},{"objectId":"5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","name":"Marco","lastName":"Costantini","uuid":"39AF91D3BD887DDA9D7064C2EEA4EC3EA3433737B56F1680E3899FD57F4B56CF80C6CBF0037AABC256FFEBAA40368FC799B344097649E00467A4677CD64AE0F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2756-5872","documentHash":"cb8eda43-6975-486d-98a0-48f4cabbf744"}],"objectId":"671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd2","doi":"10.1002/adhm.202402075","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adhm.202402075","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Automated Microfluidics‐Assisted Hydrogel‐Based Wet‐Spinning for the Biofabrication of Biomimetic Engineered Myotendinous Junction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The muscle-tendon junction (MTJ) plays a pivotal role in efficiently converting the muscular contraction into a controlled skeletal movement through the tendon. Given its complex biomechanical intricacy, the biofabrication of such tissue interface represents a significant challenge in the field of musculoskeletal tissue engineering. Herein, a novel method to produce MTJ-like hydrogel yarns using a microfluidics-assisted 3D rotary wet-spinning strategy is developed. Optimization of flow rates, rotational speed, and delivery time of bioinks enables the production of highly compartmentalized scaffolds that recapitulate the muscle, tendon, and the transient MTJ-like region. Additionally, such biofabrication parameters are validated in terms of cellular response by promoting an optimal uniaxial alignment for both muscle and tendon precursor cells. By sequentially wet-spinning C2C12 myoblasts and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, a gradient-patterned cellular arrangement mirroring the intrinsic biological heterogeneity of the MTJ is successfully obtained. The immunofluorescence assessment further reveals the localized expression of tissue-specific markers, including myosin heavy chain and collagen type I/III, which demonstrate muscle and tenogenic tissue maturation, respectively. Remarkably, the muscle-tendon transition zone exhibits finger-like projection of the multinucleated myotubes in the tenogenic compartment, epitomizing the MTJ signature architecture."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd3","671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd4","671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd5","671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd6","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","671796e1fdbe83553deb9dd7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e85","mniswId":"428","title":"Advanced Healthcare Materials","issn":"2192-2640","eissn":"2192-2659","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"242f1d15-f3e4-4f6d-af26-95394515afa6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fbeb52fdbe837a1e1ca621","year":"2024","documentHash":"c03dffa7-4fb8-4aec-b9b0-c0124e04b7ce"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059814139"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67179789fdbe83553deba9fc","name":"Yun Suk","lastName":"Huh","documentHash":"938514ec-59b1-4c80-871c-d37203d06ba6"},{"objectId":"67179789fdbe83553deba9fb","name":"Seung-Kyu","lastName":"Hwang","documentHash":"0ff4e0e5-314e-4039-93dc-3eae947752ed"},{"objectId":"67179789fdbe83553deba9fa","name":"Kiavash","lastName":"Hushmandi","documentHash":"c4e23a68-1814-4d8b-a531-a9930b9158d3"},{"objectId":"67179789fdbe83553deba9f9","name":"Keyvan","lastName":"Khoshmaram","documentHash":"8f7471f3-ddab-49cb-b27a-beda38553a5e"},{"objectId":"67179789fdbe83553deba9f8","name":"Sharareh","lastName":"Harirchi","documentHash":"ea6acfc8-67e0-4688-b13c-a4116d2b5038"},{"objectId":"67179789fdbe83553deba9f7","name":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Yazdian","documentHash":"5c6e4708-165b-4844-851d-4321c990ea13"},{"objectId":"67179789fdbe83553deba9f6","name":"Maryam","lastName":"Azarian","documentHash":"bf1db7a7-fc89-48b3-99eb-b2d48b51de53"},{"objectId":"67179789fdbe83553deba9f5","name":"Haneul","lastName":"Kang","documentHash":"a04bfeb0-7379-4dab-b896-a0461e7c89c5"},{"objectId":"67179789fdbe83553deba9f4","name":"William","lastName":"C.

Consequently, identifying rare or slow-growing taxa becomes challenging. Over the past decade, a new approach has been proposed to replace traditional flasks or multiwell plates with ultrahigh-throughput droplet microfluidic screening assays. In this study, we present a novel passive droplet-based method designed for isolating proteolytic microorganisms, which are crucial in various biotechnology industries. Following the encapsulation of single cells in gelatin microgel compartments and their subsequent clonal cultivation, microcultures are passively sorted at high throughput based on the deformability of droplets. Our novel chip design offers a 50-fold improvement in throughput compared to a previously developed deformability-based droplet sorter. This method expands an array of droplet-based microbial enrichment assays and significantly reduces the time and resources required to isolate proteolytic bacteria strains."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936f878c28a0473a9842"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e44849543c7410626efd2","5e70935b878c28a0473a7ee2","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff80"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"96","issue":"40","pagesFromTo":"15931-15940","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e44849543c7410626efd2","5e70936f878c28a0473a9842","5e70935b878c28a0473a7ee2","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff80"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477015","mniswId":"1091","title":"Analytical Chemistry","issn":"0003-2700","eissn":"1520-6882","documentHash":"8f3773b7-6df0-4b93-a2cc-a2900cc9dcb3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67178522fdbe83553de9220c","year":"2024","volume":"96","number":"40","documentHash":"d7a1591d-6122-46b0-8d6d-1e6daeb241e7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059814442"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad4546","name":"Shahid","lastName":"Atiq","documentHash":"d590756a-a035-492d-8772-978a83fa7b9c"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad4545","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Asim","documentHash":"3c9bd1b0-51b2-4430-844f-6b7b316a4840"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad4544","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Awais","documentHash":"a6b54eac-fd34-4495-9b95-d6b8defba09a"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad4543","name":"Qurat Ul","lastName":"Ain","documentHash":"b6950e92-b706-40ea-8d55-54d81c1ff2c8"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad4542","name":"Saira","lastName":"Sarwar","documentHash":"4eab255c-d50d-4d1a-b183-9e54448b967e"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad4541","name":"Zahid","lastName":"Abbas","documentHash":"c0b0ae8d-dc4e-46be-8cfd-5ef6578ae25f"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad4540","name":"Wajeeha","lastName":"Rafiq","documentHash":"abfb172a-b5a2-423a-8827-f7b823886f98"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad453f","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shahid","documentHash":"b82f6a8e-4673-414b-bdcc-045b557b4eaf"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad453e","name":"Fazal","lastName":"Rasheed","documentHash":"776b78a9-15b9-4383-bcfb-e0bf9212b07b"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad453d","name":"Huma","lastName":"Ghazal","documentHash":"07c62f44-944b-45d2-b072-acf30cbf7797"},{"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad453c","name":"Farooq","lastName":"Ahmad","documentHash":"8129763b-d59d-421d-84b2-8e0ff333be2e"},{"objectId":"646c252a40e3ff6728fba498","name":"Aimen","lastName":"Waqar","uuid":"9E7D07746C9455D69CACD8060B95520D262B057D5EEFEDEFE0CCC7593400E95B0331FA498C9DB2938A8A1F83EA2D2B877C39E3385ED7CC824E25D1C038CD344F","documentHash":"2c14198b-5ec2-4fb5-8e56-3c39acb04732"},{"objectId":"60c2fd6e9543c7233654361b","name":"Shreyas","lastName":"Kandhadai Vasantham","uuid":"15811B25B32BAB2AF93E363118C6FCA186E088431248E254546B94F5BB1E942499598E1253D19EAB9C213A849CF3F9C09258101D68DCA524209526099C39AED4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2212-9230","documentHash":"d94b3ed7-8bd6-41c4-b77c-424e57b9ff06"}],"objectId":"66ea990dfdbe836650ad453a","doi":"10.1016/j.synthmet.2024.117594","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0379677924000560?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Graphene and its derivatives in medical applications: A comprehensive review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Graphene and its variants have garnered significant attention in the scientific community due to their distinctive characteristics at the nanoscale.

Here, we have fabricated electrodes for electrolyte-based supercapacitors using mechanochemically synthesized LHPs and demonstrated that the type of starting material and dimensionality of the perovskite strongly influence the device performance. First, we have compared the electrochemical performance of electrodes obtained from the single crystalline (SCP) and mechanosynthesized (MSP) methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr3), and similar to 2 times improvement was observed in the MAPbBr3 MSP-based energy storage device due to higher average microstrain induced by ball milling, which modulates ion migration. Next, we fabricated electrodes based on mechanochemically synthesized MAPbBr3, 2D MA2PbBr4 and quasi-2D BA2MAPb2Br7, and demonstrated that the structure and ion migration could play a vital role in the overall performance of the LHP-based electrochemical supercapacitor. The areal capacitance (similar to 209 mF cm-2) and specific capacitance (similar to 138.35 F g-1) calculated at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 with the maximum power density and cycle stability were found to be highest in the 2D MA2PbBr4 perovskite-based supercapacitor. This result can be attributed to its smallest particle size, which helps to improve the interaction between electrolyte ions and the perovskite electrode interface at a lower scan rate.\nA mechanochemically synthesized family of lead halide perovskites was utilized to fabricate electrodes for electrolyte-based supercapacitors. The effect of material quality and dimensionality of the perovskite structure on the device performance and stability was thoroughly discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629eb829752340212cd272f2","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"5","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"3881-3889","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622ac2387523402df090302f","66fd35fefdbe836fcb7cace7","66fd35fefdbe836fcb7cace8","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb","629eb829752340212cd272f2","66fd35fefdbe836fcb7cace9","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb827","mniswId":"30104","title":"Materials Advances","eissn":"2633-5409","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"29cfe746-1686-4af4-a7e2-552c3e947f18"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd35fefdbe836fcb7cace6","year":"2024","volume":"5","number":"9","documentHash":"b482ab78-6bc8-4c48-a0b0-a7ba9136e0dd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059836753"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66fbdb57fdbe837a1e1aa62f","name":"Ariel","lastName":"Meyra","documentHash":"7a811b33-95bf-467e-8328-d13a8020bd51"},{"objectId":"66fbdb57fdbe837a1e1aa62e","name":"Andres","lastName":"De Virgiliis","documentHash":"7a5abcbc-4011-4817-a381-16f4e61d42fe"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","name":"Alina","lastName":"Ciach","uuid":"520AD5EF74AF15FA81FB18147E92D695E358B38A5F90389DF9A11C3C3623C0214250CFB548E34846D53DBA21ED79955D9F88250356F8AFEBD6A696B7263A658B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5556-401X","documentHash":"630645e8-c7ee-4652-a5a0-a0da6ec79d79"}],"objectId":"66fbdb57fdbe837a1e1aa62d","doi":"10.3390/molecules29071512","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/7/1512/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Lattice Model Results for Pattern Formation in a Mixture with Competing Interactions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A monolayer consisting of two types of particles, with energetically favored alternating stripes of the two components, is studied by Monte Carlo simulations and within a mesoscopic theory.

These physical quantities are determined from the FCS-measured autocorrelation function, G(t), as a function of time, t. In most of the studied cases, the analytical form of G(t) is well-known for reactions that are much faster than the diffusion time of reactants across the focal volume probed by FCS or when they are much slower than the diffusion time. Here, we develop an analytical form of G(t) for reactions occurring at an intermediate time scale comparable to the diffusion time. G(t) depends on the reaction rates in such reactions. We focus on reversibly binding a fluorescently labeled small molecule to a macromolecule in a diluted solution in thermodynamic equilibrium. Our approach allows the analysis of FCS data over a wide range of diffusion coefficients, reaction rate constants, and brightness levels of fluorescent labels. Our G(t) is valid even when the fluorescent label changes its brightness upon binding. The easy-to-implement analytical form of the autocorrelation function greatly helps experimentalists study chemical reactions, determining the equilibrium constants of reactions and the reaction rates."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afebc","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"2830-2841","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afebc","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478548","mniswId":"10444","title":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","issn":"1549-9618","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"cedfba2b-3cf9-422b-9674-7c0ec8928228"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd2752fdbe836fcb7be602","year":"2024","volume":"20","number":"7","documentHash":"e0d9d4af-5650-4bf7-bc00-41c301be6afe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059836819"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66fbb643fdbe837a1e188a33","name":"Tan-Phat","lastName":"Huynh","documentHash":"3209c466-9e3d-4ad7-a838-cd1da682445a"},{"objectId":"66fbb643fdbe837a1e188a32","name":"Mohammed","lastName":"Zniber","documentHash":"44bd957e-66c4-4165-b468-05c1c30f6617"},{"objectId":"66fbb643fdbe837a1e188a31","name":"Parastoo","lastName":"Vahdatiyekta","documentHash":"c318580e-6807-4733-9ec1-317ae6820e8b"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Nikiforow","uuid":"E166453BA6868F48895D87A86E6702843A623A59A84923A7C78B7FFBB992983C7D95FE6E5E79D29AB2127112DC3887B27E8FB1E44DE4688F1367FD5EA5783F74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6135-8514","documentHash":"c96f36f3-357e-4938-9d4c-83e71d392895"}],"objectId":"66fbb643fdbe837a1e188a2f","doi":"10.1039/d3ma01179h","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/MA/D3MA01179H","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Synthesis and characterization of <i>N,N</i>′-bis(2-thienylmethylene)-1,<i>X</i>-diaminobenzene isomers (<i>X</i> = 2, 3, 4) and their metal complexes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The synthesis of N,N '-bis(2-thienylmethylene)-1,2-diaminobenzene, N,N '-bis(2-thienylmethylene)-1,3-diaminobenzene, and N,N '-bis(2-thienylmethylene)-1,4-diaminobenzene, three isomers with the molecular formula of (C16H12N2S2) and their metal complexation with Co(ii), Fe(iii), and Ni(ii) is reported in this study.

This architectural innovation is realized through the development of a specialized material, termed dithiafulvene end-capped Spiro[fluorene-9,9 '-xanthene], denoted by the acronym AF32. In this design architecture, dithiafulvene is thoughtfully attached to the spiroxanthene fluorene core with phenothiazine as the spacer unit, possessing multiple alkyl chains. AF32 passivates interfacial defects by coordinating the sulfur constituents of the phenothiazine and dithiafulvene frameworks to the uncoordinated Pb2+ cations on the surface of the perovskite film, and the alkyl chains construct a hydrophobic environment, preventing moisture from entering the hydrophilic perovskite layer and improving the long-term stability of PSCs. Furthermore, this conductive interlayer facilitates hole transport in PSCs due to its well-aligned molecular orbital levels. Such improvements translated into an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.6% for the device employing 1.5 mg/mL AF32, and it maintained 85% of its initial PCE after more than 1800 h under ambient conditions [illumination and 45 +/- 5% relative humidity (RH)].

These are related by Laplace transform to the sum of exponential functions, stretched exponentials, Becquerel’s decay function, and others. However, the limitations of this approach have not been sufficiently discussed in the literature. In particular, the time-independent probability distributions of the rate constants or decay times are occasionally used to describe bimolecular quenching. We show that in such a case, this mathematical formalism has a clear physical interpretation only when the fluorophore and quencher molecules are immobile, as in the solid state. However, such an interpretation is no longer possible once we consider the motion of fluorophores with respect to quenchers. Therefore, for systems in which the relative motion of fluorophores and quenchers cannot be neglected, it is not appropriate to use the time-independent rate or decay time distributions to describe, fit, or rationalize experimental results on fluorescence decay."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b0046","5e70927b878c28a047396813"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"161","issue":"10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927b878c28a047396813","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0046"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffe13ad49b31ccece8769","title":"The Journal of Chemical Physics","issn":"0021-9606","eissn":"1089-7690","documentHash":"0c4d9750-ec8c-46a1-b0cd-4122820331fc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"672b5939fdbe83748a7c035c","year":"2024","volume":"161","number":"10","documentHash":"ad0e5584-cda9-479c-9193-cb0aa404bdd6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PHOTOINDUCED ELECTRON-TRANSFER","UNDERLYING DISTRIBUTIONS","MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS","FLUORESCENCE DECAY","GENERAL-PROPERTIES","DONATING SOLVENTS","KINETICS","LIQUID"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059854998"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"671784aafdbe83553de91aef","name":"Vanish","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"1e12484b-8fac-4b71-b174-4b74958ecae7"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Kutner","uuid":"4DB1E113A4C8683FB6BC69134920B86E44C946E3D21F32F5F6CE1483179976E11B16608F3E02B532633CFF5B5216E4C96C7B94090438FDEA74135F1AE4F3BCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-5170","documentHash":"71f3755a-d420-46be-bb05-d5ea4b0bfa7c"}],"objectId":"671784aafdbe83553de91aee","doi":"10.1016/j.cej.2024.155828","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1385894724073194?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Advancements and potentials of molecularly imprinted polymer-based sensors for lysozyme determination in food and clinical samples","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lysozyme determination is imperative for clinical diagnostics and food safety applications.

Promising properties can be achieved with Ni-P materials. Herein, nitric acid etching (being used for blackening of electroless Ni-P coatings) resulted in enhanced efficiency towards hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) in 1.0 M KOH. For etched Ni-7.6 wt%P coating, the potential of HER at -10 mA cm(-2) was about -0.20 V vs. RHE, and the potential of OER at 10 mA cm(-2) was about 1.67 V, whereas for etched Ni they were -0.40 V and 1.94 V, respectively. Surface layers of etched coatings contained bundles of microrods and were enriched in O and P. Impedance measurements showed that etching caused about a 60-fold increase of CPE which can be ascribed to the development of surface area and pseudocapacitance of redox reactions, involving Ni -><- NiO. It is proposed that the electroactivity of Ni-NiO composite is to a large extent associated with the oxide reduction effects, involving high activity of newborn (pristine) Ni nanoparticles, acidification at the metal surface and disclosure of bare metal. Etched Ni-P coatings can be promising for the activation of electrodes for water electrolysis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709490878c28a0473bf949"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"328","pagesFromTo":"129955","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67178618fdbe83553de94953","5e709490878c28a0473bf949"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d8b","mniswId":"13972","title":"Materials Chemistry and Physics","issn":"0254-0584","eissn":"0254-0584","websiteLink":"http://www.elsevier.com/locate/matchemphys","documentHash":"3faf2b20-40af-4e76-9bed-955b4f95f3ba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67178618fdbe83553de94952","year":"2024","volume":"328","documentHash":"2e174c87-c1a2-4858-a85b-672432c00157"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059867962"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4687","name":"Spyros N.","lastName":"Pandis","documentHash":"bf778cdd-ef88-4621-8dab-e80d360a9696"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4686","name":"Athanasios","lastName":"Nenes","documentHash":"6ba28e7b-98c1-4aac-9656-6154f2cfa320"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4685","name":"Edouard","lastName":"Bard","documentHash":"70668972-fa75-40b5-a194-68fdf31faea6"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4684","name":"Christos","lastName":"Panagiotopoulos","documentHash":"a1eee3b1-c177-41ab-a871-bc1ed8856822"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4683","name":"Thibaut","lastName":"Tuna","documentHash":"b39623dc-5b19-4d14-9ade-bec48c325900"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4682","name":"Yoann","lastName":"Fagault","documentHash":"5af99cb1-e393-4747-81e7-c9708ef11456"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4681","name":"Ksakousti","lastName":"Skyllakou","documentHash":"1b25da39-f1df-47ea-9d35-e1af58aebc29"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4680","name":"Katerina","lastName":"Seitanidi","documentHash":"29a9bd06-167c-457e-a26c-c61b70e4d22d"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467f","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Błaziak","documentHash":"116ca17d-55f8-4c47-b8d9-0b10216c867b"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467e","name":"Evangelia","lastName":"Kostenidou","documentHash":"74686b0e-0da4-43e5-ae42-e1c2d91897de"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467d","name":"David","lastName":"Patoulias","documentHash":"ec9b14e3-f033-4f00-8d92-0e3e1778262c"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467c","name":"Kalliopi","lastName":"Florou","documentHash":"21ff0ab7-06e2-4937-8cb3-1ceccb44f75c"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467b","name":"Christos","lastName":"Kaltsonoudis","documentHash":"026a304f-9c48-4c40-9b65-5cbad1ed25cf"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467a","name":"Andreas","lastName":"Aktypis","documentHash":"b02ff713-ec64-44cd-866a-771111365605"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4679","name":"Christina N.","lastName":"Vasilakopoulou","documentHash":"0ec001b9-566a-4c1f-98b0-08b07241e035"},{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4678","name":"Angeliki","lastName":"Matrali","documentHash":"e8419668-bd19-4732-ba9c-109cb15e0cd0"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Błaziak","uuid":"AEDB2ECC32F737F5077EC9208A4CE78A44A394111443167820E6EF5EA4670E5AE09D9D49AF5EAB18FB5968748B3CBACB9FA54CC956C74EBBC14197011907BBAB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9270-5304","documentHash":"b0419532-30c3-4540-9c4d-f50db1e70699"}],"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4676","doi":"10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120722","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1352231024003972?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Anthropogenic and biogenic pollutants in a forested environment: SPRUCE-22 campaign overview","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The SPRUCE-22 field campaign was conducted during July 2022 on a remote mountainous forested site in Greece to assess interactions of biogenic and anthropogenic pollutants in the Eastern Mediterranean. Particle chemical composition and size distributions along with concentrations of organic and inorganic gases were measured at high temporal resolution, while samples were collected and analyzed off-line. PM1 1 had a surprisingly high average concentration of 13 mu g m-3 consisting primarily of organics (57%), followed by sulfate (30%), ammonium (9%), and black carbon (2%). Nitrates (both inorganic and organic) were less than 1% of the PM1 1 despite the relatively high NOx x emissions in the Balkans. The PM 2.5 concentrations at this remote site were similar and even higher than those in major cities across Greece including Athens, indicating the importance of regional transport for summertime pollution in the Eastern Mediterranean. The relatively constant average diurnal profiles of major anthropogenic pollutants are consistent with only minimal effects from local sources. Sulfates are not any more the dominant component of fine PM in Greece due to the reduction of SO2 2 emissions of coal-burning powerplants. The organic aerosol (OA) was quite oxidized with an average oxygen to carbon ratio (O:C) equal to 0.83. The average concentration of isoprene was 0.6 ppb, of monoterpenes 0.5 ppb, while the biogenic secondary organic aerosol factor (obtained through source apportionment analysis) was estimated to contribute 22% of the OA. Additional biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) may be part of the two oxygenated OA (OOA) factors that were also identified. Radiocarbon analysis indicated that the non-fossil carbon was approximately equal to the sum of the biogenic and the more oxidized oxygenated OA, implying that the less oxidized OOA in this study was mostly associated to anthropogenic fossil fuel combustion. The biogenic SOA was quite aged (O:C equal to 0.63) and was also mostly transported to the site. Nearby new particle formation events occurred during 20 % of the days, with an average SO2 2 concentration of 0.3 ppb. The oxidative potential of the PM per unit of mass was quite high. The source attribution of the fine PM and the interactions among its anthropogenic and biogenic components are also discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"334","pagesFromTo":"120722","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4678","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4679","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467a","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467b","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467c","5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467d","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467e","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac467f","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4680","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4681","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4682","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4683","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4684","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4685","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4686","6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4687"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724e","mniswId":"2027","title":"Atmospheric Environment","issn":"1352-2310","documentHash":"8410b299-0ed5-4d8a-af23-45221cc3b089"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6720cab8fdbe831a48ac4677","year":"2024","volume":"334","documentHash":"2920aa88-145c-4eda-97ba-926a45596583"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059871278"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"671f8edefdbe83222c5ba943","name":"Spyros N.","lastName":"Pandis","documentHash":"d3934eb5-255c-460a-be42-c19ad36ce281"},{"objectId":"671f8edefdbe83222c5ba942","name":"Christina N.","lastName":"Vasilakopoulou","documentHash":"d448dc6b-a051-40a3-b756-2dcbd4b3f432"},{"objectId":"671f8edefdbe83222c5ba941","name":"Petro","lastName":"Uruci","documentHash":"d4686feb-bfc0-45ce-bb14-a879066e87f4"},{"objectId":"671f8edefdbe83222c5ba940","name":"Spiro","lastName":"Jorga","documentHash":"738caf4b-8df4-43f0-9687-61e85e9c8ac2"},{"objectId":"671f8edefdbe83222c5ba93f","name":"Kalliopi","lastName":"Florou","documentHash":"57a28597-2b6f-4b83-b6e2-155eb4f92db2"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Szmigielski","uuid":"8BA441832175E89B21F79F78CE35C01EAE6DA9568D355F2A4BFC7D823AB2D6D5C83D7B8E06C8BBC3896462D090D1BFEEFF6AC20665089B7B419A5802C9DAD013","orcidId":"0000-0003-3389-9318","documentHash":"b9e87d98-9f5d-4922-852b-1896bf4792e3"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Błaziak","uuid":"AEDB2ECC32F737F5077EC9208A4CE78A44A394111443167820E6EF5EA4670E5AE09D9D49AF5EAB18FB5968748B3CBACB9FA54CC956C74EBBC14197011907BBAB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9270-5304","documentHash":"b0419532-30c3-4540-9c4d-f50db1e70699"}],"objectId":"671f8edefdbe83222c5ba93d","doi":"10.1021/acsearthspacechem.4c00201","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsearthspacechem.4c00201","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Properties and Atmospheric Oxidation of Terebic Acid Aerosol","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Terebic acid (C7H10O4) is a biogenic secondary organic aerosol constituent, produced by the oxidation of first- and second-generation products of monoterpenes such as alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, and Delta(3)-carene. It is a processed derivative of terpenylic acid and has been identified in aerosol samples from terrestrial and forest environments. The physicochemical properties of pure terebic acid aerosol were characterized using two different atmospheric simulation chambers and a suite of online particle and gas-phase instrumentation. Its mass spectrum, obtained by a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer, had characteristic peaks at mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios 81, 96, 100, 115, and 143, mainly related to oxygenated fragment ions. The density of terebic acid aerosol was 1.33 +/- 0.20 g cm(-3), and its vaporization enthalpy was 85 kJ mol(-1). The estimated saturation concentration at 298 K of 2.6 +/- 1.2 mu g m(-3) places terebic acid in the semivolatile organic compound category. Oxidation of terebic acid aerosol by hydroxyl (OH) radicals resulted in a substantial reduction in organic aerosol (OA) mass concentration (up to 80%), with no significant alteration in the OA spectrum or aerosol O:C ratio, indicating negligible production of secondary OA. Gas-phase analysis detected the production of smaller compounds, such as acetone. The terebic acid oxidation products were mostly in the gas phase as fragmentation appears to dominate its reaction with OH radicals. The gas-phase reaction rate constant with OH was estimated to be 3 x 10(-12) cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"2090-2100","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["671f8edefdbe83222c5ba93f","5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","671f8edefdbe83222c5ba940","671f8edefdbe83222c5ba941","671f8edefdbe83222c5ba942","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","671f8edefdbe83222c5ba943"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b7fd","mniswId":"132","title":"ACS Earth and Space Chemistry","issn":"2472-3452","eissn":"2472-3452","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"fe13454a-00de-4eae-ad40-997f6e72c31d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"671f8edefdbe83222c5ba93e","year":"2024","volume":"8","number":"10","documentHash":"1af6b3a5-cccf-42be-a005-584094a28375"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059871826"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa5e","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Turczyniak-Surdacka","documentHash":"51e9437d-040e-4d66-b675-049cd0c107a3"},{"objectId":"672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa5d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Tomastik","documentHash":"169642a1-1a8d-4995-863c-7e7a9a1914de"},{"objectId":"672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa5c","name":"Lukas","lastName":"Vaclavek","documentHash":"0fbc8ee3-ac6f-4442-8d14-381b45ac0f52"},{"objectId":"672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa5b","name":"Libor","lastName":"Nozka","documentHash":"92c8fa6e-2d52-4854-96ad-ac025e92feb3"},{"objectId":"636f13387523405a7dd0886c","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"666C32141BE224A91192E3A8179D6DA9A7A02F551905297887440924FC723D3D58DDE412448979A35E797D899B19C933797E4E045A9A6DA3FD4B2AC1B0D9D07C","documentHash":"cfb8c097-c43b-4512-b48b-26b981ed4092"},{"objectId":"619f03387523402fabdefaec","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Michałowska","uuid":"704753DDC9ED4ED0C3EA2ED92AA59908F3D4CAB1CAA6D7535B11DB320A19B02A7A61277EDAFD6839E73BD473D173D0DC975F9884B56835891F86BBE42BB4D5B6","documentHash":"93f39bce-3730-49b7-bd9e-1c7d08c49a7a"},{"objectId":"60dda4479543c7233654463c","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ambroziak","uuid":"E28B4465CC430F2FC9B36F74A3AB1503AC9E5B992341669F4113874245451DF1EE6537AC66406925F40C4F61CBC7D02FD50EFCBAADC1CFCA08644E8AC4FBA899","orcidId":"0000-0001-8581-9119","documentHash":"b3a0e440-6cef-4a22-8004-f43305b96a85"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac852","name":"Jan","lastName":"Krajczewski","uuid":"D2D819CE90BD6EE7AF63845986425333B86BCCCC159E65944D88D8A9F6F4C6888466075F1EECB75FA0A5A97820796F931EE3EDEEFF3E81D7C7E356AD90883DB7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9629-6448","documentHash":"a82bc041-0915-4757-a0ad-829fedeb350e"}],"objectId":"672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa57","doi":"10.1007/s10853-024-10120-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10853-024-10120-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Improved SERS activity of TiN microstructures by surface modification with Au","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Over the years, numerous outstanding research groups around the world have been working tirelessly on metallic SERS substrates. Although these efforts have led to the development of various sensors and pushed the field forward, today this line of research seems saturated and exhausted. In this work, we address this issue by exploring an emerging topic in recent literature: the fabrication of high-performance TiN SERS-active structures. TiN thin film was sputtered onto pyramidal Si microstructures. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements confirmed the plasmonic properties of the TiN material above its plasma wavelength of 515 nm. The Si-TiN surface was subsequently modified with an Au layer, which was then transformed into Au nanoparticles (Au NPs) during the Rapid Thermal Annealing process. The Si-TiN-AuNPs samples exhibited the highest extinction intensity, as well as the best SERS signal intensity for the model Raman reporter molecule. Further analysis of the SERS data showed that the presence of the Au thin film only moderately increased SERS activity, while Au NPs enhanced the SERS signal by one order of magnitude. Final Si-TiN-AuNPs platforms were successfully employed for the detection of vitamin B12, demonstrating a low limit of detection (8.57 center dot 10-8 M) along with excellent point-to-point repeatability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa5e","619f03387523402fabdefaec","5e70938d878c28a0473ac852","636f13387523405a7dd0886c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60dda4479543c7233654463c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"59","issue":"36","pagesFromTo":"16918-16931","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["619f03387523402fabdefaec","636f13387523405a7dd0886c","60dda4479543c7233654463c","672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa5b","672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa5c","672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa5d","672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa5e","5e70938d878c28a0473ac852"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478852","mniswId":"11762","title":"Journal of Materials Science","issn":"0022-2461","eissn":"1573-4803","websiteLink":"http://link.springer.com/journal/10853","documentHash":"01822ac7-e7e2-44c3-9ee9-2cb3e589e7d2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"672b57d8fdbe83748a7bfa58","year":"2024","volume":"59","number":"36","documentHash":"a138364d-e41a-4e50-a6ea-70ac448cf8ec"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059890175"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673c8d07fdbe831a02100b9e","name":"Farzan","lastName":"Gity","documentHash":"8e1d9354-5767-4613-8265-0c417e876bf8"},{"objectId":"673c8d07fdbe831a02100b9d","name":"Lida","lastName":"Ansari","documentHash":"a0daf395-7629-4aa9-a2e5-aba0fd0e7c78"},{"objectId":"673c8d07fdbe831a02100b9c","name":"M.

The orbital-resolved density of states revealed that the 4f orbitals of the dopant Er atom strongly impact the electronic structure of the monolayer PtSe2 and induce spin-polarized localized states. Simultaneously, in addition to a significant increase in the PtSe2 surface energy (52-fold) due to Er doping (from 7.94 x 10-5 to 4.16 x 10-3 eV/& Aring;2), the formation energy of the Er-doped PtSe2 (-328.72 kJ/ mol) compared to the pristine PtSe2 (-326.52 kJ/mol) indicates that Er doping has made the PtSe2 system thermodynamically more stable.

Traditional methods for converting lignocellulose often suffer from challenges such as low selectivity, suboptimal yield, and high energy consumption. To address these issues, innovative approaches that blend different catalytic processes are gaining traction. One such approach is the combination of sonication with photocatalysis in continuous-flow systems. This method offers the potential to revolutionize lignocellulose valorization by enhancing process efficiency and selectivity, thus opening new pathways for producing high-value chemicals and energy sources. This paper delves into the potential of integrating sonication and photocatalysis for lignocellulose conversion within continuous-flow systems. It discusses the opportunities that arise from this synergistic approach, as well as the associated challenges, such as the need for precise control of reaction conditions and the integration of scalable technologies. Moreover, a critical review of the current state of the art in this domain is provided to highlight recent advancements and identify avenues for future exploration. This paper is particularly relevant to researchers, engineers, and professionals in chemical engineering, renewable energy, and environmental science who are focused on sustainable technologies and biomass conversion. It is also valuable for academic and industrial stakeholders seeking innovative solutions to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of biomass processing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63574a29752340623bc01cc7","5e709381878c28a0473ab62f","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"193","pagesFromTo":"206973","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63574a29752340623bc01cc7","5e709381878c28a0473ab62f","673c9307fdbe831a0211040d","673c9307fdbe831a0211040e","673c9307fdbe831a0211040f","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"6667fe4f4097076fb48835fd","title":"Applied Catalysis O: Open","issn":"2950-6492","eissn":"2950-6484","websiteLink":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-catalysis-o-open","documentHash":"0521dd92-2585-48d6-82f2-3237d1a6a2db"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673c9307fdbe831a0211040c","year":"2024","volume":"193","documentHash":"3abf1225-6716-43f3-b229-af990b4ef30e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059893059"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673de9cefdbe8321548fea0e","name":"Christian","lastName":"Holm","documentHash":"04acd6c2-6781-4217-bb44-75b158e86084"},{"objectId":"673de9cefdbe8321548fea0d","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Reinauer","documentHash":"80840df2-ca6e-41e6-920a-d828503fa4a4"},{"objectId":"5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","uuid":"4C8E231D76FA1FF9DEBFB40938EB36AF89D302A9BF4FB4483D4EB2BD2B36DFFFCE516493C98DF050048768547005AB2F2AB230D9F072ED3FD77064BDE749E112","orcidId":"0000-0003-4448-0686","documentHash":"22911df0-6857-4e43-8285-ca3bbbff21b2"}],"objectId":"673de9cefdbe8321548fea0c","doi":"10.1063/5.0226959","publicUri":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0226959/20148493/104101_1_5.0226959.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Electrolytes in conducting nanopores: Revisiting constant charge and constant potential simulations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Simulating electrolyte-electrode systems poses challenges due to the need to account for the electrode's response to ion movements in order to maintain a constant electrode potential, which slows down the simulations. To circumvent this, computationally more efficient constant charge (CC) simulations are sometimes employed. However, the accuracy of CC simulations in capturing the behavior of electrolyte-electrode systems remains unclear, especially for microporous electrodes. Herein, we consider electrolyte-filled slit nanopores and systematically analyze the in-pore ion structure and diffusivity using CC and constant potential simulations. Our results indicate that CC simulations provide comparable pore occupancies at high bulk ion densities and for highly charged pores, but they fail to accurately describe the ion structure and dynamics, particularly in quasi-2D (single-layer) pores and at low ion densities. We attribute these results to the superionic state emerging in conducting nanoconfinement and its interplay with excluded volume interactions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"161","issue":"10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673de9cefdbe8321548fea0d","5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","673de9cefdbe8321548fea0e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478544","mniswId":"10440","title":"Journal of Chemical Physics","issn":"0021-9606","eissn":"1089-7690","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"20904248-8c4b-43a4-a2cb-343564302e7f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673dea0bfdbe8321548ff159","year":"2024","volume":"161","number":"10","doi":"","documentHash":"9ee82e0b-28dd-48c9-8faa-ecf21b6b1825"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059901853"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673b37fafdbe831377a47cbf","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Faizan","documentHash":"0d79bb27-e9ff-4d2c-ae77-c52f32253553"},{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d35","name":"Huma","lastName":"Jamil","uuid":"CB5C78F9950F3DAA287C7BC85ACA153ED8C12145AED8407E00311E2037208D3D9377ED07C8A422EFAD0DE0EBD836E1A3AFED6E684981837E23EFE9680DAF0922","documentHash":"d1f31ddc-a47c-4aed-9aa7-648cbe8a0567"}],"objectId":"673b37fafdbe831377a47cbe","doi":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e35828","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2405844024118592?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Facile synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles using Nigella Sativa extract and its role as catalyst in production of bio-oil and degradation of methylene blue dye","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized using an environmentally benign biogenic approach employing an extract of kernels of Nigella Sativa (kalonji).

The assynthesized ZnO NPs were characterized using various advanced techniques i.e., UV, SEM, XRD, EDS, TGA, DSC, and FTIR spectra. UV characterization of ZnO NPs revealed a peak within the 350-400 cm- 1 range, confirming their successful formation. XRD spectra revealed that the particles possess a nano-rods and platelets structure, with an average size of 65 nm. XRD analysis revealed that the particles possess a size of 65 nm with a nano-rods and platelets structure. FTIR spectra of the ZnO NPs exhibited a peak at a wavenumber range of 500-600 cm-1. The newly fabricated ZnO NPs were utilized in a pyrolysis reaction for the production of high-yield bio-oil, resulting in a maximum yield of 65.6 % at 350 degrees C. The spectra of the bio-oil display distinct peaks at 1340 cm- 1, 2923.6 cm- 1, and 1617 cm-1, which suggest the existence of phenolic and carbonyl chemicals.

Taken together, ZnO NPs developed by eco-benign methods have the potential to be implemented as a novel catalytic system in the production of bio-oil as well as the remediation of dye-harboring industrial wastewater."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d35"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"e35828","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d35","673b37fafdbe831377a47cbf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c2a4","mniswId":"7504","title":"Heliyon","issn":"2405-8440","eissn":"2405-8440","documentHash":"05fb320b-04d9-493e-b63d-0bccbe96db8d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d1997dfdbe8378e2aedd17","year":"2024","volume":"10","number":"16","documentHash":"57a7727c-e4d0-4f12-8eee-167e2e1d2f29"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059912080"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673b2edffdbe831377a3651b","name":"Arez","lastName":"Nosratpour","documentHash":"ac923356-ce41-4c7d-9191-4df58dc2ab33"},{"objectId":"673b2edffdbe831377a3651a","name":"Karvan","lastName":"Karimizadeh","documentHash":"9a668459-27b6-4ee5-b929-897e8879cafa"},{"objectId":"673b2edffdbe831377a36519","name":"Zhilvan","lastName":"Habibi","documentHash":"fff2f50c-246d-4169-b280-e9a15d42c6f5"},{"objectId":"60c2fc239543c7233654339a","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Alipourfard","uuid":"09F87F13C145EAA33D5D3E392CC52D6627B20E2FB071920A9AC8A55B4EFE06CCFDC635D1FBCFD0C3CE2E997891A272F5A4326A19832587B921FF5E5C935B8BC5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5164-8606","documentHash":"92b7f0ed-674e-4ca5-b512-5aa90affbef8"}],"objectId":"673b2edffdbe831377a36517","doi":"10.1016/j.compeleceng.2024.109528","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0045790624004555?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Enhanced QRS detection and ECG compression using adaptive thresholding: A real-time approach for improved monitoring and diagnosis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Electrocardiograms (ECGs) heavily rely on QRS detection; however, most existing R-peak detectors face challenges due to varying QRS morphology and non-stationary signals. To address these issues, an enhanced real-time method for detecting QRS complexes and compressing ECG signals is proposed, particularly beneficial for Internet of Things (IoT) applications in biomedicine. This method integrates advanced signal processing algorithms with an adaptive threshold technique to improve accuracy and efficiency. By dynamically adjusting detection thresholds based on local ECG signal characteristics and incorporating wavelet transform and morphological operations, robust QRS detection is achieved, even in noisy environments. The suggested QRS detector has been verified using 48 ECG records from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and 15 ECG records from the BIDMC Congestive Heart Failure Database (CHF). Mean sensitivity, positive predictivity, and F1 score of 99.69 %, 99.60 %, and 99.63 %, respectively, are achieved for the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, and 99.56 %, 99.05 %, and 99.29 %, respectively, for the BIDMC-CHF - CHF database. Also, a lossless compression technique, utilizing the ECG signal's first derivative and entropy encoding, is incorporated into the architecture, eliminating complex data processing and storage requirements. Overall, this approach offers an efficient, cost-effective solution for medical signal monitoring and diagnosis on low-power hardware suitable for mobile applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"119","pagesFromTo":"109528","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673b2edffdbe831377a36519","673b2edffdbe831377a3651a","673b2edffdbe831377a3651b","60c2fc239543c7233654339a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777ac","mniswId":"4260","title":"Computers and Electrical Engineering","issn":"0045-7906","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2e895cd9-9909-4a74-8e46-ee6a43d638e5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673b2edffdbe831377a36518","year":"2024","volume":"119","documentHash":"11a79a56-3cb9-48a8-bccc-8b6bc1ca1f17"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059912411"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484e5","name":"Toheed","lastName":"Akhter","documentHash":"4f67508c-5b1d-41a0-83c3-8ec6f50a2a90"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484e4","name":"Sajid","lastName":"Mahmood","documentHash":"f61ae0ed-639a-4473-ae9a-abf84ea57b39"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484e3","name":"Shahid","lastName":"Iqbal","documentHash":"bcbb1f41-1dac-40f6-b1dc-0f1cf186bea6"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484e2","name":"Ali","lastName":"Bahadur","documentHash":"d00725d6-2b91-4bcd-b6aa-664c68dbc9f3"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484e1","name":"Nafeesa Allah","lastName":"Ditta","documentHash":"9d0f2ef2-913b-4665-b741-15f10146f711"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484e0","name":"Mohsin","lastName":"Javed","documentHash":"77f29833-814f-4670-bfa4-715710bb146d"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484df","name":"Waheed","lastName":"Al-Masry","documentHash":"4b998637-2f4c-46d5-b515-51436c5e2d6c"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484de","name":"Ammar","lastName":"Zidan","documentHash":"a3f125dc-74b6-46f3-9086-68a0fea72f8b"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484dd","name":"Asif","lastName":"Mahmood","documentHash":"312a1139-4fb1-4ad9-a976-46ac481a9142"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484dc","name":"Rabia","lastName":"Nawaz","documentHash":"f6eb79f0-42cb-48ee-a48b-c0f6b910d89f"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484db","name":"Sohail","lastName":"Nadeem","documentHash":"9ff30452-b87d-489f-8c9d-d25713f6d8e4"},{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484da","name":"Shagufta","lastName":"Rasheed","documentHash":"6582e5b9-fc3b-4be3-9890-669706c19062"},{"objectId":"6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","name":"Shumaila","lastName":"Razzaque","uuid":"261A1A977BE4EBBB10518C9A7232243A314300947F089B5F096212DB1251D7A0E00CD43D305FDC10FC626B597CB0221BA7C0E5FD5D9A0908F94649ACF2D8F675","documentHash":"285a1ffb-e5f7-47d0-ad8f-de3058e74c54"}],"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484d8","doi":"10.1016/j.molstruc.2024.139480","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022286024019951?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Revolutionizing textile wastewater treatment: Enhanced degradation of dyes using bimetallic Zinc Ferrite-GO nanocomposites","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A novel bimetallic nickel-copper doped zinc ferrite based catalyst has been synthesized using the hydrothermal method. The nano-sized bimetallic (Ni-Cu) zinc ferrites were embedded with graphene oxide (GO). The characterization of nano-sized bimetallic (Ni-Cu) zinc ferrites with graphene oxide (GO) involves a comprehensive set of analytical techniques to determine their elemental composition, structural properties, and morphological features. The prepared materials were also subjected to structural and morphological evaluation through FTIR, Raman, XRD, TGA, UV-vis spectroscopy, and SEM with EDX. The experiment for the photodegradation of the selected model pollutant dye, methylene blue was conducted using the prepared materials. This means that the present photocatalyst has a high efficiency of degrading the pollutant to a tune of 99 % within 3 h. When the amount of GO in the prepared nanocomposite was 40 %, there was the perfect result in terms of no degradation of MB. It reduced and deteriorated the degree of band gap energy of the MB dye. The photocatalyst activity was proven to be repeatable; the sample's use was again possible. A decrease in the band gap energy implies that the improved photocatalyst material becomes more efficient at absorbing light energy. This enhanced light absorption promotes the generation of electron-hole pairs, which are essential for catalytic reactions. Therefore, the reduction in band gap energy likely contributes to the catalyst's heightened ability to initiate the degradation of the MB dye, ultimately leading to more effective pollutant removal. In the future, the synthesized sample can be reused without significant loss in its catalytic efficiency, underscoring the stability and durability of the material. The current study has paramount importance for real-world applications; reliable performance over multiple cycles ensures that the catalyst remains effective in addressing pollution challenges over prolonged periods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6375aab9752340568bfffcd4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673b3909fdbe831377a484da","673b3909fdbe831377a484db","673b3909fdbe831377a484dc","6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","673b3909fdbe831377a484dd","673b3909fdbe831377a484de","673b3909fdbe831377a484df","673b3909fdbe831377a484e0","673b3909fdbe831377a484e1","673b3909fdbe831377a484e2","673b3909fdbe831377a484e3","673b3909fdbe831377a484e4","673b3909fdbe831377a484e5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788b4","mniswId":"11918","title":"Journal of Molecular Structure","issn":"0022-2860","eissn":"1872-8014","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-molecular-structure/","documentHash":"4bff2014-656e-441f-955f-ddef373955b2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673b3909fdbe831377a484d9","year":"2025","volume":"1320","documentHash":"caf60fe6-e73b-4dc0-aeb3-43bdf19e87bf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059914865"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673c9091fdbe831a0210a049","name":"Taras","lastName":"Verkholyak","documentHash":"3d3736a8-1198-4579-88bf-e3a818b43eda"},{"objectId":"673c9091fdbe831a0210a048","name":"Andrij","lastName":"Kuzmak","documentHash":"6f24bba1-b421-47e2-94e7-b9f60fb96a65"},{"objectId":"673c9091fdbe831a0210a047","name":"Ganji","lastName":"Seeta Rama Raju","documentHash":"6a3fc4c4-bfe3-4f64-81a2-f5667f084438"},{"objectId":"673c9091fdbe831a0210a046","name":"Lintymol","lastName":"Antony","documentHash":"8af4cbf5-ac3c-49f0-b9eb-b01880644a78"},{"objectId":"640bf5b8752340785443ab46","name":"Daniele","lastName":"Paolini","uuid":"821974930F2C6FCB4AD2761174188C71E28B0042DF09D8F8EBD3FD34F0D08812C187A9207554C8D3D099D8A4E8CDB3D48FDB3096360E1DD9915F10BB3A04DBC3","documentHash":"84897523-cad2-4bf1-bc9f-1288f47a90d3"},{"objectId":"5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","uuid":"4C8E231D76FA1FF9DEBFB40938EB36AF89D302A9BF4FB4483D4EB2BD2B36DFFFCE516493C98DF050048768547005AB2F2AB230D9F072ED3FD77064BDE749E112","orcidId":"0000-0003-4448-0686","documentHash":"22911df0-6857-4e43-8285-ca3bbbff21b2"}],"objectId":"673c9091fdbe831a0210a045","doi":"10.1002/celc.202400218","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/celc.202400218","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Tuning Electrode and Separator Sizes For Enhanced Performance of Electrical Double‐Layer Capacitors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An electrical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) comprises two porous electrodes sandwiching an electrolyte-permeable separator, which prevents the electrodes from short-circuiting. While previous studies have mainly focused on electrolyte and electrode properties of EDLCs, the device configuration in terms of electrode and separator sizes received less attention, with separators often simplistically modelled as infinitely large reservoirs of ions. Herein, we investigate how the relationship between electrode and separator thicknesses impacts EDLC charging. We find that the assumption of bulk reservoir holds only under specific conditions. Moreover, we identify a tradeoff between stored energy density and pressure variations within the separator, potentially jeopardizing the EDLC durability. We also explore the influence of ionic liquid additives on EDLC charging. While prior research has shown that trace amounts of uncharged additives with strong electrode affinity can significantly enhance energy storage, we observe this effect as negligible for electrodes and separators of comparable sizes. Instead, we show how to optimize EDLC performance by fine-tuning the concentration of additives and separator-to-electrode size ratio to maximize stored energy density.\nThe separator thickness in relation to the electrode thickness can significantly influence the energy storage capacity and pressure variation in electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs). These parameters, along with the electrolyte composition and concentration, can be optimized to enhance the overall performance of EDLCs. image"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["640bf5b8752340785443ab46","5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["640bf5b8752340785443ab46","673c9091fdbe831a0210a046","673c9091fdbe831a0210a047","673c9091fdbe831a0210a048","673c9091fdbe831a0210a049","5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775c0","mniswId":"3460","title":"ChemElectroChem","issn":"2196-0216","eissn":"2196-0216","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"69b4b420-d94d-4637-a792-841d1267318d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673c90b1fdbe831a0210abfd","year":"2024","volume":"11","number":"18","doi":"","documentHash":"144bfcdb-0d19-4557-afee-dc6f1a16ae91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059915461"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673c8ec5fdbe831a021050a9","name":"Pitamber","lastName":"Mahanandia","documentHash":"a930eb04-8f5d-4e78-8a74-d257bff16c31"},{"objectId":"673c8ec5fdbe831a021050a8","name":"Subhasri","lastName":"Subudhi","documentHash":"20aceb17-f8d3-4ecc-8e54-6c59a4a74d10"},{"objectId":"673c8ec5fdbe831a021050a7","name":"Alok Kumar","lastName":"Nayak","documentHash":"396704a2-1bb6-42a3-9923-45013af5d2d2"},{"objectId":"673c8ec5fdbe831a021050a6","name":"Santosini","lastName":"Patra","documentHash":"5c98d259-eca5-4591-bc90-4d455096b959"},{"objectId":"673c8ec5fdbe831a021050a5","name":"Manas Ranjan","lastName":"Sahoo","documentHash":"b9036f18-70fe-4986-b7be-becba7033a02"},{"objectId":"673c8ec5fdbe831a021050a4","name":"Injamul","lastName":"Alam","documentHash":"eecb9656-cc58-42dd-a1c8-ef7ad295ba40"},{"objectId":"673c8ec5fdbe831a021050a3","name":"Manoranjan","lastName":"Mandal","documentHash":"bfe7b95a-0846-4973-aecb-e4dbf2412400"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"}],"objectId":"673c8ec5fdbe831a021050a1","doi":"10.1016/j.cplett.2024.141536","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0009261424004780?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Simple pyrolysis synthesis of multi-walled carbon nanotubes as a highly stable electrode material for supercapacitor applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We report the preparation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by using a simple and cost-effective method for supercapacitor applications.

Therefore, it is crucial to develop an electrode material with a rational design and achieve compatibility with the electrolyte. In this study, we prepare Ni-MOF derived nickel phosphides/carbon (NP@C) nanostructure as an electrode for supercapacitor application. The as synthesized material provides more redox-active sites, better spatial utilization, improved conductivity, and a high-polarized surface that will speed up ion migration at electrode/electrolyte. Also, the usage of redox additive electrolyte (0.2 M K-3[Fe (CN)(6)] in 1 M Na2SO4) further complements the redox active sites and hence the improved charge transport. Therefore, NP@C electrode achieved a remarkable 2136.3 F/g of capacitance at 3 A/g with 90.6 % of capacitance retention after 5000 charge-discharge cycles. In addition, the surface-diffusion studies confirms that NP@C shows high diffusion contribution of 82.6 % in redox electrolyte than that of 25.1 % in 1 M Na2SO4. Furthermore, NP@C//NP@C symmetric supercapacitor device in redox additive electrolyte also delivered remarkable performance rendering high energy density of 52.5 Wh/kg at a power density of 750 W/kg. In addition, NP@C//NP@C also shows the long-term stability with attenuating only 7.2 % of initial capacitance value after 10000 charge-discharge cycles. In addition to this, the device performs extremely well when tested for self-discharge studies. Hence, this study demonstrates the perfect harmony of NP@C electrodes and redox additive electrolyte to fabricate a high-performance supercapacitor."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"102165","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673c9228fdbe831a0210bcf3","673c9228fdbe831a0210bcf4","673c9228fdbe831a0210bcf5","673c9228fdbe831a0210bcf6","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","673c9228fdbe831a0210bcf7","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc39","mniswId":"13999","title":"Materials Today Chemistry","issn":"2468-5194","eissn":"2468-5194","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"c855d6ed-5f98-42d7-80a8-9265675a9b87"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673c9228fdbe831a0210bcf2","year":"2024","volume":"39","documentHash":"c748e686-a1f8-49c9-a62f-eb2f9d4bed07"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059920385"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673c9188fdbe831a0210b3b2","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Święszkowski","documentHash":"b49103a1-101a-4766-a411-95e6216043a5"},{"objectId":"673c9188fdbe831a0210b3b1","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Heljak","documentHash":"3b22be93-273a-4647-a220-bbfb1d336866"},{"objectId":"673c9188fdbe831a0210b3b0","name":"Pasquale","lastName":"Posabella","documentHash":"64e85db2-ce12-4491-a105-1f1865715dc0"},{"objectId":"5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","name":"Marco","lastName":"Costantini","uuid":"39AF91D3BD887DDA9D7064C2EEA4EC3EA3433737B56F1680E3899FD57F4B56CF80C6CBF0037AABC256FFEBAA40368FC799B344097649E00467A4677CD64AE0F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2756-5872","documentHash":"cb8eda43-6975-486d-98a0-48f4cabbf744"}],"objectId":"673c9188fdbe831a0210b3ae","doi":"10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2024.109636","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0020740324006775?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Spherical-based porous architectures: In silico design and validation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Porous (or cellular) materials, like wood and bones, are abundantly found in nature for structural purposes. Thanks to the advancements of evolving technologies, the fabrication of intricate cellular structures was possible. Notably, functionally graded porous structures offer superior mechanical and physical properties compared to their uniform counterparts. Additive manufacturing, especially light-based 3D printing (3DP) technologies, has significantly augmented the production of such materials thanks to their high speed, resolution, and costefficiency. However, selecting the most suitable porous architecture for one's necessities remains challenging, requiring an optimised workflow supporting 3DP methods with in silico tools to predict the functional properties of the developed porous architecture. This study introduces a preliminary step toward this workflow, involving in silico design and mechanical validation of porous architectures manufactured via low-force stereolithography 3DP. The work proposes for the first time spherical-based functionally graded porous geometries, filling the existing gap in the literature. The proposed structures, categorised upon their pore size, porosity, and pore size gradients, demonstrate potential applications in the biomedical field (e.g., tissue engineering scaffolds and soft bioreactor systems) and outperform other existing porous architectures in terms of energy absorption capabilities. These findings lay the foundation for further workflow optimisation.

The sulfur-iodine thermochemical cycle has high commercial potential in conducting hydrogen iodide (HI) splitting for H2 generation, but it requires high-temperature conditions. In comparison, photocatalytic HI splitting of halide perovskites is non-polluted and low-cost for H2 production at room temperature. Herein, an in situ constructed multidimensional bismuth (Bi)-based 3D/2D EDABiI5/MA3Bi2I9 perovskite heterojunction is developed first by synergistically integrating dimensionality control with heterostructure engineering. Accordingly, the optimal EDABiI5/MA3Bi2I9 without any co-catalysts exhibits the H2 evolution rate of 213.63 mu mol h-1g-1 under irradiation. Equally importantly, interfacial dynamics of solid/solid and solid/liquid interfaces play a crucial role in photocatalytic performance. Therefore, using temperature-dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques, it is confirmed that the exciton transportation of EDABiI5/MA3Bi2I9 is accelerated by stronger electronic coupling arising from an enhanced overlap of electronic wavefunctions. Moreover, the effective diffusion coefficient and electron transfer rate of EDABiI5/MA3Bi2I9 demonstrate efficient heterogeneous electron transfer, resulting in improved photocatalytic hydrogen production. Consequently, the in situ formation of perovskite heterostructures studied by a combination of photophysical and electrochemical techniques provides new insights into green hydrogen evolution and interfacial interaction dynamics for commercial applications of solar-to-fuel technology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"43","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673ded2bfdbe832154903754","673ded2bfdbe832154903755","673ded2bfdbe832154903756","673ded2bfdbe832154903757","673ded2bfdbe832154903758","673ded2bfdbe832154903759","673ded2bfdbe83215490375a","673ded2bfdbe83215490375b","673ded2bfdbe83215490375c","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","673ded2bfdbe83215490375d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e81","mniswId":"424","title":"Advanced Energy Materials","issn":"1614-6832","documentHash":"168e1998-d664-47c7-baba-a926fd45c7c5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673ded2bfdbe832154903753","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"43","documentHash":"9bef804c-2819-4817-8f31-9fff95845867"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059923769"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673eff5cfdbe834f4e0dfb1a","name":"Kim E.","lastName":"Stansfield","documentHash":"016c3fd9-9850-4db8-b399-45a306d1f7f1"},{"objectId":"673eff5cfdbe834f4e0dfb19","name":"Damian","lastName":"Kasperczyk","documentHash":"9f0f328a-641a-4615-88d2-61a97c5544c6"},{"objectId":"673eff5cfdbe834f4e0dfb18","name":"Marieth","lastName":"Baquero-Almazo","documentHash":"5d4325ad-9968-4229-813a-f3169232957f"},{"objectId":"673eff5cfdbe834f4e0dfb17","name":"Ramón Fernando","lastName":"Colmenares-Quintero","documentHash":"bc4d213f-a8a4-410a-b7e6-792ffccef69a"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"objectId":"673eff5cfdbe834f4e0dfb15","doi":"10.1016/j.clet.2024.100783","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2666790824000636?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Analysis of IoT technologies suitable for remote areas in Colombia: Conceptual design of an IoT system for monitoring and managing distributed energy systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study presents a conceptual design of an Internet of Things (IoT) communication system for monitoring power generation systems in Colombian Non-Interconnected Zones (NIZs), which lack IoT connectivity due to complex geographical factors.

The study also analyses and compares various technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, LoRa and ZigBee, to determine which ones are best suited for IoT system design. The conceptual design of the proposed IoT monitoring system considers the geographical, communication and coverage characteristics of the NIZs and the technical characteristics of the energy projects to provide a complete functional system that can connect approximately 2 million people located in these isolated and vulnerable zones. Finally, the defined system can serve as a precedent for building prototypes in various NIZs, and research on IoT technologies suitable for NIZs can help us seek the technologies that are most suitable for these areas. Depending on the application and conditions of the energy project, the most appropriate technology can be determined on a case-by-case basis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"100783","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673eff5cfdbe834f4e0dfb17","673eff5cfdbe834f4e0dfb18","673eff5cfdbe834f4e0dfb19","673eff5cfdbe834f4e0dfb1a","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"64f04bf6cf9a7471b0ea3b97","mniswId":"30622","title":"Cleaner Engineering and Technology","eissn":"2666-7908","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2f37b375-64b5-42c2-b271-122d700a2dfc"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059923945"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646c252a40e3ff6728fba498","name":"Aimen","lastName":"Waqar","uuid":"9E7D07746C9455D69CACD8060B95520D262B057D5EEFEDEFE0CCC7593400E95B0331FA498C9DB2938A8A1F83EA2D2B877C39E3385ED7CC824E25D1C038CD344F","documentHash":"2c14198b-5ec2-4fb5-8e56-3c39acb04732"},{"objectId":"6375aab9752340568bfffcd4","name":"Shumaila","lastName":"Razzaque","uuid":"261A1A977BE4EBBB10518C9A7232243A314300947F089B5F096212DB1251D7A0E00CD43D305FDC10FC626B597CB0221BA7C0E5FD5D9A0908F94649ACF2D8F675","documentHash":"285a1ffb-e5f7-47d0-ad8f-de3058e74c54"},{"objectId":"6243c0a87523402df099a303","name":"Alla","lastName":"Dyachenko","uuid":"5111AF0AEDD620451C94AF513B6855E490D9FBF95139304CEEBBF517F410035CE340D3116A01780FA85C4DC516C293948075B1F141F97D5093C36EDB3832353C","documentHash":"da609206-2ab6-4dbc-81b4-db000a4ef5a1"},{"objectId":"60c2fd859543c723365436a5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dusiło","uuid":"39B0D6E76B70F7168320D3265772A117770C2B5094291BC4EA306A9CA945B941AF71218E83FCFC84B062457F9179CCBFE65929F7499EE4F418051CF43D52C54C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6847-063X","documentHash":"c03e16a4-90ad-4d2d-aa48-130a48f446e8"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Opałło","uuid":"ECB569ECB4125066F1DCDB9F48064E76F971F64BACACA1AFD7DBBBE80107D088337CBD1844ADDF79163AEED6F4FB8E817D076BC1662EF431F114EA1356D7929A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5872-7059","documentHash":"71cabfc4-5832-4f70-97cb-7c9b9abea0ef"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"673deb4efdbe832154901bef","doi":"10.1016/j.elecom.2024.107800","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1388248124001437?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction at non-metalated and pyrolysis free hypercrosslinked polymers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Oxygen reduction is one of the core steps of non-emissive zero carbon energy conversion.

In this review, state-of-the-art nanoscale electrocatalysts for water electrolysis and photocatalysts for water splitting, tailored for different reaction environments, including acidic electrolytes, alkaline electrolytes, pure water, seawater, and hydrohalic acids, are systematically presented. In particular, modification approaches such as doping, morphology control, heterojunction/homojunction construction, as well as the integration of cocatalysts and single atoms for efficient charge transfer and separation are examined. Furthermore, the unique properties of these upgraded catalysts and the mechanisms of promoted H2 production are also analyzed by elucidating the charge carrier dynamics revealed by photophysical and photoelectrochemical characterization methods.

In this work, for the first time the effect of aging the typical n-i-p PSCs employing nickel phthalocyanine (coded as Bis-PF-Ni) solely as dopant-free HTM is investigated and as an additive in spiro-OMeTAD solution. This study reveals that the prolong aging of these devices at dry air condition (RH = 2%, 25 degrees C) is beneficial for the improvement of their performances. Various bulk and surface characterization techniques are utilized to understand the factors behind the spontaneous efficiency enhancement of the devices after storage. As a result, the changes in properties of the Bis-PF-Ni layer are observed and at perovskite/Bis-PF-Ni interface, which ultimately improves the charge transport and reduces non-radiative recombination. In addition, the devices with Bis-PF-Ni HTM reveal enhanced long-term ambient and thermal stability compared to the PSCs based on doped spiro-OMeTAD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c301819543c723365439a6","629eb829752340212cd272f2","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"41","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d33","673ef34afdbe834f4e0cb9a8","622ac2387523402df090302f","629eb829752340212cd272f2","60c301819543c723365439a6","673ef34afdbe834f4e0cb9a9","673ef34afdbe834f4e0cb9aa","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","673ef34afdbe834f4e0cb9ab","673ef34afdbe834f4e0cb9ac","673ef34afdbe834f4e0cb9ad","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e8d","mniswId":"441","title":"Advanced Science","issn":"2198-3844","eissn":"2198-3844","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"29029c47-00ae-42e6-841c-76a199a9cb73"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673ef34afdbe834f4e0cb9a7","year":"2024","volume":"11","number":"41","documentHash":"85440a1c-5eb3-49fc-a736-082a0a513566"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059924043"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673f1072fdbe834f4e10880d","name":"Irene","lastName":"Carra","documentHash":"080746d1-27bf-4e05-b434-b4727a412b82"},{"objectId":"673f1072fdbe834f4e10880c","name":"Ilenia","lastName":"Rossetti","documentHash":"b567bf97-d8f6-46ca-8cf1-d2cc94919f8f"},{"objectId":"673f1072fdbe834f4e10880b","name":"Hanggara","lastName":"Sudrajat","documentHash":"e3969504-c2a4-4fa4-a1b1-0d0ebf7ef1e7"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"objectId":"673f1072fdbe834f4e108809","doi":"10.1016/j.coche.2024.101043","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2211339824000443?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Piezocatalytic reduction: an emerging research direction with bright prospects","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Catalytic reduction represents a promising avenue for addressing some of the most pressing challenges in energy and environmental research.

The gut microbiota has been implicated in the etiology of ASD due to its impact on the bidirectional communication pathway known as the gut-brain axis. However, the precise involvement of the gut microbiota in the causation of ASD is unclear. This study critically examines recent evidence to rationalize a probable mechanism in which gut microbiota symbiosis can induce neuroinflammation through intermediator cytokines and metabolites. To develop ASD, loss of the integrity of the intestinal barrier, activation of microglia, and dysregulation of neurotransmitters are caused by neural inflammatory factors. It has emphasized the potential role of neuroinflammatory intermediates linked to gut microbiota alterations in individuals with ASD. Specifically, cytokines like brain-derived neurotrophic factor, calprotectin, eotaxin, and some metabolites and microRNAs have been considered etiological biomarkers. We have also overviewed how probiotic trials may be used as a therapeutic strategy in ASD to reestablish a healthy balance in the gut microbiota. Evidence indicates neuroinflammation induced by dysregulated gut microbiota in ASD, yet there is little clarity based on analysis of the circulating immune profile. It deems the repair of microbiota load would lower inflammatory chaos in the GI tract, correct neuroinflammatory mediators, and modulate the neurotransmitters to attenuate autism. The interaction between the gut and the brain, along with alterations in microbiota and neuroinflammatory biomarkers, serves as a foundational background for understanding the etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673f2984fdbe834f4e12b13e","673f2984fdbe834f4e12b13f","673f2984fdbe834f4e12b140","673f2984fdbe834f4e12b141","673f2984fdbe834f4e12b142","673f2984fdbe834f4e12b143","673f2984fdbe834f4e12b144","673f2984fdbe834f4e12b145","60c2fc239543c7233654339a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780bd","mniswId":"8287","title":"Inflammation","issn":"0360-3997","eissn":"1573-2576","documentHash":"451b6a08-f1e2-4259-ab43-941ac155450b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673f2984fdbe834f4e12b13d","year":"2024","documentHash":"e0c6a9e9-72e9-436c-8f0e-a50e1eefa4be"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059924221"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7cb","name":"Subha","lastName":"Sadhu","documentHash":"ff6d0f59-97a9-4c88-9e90-19409f6e7590"},{"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7ca","name":"Daya Shankar","lastName":"Pandey","documentHash":"57c7590c-b187-4773-8f2a-deb6338bf10f"},{"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c9","name":"Kazunari","lastName":"Domen","documentHash":"c54dd348-c15b-4427-a255-fafd8c8ee0e4"},{"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c8","name":"Balendu Sekhar","lastName":"Giri","documentHash":"a48713f3-6627-48ca-9f39-2dbb5574b63a"},{"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c7","name":"Mamiko","lastName":"Nakabayashi","documentHash":"11ed2bdc-610a-43d6-ad0d-c33ec0f51f87"},{"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c6","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Pihosh","documentHash":"d7cc8551-5590-4f98-997e-e6b784df5b47"},{"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c5","name":"Vivek Kumar","lastName":"Agrahari","documentHash":"d81fd2c8-e13e-4e26-81d9-9a040e4a1239"},{"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c4","name":"Ankur","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"da11bfec-383f-4333-9fa9-b8d1fa00a368"},{"objectId":"605d60749543c745d80e5a65","name":"Bhavana","lastName":"Gupta","uuid":"AC6B32A259B1EED07E7B7D122C124FA2584D1B82B4F45CC0C27768ECDC0E45D999F07DF9B0C583C66EC6E7ED36C4346B55C7FD0A32759764560A404DBD4DC401","orcidId":"0000-0001-9426-8750","documentHash":"fb539681-d025-47b3-a615-41ecb8bac193"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"}],"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c2","doi":"10.1039/d4na00479e","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/NA/D4NA00479E","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Impact of polymorphism <i>vs.</i> shape of titania nanocrystals on the hydrogen evolution reaction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Herein, we investigated the impact of polymorphism vs. dimension control of titania nanocrystals towards hydrogen generation. Two different forms of titania nanoparticles have been synthesized following the solvothermal method, leading to the formation of two distinct physicochemical features. Detailed structural, morphological, and optical studies revealed that the formation of titania nanorods correspond to rutile while granular particles correspond to the anatase phase. Among various titania polymorphs, anatase is well known for its superior photocatalytic activity; however, to our surprise, the as-synthesized rutile nanorods exhibited higher catalytic activity in comparison to anatase spheres, and hydrogen evolution was considerably enhanced after the addition of a minute amount of Pt as the co-catalyst. Thus, despite the higher catalytic activity of anatase, the enhanced hydrogen evolution of rutile nanorods may be related to the creation of a 1D structure. Our study highlights the importance of considering not only TiO2 polymorphism but also shape and dimension in optimizing photocatalytic H-2 production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","605d60749543c745d80e5a65"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"5636-5645","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c4","673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c5","673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c6","673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c7","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c8","673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c9","673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7ca","605d60749543c745d80e5a65","673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7cb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f137","mniswId":"27874","title":"Nanoscale Advances","issn":"2516-0230","eissn":"2516-0230","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"570db27f-5279-4051-a072-5b0db028519c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673ef254fdbe834f4e0ca7c3","year":"2024","volume":"6","number":"22","documentHash":"ef9747fc-1fc4-4e17-8fef-e1558fdc6bb7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059924233"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673f0f09fdbe834f4e0fdfad","name":"Ammu","lastName":"Rosin Jose","documentHash":"b18cd3cb-727f-4a26-8f79-d2b3065d6248"},{"objectId":"673f0f09fdbe834f4e0fdfac","name":"Cristina E.","lastName":"Tiangco","documentHash":"cae4e663-64e9-4ff9-bcea-d0217e3e789d"},{"objectId":"673f0f09fdbe834f4e0fdfab","name":"Lorico DS.","lastName":"Lapitan","documentHash":"6be49ffa-2762-4c78-bcf9-2402b007e3ef"},{"objectId":"602e20fd9543c7410626ecf2","name":"Bren","lastName":"Felisilda","uuid":"D6AF817E0DBD338E2838DCCD0B92682EFBCFDD4712B5BF3BA370D68449B220F063C9F28BD1AA2BF193D40E01EC9A63388B1EB72050333E920E680026705CE075","orcidId":"0000-0002-1340-902X","documentHash":"48c64289-d91f-4d53-80d5-417d974c3638"}],"objectId":"673f0f09fdbe834f4e0fdfa9","doi":"10.1002/asia.202400090","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asia.202400090","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Advances in Bioreceptor Layer Engineering in Nanomaterial‐based Sensing of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and its Metabolites","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a pathogen that infects wounds and burns and causes severe infections in immunocompromised humans. The high virulence, the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains, and the easy transmissibility of P. aeruginosa necessitate its fast detection and control. The gold standard for detecting P. aeruginosa, the plate culture method, though reliable, takes several days to complete. Therefore, developing accurate, rapid, and easy-to-use diagnostic tools for P. aeruginosa is highly desirable. Nanomaterial-based biosensors are at the forefront of detecting P. aeruginosa and its secondary metabolites. This review summarises the biorecognition elements, biomarkers, immobilisation strategies, and current state-of-the-art biosensors for P. aeruginosa. The review highlights the underlying principles of bioreceptor layer engineering and the design of optical, electrochemical, mass-based, and thermal biosensors based on nanomaterials. The advantages and disadvantages of these biosensors and their future point-of-care applications are also discussed. This review outlines significant advancements in biosensors and sensors for detecting P. aeruginosa and its metabolites. Research efforts have identified biorecognition elements specific and selective towards P. aeruginosa. The stability, ease of preparation, cost-effectiveness, and integration of these biorecognition elements onto transducers are pivotal for their application in biosensors and sensors. At the same time, when developing sensors for clinically significant analytes such as P. aeruginosa, virulence factors need to be addressed, such as the sensor's sensitivity, reliability, and response time in samples obtained from patients. The point-of-care applicability of the developed sensor may be an added advantage since it enables onsite determination. In this context, optical methods developed for P. aeruginosa offer promising potential."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e20fd9543c7410626ecf2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673f0f09fdbe834f4e0fdfab","602e20fd9543c7410626ecf2","673f0f09fdbe834f4e0fdfac","673f0f09fdbe834f4e0fdfad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f2","mniswId":"3514","title":"Chemistry-An Asian Journal","doi":"10.1002/asia","issn":"1861-4728","eissn":"1861-471X","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1861-471X","documentHash":"c21876db-39b9-4f05-957c-ae2fb92baee6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673f0f09fdbe834f4e0fdfaa","year":"2024","documentHash":"c5fabff1-608b-4cef-a4f3-6dd1213be2f5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059924294"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f51c5c1752340073806a906","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kochman","uuid":"22C16E55321372BBEF58FCBADF8A0A14C565F80F31D6884468A7838112F1AED17FF8F6ECC7574B860680F4FB85CA5D7A8A5160E1A187C8EE2968C7660C489536","orcidId":"0000-0003-2552-9464","documentHash":"a0eedb93-4c63-4fc5-a396-aefeb1288111"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"673f1190fdbe834f4e10cd3b","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpca.4c03693","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpca.4c03693","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Nonadiabatic Molecular Dynamics Simulations Provide Evidence for Coexistence of Planar and Nonplanar Intramolecular Charge Transfer Structures in Fluorazene","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fluorazene is a model compound for photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between aromatic moieties. Despite intensive studies, both spectroscopic and theoretical, a complete model of its photophysics is still lacking. Especially controversial is the geometry of its ICT structure, or structures. In order to fill in the gaps in the state of knowledge on this important model system, in the present study I report the results of nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations of its photorelaxation process in acetonitrile solution. To afford a direct comparison to spectroscopic data, I use the simulation results as the basis for the calculation of the transient absorption (TA) spectrum. The NAMD simulations provide detailed information on the sequence of events during the excited-state relaxation of the title compound. Following initial photoexcitation into the bright S2 state, the molecule undergoes rapid internal conversion into the S1 state, leading to the locally excited (LE) structure. The LE structure, in turn, undergoes isomerization into a population of ICT structures, with geometries ranging from near-planar to markedly nonplanar. The LE -> ICT isomerization reaction is accompanied by the decay of the characteristic excited-state absorption band of the LE structure near 2 eV. The anomalous fluorescence emission band of fluorazene is found to originate mainly from the near-planar ICT structures, in part because they dominate the overall population of ICT structures. Thus, the planar ICT (PICT) model appears to be the most appropriate description of the geometry of the ICT structure of fluorazene."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f51c5c1752340073806a906"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"128","issue":"32","pagesFromTo":"6685-6694","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f51c5c1752340073806a906"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec0033bad49b31cced6faec","title":"The Journal of Physical Chemistry.

Through chemical depolymerization, recycled terephthalic acids (BDCs) obtained from PET waste were coordinated with copper (Cu) and nickel (Ni) to prepare a bimetallic Ni/Cu-MOF. After exploring various Ni:Cu ratios (1:3, 2:3, and 3:3), we determined that the 2:3 ratio represents the optimal metal combination (degradation efficiency 50-60% under direct sunlight). Subsequently, we integrated bismuth oxyiodide (BiOI) into the Ni/Cu-BDC MOF, yielding Ni/Cu-MOF@BiOI heterostructures. Thorough structural characterization via scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction confirmed the morphology and composition of the prepared materials. Assessing the photocatalytic performance against methylene blue (MB) degradation in water under solar irradiation, we systematically analyzed operational parameters such as pH, catalyst dosage, MB concentration, and irradiation time.

This straightforward methodology has exhibited captivating advancements in the kinetics of crystallization as well as the optoelectronic characteristics of the resulting perovskite films. These developments hold the promise of enhancing not only the quality and uniformity of the films but also aspects such as band alignment and the efficacy of charge transfer mechanisms. Calculation results corroborate that the incorporation of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate (BmimSCN) led to a significant redistribution of electron state density and enhanced electron-donating properties, indicating a substantial electron transfer between the perovskite material and the IL. Notably, the engineered devices demonstrate a remarkable efficiency surpassing 15%, a substantial enhancement attributed to the synergistic effects of the SCN- ion. Additionally, this approach offers inherent stability benefits, thereby addressing a significant challenge in I-PSC technology. This IL maintains >90% of the initial efficiency after 600 h, while the control device decreased to <20% of its initial value after only 100 h. 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BmimI) is also employed to further investigate the effects of SCN- ions on device performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"44","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6746f7c4fdbe832bc28afd04","6746f7c4fdbe832bc28afd05","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d33","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","6746f7c4fdbe832bc28afd06","6746f7c4fdbe832bc28afd07","6746f7c4fdbe832bc28afd08"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547974a","mniswId":"18530","title":"Small","issn":"1613-6810","eissn":"1613-6829","documentHash":"3e68ff9d-6bb3-472f-be74-ea8ba387fc87"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6746f7c4fdbe832bc28afd03","year":"2024","volume":"20","number":"44","documentHash":"ac609cf9-e59e-4a44-99b8-1aead22fb6a0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059935947"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb067","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Żuk","uuid":"A2CF96DA8DBC0F0EC756C6ABC4425D960DE3CE0ABBAA543C816DF4A24FDC838930FFB8FDCE1B3C5232CB0C3FD9D93CDDF5F6336061F13F18AC43F6C77E9DD4F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0555-5913","documentHash":"323764fb-47c8-4632-b36c-1a2615cfd8d2"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Giżyński","uuid":"7AEDD73DD5B1257841075AC646D7AF5FC2472AC6E46D6B167FA3D962FDEFA3E257CD7B398C64DC6A04810369674D2DCA9ABA0C97270D398AA0B697F0E2F788ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-3547-1174","documentHash":"1424e1a0-06b3-460a-9b83-8855874b6421"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maciołek","uuid":"E3E9BCC7397B929B2C469D73E68AE44FB2E6F4892A7DC44C238F904FE76F9D470FD528254865B02108CA8B9311A7A421914ADC30598B3516CDD6CB7BF0F07C81","orcidId":"0000-0002-2371-4183","documentHash":"d2f0a437-c8a3-4dc0-9358-3f2e9c4648e4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","name":"Karol","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"30216860D4FCF71F80CCF2F14F9FA6358B5A0632271ACE53CD62EC8265F97928E335571E5A301CC0BA9C252A21169DB64AF4E27EC652B74805AD01BFF7BDF4DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9769-7646","documentHash":"3ea17df7-ffc6-4937-bb72-a24f676f97e3"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hołyst","uuid":"E92F295C3CC2CB6B18C450B2AB735CDA75E1B176DB096D3C43CB9E6E23F05E2B3448297032B471C71265740E595D30DAA6BA0B89CC0DB4589E73DB45075B7008","orcidId":"0000-0002-3211-4286","documentHash":"cbe7625d-9b95-4888-b28d-a8e3f921d07f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"673de956fdbe8321548fd640","doi":"10.3390/e26080713","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/26/8/713/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Direction of Spontaneous Processes in Non-Equilibrium Systems with Movable/Permeable Internal Walls","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider three different systems in a heat flow: an ideal gas, a van der Waals gas, and a binary mixture of ideal gases. We divide each system internally into two subsystems by a movable wall. We show that the direction of the motion of the wall, after release, under constant boundary conditions, is determined by the same inequality as in equilibrium thermodynamics d𝑈−đ𝑄≤0. The only difference between the equilibrium and non-equilibrium laws is the dependence of the net heat change, đ𝑄, on the state parameters of the system. We show that the same inequality is valid when introducing the gravitational field in the case of both the ideal gas and the van der Waals gas in the heat flow. It remains true when we consider a thick wall permeable to gas particles and derive Archimedes’ principle in the heat flow. Finally, we consider the Couette (shear) flow of the ideal gas. In this system, the direction of the motion of the internal wall follows from the inequality d𝐸−đ𝑄−đ𝑊𝑠≤0, where d𝐸 is the infinitesimal change in total energy (internal plus kinetic) and đ𝑊𝑠\n is the infinitesimal work exchanged with the environment due to the shear force imposed on the flowing gas.

The Stokes–Sutherland–Einstein relation for the translational diffusion coefficient, DT, agrees with experiments done in simple fluids but fails for complex fluids. Moreover, the interdependence between DT and rotational diffusion coefficient, DR, also deviates in complex fluids from the classical relation of DT/DR = 4r2/3 known in simple fluids. Makuch et al. Soft Matter, 2020, 16, 114–124 presented a generalization of the classical translational and rotational diffusion theory for complex fluids. In this work, we empirically verify this model based on simultaneous translational and rotational diffusion measurements.

The interfaces amidst the absorber layer and the hole transport layer (HTL) pose challenges related to ineffective charge extraction and charge recombination, necessitating enhancement. Spiro-OMeTAD is commonly utilized as p-type material in the HTL of planar architecture, entailing the inclusion of diverse additives to enhance solar cell efficiency, which can restrict device performance and stability. Herein, we explore the influence of a discotic liquid crystalline (DLCs) based semiconductor, a heteroatom bay-annulated perylene bisimide (PBI-SeO10), which is derived from tri-n-alkoxy anilines. Our study examines the function of PBI-SeO10 as an interfacial passivation layer within the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface, assessing its effects on both device performance and stability. Our results indicate that integrating PBI-SeO10 as a surface passivation layer not only aids in effective hole extraction from the perovskite layer but also substantially diminishes defects, leading to an improvement in overall device performance by approximately 7 %. Furthermore, PBI-SeO10 passivation also reduces ionic/molecular species diffusion into the device and provides good moisture resistivity leading to improved device stability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629eb829752340212cd272f2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"278","pagesFromTo":"112762","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673f017cfdbe834f4e0e8d53","673f017cfdbe834f4e0e8d54","673f017cfdbe834f4e0e8d55","673f017cfdbe834f4e0e8d56","629eb829752340212cd272f2","673f017cfdbe834f4e0e8d57","673f017cfdbe834f4e0e8d58","673f017cfdbe834f4e0e8d59"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797b1","mniswId":"18687","title":"SOLAR ENERGY","issn":"0038-092X","documentHash":"91426551-fcbb-44cd-8605-5b1d30cea18b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673f017cfdbe834f4e0e8d52","year":"2024","volume":"278","documentHash":"171afa48-7d5c-42ae-b886-17164bf3efbe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059939157"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673f3075fdbe834f4e13099a","name":"Mikaela","lastName":"Görlin","documentHash":"2ed3ab5d-7c67-4f48-9ecd-16c4bbdb45e5"},{"objectId":"673f3075fdbe834f4e130999","name":"Carl-Johan","lastName":"Wallentin","documentHash":"9eaa6e54-8916-4545-bd6d-79876a1026aa"},{"objectId":"673f3075fdbe834f4e130998","name":"Peter","lastName":"Broqvist","documentHash":"4d9d282d-0586-483e-ab64-a4a421970f28"},{"objectId":"673f3075fdbe834f4e130997","name":"Yeersen","lastName":"Patehebieke","documentHash":"93e8be92-0eb4-4552-b6f2-8e246098084f"},{"objectId":"673f3075fdbe834f4e130996","name":"Robert","lastName":"Bericat-Vadell","documentHash":"243f823a-63ff-4b6e-a857-8e7b51649026"},{"objectId":"673f3075fdbe834f4e130995","name":"Pandiaraj","lastName":"Sekar","documentHash":"d7b8baec-3220-405c-8b9c-ffb6c5c5ce72"},{"objectId":"622036397523402df08c206c","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sa","uuid":"87182E2E0888DA41C757B81B2143E2316665900AFDCDE55D96C088AFA76BAFB6A4F1AA06C4EDA6BD452B1F53C7A1CCDD6A3E7FE74E2E496F4852B0410671F4C6","documentHash":"b4c2efbd-ab85-495c-833b-083d3a9f0f35"}],"objectId":"673f3075fdbe834f4e130993","doi":"10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c01803","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c01803","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Decoupling Plasmonic Hot Carrier from Thermal Catalysis via Electrode Engineering","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Increased attention has been directed toward generating nonequilibrium hot carriers resulting from the decay of collective electronic oscillations on metal known as surface plasmons. Despite numerous experimental endeavors, demonstrating hot carrier-mediated photocatalysis without a heating contribution has proven challenging, particularly for single electron transfer reactions where the thermal contribution is generally detrimental. An innovative engineering solution is proposed to enable single electron transfer reactions with plasmonics. It consists of a photoelectrode designed as an energy filter and photocatalysis performed with light function modulation instead of continuously. The photoelectrode, consisting of FTO/TiO2 amorphous (10 nm)/Au nanoparticles, with TiO2 acting as a step-shape energy filter to enhance hot electron extraction and charge-separated state lifetime.

Recent advancements in MXenes have focused on improving their synthesis methods, characterization techniques, processing, new MXenes materials, novel applications, and properties. One of the main challenges in MXene synthesis is scalability. Our review studies have demonstrated high-throughput and scalable methods for synthesizing MXenes, including microwave-assisted, molten salt etching, and hydrothermal methods. Researchers have successfully synthesized MXenes with different transition metals (V, Nb, Mo, W, and Hf) and surface functional groups, such as Mo2TiC2Tx, V2CTx, and Nb2CTx, with acceptable properties. Also, some new studies have been carried out about the surface modification of MXenes with organic molecules, polymers, or nanoparticles that can improve their mechanical, electrical, and optical properties. Recent study trends show that most research in this field in the future will focus on improving the properties of these materials by concentrating on new compositions and the most sustainable and cost-effective synthesis method.

Since its early stages, IPF may be asymptomatic, leading to a delayed diagnosis. The present review critically examines the recent literature on molecular biomarkers potentially useful in IPF diagnostics. The examined biomarkers are grouped into breath and sputum biomarkers, serologically assessed extracellular matrix neoepitope markers, and oxidative stress biomarkers in lung tissue. Fibroblasts and complete blood count have also gained recent interest in that respect. Although several biomarker candidates have been profiled, there has yet to be a single biomarker that proved specific to the IPF disease.

The impressive amount of success\nthat has been made with NMR has been possible because an enormous effort has been\nexpended to improve the low level of NMR sensitivity. However, the issue of low\nNMR sensitivity is still a serious problem, and NMR still cannot be utilized in many\nimportant cases where the concentrations of NMR active species are low-this is why\nthe boosting of the NMR signal is currently one of the most important research fields\nin the NMR area. Here, the problem of low NMR sensitivity is discussed through the\npresentation of methodologies aimed at increasing NMR sensitivity and their novel\napplications. First, a short general overview of the NMR and its sensitivity problem\nwill be presented. Having clearly identified the problem, the main technologies that\nwill be utilized for the improvement of NMR sensitivity will be introduced. First, we\nwill concisely, and with appropriate references, present methodologies that can\nincrease NMR sensitivity via the design of novel superconducting magnets, the\napplication of cryotechnology for the design of noiseless probe heads, and other\nhardware and software approaches. Next, the most promising and powerful method\nfor NMR signal enhancement which is known as hyperpolarization will be discussed.\nFirst, noble gas hyperpolarization and CIDNP will be briefly presented. We will\ndescribe the basic mechanism and applications of these methods. Next, our attention\nwill be paid to the DNP approach, and the origin and applications of the DNP effect\nwill be presented, in particular from the point of view of its utilization in medical\ndiagnostics and material sciences. The most extensive part of our discussion will be\ndevoted to the parahydrogen-based methods, which include hydrogenable\nParahydrogen Induced Polarization and Signal Amplification by Reversible\nExchange. In the introduction to these methods, the properties of hydrogen\nmolecules, which are the main driving forces of PHIP, will be presented.\nThe mechanism of the boosting of NMR signals will be presented for hPHIP and\nSABRE. The application of these methods will be presented, with the central focus\nbeing on their applications in catalysis and medical diagnostics. In the context of\nmedical applications, the hyperpolarization of biorelevant molecules will be\npresented.

Now, we carefully design functional nanostructures. These designs are often bio-inspired or composed of bio-parts. We are aiming to create life-like systems. The conflict will remain in defining the stage when such systems could be considered living. A similar dilemma is persistent in the realm of viruses, which are considered living or not, depending on the perception. This chapter describes the mutual relation between nanotechnology and bacteriophages (phages for short). Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and use bacterial cellular machinery to replicate. Phages are often seen as bio-nanomaterials with high specificity, uniform structure, and easy replication. Over the years, phages and nanomaterials have been helpful to each other in enhancing their applications. In different approaches, nano-phage particles work in synergy to derive better results. This chapter is divided into two major sections: ‘bacteriophages for nanotechnology’ and ‘nanotechnology for bacteriophages’."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6577d3b840e3ff4ef3006306","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"243-271","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6577d3b840e3ff4ef3006306","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6751a7c9fdbe834f768747d8","title":"Nanoscience","year":2023,"volume":"9","isbn":"978-1-83916-813-0","url":"https://books.rsc.org/books/edited-volume/2132/NanoscienceVolume-9","translation":false,"documentHash":"67d23bed-9696-4164-8a3c-caaa59ca6dcb","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8b8","mniswId":"52200","name":"Royal Society of Chemistry","documentHash":"9fbf33a8-3150-4421-aa84-10c86b9d1ee2"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":true,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059982267"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453ac4","name":"V.

We demonstrate the dependence of the catalytic activity of bulk NiFe catalysts against the Ni/Fe ratio. Based on the experimental observations, the possible mechanism of carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation to methane (CH4) on the surface of the active bulk catalyst and that loaded on carbon nanotubes was proposed. The CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity mainly depend on the nature of the carrier. Based on the example of the catalysts loaded on carbon carriers, the effect of surface morphology on the CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity is shown. We showed the role of the initial carriers, namely, crystal structure, texture, and surface morphology, on the formation of active sites of nanocomposite NiFe catalysts based on the alumina with different porosities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6243c0a87523402df099a303"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"211-241","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6243c0a87523402df099a303","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453abb","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453abc","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453abd","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453abe","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453abf","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453ac0","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453ac1","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453ac2","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453ac3","674ee7d4fdbe832d4f453ac4"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6582e2a440970751d8f2d002","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-42708-4","title":"Nanoelectronics, Nanooptics, Nanochemistry and Nanobiotechnology, and Their Applications: Selected Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Nanotechnologies and Nanomaterials (NANO2022), 25–27 August 2022, Ukraine","year":2023,"isbn":"978-3-031-42707-7","issn":"0930-8989","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-42708-4.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"4e4b000b-681f-4360-b79d-8dc9d3bd3216","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059992750"},{"authors":[],"objectId":"6751a7c9fdbe834f768747d8","publicUri":"https://books.rsc.org/books/edited-volume/2132/NanoscienceVolume-9","type":"EDITED_BOOK","typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","year":2023,"title":"Nanoscience","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"EDITOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":true,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6751a7c9fdbe834f768747d9","6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e"]},"_version":4,"isbn":"978-1-83916-813-0","pages":292,"series":"Specialist Periodical Reports","translation":false,"publicationPlace":"Cambridge","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8b8","mniswId":"52200","name":"Royal Society of Chemistry","documentHash":"9fbf33a8-3150-4421-aa84-10c86b9d1ee2"},"editors":[{"objectId":"6751a7c9fdbe834f768747d9","name":"Neerish","lastName":"Revaprasadu","documentHash":"a149da1e-3580-4b88-9126-3e104733c287"},{"objectId":"6126fca99543c7051ff01b0e","name":"Malik","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"3F14D6BD4340633067804C270812A937F4E92325031BE1176142856E397CDDA3DE8C90CE8CB58D3FB67D87C91202A989955940DCCDD0BEF387B162A98B900235","orcidId":"0000-0002-3316-041X","documentHash":"b5f5ad91-b181-4281-9e6e-7bd70d906091"}],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060027103"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Waluk","uuid":"587A78D077C4375A4C980253E3D29FB2074174FC88F6A7341BDCBF8F80F6764FDE1461139B4C2337F132A7A1787A14076B55E79D57654F32E1BE17E03941A875","orcidId":"0000-0001-5745-583X","documentHash":"f8893a20-d629-4008-9c8c-d34c0e171106"}],"objectId":"6756e780fdbe833c07e88fbb","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9783527834914.ch6","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonding in Porphyrin Isomers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Simulations of intramolecular hydrogen bonding characteristics were performed for free‐base porphyrin and its isomers, including all possible tautomeric forms.

The core-shell structure is designed with a ZIF-8 core, onto which a ZIF-67 shell is grown. This unique architecture aims to expedite the diffusion of electrolyte ions, facilitate inner-outer metal ion electron transfer, and consequently enhance electrochemical performance. When used as an active electrode material, the material delivers 263.43 F g-1 of capacitance at 0.5 A g-1 of discharge rate. The core-shell structure exhibits 68% of surface contribution toward the total capacitance. At the scan rate of 50 mV s-1, the sample almost exhibits equal contribution of diffusion and surface charge contribution. Further an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device is assembled, featuring a ZIF-8@ZIF-67 core-shell metal-organic framework (MOF) as a positive electrode and waste-tissue-paper-derived activated carbon as negative electrode using 1 m H2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. The ASC device delivers an energy density of 38.4 Wh kg-1 at the power density of 0.8 kW kg-1, along with long cycle life of 95.2% after an extensive 10 000 cycles. In this work, the significance of the ZIF-based core-shell structure in advancing supercapacitor technology, which further can be extended to multiple core-shell structure and other MOF combination, is highlighted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62fef5a87523404ea24371aa","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6761705ffdbe836571659adb","6761705ffdbe836571659adc","6761705ffdbe836571659add","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","62fef5a87523404ea24371aa","6761705ffdbe836571659ade","6761705ffdbe836571659adf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ab8","mniswId":"5696","title":"Energy Technology","issn":"2194-4288","eissn":"2194-4296","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e764d95d-6fc8-4d99-aa65-5b232010cab5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6761705ffdbe836571659ada","year":"2024","documentHash":"b71f6514-bac1-4283-8d84-f3704935bcc6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060088477"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652796","name":"Claudia","lastName":"Bearzi","documentHash":"963b664f-4712-448d-9402-09a7c727822a"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652795","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Rizzi","documentHash":"7aa6ffcf-d849-43bd-ba62-a3743cd5c5e9"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652794","name":"Tommaso","lastName":"Sciarra","documentHash":"9e559d51-111d-4972-827b-96bea8907e0d"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652793","name":"Antonella","lastName":"Calogero","documentHash":"ce15a390-eb52-441a-9b86-47eae57d4b11"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652792","name":"Dario","lastName":"Di Silvestre","documentHash":"02498df9-af4a-4bd3-ab59-759db013b99b"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652791","name":"Pierluigi","lastName":"Mauri","documentHash":"310ee841-39ec-47b7-87f0-9395a243857b"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652790","name":"Francesca","lastName":"Brambilla","documentHash":"cfc364ea-6712-4fc6-bd9f-28f64eb14b73"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe83657165278f","name":"Orazio","lastName":"Fortunato","documentHash":"5edb8b9f-05fa-4b70-b35f-affa4369c2b4"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe83657165278e","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Galbiati","documentHash":"20550bdc-5e58-48cd-ae72-d629be86f0f6"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe83657165278d","name":"Nicole","lastName":"Fratini","documentHash":"d4cefd54-4ab2-404b-8458-188be10b7f24"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe83657165278c","name":"Salma","lastName":"Bousselmi","documentHash":"3a5e7815-deb8-4101-8f86-d45f4e8e1acd"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe83657165278b","name":"Maria Grazia","lastName":"Ceraolo","documentHash":"680a5e31-4899-473b-a5f3-14d8afc5b38d"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe83657165278a","name":"Maila","lastName":"Chirivì","documentHash":"e0131368-dfcd-47a2-8a92-f26e37be7bda"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652789","name":"Marika","lastName":"Milan","documentHash":"c59cf09a-d294-4723-8be8-080727207b8a"},{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652788","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Maiullari","documentHash":"57a74cd4-0513-4dc3-8eab-4b3620d4e462"},{"objectId":"5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","name":"Marco","lastName":"Costantini","uuid":"39AF91D3BD887DDA9D7064C2EEA4EC3EA3433737B56F1680E3899FD57F4B56CF80C6CBF0037AABC256FFEBAA40368FC799B344097649E00467A4677CD64AE0F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2756-5872","documentHash":"cb8eda43-6975-486d-98a0-48f4cabbf744"}],"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652786","doi":"10.1088/1758-5090/ad6190","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/ad6190","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Enhancing neovascularization post-myocardial infarction through injectable hydrogel functionalized with endothelial-derived EVs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Over the past three decades, cell therapy development has fallen short of expectations, with many cellular sources demonstrating a 'Janus effect' and raising safety concerns. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), supported by advanced technologies, present a promising avenue in regenerative medicine, offering benefits such as immune tolerance and avoidance of negative aspects associated with cell transplants. Our previous research showcased enhanced and organized subcutaneous vascularization using three-dimensional bioprinted patches containing HUVEC-derived EVs in immunodeficient animal models. In this context, stress conditions on the cells of origin further boosted the EVs' neoangiogenic potential. Since neovascularization is the first regenerative target requiring restoration, the present study aims to complement our previous work by employing an injectable gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogel functionalized with HUVEC-derived EVs in a pathological condition of acute myocardial infarction. This bioactive hydrogel resulted in reduced fibrosis, improved contractility, and promoted angiogenesis, showing promise in countering tissue deterioration and addressing vascular deficits. Moreover, the molecular characterization of EVs through miRNome and proteomic analyses further supports their potential as bio-additives for hydrogel functionalization. This cell-free approach mitigates immune rejection and oncogenic risks, offering innovative therapeutic advantages."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"45009","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67616dc5fdbe836571652788","67616dc5fdbe836571652789","67616dc5fdbe83657165278a","67616dc5fdbe83657165278b","67616dc5fdbe83657165278c","67616dc5fdbe83657165278d","67616dc5fdbe83657165278e","67616dc5fdbe83657165278f","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","67616dc5fdbe836571652790","67616dc5fdbe836571652791","67616dc5fdbe836571652792","67616dc5fdbe836571652793","67616dc5fdbe836571652794","67616dc5fdbe836571652795","67616dc5fdbe836571652796"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477330","mniswId":"2410","title":"Biofabrication","issn":"1758-5082","eissn":"1758-5090","documentHash":"26f5e61e-76c6-4d1c-9a6a-582c233c6563"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67616dc5fdbe836571652787","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"4","documentHash":"ab6e12a1-c7d8-4b3f-9f57-871d7af182c1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060088620"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"675ff772fdbe834e36a2e8f9","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"5f57e46e-421c-46fb-8207-ee6e3a6817d0"},{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","name":"Vishnu","lastName":"Anilkumar","uuid":"E6BC82950E1CF64BECDB4E8D419567829CC492010A2E46B331EFC93341CB90928D97A6E5D8D5F2AF41D1CFFB86D4ADC11ADEB9CC375327B4151EE8C1B4037AA1","documentHash":"49a79fc7-7dc7-4e98-a3f0-b2ba16d63798"},{"objectId":"629eb829752340212cd272f2","name":"Rohit Dinkar","lastName":"Chavan","uuid":"42A4419351507C5EFF57A56FBFE83E1427C39AFCCFFE11312EE91407D09E063653D764F0C3E0A44E6E077C8C8285F6E7094D1AD7141AAAB755D357F2A203B403","orcidId":"0000-0001-9254-5048","documentHash":"911a2b07-da41-4a94-b31a-c3f1e2ca1b35"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb","name":"Jan","lastName":"Nawrocki","uuid":"0CFCE88393569CC4AD0EFB74B59B31980A7EBFC0F4A872CE7EBAD443DCCC51CD9F6C216EEF1783FD8A1A9543E25903CB03C7D79C11003F6B8DAFED4EA2DA1AAE","orcidId":"0000-0001-5124-4273","documentHash":"79118e2f-0a10-45a3-80f2-107cc30031e3"}],"objectId":"675ff772fdbe834e36a2e8f7","doi":"10.1002/adom.202302032","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/adom.202302032","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Metal‐Doped MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> Single Crystal p‐n Junction Photodiode for Self‐Powered Photodetection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lead halide perovskites have emerged as the next-generation materials for self-powered photodetectors enabling operation without an external power source.

However, the contribution of the loaded metals to enhanced performance remains unclear. In this study, Cu is loaded onto gCN to understand how photocatalytic activity is regulated by the loaded metals. Loading gCN with 3 wt% of Cu increases the electron population by 8.1 and 4.6 times under UV (λ < 370 nm) and visible light (390 < λ < 740 nm), respectively. This sample shows nearly 100% selectivity for oxidizing benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and a high yield-to-power ratio, reaching 0.35 mmol g−1 h−1 W−1. The loaded Cu species exist as single atoms with a +1-oxidation state. Each Cu+ cation is coordinated to two (at 3 wt% Cu) or four (at 6 wt% Cu) N atoms within the cavity of the gCN framework. Doubling the Cu loading results in a smaller electron population and coordinatively more saturated Cu+ cations, making it catalytically less reactive. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that Cu+ cations produce filled mid-gap states above the valence band, which function as hole traps and hence oxidation centers. The Cu+ cation and the neighboring N atoms are electron-depletion and electron-accumulation sites due to Cu → N electron transfer, making it highly reactive for oxidative transformations via the hole transfer pathway. The role of Cu as a hole-transfer site updates the received understanding that surface-loaded Cu serves as an electron-accumulation site. A strong correlation is observed between the electron population at steady-state and the product yield, indicating that it could serve as a promising performance indicator for the design of future photocatalysts"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b0038","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"31","pagesFromTo":"14813-14830","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67470b33fdbe832bc28c700a","67470b33fdbe832bc28c700b","67470b33fdbe832bc28c700c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0038","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a3","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f5a","mniswId":"14752","title":"Nanoscale","issn":"2040-3364","eissn":"2040-3372","documentHash":"2b80ed9d-ffa7-41a5-bd32-5cb176a1d65c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67470b33fdbe832bc28c7009","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"31","documentHash":"0cffcbcd-8124-4647-8e83-6914dc5bf94d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060117360"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67617163fdbe83657165a730","name":"Erkki","lastName":"Lähderanta","documentHash":"5bc59e74-4fe6-46c7-97c3-81da2f996c73"},{"objectId":"67617163fdbe83657165a72f","name":"Jaroslav","lastName":"Ilnytskyi","documentHash":"cc63291d-c1e0-4cc8-8583-7849735ad3d4"},{"objectId":"636dc1b87523405a7dd0411a","name":"Viktoriya","lastName":"Blavatska","uuid":"F461CD63D3BD823F0773DC006A87A8F76D6A2F4204D76AE1DB657ADB0E26F20F8B7F1CC5E50A9E86147DA9A605574508D73256D6C9900C0F7FCC52408A03895C","documentHash":"6887b7c0-cbde-4491-9d63-8c535234d918"}],"objectId":"67617163fdbe83657165a72d","doi":"10.1088/1751-8121/ad5e4d","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ad5e4d","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Coagulation-flocculation process on a lattice: Monte Carlo simulations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Coagulation-flocculation, the physicochemical process widely used for purification a wastewater, is affected both by chemical details of involved polymers and by the statistics of their conformations on a large scale.

the prevention of their recurrence is a pressing global health problem. In a urinary infection, pathogenic bacteria not only reside in the bladder lumen but also attach to and invade the bladder tissue. Planktonic, attached, and intracellular bacteria face different selection pressures from physiological processes such as micturition, immune response, and antibiotic treatment. Here, we use a mathematical model of the initial phase of infection to unravel the effects of these different selective pressures on the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of urinary infections. We explicitly model planktonic bacteria in the bladder lumen, bacteria attached to the bladder wall, and bacteria that have invaded the epithelial cells of the bladder. We find that the presence of non-planktonic bacteria substantially increases the risk of infection establishment and affects evolutionary trajectories leading to resistance during antibiotic treatment. We also show that competitive inoculation with a fast-growing non-pathogenic strain can reduce the pathogen load and increase the efficacy of an antibiotic, but only if the antibiotic is used in moderation. Our study shows that including different compartments is essential to create more realistic models of urinary infections, which may help guide new treatment strategies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6041ecab9543c711bc6ea917","5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67653420fdbe832d0ce22972","67653420fdbe832d0ce22973","6041ecab9543c711bc6ea917","67653420fdbe832d0ce22975","5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478390","mniswId":"9723","title":"ISME Journal","issn":"1751-7362","eissn":"1751-7370","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2da2f750-9a4c-404e-8f43-9f7da78633d5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67653420fdbe832d0ce22971","year":"2024","volume":"18","number":"1","documentHash":"afba0919-5cca-4233-92b9-0bf48f8d116e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060133776"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"676155c6fdbe8365716186e1","name":"M.","lastName":"Giannakou","documentHash":"09cbc788-c3df-47ba-b0f0-51da93cf1ccf"},{"objectId":"5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Wacław","uuid":"2C1F0B1E5915A2AE7C6A21FEB74B6EAAB6EEADBA510F9B9D6D976A06BE525AA1AFAB518E365046A9C632BC0912D06D7695FAAB325F685926EF96B780C3032E6A","documentHash":"2c71e559-80a7-4340-a94e-549f533b55f2"}],"objectId":"676155c6fdbe8365716186e0","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-67098-3","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-67098-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Resonant noise amplification in a predator-prey model with quasi-discrete generations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Predator-prey models have been shown to exhibit resonance-like behaviour, in which random fluctuations in the number of organisms (demographic noise) are amplified when their frequency is close to the natural oscillatory frequency of the system. This behaviour has been traditionally studied in models with exponentially distributed replication and death times. Here we consider a biologically more realistic model, in which organisms replicate quasi-synchronously such that the distribution of replication times has a narrow maximum at some T>0 corresponding to the mean doubling time. We show that when the frequency of replication f =1/T is tuned to the natural oscillatory frequency of the predator-prey model, the system exhibits oscillations that are much stronger than in the model with Poissonian (non-synchronous) replication and death. These oscillations lead to population instability and the extinction of one of the species much sooner than in the case of Poissonian replication. The effect can be explained by resonant amplification of coloured noise generated by quasi-synchronous replication events."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["676155c6fdbe8365716186e1","5f7fdc07085dcb410a25ebfe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060147266"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139b7","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Palczewski","documentHash":"f91e419a-c208-4588-856b-b2566c08a5ca"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139b6","name":"Simon M.","lastName":"Petersen-Jones","documentHash":"932ddfb7-94f4-4fbe-b33f-b7330c0aff9f"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139b5","name":"Vladimir J.","lastName":"Kefalov","documentHash":"cdd5c4a9-6a20-41f4-a7d6-63898a0c1d73"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139b4","name":"Seth","lastName":"Blackshaw","documentHash":"410b2dd9-506b-43a6-9826-44b35e171e6d"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139b3","name":"Philip D.","lastName":"Kiser","documentHash":"1bf555a3-a092-4a53-a1e5-b9e1244a1870"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139b2","name":"Zhiqian","lastName":"Dong","documentHash":"8ca65cfa-a3f0-48fd-9765-9f0ffa060a01"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139b1","name":"David E.","lastName":"Einstein","documentHash":"02972e4b-bf95-4104-8940-ef2f892b620f"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139b0","name":"Elliott E.","lastName":"Einstein","documentHash":"a9099d23-2bd5-4437-951c-144d6dfad03d"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139af","name":"Timothy T.","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"f7a63c16-fc57-4d95-8785-0f1f5255178e"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139ae","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Lewandowski","documentHash":"a16bad5b-7a7e-4745-b31a-8f543528fbeb"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139ad","name":"Thanh","lastName":"Hoang","documentHash":"1596d323-4729-467f-a6b4-fa5ec629ffc7"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139ac","name":"Alexander V.","lastName":"Kolesnikov","documentHash":"cd1bad0f-0e73-4d43-a5c2-8713d894c8fe"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139ab","name":"Janice","lastName":"Querubin","documentHash":"3797a852-3af4-40ea-a6d5-ef25e6e3747f"},{"objectId":"6761535ffdbe8365716139aa","name":"Luis Felipe","lastName":"L.P.

Disease-modifying therapies that mitigate pathophysiology regardless of the underlying genetic lesion are desirable due to the diversity of mutations found in such diseases. We tested a systems pharmacology-based strategy that suppresses intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ activity via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) modulation using tamsulosin, metoprolol, and bromocriptine coadministration. The treatment improves cone photoreceptor function and slows degeneration in Pde6 beta rd10 and RhoP23H/WT retinitis pigmentosa mice. Cone degeneration is modestly mitigated after a 7-month-long drug infusion in PDE6A-/- dogs. The treatment also improves rod pathway function in an Rpe65-/- mouse model of Leber congenital amaurosis but does not protect from cone degeneration. RNA-sequencing analyses indicate improved metabolic function in drug-treated Rpe65-/- and rd10 mice. Our data show that catecholaminergic GPCR drug combinations that modify second messenger levels via multiple receptor actions provide a potential disease-modifying therapy against retinal degeneration.\nThis preclinical study demonstrates the potential of a drug repurposing strategy using the coadministration of tamsulosin, metoprolol, and bromocriptine to provide a mutation-agnostic therapy for inherited retinal degeneration."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","5e709373878c28a0473a9ddb","5f505f00752340073806a8ca","616a392975234017e05459e5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6761535ffdbe8365716139a5","6761535ffdbe8365716139a6","6761535ffdbe8365716139a7","6761535ffdbe8365716139a8","6761535ffdbe8365716139a9","6761535ffdbe8365716139aa","6761535ffdbe8365716139ab","6761535ffdbe8365716139ac","5e709373878c28a0473a9ddb","6761535ffdbe8365716139ad","6761535ffdbe8365716139ae","6761535ffdbe8365716139af","6761535ffdbe8365716139b0","6761535ffdbe8365716139b1","6761535ffdbe8365716139b2","6761535ffdbe8365716139b3","6761535ffdbe8365716139b4","6761535ffdbe8365716139b5","5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","5f505f00752340073806a8ca","6761535ffdbe8365716139b6","6761535ffdbe8365716139b7","616a392975234017e05459e5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f7e","mniswId":"14814","title":"Nature Communications","issn":"2041-1723","eissn":"2041-1723","documentHash":"8ac6042b-5d3a-47c7-90e7-2c25bff3698a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ddd45040970770919addaa","year":"2024","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"3ae44993-1507-4b06-989e-c915ad719abd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060147560"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf818","name":"Hsien-Yi","lastName":"Hsu","documentHash":"613b1aee-13f0-4548-8f23-03cdbf118ed9"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf817","name":"Duu-Jong","lastName":"Lee","documentHash":"ba7c957a-55e6-4749-ac01-5a92b67e6d02"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf816","name":"Haisheng","lastName":"Song","documentHash":"6f18dbce-fbf8-47c1-8cc9-4e79eec09d09"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf815","name":"Fang-Fang","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"2db05230-80a4-4a0f-9363-e37eac13127d"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf814","name":"Mingjian","lastName":"Yuan","documentHash":"7318b81c-ec82-4321-ab7a-6d505c0dbb92"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf813","name":"Shella Permatasari","lastName":"Santoso","documentHash":"c0d72260-3348-4646-9097-930d07b49306"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf812","name":"Bin","lastName":"Han","documentHash":"a959e7b3-fb4c-4afc-8a77-bf4bc6fd6b9e"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf811","name":"Hsin-Hui","lastName":"Shen","documentHash":"c2cab896-8d9c-4cc4-b7ee-a7cfb5441e32"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf810","name":"Jianpei","lastName":"Feng","documentHash":"8cfee0fe-0d1e-430f-821f-8df32d8b5692"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf80f","name":"Chun Hong","lastName":"Mak","documentHash":"f4e78759-ff21-46d6-bbb7-e2538c167415"},{"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf80e","name":"Zhe","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"752549c5-242f-4abc-bdd8-e2e19dd15434"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"objectId":"67641786fdbe830ff2fbf80c","doi":"10.1039/d4ta02446j","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/TA/D4TA02446J","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Nanoscale halide perovskites for photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction: product selectivity, strategies implemented, and charge-carrier separation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The over-use of fossil fuels leads to a sharp increase in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), which seriously contributes to the energy crisis and climate problems. The direct transformation of CO(2 )into high-value chemicals through photocatalysis offers an effective way to mitigate these problems. The key to achieving this goal is to discover a cost-effective, highly efficient, and durable photocatalyst. Due to their straightforward synthesis, high light absorption capacity, rapid exciton production efficiency, and long carrier diffusion length, nanoscale halide perovskites (NHPs) have great potential for solar photocatalysis. However, several crucial problems, like poor long-term stability, low product selectivity, and severe charge recombination, have become bottlenecks in the development of NHP photocatalysts. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the principles of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), the structural features of halide perovskites nanocrystals (NCs) in the system, and the principal approaches to enhancing their photocatalytic activity. Factors that influence the selectivity of CO2RR final products are also discussed. Moreover, this review pays special attention to the techniques for studying photogenerated carrier transport processes and photocatalytic intermediates, which make a significant contribution to the insight into the reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Finally, the main challenges and prospects for NHP's further development are also presented. This review will offer instructions for the design of NHP photocatalysts to further enhance the photocatalytic performance and product selectivity for CO2 reduction. It will also offer insights into studying the charge transport process and mechanism for the CO2 photocatalytic reduction reaction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"32","pagesFromTo":"20542-20577","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67641786fdbe830ff2fbf80e","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf80f","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf810","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf811","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf812","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf813","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf814","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf815","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf816","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf817","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","67641786fdbe830ff2fbf818"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547884a","mniswId":"11753","title":"Journal of Materials Chemistry.

Herein, we report on a high-throughput screening method for identifying and differentiating chiroptically active quantum-sized ZnO crystals using Raman spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis. ZnO quantum dots (QDs) coated by structurally diverse homo- and heterochiral aminoalcoholate ligands (cis- and trans-1-amino-2-indanolate, 2-amino-1-phenylethanolate, and diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinemethanolate) were prepared using the one-pot self-supporting organometallic procedure and then extensively studied toward the identification of specific Raman fingerprints and spectral variations. The direct comparison between the spectra demonstrates that it is very difficult to make definite recognition and identification between QDs coated with enantiomers based only on the differences in the respective Raman bands' position shifts and their intensities. However, the applied approach involving the principal component analysis performed on the Raman spectra allows the simultaneous differentiation and identification of the studied QDs. The first and second principal components explain 98, 97, 97, and 87% of the variability among the studied families of QDs and demonstrate the possibility of using the presented method as a qualitative assay. Thus, the reported multivariate approach paves the way for simultaneous differentiation and identification of chirotopically active semiconductor nanocrystals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","5e709491878c28a0473bfabb","5e7094ba878c28a0473c2990"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"28","pagesFromTo":"37308-37317","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ba878c28a0473c2990","5e709491878c28a0473bfabb","5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","67641b5efdbe830ff2fc3034"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dc5","mniswId":"125","title":"ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES","issn":"1944-8244","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/aamick","documentHash":"27b6e464-7a88-4cfc-a099-7ec8b65dc4b1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6708d710fdbe833af651bf24","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"28","doi":"","documentHash":"ef10d628-0b7e-4d51-99c4-e28b2ea1d3cf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060150981"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff21","name":"Marek","lastName":"Litniewski","uuid":"9AD3E3D3C77BF3C4432B814DCD0B0241149CB64041774EB85580C14B4EEEC98A826ED751C1A75EA66AC21430A6EC3AAA7050A1402282D55BC344486D1CC16296","orcidId":"0000-0002-0148-1809","documentHash":"bdfdda6a-df41-4ccf-b38f-d0fe36b44046"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afee8","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Góźdź","uuid":"197B6E68CB3C2A59D0BC10FE02374BD275CDB73277FF57AD7B1F7945DEC1E8C579C7FF45896BCC73F763CD875C839EFC962E3F19F45034A7BE89A84DB14AEADD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4506-6831","documentHash":"182609ba-8d05-4c5b-adfd-ddf5d4231097"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","name":"Alina","lastName":"Ciach","uuid":"520AD5EF74AF15FA81FB18147E92D695E358B38A5F90389DF9A11C3C3623C0214250CFB548E34846D53DBA21ED79955D9F88250356F8AFEBD6A696B7263A658B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5556-401X","documentHash":"630645e8-c7ee-4652-a5a0-a0da6ec79d79"}],"objectId":"676418f0fdbe830ff2fc0472","doi":"10.3390/molecules29133170","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/13/3170/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Adsorption on a Spherical Colloidal Particle from a Mixture of Nanoparticles with Competing Interactions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Adsorption of nanoparticles on a spherical colloidal particle is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. We consider a generic model for a mixture of nanoparticles with energetically favored self-assembly into alternating layers of the two components. When both components are attracted to the colloidal particle, the adsorbed nanoparticles self-assemble either into alternating parallel tori and clusters at the two poles of the colloidal particle, or into alternating spirals wrapped around the spherical surface. The long-lived metastable states obtained in simulations follow from the spherical shape of the adsorbing surface and the requirement that the neighboring chains of the nanoparticles are composed of different components. A geometrical construction leading to all such patterns is presented. When the second component particles are repelled from the colloidal particle and the attraction of the first component is strong, the attracted particles form a monolayer at the surface of the colloidal particle that screens the repulsion of the second component. The subsequent adsorbed alternating spherical layers of the two components form together a thick shell. This structure leads to the adsorption that is larger than in the case of the same attraction of the two components to the colloidal particle."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","5e7093bd878c28a0473afee8","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff21"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"3170","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff21","5e7093bd878c28a0473afee8","5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"667d43bafdbe83464a4e7da3","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"29","number":"13","documentHash":"43d0d238-de92-4078-b528-250e4ec449a8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060177903"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6764186ffdbe830ff2fbfd73","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zielińska-Jurek","documentHash":"c4f4e1a5-adcb-49e2-ba22-ad34e242a2b7"},{"objectId":"6764186ffdbe830ff2fbfd72","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Trzciński","documentHash":"88617fde-c83a-458c-9c62-1052710fe2fe"},{"objectId":"6764186ffdbe830ff2fbfd71","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Fiszka Borzyszkowska","documentHash":"8144992e-57d1-43b8-bef0-d3044b1fe0f2"},{"objectId":"6764186ffdbe830ff2fbfd70","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Sulowska","documentHash":"e82ed665-da44-4537-8542-389cd18f4ffe"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pisarek","uuid":"394C70A4B68190862754D0C9C71B0CB236E956007955224514CD5CC84EABBD07900FBD9AC8AACDBDD5E542D5CC809EC02A9E49AFFB1DCA527F248F357949EFB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7424-5954","documentHash":"f7a53170-9e7f-4afd-bea7-cb1ef6322bc6"}],"objectId":"6764186ffdbe830ff2fbfd6e","doi":"10.1016/j.apt.2024.104565","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0921883124002413?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Polypyrrole-Fe2TiO5 composites for adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of micropollutants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, a new series of Fe2TiO5 - polypyrrole (FTO-xP) were prepared by the facile polymerisation method using sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide as oxidising agents.

The new composites were used for photocatalytic removal of micropollutants: highly toxic Cr(VI) and ibuprofen (IBU). The effect of polypyrrole content in the composite on the efficiency of selected micropollutants degradation was investigated. The results showed that FTO-xP composites had better adsorption capacity and photocatalytic activity than single components. Hybrid FTO-xP composites could efficiently remove inorganic/organic micropollutants in the aqueous phase.

Using a bioreactor model of infection, we modelled the emergence of colistin resistance in a susceptible isolate of K. pneumoniae. Genotypic, phenotypic and mathematical analyses of the antibiotic-challenged and un-challenged population indicates that after an initial decline, the population recovers within 24 h due to a small number of \"founder cells\" which have single point mutations mainly in the regulatory genes encoding crrB and pmrB that when mutated results in up to 100-fold reduction in colistin susceptibility.

This work involves the conversion of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) into cobalt nitride nanoparticles embedded within a porous carbon matrix (Co4N/C). The as-prepared composite shows great synergy by providing a high surface area and efficient charge transfer, showcasing outstanding electrochemical performance by providing a specific capacitance of 313 F g-1. Moreover, we meticulously conducted calculations to derive the most precise values for the surface contribution, a crucial aspect often overlooked in existing literature, thereby ensuring the reliability of our calculated measurements. Correct calculations of surface and diffusion charge contributions are necessary for evaluating the overall electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. For practical utility, we successfully assembled an asymmetrical supercapacitor employing the Co4N/carbon composite as the negative electrode that achieved an impressive energy density of 26.6 W h kg-1 at a power density of 0.36 kW kg-1. This study opens up new avenues for investigating the use of other metal nitride nanoparticles embedded in carbon structures for various energy storage applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"4219-4229","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","678e2dbefdbe8352f865eb9e","678e2dbefdbe8352f865eb9f","678e2dbefdbe8352f865eba0","678e2dbefdbe8352f865eba1","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","678e2dbefdbe8352f865eba2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f137","mniswId":"27874","title":"Nanoscale Advances","issn":"2516-0230","eissn":"2516-0230","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"570db27f-5279-4051-a072-5b0db028519c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678e2dbefdbe8352f865eb9d","year":"2024","volume":"6","number":"16","documentHash":"a4313563-036b-45d2-9bb9-0d3c9b148081"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060382835"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63574a29752340623bc01cc7","name":"Behdokht","lastName":"Hashemi Hosseini","uuid":"C3F7CFE9BD7E3964BAA2877563842355707DCA14A9AC24455B05533E419DC41D5D3BBAA306D60E1F747363106C11C5EB808EFB80A463346417BDA9BBF4A866B3","documentHash":"6b08e879-9c1c-48da-af5b-31ee3ea3c72a"},{"objectId":"616a392975234017e0545a1c","name":"Rafael","lastName":"De Lima Oliveira","uuid":"2A0952DDD5CA46FCB5F8E537449E7400054CA4D3A6CDED3C35A806C05ECCFE5E63CCA987EE7F1445FE8A8D1E0AFF7929A38B99AA638724CB2CE8BBD46A32C36D","documentHash":"fe127367-6cc0-4c99-b0c3-67135675feb1"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Łomot","uuid":"9AD36137223F2722603D98969D279F5AB25CDBFDC76A5D950100F7F869850EC0FF7080AD835DF490058317885BB46E2FA8C68ECFF5811377F69FFFD0A2288626","orcidId":"0000-0003-3663-1122","documentHash":"15b687f0-a174-44c7-97e5-cebe3bb751ea"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf93f","name":"Olga","lastName":"Chernyayeva","uuid":"D8616FD54954511340229E9B6612899E830FCB8E4620DFD5135927A3D2F2C2BBE0A5D2C0B9CC50C186B9C1504D781D6FEBF3A9E74BA6E3402FC46FADF20D3AE2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6813-4350","documentHash":"e2c193ec-d62c-4906-a22b-a0c29ad423c1"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66fbc1b2fdbe837a1e18fc37","doi":"10.3390/molecules29071436","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/7/1436/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Sonocatalytic Activity of Porous Carbonaceous Materials for the Selective Oxidation of 4-Hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzyl Alcohol","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Selective oxidation, which is crucial in diverse chemical industries, transforms harmful chemicals into valuable compounds. Heterogeneous sonocatalysis, an emerging sustainable approach, urges in-depth exploration. In this work, we investigated N-doped or non-doped carbonaceous materials as alternatives to scarce, economically sensitive metal-based catalysts. Having synthesized diverse carbons using a hard-template technique, we subjected them to sonication at frequencies of 22, 100, 500, and 800 kHz with a 50% amplitude. Sonochemical reaction catalytic tests considerably increased the catalytic activity of C-meso (non-doped mesoporous carbon material). The scavenger test showed a radical formation when this catalyst was used. N-doped carbons did not show adequate and consistent sonoactivity for the selective oxidation of 4-Hydroxy-3,5 dimethoxybenzyl alcohol in comparison with control conditions without sonication, which might be associated with an acid-base interaction between the catalysts and the substrate and sonoactivity prohibition by piridinic nitrogen in N-doped catalysts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","63574a29752340623bc01cc7","5e709490878c28a0473bf93f","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb9","uid":"bpq3XEoTuWT9uiSQASO_7cA","uuid":"0f0762c0-9894-4415-abdf-24cbd96b7045","name":"Instytut Niskich Temperatur i Badań Strukturalnych im.

It is formed in the reaction of alpha-pinene, beta-pinene or verbenone with atmospheric oxidizing reagents. In the presented study, tandem mass spectrometry techniques were used to determine the exact norpinonic acid fragmentation pathway in the gas phase. The precursor anion - deprotonated norpinonic acid (m/z 169), generated in an electrospray (ESI) source - was introduced into the collision cell of the mass spectrometer and fragmented using the energy-resolved collision-induced dissociation (ER-CID) technique. The experimental energy values of degradation processes were determined via analysis of the breakdown curves. Quantum chemical calculations of the reaction models were also constructed, including calculation of all transition states. Comparison between the experimental and the theoretical threshold energies calculated at a omega B97XD/6-311+G(2d,p) theoretical level has shown a good correlation. Two basic pathways of the fragmentation of the parent anion [M-H]- (m/z 169) were observed. Firstly this leads to the decarboxylation product (m/z 125) and secondly to the loss of a neutral molecule (C4H6O), together with the formation of the anion m/z 99. On the other hand, the breakdown of the anion m/z 125 gives rise to the m/z 69, 57 and 55 ions. To confirm structures formed during ER-CID experiments, the gas-phase proton transfer reactions were examined of all norpinonic acid anionic fragments with a series of neutral reagents, characterized by proton affinity (PA) values. Based on PA difference analysis, the most possible chemical structures were proposed for the observed fragment anions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cb878c28a04739ccfe","5e7093eb878c28a0473b3524","602e11569543c7410626eb9b","6700a4a9ece39845a3419bb3"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"9309-9322","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e11569543c7410626eb9b","5e7092ac878c28a04739a65c","6700a4a9ece39845a3419bb3","5e7093eb878c28a0473b3524","5e7092cb878c28a04739ccfe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724d","mniswId":"2026","title":"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","issn":"1680-7316","eissn":"1680-7324","documentHash":"767f0fa0-a1ba-4887-b209-a40652902fe4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673b2c3afdbe831377a29f26","year":"2024","volume":"24","number":"16","documentHash":"28bc34de-0091-4f73-9212-2e1a12703edb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060436641"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d367","name":"Reza","lastName":"Akhavan-Sigari","documentHash":"d6f42397-4122-44cc-a34b-3d03e0d03e78"},{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d366","name":"Marzieh Ramezani","lastName":"Farani","documentHash":"9714e350-0122-4de5-b7e4-8d92bcc8904d"},{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d365","name":"Yun Suk","lastName":"Huh","documentHash":"b521a41d-f66c-43cc-9354-1e0b5ac8ec13"},{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d364","name":"Yalda","lastName":"Yazdani","documentHash":"fda744d4-61ec-4036-81e4-b44aa56ef09f"},{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d363","name":"Sohrab","lastName":"Jaferian","documentHash":"cc368bb9-36d3-49cf-b4bf-e4047ad41c56"},{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d362","name":"Shayan","lastName":"Khalilollah","documentHash":"5ba458b4-84de-4d8a-89ac-3ce33fddcdd5"},{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d361","name":"Shiva","lastName":"Karimian","documentHash":"9d399c49-160c-461b-b853-95a2b9fc4706"},{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d360","name":"Amin","lastName":"Birashk","documentHash":"97f6caee-938a-4734-bb24-1d9285de7a8f"},{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d35f","name":"Mehrnaz","lastName":"Mostafavi","documentHash":"a92a3264-155a-41db-a37f-a59242213e88"},{"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d35e","name":"Saber","lastName":"Saharkhiz","documentHash":"45dc8a28-f163-4918-adbf-523e7edea280"},{"objectId":"60c2fc239543c7233654339a","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Alipourfard","uuid":"09F87F13C145EAA33D5D3E392CC52D6627B20E2FB071920A9AC8A55B4EFE06CCFDC635D1FBCFD0C3CE2E997891A272F5A4326A19832587B921FF5E5C935B8BC5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5164-8606","documentHash":"92b7f0ed-674e-4ca5-b512-5aa90affbef8"}],"objectId":"678f6fb1fdbe835856b3d35c","doi":"10.1007/s41061-024-00469-6","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s41061-024-00469-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The State-of-the-Art Overview to Application of Deep Learning in Accurate Protein Design and Structure Prediction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the scientific community's interest in rational protein design. The prospect of designing an amino acid sequence that can reliably fold into a desired three-dimensional structure and exhibit the intended function is captivating. However, a major challenge in this endeavor lies in accurately predicting the resulting protein structure. The exponential growth of protein databases has fueled the advancement of the field, while newly developed algorithms have pushed the boundaries of what was previously achievable in structure prediction. In particular, using deep learning methods instead of brute force approaches has emerged as a faster and more accurate strategy.

The sensitivity of biosensors can be improved by optically active materials with anti-Stokes emission, narrowband absorption and emission spectral lines, and long luminescence lifetimes. In contrast to energy reabsorption, energy transfer between the upconversion nanocrystals (UCNPs) and organic dyes attached to their surface can be observed through donor emission quenching and acceptor emission and decreases in the luminescence lifetimes of donors. Although the emission spectra confirmed that FRET occurred from the Er3+ ions to the Rose Bengal acceptor, the luminescence lifetimes were generally not affected by the presence of the acceptor. The Ln3+ dopant in LnNPs, which typically has 20-100 % Yb3+ sensitizer ions and 0.2-2% activator (Er3+/Tm3+/Ho3+) ions, results in hundreds to thousands of Ln3+ ions in a single UCNP. The interaction between multiple Ln3+ ions results in significant energy migration and storage in the Yb3+ sensitizer network, which is often recharged with the energy of the Er3+ ions when they emit and nonradiatively transfer their energy to acceptor species. However, the energy transfer mechanisms could not be unambiguously determined through spectroscopic data due to the nature the upconversion process. Studies confirmed that the energy migration distance was significantly shortened when the LnNP surface contained acceptors; this affected the energy storage and 'recharging' capability of the Yb3+ sensitizer network within the UCNPs. These results provide hints on the future use of LnNP as effective FRET probes, in which the highest possible absorption cross section and possibly lowest dopant concentration should be maintained."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb9","uid":"bpq3XEoTuWT9uiSQASO_7cA","uuid":"0f0762c0-9894-4415-abdf-24cbd96b7045","name":"Instytut Niskich Temperatur i Badań Strukturalnych im.

cost-effective electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in aqueous media is crucial for energy conversion systems such as fuel cells or Zn-air batteries. Electrode materials from spent devices such as lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) are a serious environmental problem. One of the solutions is their reuse for other electrochemical processes. This work demonstrates the application of solid residues of carbon-based powders left over from the hydrometallurgical recycling process of LIBs’ waste as efficient catalysts for ORR. Microscopic and spectroscopic studies of the residue disclosed their porous structure and various cobalt contents, depending on the recycling procedure. These battery wastes display ORR catalytic activity when deposited at the liquid-liquid and solid electrode-electrolyte interfaces. Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy (SECM) tests showed that assembling battery waste at the liquid-liquid interface boosts the efficiency of H2O2 production by one to two orders of magnitude. The catalytic activity towards 2-electron ORR strongly depends on waste powder compositions and structures, e.g., porosity, heteroatom presence, level of defects, and

areas of chemistry, and a more in-depth understanding of factors controlling their reactivity with metal complexes is warranted to promote further developments. Here, we report on the effect of the metal centre Lewis acidity on both the distribution of the O- and N-centered spin density in 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO) and turning TEMPO from the O- to N-radical mode scavenger in metal-TEMPO systems. We use Et(Cl)Zn/TEMPO model reaction system with tuneable reactivity in the solid state and solution. Among various products, a unique Lewis acid-base adduct of Cl2Zn with the N-ethylated TEMPO was isolated and structurally characterised, and the so-called solid-state ' slow chemistry ' reaction led to a higher yield of the N-alkylated product. The revealed structure-activity/selectivity correlations are exceptional yet are entirely rationalised by the mechanistic underpinning supported by theoretical calculations of studied model systems. This work lays a foundation and mechanistic blueprint for future metal/nitroxide systems

Lipid Formulation for Combination Cancer Treatment: Delivery of a Chemotherapeutic Agent and Complexed α-Particle Emitter 213Bi","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Here, we propose tailored lipid liquid-crystalline carriers (cubosomes), which incorporate an anticancer drug (doxorubicin) and complexed short-lived alpha-emitter (bismuth-213), as a strategy to obtain more effective action toward the cancer cells. Cubosomes were formulated with doxorubicin (DOX) and an amphiphilic ligand (DOTAGA-OA), which forms stable complexes with Bi-213 radionuclide. The behavior of DOX incorporated into the carrier together with the chelating agent was investigated, and the drug liberation profile was determined. The experiments revealed that the presence of the DOTAGA-OA ligand affects the activity of DOX when they are incorporated into the same carrier. This unexpected influence was explained based on the results of release studies, which proved the contribution of electrostatics in molecular interactions between the positively charged DOX and negatively charged DOTAGA-OA in acidic and neutral solutions. A significant decrease in the viability of HeLa cancer cells was achieved using sequential cell exposure: first to the radiolabeled cubosomes containing Bi-213 complex and next to DOX-doped cubosomes. Therefore, the sequential procedure for the delivery of both drugs encapsulated in cubosomes is suggested for further biological and in vivo studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa8f5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","uid":"bhtjxujYsJBDWqZPLXLXOmg","uuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","name":"Instytut Chemii i Techniki Jądrowej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b526f","62f36d12409707058d1b9284","5e709450878c28a0473ba4a2","6153cfa99543c7051ff01daf","5e70940f878c28a0473b58bb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","parentUuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","rootUuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a7651","602c99239543c7410626e08f","5e709359878c28a0473a7dda"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"2818-2831","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602c99239543c7410626e08f","62f36d12409707058d1b9284","5e709359878c28a0473a7dda","5e709355878c28a0473a7651","5e709408878c28a0473b526f","6153cfa99543c7051ff01daf","5e70937a878c28a0473aa8f5","62f36d12409707058d1b9289","62f36d12409707058d1b928a","5e70940f878c28a0473b58bb","5e709450878c28a0473ba4a2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f03","mniswId":"14569","title":"Molecular Pharmaceutics","issn":"1543-8384","eissn":"1543-8392","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"6d2805a6-31b4-4330-a1a4-b09f0d105b8f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f36d12409707058d1b9282","year":"2022","volume":"19","number":"8","documentHash":"79f083db-0e82-429f-bf33-370cfb379c10"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["213Bi radionuclide;

The TMG cap plays a crucial role in RNA processing and stability as it protects the RNA molecule from degradation by exonucleases and facilitates its export from the nucleus. Additionally, the TMG cap plays a role in the recognition of snRNA by snurportin, a protein that facilitates nuclear import. TMG cap analogs are used in biochemical experiments as molecular tools to substitute the natural TMG cap. To expand the range of available TMG-based tools, here we conjugated the TMG cap to Fluorescent Molecular Rotors (FMRs) to open the possibility of detecting protein-ligand interactions in vitro and, potentially, in vivo, particularly visualizing interactions with snurportin. Consequently, we report the synthesis of 34 differently modified TMG cap-FMR conjugates and their evaluation as molecular probes for snurportin. As FMRs we selected three GFP-like chromophores (derived from green fluorescent protein) and one julolidine derivative. The evaluation of binding affinities for snurportin showed unexpectedly a strong stabilizing effect for TMGpppG-derived dinucleotides containing the FMR at the 2 '-O-position of guanosine. These newly discovered compounds are potent snurportin ligands with nanomolar KD (dissociation constant) values, which are two orders of magnitude lower than that of natural TMGpppG. The effect is diminished by similar to 50-fold for the corresponding 3 '-regioisomers. To deepen the understanding of the structure-activity relationship, we synthesized and tested FMR conjugates lacking the TMG cap moiety. These studies, supported by molecular docking, suggested that the enhanced affinity arises from additional hydrophobic contacts provided by the FMR moiety. The strongest snurportin ligand, which also gave the greatest fluorescence enhancement (Fm/F0) when saturated with the protein, were tested in living cells to detect interactions and visualize complexes by fluorescence lifetime monitoring. This approach has potential applications in the study of RNA processing and RNA-protein interactions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff83","5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d4878c28a0473b1711","5e70935b878c28a0473a7f1b","5e70947f878c28a0473be91b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"33","pagesFromTo":"6763-6790","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673f27aefdbe834f4e129db1","673f27aefdbe834f4e129db2","5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff83","673f27aefdbe834f4e129db4","673f27aefdbe834f4e129db5","673f27aefdbe834f4e129db6","673f27aefdbe834f4e129db8","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","5e70947f878c28a0473be91b","5e7093d4878c28a0473b1711","5e70935b878c28a0473a7f1b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547912b","mniswId":"15528","title":"Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry","issn":"1477-0520","eissn":"1477-0539","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"2f937d80-fc83-4f8a-84f8-aa098f514d2b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673f27dcfdbe834f4e129fbe","year":"2024","volume":"22","number":"33","doi":"","documentHash":"867aca46-4cc5-4bdb-b822-54807182abc8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060592757"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818569","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Volpe","documentHash":"aa3e35ec-024d-4dab-9d95-9cc57f4d8d4f"},{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818568","name":"S.","lastName":"Dietrich","documentHash":"c0540ff8-2e43-4a6e-ae43-bb86c5bcdafd"},{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818567","name":"Mikael","lastName":"Käll","documentHash":"540faa92-731a-4aa8-9fdd-a5ec57005ad9"},{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818566","name":"Ruggero","lastName":"Verre","documentHash":"56fdf3f4-345a-43ce-831f-7cfb0d92e0dc"},{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818565","name":"Agnese","lastName":"Callegari","documentHash":"df6d0bef-7770-4051-b907-134db00cb525"},{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818564","name":"Falko","lastName":"Schmidt","documentHash":"82e6a344-0d4f-4d33-8ee4-2a3b59226ebe"},{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818563","name":"Benjamin","lastName":"Midtvedt","documentHash":"5fddd711-4cd1-4ed3-bda1-e8afc7ae565d"},{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818562","name":"Nima","lastName":"Farahmand Bafi","documentHash":"302287fd-17ec-443f-bef3-5883b55b92f9"},{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818561","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Nowakowski","documentHash":"e8406afe-fc7d-4272-8876-0cb703d7495e"},{"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe836565818560","name":"Gan","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"cae094d3-cb8e-4a04-8f60-f14484a30f1d"},{"objectId":"5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","uuid":"4C8E231D76FA1FF9DEBFB40938EB36AF89D302A9BF4FB4483D4EB2BD2B36DFFFCE516493C98DF050048768547005AB2F2AB230D9F072ED3FD77064BDE749E112","orcidId":"0000-0003-4448-0686","documentHash":"22911df0-6857-4e43-8285-ca3bbbff21b2"}],"objectId":"67c5b2fdfdbe83656581855f","doi":"10.1038/s41467-024-49220-1","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49220-1.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Nanoalignment by critical Casimir torques","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The manipulation of microscopic objects requires precise and controllable forces and torques. Recent advances have led to the use of critical Casimir forces as a powerful tool, which can be finely tuned through the temperature of the environment and the chemical properties of the involved objects. For example, these forces have been used to self-organize ensembles of particles and to counteract stiction caused by Casimir-Liftshitz forces. However, until now, the potential of critical Casimir torques has been largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that critical Casimir torques can efficiently control the alignment of microscopic objects on nanopatterned substrates. We show experimentally and corroborate with theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations that circular patterns on a substrate can stabilize the position and orientation of microscopic disks. By making the patterns elliptical, such microdisks can be subject to a torque which flips them upright while simultaneously allowing for more accurate control of the microdisk position.

However, its low polarity and lack of functional groups limit wider applications. While inert, PVDF has been modified by grafting polymer chains by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), albeit via an unclear mechanism, given the strong C–F bonds. Herein, we applied eosin Y and green-light-mediated ATRP to modify PVDF-based materials. The method gave nearly quantitative (meth)acrylate monomer conversions within 2 h without deoxygenation and without the formation of unattached homopolymers, as confirmed by control experiments and DOSY NMR measurements. The gamma distribution model that accounts for broadly dispersed polymers in DOSY experiments was essential and serves as a powerful tool for the analysis of PVDF. The NMR analysis of poly(methyl acrylate) graft chain-ends on PVDF-CTFE (statistical copolymer with chlorotrifluoroethylene) was carried out successfully for the first time and showed up to 23 grafts per PVDF-CTFE chain. The grafting density was tunable depending on the solvent composition and light intensity during the grafting. The initiation proceeded either from the C–Cl sites of PVDF-CTFE or via unsaturations in the PVDF backbones. The dehydrofluorinated PVDF was 20 times more active than saturated PVDF during the grafting. The method was successfully applied to modify PVDF, PVDF-HFP, and Viton A401C. The obtained PVDF-CTFE-g-PnBMA materials were investigated in more detail. They featured slightly lower crystallinity than PVDF-CTFE (12–18 vs 24.3%) and had greatly improved mechanical performance: Young’s moduli of up to 488 MPa, ductility of 316%, and toughness of 46 × 106 J/m3."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c9878c28a04738993a","name":"Carnegie Mellon University","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6529fd2a40e3ff51d51ca257","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4773"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6529fd2a40e3ff51d51ca257"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935c878c28a0473a8005","63574a29752340623bc01c87"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"23932–23947","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6529fd2a40e3ff51d51ca257","667d0fb9fdbe8301716d0079","667d0fb9fdbe8301716d007a","667d0fb9fdbe8301716d007b","63574a29752340623bc01c87","5e70935c878c28a0473a8005","667d0fb9fdbe8301716d007d","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4773"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dc5","mniswId":"125","title":"ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES","issn":"1944-8244","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/aamick","documentHash":"27b6e464-7a88-4cfc-a099-7ec8b65dc4b1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ea952ffdbe836650ad1ea6","year":"2024","volume":"","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"ccc77fb1-036c-41bb-8854-258f3856c0e5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060600707"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c81fb7fdbe83551ebff140","name":"Mikaela","lastName":"Görlin","documentHash":"fae4962b-da64-4144-84a1-946547109085"},{"objectId":"67c81fb7fdbe83551ebff13f","name":"Jaroslava","lastName":"Nováková","documentHash":"91d84ea0-7ffc-4120-9522-120b4efd5383"},{"objectId":"67c81fb7fdbe83551ebff13e","name":"Stylianos","lastName":"Kioumourtzoglou","documentHash":"bc9042fa-e84e-435b-9ccc-a4160f3fd0ce"},{"objectId":"67c81fb7fdbe83551ebff13d","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Hof","documentHash":"fd14bd38-0a1d-419d-9532-a597dbcd85e6"},{"objectId":"622036397523402df08c206c","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sa","uuid":"87182E2E0888DA41C757B81B2143E2316665900AFDCDE55D96C088AFA76BAFB6A4F1AA06C4EDA6BD452B1F53C7A1CCDD6A3E7FE74E2E496F4852B0410671F4C6","documentHash":"b4c2efbd-ab85-495c-833b-083d3a9f0f35"}],"objectId":"67c81fb7fdbe83551ebff13c","doi":"10.1002/admt.202401566","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/admt.202401566","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Continuous Flow Synthesis of Prussian Blue and Analogues Assisted by AI","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Prussian blue and its analogs are promising materials for numerous applications. Interest in this class of materials arises from their broad pore distribution, redox properties, high biocompatibility, low-cost components, straightforward manufacturability, and adaptability through analog development. A key challenge is the synthesis of well-defined, small-dimensioned materials using machine learning approaches. This study presents a strategy to address this limitation via machine learning-driven microfluidic synthesis. Employing unsupervised Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes effectively reduces optimization time and minimizes the need for prior knowledge. As a proof of concept, Prussian blue, and cobalt-based analogs are synthesized, with UV-vis spectroscopy providing feedback for the machine learning algorithm. The optimized protocols are subsequently applied to larger-scale preparations, demonstrating that the standardized methods have the potential for the commercial production of high-quality materials. Comprehensive characterization of the materials confirms their cubic morphology, small dimensionality, and mixed-valency of the metal elements."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622036397523402df08c206c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c81fb7fdbe83551ebff13d","67c81fb7fdbe83551ebff13e","67c81fb7fdbe83551ebff13f","67c81fb7fdbe83551ebff140","622036397523402df08c206c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b85c","mniswId":"433","title":"Advanced Materials Technologies","issn":"2365-709X","eissn":"2365-709X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3263498c-0e52-41ea-a7e4-5bbee44ab6ef"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"668f8fd1fdbe83640c1f2319","year":"2024","documentHash":"77accec5-8789-490e-9580-fc9702b8d10a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060607218"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66d05f22fdbe8307ad2977df","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Przedpełska","documentHash":"ee542d64-49e5-42fc-ac99-bc2defb8f1f4"},{"objectId":"66d05f22fdbe8307ad2977de","name":"Beata","lastName":"Młynarczyk-Bonikowska","documentHash":"48f5c0a7-b566-40eb-9eee-7353991f7334"},{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6b70","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Berus","uuid":"7815C16291F02480DD49EBB8325DCA99B488C88A3FAFEF5DF72BC897B1E71A3B5298546D057A8D69AF1B529FD223FB58B390215962E0B4DF01BD71E7AD8E7CCF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1321-3884","documentHash":"d80e0c0a-2b2c-406a-9f70-bcef54688730"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0030","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szymborski","uuid":"954854E6F2B443EC1CEB9F87B01EE762AF5FD41964DF487AECCC88636584A873D6A10C14419BE9300C7867D99C4B0428A933B1CC8AEFC11FFBA4EA05B9BB8898","orcidId":"0000-0002-7308-0609","documentHash":"947670c0-098e-4473-88a8-425f44f4fcbf"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Michota-Kamińska","uuid":"4EB7079300C2AFB8708927EEDB21FBD81AEF2FD51FC263E240C99C7038D1005DEC8459DA840507FBA6DE74655F99385CF34A6DC7B3F7B83FA17E470DC416A800","orcidId":"0000-0002-1713-4182","documentHash":"c1786c7a-c1fc-4ac2-aa4a-053360f9fd89"}],"objectId":"66d05f22fdbe8307ad2977dc","doi":"10.1016/j.snb.2024.135571","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0925400524003009?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy analysis of menstrual cycle: From biochemical changes to diagnostics of vaginal infections","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Analysis of vaginal fluid is essential for the diagnosis of cervical cancer, various infections and the increasingly common infertility as well. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), which is an ultrasensitive technique, provides information from the molecular level of the analysed system and together with chemometric methods, can be a perfect diagnostic tool. However, the variety of processes naturally occurring during the menstrual cycle has a definite impact on the biochemistry of vaginal swabs. This study adopted SERS to track the biochemical changes recorded in spectra of analysed clinical entities during two menstrual cycles. Using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) technique, we demonstrated the spectral information typical for three types of body fluid: menstrual blood (MB), menstrual spotting (MS) and vaginal fluid (VF). The hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle can be reflected in SERS spectra and allow distinction between the fertile and infertile phases. Significantly larger data separation was observed due to infection rather than hormonal fluctuation. These results give a firm foundation for the diagnosis of vaginal infections regardless of the menstrual cycle's day."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709420878c28a0473b6b70","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0030","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"409","pagesFromTo":"135571","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709420878c28a0473b6b70","66d05f22fdbe8307ad2977de","66d05f22fdbe8307ad2977df","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0030","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796ff","mniswId":"18385","title":"Sensors and Actuators B - Chemical","issn":"0925-4005","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/sensors-and-actuators-b-chemical","documentHash":"a4a599b0-8904-44b7-8446-b23dd4815dbc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d05f22fdbe8307ad2977dd","year":"2024","volume":"409","documentHash":"6f4670e0-67ca-498c-bafd-ddeb7aebb749"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060666017"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a6","name":"Mykhailo","lastName":"Gonchar","documentHash":"5c6865a1-1bcd-4e16-bb1b-c6c26362ffae"},{"objectId":"67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a5","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Salyha","documentHash":"ef4c5f2b-e3e8-4f65-8628-b02f3f08e942"},{"objectId":"67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a4","name":"Olha","lastName":"Demkiv","documentHash":"d1bb61b5-6970-4fd3-bae8-33004b56277e"},{"objectId":"67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a3","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Zakalska","documentHash":"6b4c1f83-be72-4456-a898-e85923e0a369"},{"objectId":"67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a2","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Zakalskiy","documentHash":"89ddabba-81b0-40f7-9192-ccaf35e3d574"},{"objectId":"67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a1","name":"Nataliya","lastName":"Stasyuk","documentHash":"03d1a2ba-70e4-43b1-9fac-b1796b755943"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b","name":"Sylwester","lastName":"Gawinkowski","uuid":"761B7AE16CFD75EB1A88D826D94A467E05324FD341C458B84E69C8EB2293C97494EB7673675FFA020D7F454A9A41264E0E660B47C2DA7443F5C3749B7A67F712","orcidId":"0000-0001-5315-6197","documentHash":"c3414384-cb99-4a1f-afe4-3a8df7e6cec8"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"}],"objectId":"67c5ac6cfdbe83656581559f","doi":"10.1016/j.electacta.2024.144605","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013468624008454?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Genetically engineered yeast cells enriched with nanocomposites containing a natural enzyme and nanozyme for the construction of microbial sensors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Microbial biosensors, particularly when combined with nanotechnologies, are fast and affordable tools for different analytical purposes. Most microbial biosensors are based on the use of genetically modified cells, capable of over-producing a target enzyme, which is advantageous in terms of their sensitivity and selectivity. However, the loss of a plasmid or changes in the number of copies of the plasmid is a significant drawback. In this context, the application of alternative nanotechnological approaches for increasing the catalytic activity of sensing cells is of paramount importance. In the current research, a novel strategy of additional loading of recombinant yeast cells with a target enzyme and nanozyme has been proposed to develop methylamine (MA)selective biosensor. To construct an amperometric sensor, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells were enriched with the enzyme and nanozyme by combining three ways of genetic and nanotechnological engineering: on the genetic level - by overexpression of the methylamine oxidase (MAO) gene coding for MAO in recombinant cells; under nanotechnological approaches - by the additional enrichment of the cells with the purified enzyme MAO, co-immobilized with peroxidase mimetics, i.e. , nCdTe or nCeAu. Fluorescent nCdTe as the most effective peroxidase-mimetic was used to develop hydrogen peroxide chemosensors and as a carrier for delivery of MAO inside the cells. The most effective cells-MAO-nCdTe-containing electrode shows wide range (0.001-0.02 mu M) of linear response and high sensitivity (5450 A center dot M-1 center dot m(-2) ) to MA. The proposed approaches for increasing catalytic efficiency of sensing cells can be used for elaboration of other microbial sensors based on their enzymatic activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"497","pagesFromTo":"144605","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a1","67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a2","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff7b","67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a3","67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a4","67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a5","67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a6","5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a67","mniswId":"5553","title":"Electrochimica Acta","issn":"0013-4686","eissn":"1873-3859","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/electrochimica-acta/","documentHash":"9acc56c7-cbf9-4da3-b4ef-7d0a9cfd7d71"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c5ac6cfdbe8365658155a0","year":"2024","volume":"497","documentHash":"e25a1ef7-da66-4c6a-a1ea-e80dbf999efd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060708402"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c5b26ffdbe8365658183b5","name":"Valeriy","lastName":"Moroz","documentHash":"f2ce8801-c93b-4106-b13b-abde9b3e519e"},{"objectId":"67c5b26ffdbe8365658183b4","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Shliusar","documentHash":"53624e51-6eaf-4546-983a-9d847c24932f"},{"objectId":"67c5b26ffdbe8365658183b3","name":"Tetyana","lastName":"Kucher","documentHash":"36332323-a343-478c-b289-253696fadcd8"},{"objectId":"67c5b26ffdbe8365658183b2","name":"Liubomyr","lastName":"Kryskiw","documentHash":"4ac5bb1c-c5ce-4e52-b6bb-a1e412d0f38b"},{"objectId":"67c5b26ffdbe8365658183b1","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Blazheyevskiy","documentHash":"a35fa7ac-852b-499b-9214-a21fcc2fdfd5"},{"objectId":"651393a940e3ff34f4c346cb","name":"Olena","lastName":"Mozgova","uuid":"549DAE59842A4CB53DD645CFA296B4D0A3A14FF24C1BDD63A5EFFDCC10346753C04FD6E38B0D0F99E52B87254999D4E7509C48A2FEB77923E3385D9EA1462273","documentHash":"cc2f4ccd-3fd0-423e-b3b3-622372530a6a"}],"objectId":"67c5b26ffdbe8365658183af","doi":"10.1007/s11696-024-03558-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11696-024-03558-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"A new spectrophotometric method for the quantitative determination of Metopimazine based on the absorbance of its sulfoxide","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Metopimazine (MPZ) is a dopamine antagonist from the phenothiazine class of drugs. It has antiemetic properties and is used to treat nausea and vomiting, including those associated with cancer chemotherapy. We have proposed a new method for the quantitative determination of Metopimazine by spectrophotometry. The drug is determined using a difference spectrophotometric technique based on the absorbance of its previously prepared sulfoxide derivative (lambda(max) = 355 nm, epsilon = 4.5 x 10(3) L/mol cm) relative to a solution of a non-derivatised drug. The sulfoxide derivative is formed quickly and quantitatively at room temperature by adding potassium caroate solution. The difference in the absorbance of solutions at 355 nm is proportional to the concentration of MPZ in the drug. The method is specific for an intact drug in the presence of oxidative and photochemical decomposition products and excipients. The linearity range is 0.9-30.0 mu g/mL. Regression line equation: Delta A = 0.0061 x c (r = 0.999), where c is the MPZ concentration in mu g/mL. The limit of quantitation, LOQ (10S), is 2.8 mu g/mL.

Additionally, we present a systematic derivation of perturbed charge density distributions in one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems and establish a conceptual link between FOs, electron delocalization, and the mesomeric effect, using the electron delocalization range function (EDR), offering insights into the reactivity of molecules featuring conjugated bonds. Finally, we propose an effective way to extend the analytical approach native to solid-state physics to describe charge oscillations in cumulenes and polyynes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5e70948d878c28a0473bf7ce","63574a29752340623bc01c6e","5fc4db0f085dcb1e6ae0b939"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"541-579","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63574a29752340623bc01c6e","5fc4db0f085dcb1e6ae0b939","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5e70948d878c28a0473bf7ce"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc33","mniswId":"13973","title":"Materials Chemistry Frontiers","issn":"2052-1537","eissn":"2052-1537","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"55d354ee-d4b3-4880-8a96-eb6e74e422d9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c6e773fdbe83570425492e","year":"2025","volume":"9","number":"4","documentHash":"11686b35-0335-4e8b-beee-da7c1a709ebe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060715139"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe83570426332a","name":"Silver‐Hamill","lastName":"Turren‐Cruz","documentHash":"6b8d96de-8af4-41ce-a88a-937bf800921b"},{"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe835704263329","name":"Iván","lastName":"Mora‐Seró","documentHash":"b716348a-1b58-45ef-bae8-85297b8d2553"},{"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe835704263327","name":"Jaime","lastName":"Espino‐Valencia","documentHash":"101c2567-a3c7-4a24-b42f-eae14c5abf00"},{"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe835704263326","name":"Tzarara","lastName":"López‐Luke","documentHash":"2d852695-1704-4955-81a8-9dea40d31c2a"},{"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe835704263325","name":"Diego","lastName":"Esparza","documentHash":"0d126192-7f5c-4a3e-ad84-7049a1b2fff3"},{"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe835704263324","name":"Jhonatan","lastName":"Rodríguez‐Pereira","documentHash":"ff7b05d5-8bfd-4de4-9084-bf9391d469be"},{"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe835704263323","name":"Carlos","lastName":"Echeverría‐Arrondo","documentHash":"913d4db9-adab-4cc6-8355-df26a743bb64"},{"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe835704263322","name":"Beatriz","lastName":"Julián‐López","documentHash":"f236ee85-1baf-441d-8d0f-9df6b97b42db"},{"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe835704263321","name":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Reyes‐Francis","documentHash":"67f6b490-fe31-40e0-90ce-e85d40733a1b"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"objectId":"67c6f5e1fdbe835704263320","doi":"10.1002/cssc.202402073","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202402073","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Enhancing Stability of Microwave‐Synthesized Cs<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub>Ti<sub>1‐x</sub>Br<sub>6</sub> Perovskite by Cation Mixing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The double-perovskite material Cs2TiBr6 shows excellent photovoltaic potential, making it a promising alternative to lead-based materials. However, its high susceptibility to degradation in air has raised concerns about its practical application. This study introduces an interesting synthesis approach that significantly enhances the stability of Cs2TiBr6 powder. We implemented a gradual cation exchange process by substituting Ti4+ with Sn4+ in the efficient microwave-assisted synthesis method, developing a double perovskite Cs2SnxTi1-xBr6 type. A systematic study of increasing concentration of Sn4+ in Cs2TiBr6 perovskite has been performed to analyze the effect of Sn-doping degree on the chemical and thermal stability of the material and the optical features in both nitrogen and ambient atmospheres, significantly increasing the stability of the material in the air for over a week. Furthermore, introducing Sn4+ results in a more uniform polygonal crystal morphology of the powders and a slight band gap broadening. We show that microwave-assisted synthesis is highly efficient and cost-effective in producing more sustainable lead-free perovskite materials with enhanced stability and desirable electrical characteristics. This work suggests a promising method for synthesizing perovskite materials, opening new routes for scientific research and applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c6f5e1fdbe835704263321","67c6f5e1fdbe835704263322","67c6f5e1fdbe835704263323","67c6f5e1fdbe835704263324","67c6f5e1fdbe835704263325","67c6f5e1fdbe835704263326","67c6f5e1fdbe835704263327","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","67c6f5e1fdbe835704263329","67c6f5e1fdbe83570426332a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775fc","mniswId":"3530","title":"ChemSusChem","issn":"1864-5631","eissn":"1864-564X","documentHash":"37969cbc-842d-4894-8b4e-ba81b8782780"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665d87634097073627d764c6","year":"2024","documentHash":"e54a071e-a8c0-47ae-a639-216a27c10d69"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060718689"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c80dd7fdbe83551ebee098","name":"S.","lastName":"Dietrich","documentHash":"62824fdb-2493-4113-a090-83d1aefb92ca"},{"objectId":"67c80dd7fdbe83551ebee097","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Volpe","documentHash":"8bb7fd16-b21e-400e-ad02-b61079a84ae8"},{"objectId":"67c80dd7fdbe83551ebee096","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Nowakowski","documentHash":"e3ae1c4d-82fd-4023-853a-ba8b4932b876"},{"objectId":"67244bbfece3984a396122a0","name":"Nima","lastName":"Farahmand Bafi","uuid":"2B6E49AB9409DB281A9F839A9F03EDB3559AD64901B99E3116F245C9CDDA8F7935A635A0C4726D74DAA513AE870482B2AC72D62E223446FAA7E7CA1ACA55E909","documentHash":"8facb5da-fa23-4631-8904-b5c2eb3f716c"},{"objectId":"5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","uuid":"4C8E231D76FA1FF9DEBFB40938EB36AF89D302A9BF4FB4483D4EB2BD2B36DFFFCE516493C98DF050048768547005AB2F2AB230D9F072ED3FD77064BDE749E112","orcidId":"0000-0003-4448-0686","documentHash":"22911df0-6857-4e43-8285-ca3bbbff21b2"}],"objectId":"67c80dd7fdbe83551ebee094","doi":"10.1063/5.0235449","publicUri":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0235449/20284605/214114_1_5.0235449.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Critical Casimir levitation of colloids above a bull’s-eye pattern","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Critical Casimir forces emerge among particles or surfaces immersed in a near-critical fluid, with the sign of the force determined by surface properties and with its strength tunable by minute temperature changes. Here, we show how such forces can be used to trap a colloidal particle and levitate it above a substrate with a bull's-eye pattern consisting of a ring with surface properties opposite to the rest of the substrate. Using the Derjaguin approximation and mean-field calculations, we find a rich behavior of spherical colloids at such a patterned surface, including sedimentation toward the ring and levitation above the ring (ring levitation) or above the bull's-eye's center (point levitation). Within the Derjaguin approximation, we calculate a levitation diagram for point levitation showing the depth of the trapping potential and the height at which the colloid levitates, both depending on the pattern properties, the colloid size, and the solution temperature. Our calculations reveal that the parameter space associated with point levitation shrinks if the system is driven away from a critical point, while, surprisingly, the trapping force becomes stronger. We discuss the application of critical Casimir levitation for sorting colloids by size and for determining the thermodynamic distance to criticality. Our results show that critical Casimir forces provide rich opportunities for controlling the behavior of colloidal particles at patterned surfaces."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67244bbfece3984a396122a0","5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"161","issue":"21","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c80dd7fdbe83551ebee096","67244bbfece3984a396122a0","67c80dd7fdbe83551ebee097","5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","67c80dd7fdbe83551ebee098"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478544","mniswId":"10440","title":"Journal of Chemical Physics","issn":"0021-9606","eissn":"1089-7690","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"20904248-8c4b-43a4-a2cb-343564302e7f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c80df7fdbe83551ebee24d","year":"2024","volume":"161","number":"21","doi":"","documentHash":"32b23590-f569-47d8-b6c1-1e61337aa058"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060718918"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c3127d9543c72336543c20","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kucharska","uuid":"EC354020F12D465E5F561D6264E0A745A8D56CB87DF57B0448EC13F0F8921E06820A1C18397E5797640769A562E48DF441F5040C5BB3536863C6E948D9EC5BAD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8756-2115","documentHash":"7cb69692-bfe5-4e66-b877-c70235e138f6"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bddde","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Haniewicz","uuid":"9412A4D254FE879076154B740853F4F5ED101554AFC64ED60560D5B9FAA5DB89B7D2AC04D817AFDAC27C2DA002B1AE6F9D17542AECF30F041473BF063DEBF8E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6298-7184","documentHash":"372f2381-6a6f-4d7c-a63c-e5d353325113"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b9717","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Magiera","uuid":"1E5D3969A685107F2DB3FC1CD786462F8E526B7BF236FA6AF57885335DB5C230BE72076C9DCBC4BF49A960192B7513E33BE338F8DDE07D2C5B50B1EE7DE56CF1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3307-2882","documentHash":"20c24c3f-49c6-4779-a08a-4e0c92b97d4a"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","name":"Karina","lastName":"Kwapiszewska","uuid":"B5FE41F14EEC666D304654994E6250629F4F330AF6CF26B5585E2C99E5641B03DFEB8EA8A3A168084B7D1ED1D12DA60714C2ED67A21A919BC975D9B8456110D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7396-9571","documentHash":"eb6a4320-99ed-48fa-8778-37744fd76b87"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff83","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kalwarczyk","uuid":"C20C7460B58056E7DB39CC026D3F927BC226B10A2E55E4637069300E0540A78242583C06C3D15E45021BD1341D285FDB7A1090462E54F219F12C0225D502F46A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1136-9789","documentHash":"c02947c5-f141-4301-bb56-f028adc37e23"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hołyst","uuid":"E92F295C3CC2CB6B18C450B2AB735CDA75E1B176DB096D3C43CB9E6E23F05E2B3448297032B471C71265740E595D30DAA6BA0B89CC0DB4589E73DB45075B7008","orcidId":"0000-0002-3211-4286","documentHash":"cbe7625d-9b95-4888-b28d-a8e3f921d07f"}],"objectId":"67c6f50dfdbe83570426105f","doi":"10.1039/d4nh00214h","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2025/NH/D4NH00214H","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Measurement of large ribosomal subunit size in cytoplasm and nucleus of living human cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ribosomes are the most essential macromolecules in cells, as they serve as production lines for every single protein.

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is used to measure both the rotational (similar to 14 ms-1) and translational (similar to 4 mu m2 s-1) diffusion coefficients of the 60S ribosomes directly within living human cells. Furthermore, we apply the empirical length-scale dependent viscosity model to calculate the hydrodynamic radius of 60S ribosomes, equal to similar to 15 nm, for the first time determined inside living cells. The FCS in YO-PRO-1 stained cells is used to assess ribosome abundance changes, exemplified in rapamycin-treated HeLa cells, highlighting its potential for dynamic ribosome characterization within the cellular environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bddde","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff83","5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","60c3127d9543c72336543c20","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","5e709445878c28a0473b9717"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"388-400","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709445878c28a0473b9717","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff83","5e709479878c28a0473bddde","5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","60c3127d9543c72336543c20"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cd47","mniswId":"14754","title":"NANOSCALE HORIZONS","issn":"2055-6756","eissn":"2055-6764","websiteLink":"http://www.rsc.org/journals-books-databases/about-journals/nanoscale-horizons/","documentHash":"a5d10f2b-c05e-4f53-b920-969cc1d10e0a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c6f50dfdbe835704261060","year":"2025","volume":"10","number":"2","documentHash":"8b1cf40d-d842-4614-be5a-67408d747aa7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060718962"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6700a4a9ece39845a3419d1d","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Fabjanowicz","uuid":"EB4541EFEF5791B0A40E0B35F919CA69F876B10540D05CE6925FE9CEA04CA20D3D751422C0FE8FF894945AFFB29C40859A71417AEDE3451D74CF1603752ECD7C","documentHash":"4f5c8b27-29bc-44aa-b943-c7221422cde2"},{"objectId":"60c2fe839543c72336543828","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Pielach","uuid":"E060F0C13AA2A9E4D92F5FE0A9940220C1433A865A0FFC4E7EA776D9427BE30895DFC20A20B173679C837B679E5D7899F6136654328947FA96A1F4B0439074F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6849-1980","documentHash":"b2f527ea-9a6e-4f11-8786-677ced7c0873"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde7c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jamrozik","uuid":"437CA3BEB502139FD0C881A453568CB4404A5C6E74A22D982D920DA3EECBD7AF9C0CCAF48D389B847F5DF5C1ED1428D094567071B4ACBDE5B0F5E64423E2C9D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-0188-8668","documentHash":"955cc5e1-1aa8-4521-a49a-2005a5ae6301"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Stepanenko","uuid":"BF57EE64971811A251374C75A08A64C7DC048997A86A87460BCC2CC8BC9E96C9DFF7EC1C40B0754A465BB2A8216565AC2EACDC66EAAA2EAAD983E233DEA89728","orcidId":"0000-0001-9919-4447","documentHash":"5f260202-2f2b-402d-83ac-ff29415a756b"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":"5FFECF2E5A62709C63A8D260B40C0CD90CF8BD0DCCB7FA27183145DDA5B5CBF16812F71E9EEBA4A8B79058C3D3533F3A261B5BDE1ED8D1DEAD6581D3C27C7140","orcidId":"0000-0001-7885-7395","documentHash":"c2d231ae-c19c-4fa0-aa50-7b4f82f3ffa2"}],"objectId":"67c81e79fdbe83551ebfe002","doi":"10.1016/j.yofte.2024.104055","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1068520024004000?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Quick fabrication method of a thermally expanded core in polarization-maintaining fibers using CO<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" altimg=\"si2.svg\" display=\"inline\" id=\"d1e274\"><mml:msub><mml:mrow/><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math> laser and fiber rotation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Maximizing the transmission of high-peak-power ultrashort pulses through joints between polarization- maintaining optical fibers with different mode field diameters is crucial for improving the efficiency of all-fiber laser systems. Here, we propose a method of fabricating a thermally expanded core by using a CO2 laser as a heating source that does not require a priori splicing of fibers. Unlike standard methods utilizing continuous heating of the fiber, usually on the time scale of minutes, we present the pulsed approach, which can reduce the duration of the whole process to below 30 s. Via fiber rotation, we tailor our method to polarization- maintaining optical fibers. Furthermore, we apply the thermally expanded core method to manufacturing mode field adapters between commercially available polarization-maintaining optical fibers. Exemplary splices reveal an increase in transmission of 30 %, enabling insertion losses lower than 0.4 dB. The presented methods of fabricating a thermally expanded core and mode field adapters show high potential for large-volume production, especially for high-power applications, as the splices can withstand peak powers as high as 50 kW."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","60c2fe839543c72336543828","5e709479878c28a0473bde7c","6700a4a9ece39845a3419d1d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"89","pagesFromTo":"104055","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde7c","60c2fe839543c72336543828","6700a4a9ece39845a3419d1d","5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547910c","mniswId":"15484","title":"Optical Fiber Technology","issn":"1068-5200","documentHash":"6f4dda88-ccba-438f-89c7-38e0ebecf82e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c81e79fdbe83551ebfe003","year":"2025","volume":"89","documentHash":"b07fd377-5620-4904-b99f-b39b828af961"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060722088"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe96e","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Maćkowski","documentHash":"d3b448d0-4460-409e-8792-531d8dd2af78"},{"objectId":"67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe96d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Szalkowski","documentHash":"da5e436c-e40b-4cb9-9799-c4e1602181f9"},{"objectId":"67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe96c","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Sulowska","documentHash":"814a5398-9e46-4603-8e57-733d808cb6fb"},{"objectId":"67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe96b","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Jankowska","documentHash":"98f8e46e-302d-4f12-88bc-d52dea6ae2f1"},{"objectId":"60c3504a9543c723365444c5","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Biały","uuid":"4104AC5915A41E864086AE981AE84C502DF3AE9B0BA5A2B58598D37CE5F14752FC0F3ADB3F89D5E0980D9ED666C39286163FA6C07128D9D40B2D4CBB9EFFA37A","documentHash":"b561e50c-ef30-4743-a9ec-b20e2b4b7050"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Niedziółka-Jönsson","uuid":"87A188D17120D3F4F55C5E1B0AA008499E9DC902A95D1C123E357F1DA1F7A976DFE69FEB7E38B942004B483B0B7F470AC78009BB04046308074F5705022474FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-9508-1373","documentHash":"3f269ce4-2f3f-4dd5-8a01-0de3a5a94550"}],"objectId":"67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe969","doi":"10.1039/d4cp03419h","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2025/CP/D4CP03419H","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Controlled encapsulation of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots in a microdroplet","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Precise deposition of materials on surfaces is one of the crucial steps in a broad range of applications and functional device fabrication at both the micro- and nanoscale.

Here, we present a method for reproducible, repetitive, and precise deposition of QD-containing microdroplets using hydrophobic micropipettes without any need to apply an actuation voltage. We show that upon deposition, the droplets can be translated across the surface and placed in defined patterns. The incorporation of semiconductor QDs allows for the confirmation of the morphological integrity of the microdroplets after deposition and translation. Fluorescence blinking observed for droplets containing highly diluted QD solution proves that our approach is suitable for embedding individual emitters in such microdroplets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c3504a9543c723365444c5","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"346-354","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c3504a9543c723365444c5","67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe96b","67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe96c","67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe96d","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55","67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe96e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547925d","mniswId":"16075","title":"PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS","issn":"1463-9076","documentHash":"8e732841-944b-4696-92c7-03b5ad988f7d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c81f06fdbe83551ebfe96a","year":"2025","volume":"27","number":"1","documentHash":"2b41868a-8017-43ad-8848-7e15d9e7eca5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060722178"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a6912fdbe831aedcff12c","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"7f6aa2cb-b621-4094-8b56-5e6e2201a9bc"},{"objectId":"679a6912fdbe831aedcff12b","name":"Dominik J.","lastName":"Kubicki","documentHash":"65f10939-e6b7-4be4-8333-ffc41f5d6f7b"},{"objectId":"679a6912fdbe831aedcff12a","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Scarperi","documentHash":"41b564c1-752f-4f34-889c-d17281b6a1d3"},{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","name":"Vishnu","lastName":"Anilkumar","uuid":"E6BC82950E1CF64BECDB4E8D419567829CC492010A2E46B331EFC93341CB90928D97A6E5D8D5F2AF41D1CFFB86D4ADC11ADEB9CC375327B4151EE8C1B4037AA1","documentHash":"49a79fc7-7dc7-4e98-a3f0-b2ba16d63798"},{"objectId":"622ac2387523402df090302f","name":"Apurba","lastName":"Mahapatra","uuid":"F2DEB44382B3C50E3C5F3B0E8B52AEFC51544CBCEE13E57FC5C3D36BEA9C5A9618DF2669D1B9C8FF03CE6915768200AED30EC87927651869124F9F7D6857049C","documentHash":"808f1973-fb72-42ba-aadc-e23d2aa5f66c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8ddf","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Mączka","uuid":"800F0F43ECE30A3187CFAB3F05579FE314D7E0AB933C50405AD9CA11DC97C393394581CAE8EF6DC954E8BA14D9A9FE3E1F73DCFD9376F0343FBE89FF2E9D818F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2978-1093","documentHash":"65a4e146-e5f8-40df-8333-2075e84f7693"}],"objectId":"679a6912fdbe831aedcff126","doi":"10.1021/acsphotonics.4c00599","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsphotonics.4c00599","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Methylhydrazinium Lead Halide Perovskites: Effect of Composition and Dimensionality on Their Optoelectronic and Photodetection Properties","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb9","uid":"bpq3XEoTuWT9uiSQASO_7cA","uuid":"0f0762c0-9894-4415-abdf-24cbd96b7045","name":"Instytut Niskich Temperatur i Badań Strukturalnych im.

In this study, we utilized CuAAC and RuAAC reactions to synthesize a series of organometallic–erlotinib conjugates. Erlotinib is an important anti-non-small cell lung cancer drug with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR TK) inhibitory activity. Our studies show that ferrocenyl–erlotinib conjugates are more anticancer active than their ruthenocenyl and [Re2(μ-Cl)2(CO)6(μ-1,2-diazine)] counterparts against lung cancer A549 and Calu3 cells. Our most active conjugate, 3, demonstrates an IC50 value of 2.33 ± 0.94 μM against erlotinib-resistant A549 cells. Its mechanism of anticancer action involves a combination of EGFR TK inhibitory activity and the capability to generate reactive oxygen species in lung cancer cells. Interestingly, one of the anticancer-inactive ruthenocenyl–erlotinib conjugates showed inhibitory activity toward the replication of influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) in MDCK cells. Furthermore, the same compound inhibits the entry of coronavirus SARS-CoV-1 and -2 into host human HEK293T cells expressing ACE-2 and TMPRSS2. We showed that this anticoronavirus activity results from the inhibition of ACE-2/TMPRSS2-driven spike protein proteolytic activation. The question of whether the discovered virus entry inhibition mechanism involves direct binding of the conjugate to ACE-2 or involves additional mediators, such as EGFR, remains open."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","uid":"b4-9zzGvUfyUhirAhWcr-QA","uuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","name":"Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d1c7","61e8d73975234061bbd34120"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","parentUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","rootUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66fcb029ece39865c2f7f649","5e709490878c28a0473bf957"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","issue":"20","pagesFromTo":"2505-2519","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67332738fdbe8343db2044db","61e8d73975234061bbd34120","5e709490878c28a0473bf957","66fcb029ece39865c2f7f649","67332738fdbe8343db2044de","67332738fdbe8343db2044df","67332738fdbe8343db2044e0","5e7092cd878c28a04739d1c7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547913c","mniswId":"15554","title":"ORGANOMETALLICS","issn":"0276-7333","documentHash":"df37afed-e72c-4dd6-8ca6-5f2d907accff"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67332738fdbe8343db2044da","year":"2024","volume":"43","number":"20","documentHash":"d42efd2c-2418-4bbb-946d-bdae5ea63556"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR","ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES","KINASE INHIBITORS","PHASE","GEMCITABINE","VINORELBINE","CISPLATIN","COMPLEX","DRUGS","LUMINESCENT"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060766916"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62fcce854097074498b22808","name":"Albert","lastName":"Poater","documentHash":"eed589ab-007a-4222-b160-c1b531b5a06d"},{"objectId":"62fcce854097074498b22807","name":"Artur","lastName":"Brotons-Rufes","documentHash":"ee544eb8-d43c-43d5-bddc-6e7b45aa9443"},{"objectId":"62fcce854097074498b22806","name":"Michał","lastName":"Nowacki","documentHash":"d75d05a4-be41-4dc9-b26e-64e4d6fa15da"},{"objectId":"62fcce854097074498b22805","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Dolna","documentHash":"0c7600a0-e083-4977-83c6-f056c7c829a3"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Danylyuk","uuid":"76C9B1CC8BF786B245E6E064FB1EF762E68427200C6553653512B713F436D343D13A0FB2F4895E1A41BC3AF4C15135CAD6F23994A9FF03CEFCD8BF9C0FB1D1C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3653-2418","documentHash":"f0349659-5182-4ae8-aa50-8a56d0ae53e1"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa8fc","name":"Michał","lastName":"MICHALAK","uuid":"A714AF40FB0C2CA0B3725F83D90D2DAC716B0980C4AC8C83A14F91512BFF9E89DF3687AF83040D8002D5F88A2B4CC32830908E7A99A71175CFAE5A6A7D1C3794","orcidId":"0000-0002-1193-1551","documentHash":"6e023e8e-6b40-4fce-a8d5-7395ca86949c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-08","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62fcce854097074498b22803","doi":"10.1021/acs.joc.2c00380","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.joc.2c00380","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"NHC–BIAN–Cu(I)-Catalyzed Friedländer-Type Annulation of 2-Amino-3-(per)fluoroacetylpyridines with Alkynes on Water","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The direct catalytic alkynylation/dehydrative cyclization of 2-amino-3-trifluoroacetyl-pyridines on water wasdeveloped for the efficient synthesis of a broad range offluorinated 1,8-naphthyridines from terminal alkynes.

The impact of sterichindrance at the metal center and theflexibility of substituents on the imidazole ring of the NHC on catalytic performance are also discussed"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa8fc","62fcce854097074498b22805","62fcce854097074498b22806"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"87","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"6115-6136","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62fcce854097074498b22805","62fcce854097074498b22806","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c","62fcce854097074498b22807","62fcce854097074498b22808","5e70937a878c28a0473aa8fc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478945","mniswId":"12131","title":"Journal of Organic Chemistry","issn":"0022-3263","eissn":"1520-6904","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"958597dc-a6d5-4ce5-be9b-fe6c5a348051"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62fcceb14097074498b22aa8","year":"2022","volume":"87","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"406d5c00-8028-47a7-b2fa-8df9280c8394"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060774140"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6707c003fdbe834564da0a4c","name":"Paweł K.","lastName":"Włodarski","documentHash":"bbfad42e-3eba-4c56-b20f-6e9d7c1b671b"},{"objectId":"6707c003fdbe834564da0a4b","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kopka","documentHash":"607d4d90-b7f4-46fc-8466-3cd0d4aada7a"},{"objectId":"6707c003fdbe834564da0a4a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kopka","documentHash":"0eee2af6-bb2c-4b47-be9a-d9ae6ab6e1a1"},{"objectId":"6707c003fdbe834564da0a49","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Sobczak","documentHash":"faf35531-8653-4ab5-8cd8-8a36d981ca1f"},{"objectId":"6707c003fdbe834564da0a48","name":"Albert","lastName":"Stachura","documentHash":"3da154f4-d420-411a-acbf-7798a4c2fe65"},{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bf9b5","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kędra","uuid":"23FCCD4048052A32338AE9AD55F4CBA31ECEAD2B9292D718E9EE2ABCC3F2877CB1E2901F1BEEB8BC252294DBB3D5F6D44E078619A7A0DA2717FB8E3D74269026","orcidId":"0000-0002-3696-1618","documentHash":"67f910a2-70f2-4d84-a624-eb2c50422479"}],"objectId":"6707c003fdbe834564da0a47","doi":"10.3390/ijms25189986","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/18/9986/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Influence of N-Acetylcysteine-Enriched Hydrogels on Wound Healing in a Murine Model of Type II Diabetes Mellitus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Diabetes mellitus (DM) severely impairs skin wound healing capacity, yet few treatment options exist to enhance this process. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that improves cellular proliferation and enhances wound healing in healthy animals, yet its use in the context of type II DM has not been studied. The aim of our research was to investigate the effect of topically applied NAC-enriched hydrogels on wound healing in a leptin-deficient murine wound model. Four excisional wounds were created on the backs of 20 db/db mice and were subsequently treated with hydrogels containing NAC at concentrations of 5%, 10% and 20% or placebo (control). Healing was monitored for 28 days; photographs of the wounds were taken on every third day. Wound tissues were harvested on days 3, 7, 14 and 28 to undergo histological examinations. Wounds treated with 5% NAC showed improved wound closure speed accompanied by an increased dermal proliferation area on microscopic assessment compared with other groups. Higher concentrations of NAC failed to show a beneficial effect on wound healing. 5% NAC improved early stages of wound healing in a murine model of type II DM by increasing wound closure speed, likely mediated by improved dermal proliferation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709490878c28a0473bf9b5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"9986","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6707c003fdbe834564da0a48","6707c003fdbe834564da0a49","5e709490878c28a0473bf9b5","6707c003fdbe834564da0a4a","6707c003fdbe834564da0a4b","6707c003fdbe834564da0a4c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66e27f9ffdbe83163aab7bcd","year":"2024","volume":"25","number":"18","documentHash":"5735a8d9-1699-4e3e-84f9-087319354f96"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060803318"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67fe7250fdbe837d214af667","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wach","documentHash":"c976c802-127c-41cd-80cd-a42cf7ea2f3e"},{"objectId":"67fe7250fdbe837d214af666","name":"Zou","lastName":"Xianshao","documentHash":"a15da8fc-a812-4405-8c0c-3d2e4dde8e31"},{"objectId":"67fe7250fdbe837d214af665","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sá","documentHash":"b17bd5a7-6188-4dc2-8daf-114d5c828ab2"},{"objectId":"6488633c4097072fd7703390","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Palmisano","documentHash":"29c64605-aec2-4eb5-a8aa-13f94b771f9a"},{"objectId":"6488633c4097072fd770338f","name":"Corrado","lastName":"Garlisi","documentHash":"114542c1-054d-4ff4-92dc-f8144c35db4a"},{"objectId":"6488633c4097072fd770338e","name":"Yves","lastName":"Kayser","documentHash":"1e60de2b-5dfa-4acc-8e27-a8ddce8955f2"},{"objectId":"6488633c4097072fd770338c","name":"Xianshao","lastName":"Zou","documentHash":"a48d2417-3eff-43e7-bdfe-3b4a0cb65991"},{"objectId":"622036397523402df08c206c","name":"Jacinto","lastName":"Sa","uuid":"87182E2E0888DA41C757B81B2143E2316665900AFDCDE55D96C088AFA76BAFB6A4F1AA06C4EDA6BD452B1F53C7A1CCDD6A3E7FE74E2E496F4852B0410671F4C6","documentHash":"b4c2efbd-ab85-495c-833b-083d3a9f0f35"},{"objectId":"618353b97523400564d82082","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Wojtaszek","uuid":"06BF9225C77553572BF38084BDA4421F9BA7C878B722F78508D0A68BDC27CA07E6C720712A535803ACDBF7A1F1B36E70D6F9B9356EF79319EE8F189BDFEC16A0","documentHash":"40cb6f73-dfc1-4e79-a5b5-36dcf995fdc0"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397c2c","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Szlachetko","uuid":"CBFD946E3064E9CAB5B0BB644F9088EBA6EB3459C542F749E49A1FD2BD86309841B9142F0C36A9756815B6083DA6493CBA7429E06A1FA1D104F34C818976B453","orcidId":"0000-0002-7526-3097","documentHash":"7d3289a8-2522-46b8-b8df-d75984555f4f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6488633c4097072fd7703389","doi":"10.1002/xrs.3363","publicUri":"https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/xrs.3363","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Towards understanding the $TiO_{2}$ doping at the surface and bulk","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Anatase titanium dioxide is a common photocatalyst with limited application scope due to its wide band gap energy. Valence and conduction band doping have long been used to narrow TiO2 band gap energy. The effectiveness of the process is highly dependent on the procedure adopted, and its underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Importantly, optical changes caused by bulk doping are not always represented at the surface where the catalysis occurs. Therefore, methodologies sensitive to bulk and surface modifications are key for a holistic understanding of the doping mechanism and its effect on photocatalysis quantum yield. Herein, it is proposed the use of X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with different probing depths to elucidate the chemical composition of bulk and surface. Soft XAS was employed to determine the chemical state of typical dopants (N and Cu) in TiO2 thin films. The XAS measurements at N K‐edge and Cu L2,3‐edge were performed in surface and bulk‐sensitive detection modes, providing direct insight into the surface‐bulk effects caused by the dopants. In the case of copper doping in the TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> conduction band, the data show the formation of Cu2+ in the bulk states. In contrast, the surface states are dominated by Cu<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> components resulting from surface termination geometries. Moreover, X‐ray absorption spectra confirmed that the substitutional mechanism is the dominant process in Cu doping. The nitrogen doping was found to be interstitial, causing minor changes to the band structure but affecting the photoluminescence.

The prepared samples were characterized using FT-IR, PXRD, TEM, SEM, and EDX techniques. The KL@Ni@g-C3N4 nanocomposite was drop-cast on a graphite electrode. Subsequently, this fabricated electrode was used to detect cypermethrin (CYP) residues in drinking water. The redox properties of the fabricated sensors were evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The limit of detection (LOD) of the fabricated sensor was determined to be 0.026 mu g mL(-1), which is below the maximum residual limits of CYP in the environment (0.5 mu g mL(-1)) and within the acceptable range for food products (similar to 0.05 to 0.2 mu g mL(-1)).

The proposed in situ doping technique capitalizes on the high electronegativity of fluorine, ensuring the stability of CoF2 throughout the synthesis process. The nanoporous layer formation, resulting from anodic oxide dissolution in the presence of fluoride ions, is expected to facilitate the effective incorporation of cobalt compounds into the film. The research explores the impact of dopant concentration in the electrolyte, conducting a comprehensive characterization of the resulting materials, including morphology, composition, optical, electrochemical, and photoelectrochemical properties. The successful doping of WO3 was confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Mott-Schottky analysis. Optical studies reveal lower absorption in Co-doped materials, with a slight shift in band gap energies. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) analysis demonstrates improved PEC activity for Co-doped layers, with the observed shift in photocurrent onset potential attributed to both cobalt and fluoride ions catalytic effects. The study includes an in-depth discussion of the observed phenomena and their implications for applications in solar water splitting, emphasizing the potential of the anodic Co-F-WO3 layers as efficient photoelectrodes. In addition, the research presents a comprehensive exploration of the electrochemical synthesis and characterization of anodic Co-F-WO3, emphasizing their photocatalytic properties for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It was found that Co-doped WO3 materials exhibited higher PEC activity, with a maximum 5-fold enhancement compared to pristine materials. Furthermore, the studies demonstrated that these photoanodes can be effectively reused for PEC water-splitting experiments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii

In this work, we describe the utilization of light energy converted to the surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) for the initiation of photocatalytic reactions (semiconductor photocatalysis). Irradiation of silver nanowires coated with titanium dioxide results in the SPPs propagation and excitation of the photocatalytic system ca. 10 μm away from the illumination spot. The reaction progress is revealed by transforming almost nonfluorescent 3′-(p-aminophenyl) fluorescein to strongly emitting fluorescein. Remote plasmonic photocatalysis can be further explored in the fields of photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and sensorics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c3504a9543c723365444c5","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602de8b99543c7410626e7e8","5e709316878c28a0473a2a0e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"128","issue":"50","pagesFromTo":"21343–21348","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c81d96fdbe83551ebfda2d","60c3504a9543c723365444c5","67c81d96fdbe83551ebfda2e","67c81d96fdbe83551ebfda2f","67c81d96fdbe83551ebfda31","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55","5e709316878c28a0473a2a0e","602de8b99543c7410626e7e8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a2","mniswId":"12286","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry C","issn":"1932-7447","eissn":"1932-7455","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c69a966f-fba3-41b9-8902-e029fec3f1ca"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060875801"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67a4e5fcfdbe8362a56bc920","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Pietrzykowski","documentHash":"34fa8e28-7b0f-4e8c-8f12-205e3d04786f"},{"objectId":"67a4e5fcfdbe8362a56bc91e","name":"Marta","lastName":"Lemieszka","documentHash":"2ee6c6c1-4b70-44b7-a7c6-abb879639c3a"},{"objectId":"67a4e5fcfdbe8362a56bc91b","name":"Krzesimir","lastName":"Korona","documentHash":"ac7dd4d0-5608-41ec-82a3-dff8060fa8cd"},{"objectId":"5fc4db0f085dcb1e6ae0b939","name":"James Lawrence","lastName":"Pogrebetsky","uuid":"C81EDC2D504014D35CF4A15E6108A66AE426CCF2602BCF742013457CF844F795F33F309D30C50E43819E92690FE175A5C610BEE7168F4E262D6684C81FF695FF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0879-1498","documentHash":"bb63cd97-c1d4-43be-8076-78675fda0bbe"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kubas","uuid":"5502D7BBD854811ACE4A362AACF7E8E88D472EBF744D8A7CA3375962360A19B8C994FD5882E9191B79B6745D5F7A3AB2529D5A4D64C8AFBB3B7204C8694C6382","orcidId":"0000-0002-5508-0533","documentHash":"9f31decc-1aaa-47ff-8296-c27349c11c1e"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7cad","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bernatowicz","uuid":"40D29098F9743D6D91679CED45A43973D1A88464303D2A028CFEB3FE0C5030015CBF645DEF38136E22002A41DF2B95857F07E20977D64B0858903BD045636D6E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-0380","documentHash":"d73f2305-f1cd-4d43-a7d0-454ce3401fad"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b587c","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Justyniak","uuid":"3249E5EE5B9D2B8E1E4F8CFF41B8188B509841A2DB4AFE2ECC68C77CE2DAD28C7BDF06ADDB39539D8AEDCAB5270B6FDE67A5143CDF5AD7C7DFBFC490F5EEFF86","orcidId":"0000-0002-4392-0267","documentHash":"4858b12b-ff49-4bd3-acb9-d92db32a8656"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"9BB0811617F37A3C112AC89C1AB184813530B9CAE96BA8B681D4AB1BAAAB23BD3D2582BB3010CF1C2228858BC7D1F3D96B655DFB488EF0C406CA60C54014C8EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3407-0395","documentHash":"5dab1440-5edf-40d2-afdd-05ff37f8a8af"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6720ccd1fdbe831a48ac7954","doi":"10.1039/d4cc03672g","publicUri":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/cc/d4cc03672g","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Controlled hydrolysis of AlMe3 to tetramethylalumoxane and a new look at incipient adducts with water","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present an efficient route to tetramethylalumoxane by the controlled hydrolysis of AlMe3 in the presence of pyridine.

Furthermore, application of the femtosecond laser facilitates tailoring of the microcavity's shape with high degree of flexibility. Over the years, various µIMZI have been reported, where RI sensing has been mainly analyzed but no impact of the microcavity shape has been shown up to date. Thus, on top of the review on µIMZIs, in this work, we discuss the impact of the shape of the on the sensing performance of the device. We use two representative examples of microcavity shapes, i.e., U-shape and V-trench, made in a standard single-mode fiber. Despite different shapes, both structures offer similar and high RI sensitivity (exceeding 13,000 nm/RIU in the RI range 1.333–1.340 RIU). However, the performance of the structures in microfluidic systems is different. Based on the experimental results and numerical simulations, the advantages and disadvantages of different shapes are discussed for their application in investigations of liquids and biosensing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dede","uid":"bdoAFCGTorZ9N_5NoE6bisA","uuid":"d86ce494-55e8-4d01-929c-48a2908e6e5a","name":"Instytut Łączności - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70932a878c28a0473a4087"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dede","parentUuid":"d86ce494-55e8-4d01-929c-48a2908e6e5a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dede","rootUuid":"d86ce494-55e8-4d01-929c-48a2908e6e5a","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"73","pagesFromTo":"103059","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aacb2840970732a0a275b3","63aacb2840970732a0a275b4","63aacb2840970732a0a275b5","63aacb2840970732a0a275b6","5e70932a878c28a0473a4087","63aacb2840970732a0a275b8","63aacb2840970732a0a275b9","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547910c","mniswId":"15484","title":"Optical Fiber Technology","issn":"1068-5200","documentHash":"6f4dda88-ccba-438f-89c7-38e0ebecf82e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63aacb2840970732a0a275b2","year":"2022","volume":"73","documentHash":"5544fdd7-7523-4c88-aef5-2a0049d564fe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060887370"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e248e","name":"Mauro","lastName":"Sbragaglia","documentHash":"0ff075a6-247f-4c3b-8759-ae16e7b2a9a6"},{"objectId":"6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e248d","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Pierno","documentHash":"8bf20522-75fc-4edf-831b-e894ccda5894"},{"objectId":"6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e248c","name":"Daniele","lastName":"Filippi","documentHash":"b5cdb4eb-a4f4-4b58-8612-f21194f60ece"},{"objectId":"6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e248b","name":"Francesca","lastName":"Pelusi","documentHash":"7b9e32f7-5ebf-472b-9c3b-b630b17bddc3"},{"objectId":"5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","name":"Ladislav","lastName":"Derzsi","uuid":"298610A9E3EFD4BD025EE078249F66C3169768A76BA240CFC716072496622CB734DDFCDAE10CFF3D6DCF9853F31A90480F1F1E643D5C8E3147B5E6B43B92C460","orcidId":"0000-0002-3562-0758","documentHash":"d22f43d7-cee1-47a3-9c48-45099bf80c18"}],"objectId":"6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e2489","doi":"10.1039/d4sm00041b","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/SM/D4SM00041B","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Emulsions in microfluidic channels with asymmetric boundary conditions and directional surface roughness: stress and rheology","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The flow of emulsions in confined microfluidic channels is affected by surface roughness. Directional roughness effects have recently been reported in channels with asymmetric boundary conditions featuring a flat wall, and a wall textured with directional roughness, the latter promoting a change in the velocity profiles when the flow direction of emulsions is inverted [D. Filippi et al., Adv. Mater. Technol., 2023, 8, 2201748]. An operative protocol is needed to reconstruct the stress profile inside the channel from velocity data to shed light on the trigger of the directional response. To this aim, we performed lattice Boltzmann numerical simulations of the flow of model emulsions with a minimalist model of directional roughness in two dimensions: a confined microfluidic channel with one flat wall and the other patterned by right-angle triangular-shaped posts. Simulations are essential to develop a protocol based on mechanical arguments to reconstruct stress profiles. Hence, one can analyze data to relate directional effects in velocity profiles to different rheological responses close to the rough walls associated with opposite flow directions. We finally show the universality of this protocol by applying it to other realizations of directional roughness by considering experimental data on emulsions in a microfluidic channel featuring a flat wall and a wall textured by herringbone-shaped roughness.\nNumerical simulations help in elaborating a validated protocol for reconstructing stress profiles in channels with asymmetric boundary conditions and directional roughness, which is crucial for investigating rheological responses near the rough wall."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"26","pagesFromTo":"5203-5211","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e248b","6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e248c","5fc4e015085dcb1e6ae0b945","6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e248d","6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e248e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547979e","mniswId":"18664","title":"Soft Matter","issn":"1744-683X","eissn":"1744-6848","documentHash":"bbdb4708-4eef-4305-9152-1191418727e5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6810c7ddfdbe835d2c8e248a","year":"2024","volume":"20","number":"26","documentHash":"c53b24ca-0791-486d-ae33-c3a02f61c2ff"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060927086"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a6","name":"Elham","lastName":"Bahreini","documentHash":"f8026332-abf7-4aff-80cb-c6cac6c5fa8b"},{"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a5","name":"Fereshte","lastName":"Barjesteh","documentHash":"b6b453da-63e7-46b2-af01-dd604c3086d9"},{"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a4","name":"Zeinab","lastName":"Fathi","documentHash":"f969d9f2-3438-468e-9465-10d75d56ade9"},{"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a3","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Yaghoubzad-Maleki","documentHash":"6dd334dd-df7e-4d53-9840-ca706ef895ba"},{"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a2","name":"Mohsen","lastName":"Nabi-Afjadi","documentHash":"21ae1c32-eab3-4eaf-9573-613ff7c8b13a"},{"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a1","name":"Nafiseh","lastName":"Heidari-Kalvani","documentHash":"440a5ed3-c564-40b9-9708-f87d2f15e8ac"},{"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a0","name":"Bagher","lastName":"Seyedalipour","documentHash":"507d068d-9ba0-4edc-b47b-f970bd123ae3"},{"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e159f","name":"Farnoosh","lastName":"Gholami","documentHash":"a1243062-56ad-4dc8-bf4a-d21a0c12da3c"},{"objectId":"60c2fc239543c7233654339a","name":"Iraj","lastName":"Alipourfard","uuid":"09F87F13C145EAA33D5D3E392CC52D6627B20E2FB071920A9AC8A55B4EFE06CCFDC635D1FBCFD0C3CE2E997891A272F5A4326A19832587B921FF5E5C935B8BC5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5164-8606","documentHash":"92b7f0ed-674e-4ca5-b512-5aa90affbef8"}],"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e159d","doi":"10.1007/s00210-024-03191-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00210-024-03191-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Catharanthine, an anticancer vinca alkaloid: an in silico and in vitro analysis of the autophagic system as the major mechanism of cell death in liver HepG2 cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Catharanthine, a component of the anticancer drug vinblastine along with vindoline, disrupts the cell cycle by interfering with mitotic spindle formation. Apart from their antioxidant properties, vinca alkaloids like catharanthine inhibit phosphodiesterase activity and elevate intracellular cAMP levels. The aim of this study was to investigate how catharantine affects apoptosis and autophagy. This study conducted experiments on HepG2 liver carcinoma cells with varying doses of catharanthine to evaluate cell death rates and viability and determine the IC50 concentration via MTT assays. The apoptotic and autophagic effects of catharanthine were assessed using flow cytometry with annexin V and PI staining, while the expression of autophagy-related genes was analyzed through quantitative PCR. Additionally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to further investigate catharanthine's impact on autophagy mechanisms. The study showed that catharanthine reduced oxidative stress and triggered apoptosis in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Catharanthine also upregulated the expression of autophagy-related genes like LC3, Beclin1, and ULK1. Notably, catharanthine increased sirtuin-1 levels, a known autophagy inducer, while decreasing Akt expression compared to untreated cells. Molecular docking results indicated rapamycin had a stronger binding affinity with FRB (-10.7 KJ/mol(-1)) than catharanthine (-7.3 KJ/mol(-1)). Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that catharanthine interacted effectively with the FRB domain of mTOR, displaying stability and a strong binding affinity, although not as potent as rapamycin. In summary, besides its cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects, catharanthine activates autophagy signaling pathways and induces autophagic necrosis by inhibiting mTOR."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"397","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"8879-8892","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e159f","6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a0","6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a1","6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a2","6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a3","6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a4","60c2fc239543c7233654339a","6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a5","6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e15a6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f9c","mniswId":"14856","title":"Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology","issn":"0028-1298","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3a12fc73-1aab-444e-9c05-18beae008a61"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6810c6fcfdbe835d2c8e159e","year":"2024","volume":"397","number":"11","documentHash":"8e795622-176d-4641-a5ac-077949a51f9c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060962581"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66fe5657fdbe8364a4021659","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zielińska-Jurek","documentHash":"090e0fe2-3c3d-45ef-8387-f082154f7fe1"},{"objectId":"66fe5657fdbe8364a4021658","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Trykowski","documentHash":"ec671798-ba4d-4b96-b713-7fb5ef1d5366"},{"objectId":"66fe5657fdbe8364a4021656","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Karczewski","documentHash":"f7540b6d-2c49-46cf-8363-01aea8435c62"},{"objectId":"66fe5657fdbe8364a4021655","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Dudziak","documentHash":"e213822d-319d-48b0-86b6-ce63f936d913"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Nikiforow","uuid":"E166453BA6868F48895D87A86E6702843A623A59A84923A7C78B7FFBB992983C7D95FE6E5E79D29AB2127112DC3887B27E8FB1E44DE4688F1367FD5EA5783F74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6135-8514","documentHash":"c96f36f3-357e-4938-9d4c-83e71d392895"},{"objectId":"5e709350878c28a0473a7202","name":"Adam","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":"866C67DB9CC663F085B96F89B215768DF21F8F5D5C65EA14D4C5BBC9E3C7859D35E4A866EAE79092C73D32144BDC6F9206E01002EFC27A2735055DE2E27B2389","orcidId":"0000-0002-3936-5184","documentHash":"968b7521-9b19-42fc-82ce-90b7815dce7c"}],"objectId":"66fe5657fdbe8364a4021653","doi":"10.1021/acsmaterialsau.4c00008","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsmaterialsau.4c00008","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Fine-Tuning the Photocatalytic Activity of the Anatase {1 0 1} Facet through Dopant-Controlled Reduction of the Spontaneously Present Donor State Density","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present study highlights the importance of the net density of charge carriers at the ground state on photocatalytic activity of the faceted particles, which can be seen as a highly underexplored problem. To investigate it in detail, we have systematically doped {1 0 1} enclosed anatase nanoparticles with Gd3+ ions to manipulate the charge carrier concentration. Furthermore, control experiments using an analogical Nb5+ doped sample were performed to discuss photocatalytic activity in the increased range of free electrons. Overall results showed significant enhancement of phenol degradation rate and coumarin hydroxylation, together with an increase of the designed Gd/Ti ratio up to 0.5 at. %. Simultaneously, the mineralization efficiency, measured as a TOC reduction, was controlled between the samples. The observed activity enhancement is connected with the controlled decrease of the donor state density within the materials, being the net effect of the spontaneously present defects and introduced dopants, witch reduce hydroxylation and the hole trapping ability of the {1 0 1} facets. This allows to fine-tune multi-/single-electron processes occurring over the prepared samples, leading to clear activity maxima for 4-nitrophenol reduction, H2O2 generation, and OH formation observed for different donor densities. The optimized material exceeds the activity of the TiO2 P25 for phenol degradation by 52% (377% after surface normalization), showing its suitable design for water treatment. These results present a promising approach to boost photocatalyst activity as the combined result of the exposed crystal facet and dopant-optimized density of ground-state charge carriers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea6","uid":"bi95ii9AQejdp_lpyj6STtw","uuid":"1655155c-28da-45e1-ac0f-77c46dde131e","name":"Instytut Fizyki Molekularnej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709350878c28a0473a7202"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea6","parentUuid":"1655155c-28da-45e1-ac0f-77c46dde131e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea6","rootUuid":"1655155c-28da-45e1-ac0f-77c46dde131e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"4","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"436-449","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66fe5657fdbe8364a4021655","66fe5657fdbe8364a4021656","5e709350878c28a0473a7202","66fe5657fdbe8364a4021658","5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","66fe5657fdbe8364a4021659"]},"journal":{"objectId":"64f04bf6cf9a7471b0ea3d45","mniswId":"31064","title":"ACS Materials Au","eissn":"2694-2461","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"54b9ee09-f9fe-46c4-b372-8786031ca82a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fe5657fdbe8364a4021654","year":"2024","volume":"4","number":"4","documentHash":"9d8be70f-a447-4f69-994b-6b9952cae62c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["TiO2","crystal facets","doping","donor density","ROS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060970151"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"660708ec40970745a4ffc258","name":"Debashis","lastName":"Mondal","documentHash":"e876e7d2-a950-4191-ac4f-7f5c781fd9b0"},{"objectId":"5ebeda8e752340254fc4191f","name":"Esma","lastName":"Abdurakhmanova","uuid":"E39387C4DFA88764F6E557C844CA3CEFCE7F502CE0C2936D4651B6EF9F7379A3E44F3DC62D183E6904B70149D2166DDFA5E26542799F4F1BCED765C2F61DCD50","orcidId":"0000-0002-7071-7125","documentHash":"ec7fdb98-1ccf-447e-9628-a106b50b7386"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b76a3","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Jędrzejewska","uuid":"6641986BD79904D7EC9830DDBD8D1A9102DD84A2C21C102D174221A5F4CA2280B5A4C88C1E4569731D04F9A99B198CF19CF86C68D383FB084AC3EDFF508A5560","orcidId":"0000-0002-4789-1571","documentHash":"00ec68a1-3187-4f47-8f2a-8ea1542d262d"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Danylyuk","uuid":"76C9B1CC8BF786B245E6E064FB1EF762E68427200C6553653512B713F436D343D13A0FB2F4895E1A41BC3AF4C15135CAD6F23994A9FF03CEFCD8BF9C0FB1D1C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3653-2418","documentHash":"f0349659-5182-4ae8-aa50-8a56d0ae53e1"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa96e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"SZUMNA","uuid":"A517DABD36EC5B08BA10DCC47BA90CA25DB28E7571B399994984E57865A738828179A73C992DC45C5F5BABD354509AD84182F2698BD2E1A13C87FECB124C9951","orcidId":"0000-0003-3869-1321","documentHash":"77f1e058-ad48-4110-bdb5-369ad0d0b2fa"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa8be","name":"Piotr","lastName":"CMOCH","uuid":"A10DC8E8AB70828BFAAF1E4F2CB344E7C14E1702E0E81DC1B010857EDB0A0137894653BA2D9F0057905342E51679BB71701C09B882839C6324286D8CB11375CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8413-9290","documentHash":"788fafb8-5ff3-4d3f-9b73-21a9bee8484c"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d31","name":"Michał","lastName":"Chmielewski","uuid":"C675426453123C4649C45B91D84F3AB6B9FE50338239842F11D3967A8372D8E34A9A6C923E38247AAD317546D5887D6233FCD85357D2C02FB8B4E9C3C956C22B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3703-7670","documentHash":"b7bc6d42-2cba-47e9-a8ab-5d7fee3b9aa2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"660708ec40970745a4ffc256","doi":"10.1016/j.chempr.2024.03.003","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929424001128?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Supramolecular umpolung: Converting electron-rich resorcin[4]arenes into potent CH-bonding anion receptors and transporters","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"CH hydrogen bonding receptors constitute an emerging class of anion sensors and transporters, which, owing to their high proteolytic and pH resistance, are promising for biological applications. CH groups, however, are considered as weak hydrogen bond donors, requiring activation by strongly electron-withdrawing substituents. Accordingly, electron-rich aromatic rings have never been used for this purpose thus far. In this work, we demonstrate that resorcin[4]arenes, well known as π-electron-rich cation receptors, can be converted into CH-bonding anion receptors by simple substitution with four nitro groups. Owing to their unique geometric features, tetranitroresorcin[4]arenes acquire large dipole moments (up to 15.8 D) and highly positive electrostatic potentials at the lower rim, leading to remarkable anion affinities (Ka(Cl−) = 1.36 × 105 M−1 in THF).

Hence, this work concerns the application of three hydrotalcite-derived materials with different CuZnAl molar ratios in the liquid-phase continuous-flow hydrogenation of 2-methyl-2-pentenal (MPEA) at a wide range of temperature (298–378 K) and pressure (1 × 106–6 × 106 Pa). The catalytic investigations were supported by catalysts characterization by ICP-OES, TPR, in situ XRD, XPS, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, and TEM measurements on different stages of their biography. It was shown that the catalytic activity of these samples is related to the Cu0/Cu+ ratio. Depending on the reaction conditions, selectivity control is possible. All catalysts were 100% selective to 2-methylpentanal (MPAA)—sedative drug precursor, with low conversion, at temperatures ≤ 338 K at every pressure. However, the selectivity of the second desired product, fragrance intermediate, 2-methyl-2-penten-1-ol (MPEO), increased significantly at higher temperatures and pressures. It reached the unique value of 54% with 60% substrate conversion at 378 K and 6 × 106 Pa for the catalyst with the highest Cu loading. It was revealed that the production of significant amounts of MPEO is related to the reaction conditions, the Cu+ predominance on the surface, the hydrogen spillover effect, and the acid–base properties of these systems.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a009e","5e7092f5878c28a0473a009b"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943c878c28a0473b89bd","5e709420878c28a0473b6a41","5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","632925a975234038513ec7ca","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff35","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"3345","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a009e","5e7092f5878c28a0473a009b","632925a975234038513ec7ca","5e709420878c28a0473b6a41","67d2c2ebfdbe83617c8d2bcf","5e709491878c28a0473bfac0","5e7093bd878c28a0473afeef","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff35","5e70943c878c28a0473b89bd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["2-methyl-2-pentenal chemoselective hydrogenation","porous hydrotalcite-derived materials","2-methyl-2-penten-1-ol","2-methylpentanal"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060991678"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4aa","name":"Ludmila V.","lastName":"Vovchenko","documentHash":"991cf975-0a98-4299-9e5a-3a12e090f001"},{"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4a9","name":"Ludmila Yu.","lastName":"Matzui","documentHash":"07045393-5280-4d46-9e9a-baf026899e54"},{"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4a8","name":"Nadiia M.","lastName":"Moshkivska","documentHash":"a60ec1f5-1f41-4753-afc0-0290be72100f"},{"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4a7","name":"Mykola V.","lastName":"Borysenko","documentHash":"61c0a920-4a2d-49db-a800-1751c30a8f0e"},{"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4a6","name":"Vladyslav V.","lastName":"Lisnyak","documentHash":"6163fd9c-4420-4527-8f6f-eb5bea6adde5"},{"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4a5","name":"Vitaliy E.","lastName":"Diyuk","documentHash":"7e6da14f-8a1b-4f2f-af73-707fc87600fc"},{"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4a4","name":"Sofiia S.","lastName":"Lepeskina","documentHash":"64bc7bf7-1bc9-4c15-8b6f-937ca400393d"},{"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4a3","name":"Olena V.","lastName":"Ischenko","documentHash":"a7c41819-1c2f-4b66-ab42-9b8cd30cc6f6"},{"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4a2","name":"Olha V.","lastName":"Pryhunova","documentHash":"3bd80711-8ce8-4737-85e1-9cf8a6a60d5d"},{"objectId":"6243c0a87523402df099a303","name":"Alla","lastName":"Dyachenko","uuid":"5111AF0AEDD620451C94AF513B6855E490D9FBF95139304CEEBBF517F410035CE340D3116A01780FA85C4DC516C293948075B1F141F97D5093C36EDB3832353C","documentHash":"da609206-2ab6-4dbc-81b4-db000a4ef5a1"}],"objectId":"680a3261fdbe831c0f9cb4a0","doi":"10.1080/15421406.2024.2379662","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15421406.2024.2379662","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Bimetallic NiFe nanoparticles deposited on hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) of various sizes for the catalytic hydrogenation of CO\n            <sub>2</sub>","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The composites based on hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) decorated with nanoparticles of nickel and iron oxides were prepared from the nitrate solutions with ultrasound treatment.

Silver disc electrodes and devices fabricated by screen-printing with silver ink were used as transducers. Dithizone-silver complex ensures potential stability of prepared electrodes, forming a redox couple with silver metal transducers. Moreover, it serves as lipophilic cationic site in the membrane, inducing zirconium porphyrin to act as a neutral ionophore. Electrodes with these membranes showed the following selectivity sequence: ClO4− > F− > NO3– > Cl−. Linear response towards fluoride was observed from 10−4 M to 10–1 M. Charged carrier mechanism is also possible, requiring polar plasticizer and addition of anionic lipophilic sites to the membrane. While membranes with ionophore working as charged carrier show better discrimination of lipophilic anions (selectivity sequence: F− > ClO4− > NO3– > Cl−), dynamic range of fluoride response is narrower in this case (10−4 M to 10−2 M), as compared to membranes with ionophore working as neutral carrier.

be improved by combination with other materials. Perovskite structures have potential for photocatalytic hydrogen generation; however, their practical application is hindered by inherent low stability. This limitation can be effectively mitigated through strategic combinations with complementary materials. Therefore, hybrids consisting of the perovskite CsPbX3 (X = Br, I) and the metal–organic framework (Ce)UiO-66-Y (Y = H, Br, NH2) were successfully synthesized for the first time, using a straightforward ligand-assisted reprecipitation synthesis at room temperature. To develop a room temperature synthesis for CsPbX3@(Ce)UiO-66-Y hybrid nanomaterials, herein, we optimized the synthesis of perovskite firstly (considering factors such as the choice of solvents, the drying of stabilizers, and the purification) and then developed an efficient way to combine both materials. Six types of hybrid materials, differing in the type of perovskite and functional group in the MOFs linker, were synthesized by the introduction of MOFs powder into a solution containing perovskite precursors (CsX and PbX2 in DMF stabilized by oleyamine and oleic acid) followed by antisolvent addition. We demonstrated that the hybrids containing perovskite in combination with MOF (Ce)UiO-66-NH2 in a molar ratio of 13:1 exhibited significantly higher activity and twice as long reaction stability time compared to the individual components of the hybrids when tested separately. This outcome underscores the presence of a synergistic effect, highlighting the potential of these hybrid materials in catalyzing hydrogen generation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika

quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as next-generation materials for photodetectors (PDs). It is well known that conventional alkyl long-chain ligands show weak binding on the surface of the QD core, leading to low stability and poor charge transfer. Herein, we explore the effect of partial replacing of alkyl long-chain ligands with aromatic short-chain ligands, namely phenylethylamine (PEA) and trans-cinnamic acid (TCA), on the performance of CsPbBr3 QDs-based PD deposited on textile. The planar-type PDs with optimum PEA (L-type) and TCA (X-type) ligand doping concentration show improved performance compared to the control device due to the combined effect of enhanced conductivity and photoluminescence lifetime, lower surface defect centres, and reduced non-radiative recombination. Notably, PEA-treated CsPbBr3 QDs-based PD shows the best photodetection properties of blue light (448 nm) at 10 V with a peak responsivity of 149 mA W-1 and EQE of 41.3%, which is almost 20 times higher than those of the control device and 3 times higher than the TCA-treated CsPbBr3 QDs based device. In addition, this device reveals excellent mechanical and operational stability. These results pave the way for designing flexible and wearable perovskite QDs-based optoelectronic devices, which may find potential applications in future optoelectronic devices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7cad","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cb","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cb2","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b89","622ac2387523402df090302f","5e709430878c28a0473b7cad","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b8a","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b8b","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b8c","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b8d","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b8e","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b8f","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b90","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b91","681dc3aafdbe83601a6f8b92","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547884a","mniswId":"11753","title":"Journal of Materials Chemistry.

However, at standard conditions, they exist as pyrophoric liquids reacting violently with water and dioxygen, thus being dangerous and difficult to use in daily laboratory work. Here, we show that these zinc dialkyls can be efficiently stabilized toward air by supramolecular encapsulation within a host system based on heteroleptic alkylzinc complexes. The noncovalent immobilization of ZnR2 molecules within the resultant crystalline networks allows their structural characterization in a new confined environment. The great potential of the reported assemblies is demonstrated by efficient separation of ZnMe2 from a mixture of ZnMe2/ZnEt2.

However, the elusive control of selectivity and typical reliance on expensive and toxic transition metal (TM) based catalysts significantly hinder the utility of this process. Here, we report an exclusively regioselective hydrocyanation of unbiased alkynes, driven by base-catalyzed reversible alkyne-allene isomerization and phosphine-catalyzed HCN transfer to the allene. This TM-free, dual-catalytic approach introduces a novel mode of selectivity control via regioselective hydrocyanation of the allene intermediate. The methodology secures a cost-effective access to a broad range of vinyl nitriles (40 examples) with yields up to 97% and Z/E stereoselectivity up to 20:1, including complex natural product derivatives. A comparison with TM-based systems highlighted a 2500-fold cost reduction, as well as the elimination of the troublesome separation of the regioisomers. Mechanistic studies elucidated the reaction pathway, shedding light on the achieved regioselectivity. By altering one catalyst in a dual-catalytic system, we demonstrated the regioselectivity switch, thereby facilitating regiodivergent hydrocyanation (eight examples). In a broader context, this approach offers a foundation for developing the next generation of TM-free strategies for the regioselective hydrofunctionalizations of unbiased alkynes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935c878c28a0473a8036","5e70941a878c28a0473b641f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70941a878c28a0473b641f","5e70935c878c28a0473a8036"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477026","mniswId":"1127","title":"ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION","issn":"1433-7851","eissn":"1521-3773","documentHash":"2e22c515-48a8-4277-bd3a-488ee4361571"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67d5790dfdbe836a6dba9c9b","year":"2025","documentHash":"ee6af227-b84f-4169-91f7-812bc994a0e6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747061021366"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"650907a940e3ff0176695d84","name":"Khrystyna","lastName":"Haydukivska","uuid":"98E8EDAA81383A1E1B76A7E25207678A68BBE8F196B09775F509B10AE946549E47834E2D2040D6157D742ABF864E2FE72A34675C30BBE949B75964D1EAAB4511","documentHash":"046681f5-7945-4ee4-9edf-cedad4752034"},{"objectId":"636dc1b87523405a7dd0411a","name":"Viktoriya","lastName":"Blavatska","uuid":"F461CD63D3BD823F0773DC006A87A8F76D6A2F4204D76AE1DB657ADB0E26F20F8B7F1CC5E50A9E86147DA9A605574508D73256D6C9900C0F7FCC52408A03895C","documentHash":"6887b7c0-cbde-4491-9d63-8c535234d918"}],"objectId":"67c802d1fdbe83551ebe429e","doi":"10.5488/cmp.27.13301","publicUri":"https://cmpj2.icmp.lviv.ua/index.php/cmpj/article/download/26/16","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Universal properties of branched copolymers in dilute solutions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We analyze the universal conformational properties of complex copolymer macromolecules, based on two topologies: the rosette structure containing fc linear branches and fr closed loops grafted to the central core, and the symmetric pom-pom structure, consisting of a backbone linear chain terminated by two branching points with functionalities f.

Conjugation of C-2028 with QDgreen increased cellular senescence, while the introduction of FA to the conjugate significantly decreased this process. C-2028 nanoencapsulation also reduced cell migration. Importantly, QDgreen and QDgreen-β-CD-FA themselves did not induce any toxic responses in studied cells.\nConclusions: In conclusion, the results demonstrate the high potential of a novel folic acid-targeted receptor quantum dot-β-cyclodextrin carrier (QDgreen-β-CD-FA) for drug delivery in cancer treatment.

Structural, spectral, and electrochemical characteristics of unsubstituted corrphycene (Cp) are described along with the data for its precursor, 11,18-di-tert-butylcorrphycene. Similar to porphine, Cp turns out to be a soft chromophore, characterized by very similar energy splittings between the pairs of frontier HOMO and LUMO orbitals. Magnetic circular dichroism spectra indicate that the splitting in the HOMO orbitals is larger than in the LUMO, opposite to the DFT predictions. Corrphycene exists in the form of a doubly degenerate trans tautomeric species. The two intramolecular H-bonds are not equivalent, which strongly suggests a stepwise mechanism of trans-trans conversion. Being a nearly perfect soft chromophore, Cp emerges as an attractive candidate for sensing changes in its environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b0fc","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff86","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b0fa","681db8abfdbe83601a6e317f","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff86","681db8abfdbe83601a6e3180","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0fc","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f1","mniswId":"3513","title":"Chemistry-A European Journal","doi":"10.1002/chem.","issn":"0947-6539","eissn":"1521-3765","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1521-3765","documentHash":"56606be2-854e-47eb-92eb-2de5acecfa73"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67a8efddfdbe8328704c6f82","year":"2025","documentHash":"a0f118cf-91f5-4af0-85fa-80a564b1e5ab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747061027388"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7","name":"Karina","lastName":"Kwapiszewska","uuid":"B5FE41F14EEC666D304654994E6250629F4F330AF6CF26B5585E2C99E5641B03DFEB8EA8A3A168084B7D1ED1D12DA60714C2ED67A21A919BC975D9B8456110D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7396-9571","documentHash":"eb6a4320-99ed-48fa-8778-37744fd76b87"}],"objectId":"66fbbfcefdbe837a1e18e76c","doi":"10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00079","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00079","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Physicochemical Perspective of Biological Heterogeneity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The vast majority of chemical processes that govern our lives occur within living cells. At the core of every life process, such as gene expression or metabolism, are chemical reactions that follow the fundamental laws of chemical kinetics and thermodynamics. Understanding these reactions and the factors that govern them is particularly important for the life sciences. The physicochemical environment inside cells, which can vary between cells and organisms, significantly impacts various biochemical reactions and increases the extent of population heterogeneity. This paper discusses using physical chemistry approaches for biological studies, including methods for studying reactions inside cells and monitoring their conditions. The potential for development in this field and possible new research areas are highlighted. By applying physical chemistry methodology to biochemistry in vivo, we may gain new insights into biology, potentially leading to new ways of controlling biochemical reactions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"4","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"314-321","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b5ac7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"62e392c14097075e45d6fe29","title":"ACS Physical Chemistry Au","eissn":"2694-2445","websiteLink":"https://pubs.acs.org/journal/apcach","documentHash":"5c42a200-b112-410c-8659-c7e6ff872cf0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fbbfcefdbe837a1e18e76d","year":"2024","volume":"4","number":"4","documentHash":"9fcc0fc0-bb3c-49ef-8005-b86c752d7aef"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747061069249"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61f9fbdb7523402df07d9694","name":"Olena","lastName":"Tynkevych","uuid":"94E29F3827549CA225DDB25ED9DAD2A25933CCD3BDD80C3C8CD2CBFDD2339CED30E73E3EB2ED2F355637AB3E519C7B666FE1D34142793A5D6E4B363C10F4E11D","documentHash":"23d0bb58-51b2-4339-a940-b033ecf6c5c9"},{"objectId":"6041c8139543c711bc6ea8fc","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Czerwiński","uuid":"DC306999F03024A4EE2803E47A6FD59A863EE7F352EF378C7743921B9B90C4C1182C95F172FFD06126A2B52329D951DC5DE1B2ED5E50112B61C0DAA20BE674DE","documentHash":"add6c662-4c14-4313-9be9-4064374e2f56"},{"objectId":"602e326c9543c7410626ee4e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gurgul","uuid":"7E4181ADA4B04C2228F357DA46F7466EA1ACA51683982F36F6E489C4DEC17BD1B07959525DEEDA3ABDDB81146461B7E2E2F72D41EB9DCD22CFC287AEE7CCF517","documentHash":"7e666d35-7828-4257-890b-7a3319302f56"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85e2","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Łazińska","uuid":"2F94D83FD1DA1A1B357066C7F24601551A5FE782E35550F06C210E65A57249171EB7D1CC5A2C50D5FA4B07540DD4502A3112E5600667EE2E2D87C132D00E56FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8953-2163","documentHash":"6578f9f1-79db-42c9-b55e-d28720861b6f"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b74c6","name":"Marta","lastName":"Michalska-Domańska","uuid":"AA74C4C727A8FABC1B4320A24026951C462A26E08D5F57A7FA6BAD41B7BDB6FDB8F59B8BC074ABD3D98602A5FF7B79E2F766ED42C6B394D640B66248D3A27ECE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8684-3230","documentHash":"f5a05110-7d6a-46e1-aeed-f1918f913d74"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pisarek","uuid":"394C70A4B68190862754D0C9C71B0CB236E956007955224514CD5CC84EABBD07900FBD9AC8AACDBDD5E542D5CC809EC02A9E49AFFB1DCA527F248F357949EFB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7424-5954","documentHash":"f7a53170-9e7f-4afd-bea7-cb1ef6322bc6"},{"objectId":"5e709319878c28a0473a2ca1","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Zaraska","uuid":"4A3DF05AD74F1EF9A8FA62E81349DBFD230E5B06F3F429358B08164F4710A8B4A730D28D12BBC08C69120945FDAB052DE2EF88883065BD45A7F72D75C78FF99E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5330-7191","documentHash":"423652a9-54f9-4f62-9137-3653290ceb2d"},{"objectId":"5e709319878c28a0473a2c7e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":"F82718BB8B073F5B16ECA9157BA09738D66162B498AE20037D5D1BA667F5056C4A16169DF67E04BA3B0C0DCEE5FB1B8065AB2D518BDCA1280992724B9A0726DC","documentHash":"48f29a3c-59ef-4239-a172-d326dafb7d67"}],"objectId":"6808b0aefdbe832e346e63a5","doi":"10.1016/j.electacta.2025.146261","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2025.146261","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Physicochemical and photoelectrochemical characterization of nanostructured oxide layers grown by anodic oxidation of Fe40Al in etidronic acid-based electrolyte","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Although it has already been reported that anodic oxidation of various FeAl alloys can be successfully employed for the fabrication of nanostructured semiconducting oxide films, the photoelectrochemical activity of this kind of materials has not been studied so far.

The morphology of the obtained materials has been verified by SEM while their composition and properties have been carefully evaluated by various techniques including EDS, XRD, XPS, UV-Vis, and Raman spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical activity of the materials was assessed using a 1.5 G solar light simulator and carefully discussed in relation to the synthesis procedure, morphology, and composition of the semiconducting layers. As-anodized layers with well-developed nanoporous morphology were composed mostly of amorphous aluminum and iron oxides. The latter was converted to hematite by thermal treatment in air at 400°C without any morphological changes. Subsequent chemical etching in NaOH resulted in preferential dissolution of aluminum oxide, which was accompanied by loss of porous morphology. Both, annealed and etched layers exhibit pronounced photoelectrochemical activity, and the values of generated photocurrents as well as charge recombination behavior were found to be strongly dependent on the synthesis procedure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df55","uid":"bETvAqC6t6_hkAvn-zY0R6g","uuid":"892e1891-d330-4d2a-a6e4-b90c993616aa","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61f9fbdb7523402df07d9694","5e709319878c28a0473a2ca1","5e709319878c28a0473a2c7e","602e326c9543c7410626ee4e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709438878c28a0473b85e2"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e3","uid":"bWAncCFOOFggrGtc2DIwFog","uuid":"5ffa91bd-7336-4c07-959e-0d3f198f1d5a","name":"Instytut Optoelektroniki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709428878c28a0473b74c6","6041c8139543c711bc6ea8fc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"528","pagesFromTo":"146261","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709319878c28a0473a2ca1","602e326c9543c7410626ee4e","61f9fbdb7523402df07d9694","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","5e709319878c28a0473a2c7e","6041c8139543c711bc6ea8fc","5e709438878c28a0473b85e2","5e709428878c28a0473b74c6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a67","mniswId":"5553","title":"Electrochimica Acta","issn":"0013-4686","eissn":"1873-3859","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/electrochimica-acta/","documentHash":"9acc56c7-cbf9-4da3-b4ef-7d0a9cfd7d71"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6819c142fdbe8364f517a4d0","year":"2025","volume":"528","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"31284a7a-0f8a-4771-8b54-fbf2d24e38c7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FeAl alloy","anodization","anodic iron oxide","photoelectrochemistry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061069575"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681dc414fdbe83601a6fabf2","name":"Jan","lastName":"Krajczewski","documentHash":"61dfce99-5606-433d-aa1e-08af2bfd97c6"},{"objectId":"681dc414fdbe83601a6fabf1","name":"Libor","lastName":"Nozka","documentHash":"5a037b59-8c1c-4d8b-b383-5503d4c744bd"},{"objectId":"60dda4479543c7233654463c","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ambroziak","uuid":"E28B4465CC430F2FC9B36F74A3AB1503AC9E5B992341669F4113874245451DF1EE6537AC66406925F40C4F61CBC7D02FD50EFCBAADC1CFCA08644E8AC4FBA899","orcidId":"0000-0001-8581-9119","documentHash":"b3a0e440-6cef-4a22-8004-f43305b96a85"}],"objectId":"681dc414fdbe83601a6fabf0","doi":"10.1016/j.mssp.2025.109555","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1369800125002926?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Metal nitrides as an alternative material for SERS platforms: TiN and beyond","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Currently, SERS spectroscopy is one of the most sensitive analytical techniques. The method is rapid, accurate, and non-destructive, relying on plasmonic nanostructures at its core. To date, the literature has been dominated by SERS platforms based on plasmonic metals, primarily gold and silver. The optical properties and applications of noble metal nanoparticles in SERS spectroscopy have been studied in depth for over 40 years. As a result, the potential of well-established noble metal plasmonic nanostructures is nearing its limit. Despite decades of development, the main challenge remains the design and production of highly efficient and reliable plasmonic substrates suitable for SERS. A high-quality SERS platform should provide a stable enhancement factor (EF) across the entire substrate (point-to-point uniformity) and between different substrates (sample-to-sample reproducibility), while also exhibiting high chemical and temporal stability. For potential biomedical and biological applications, a novel SERS platform must exhibit low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility. Therefore, the synthesis of novel, metal-free plasmonic nanomaterials continues to be an area of active research. One of the most promising materials is metal nitrides. Recent literature has demonstrated the formation of metal nitride-based SERS platforms with activity comparable to, or even surpassing, that of standard platforms based on noble metals. In this review, we describe the current state of the art and the prospects for applying metal nitride-based nanomaterials as SERS platforms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60dda4479543c7233654463c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"194","pagesFromTo":"109555","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["681dc414fdbe83601a6fabf1","60dda4479543c7233654463c","681dc414fdbe83601a6fabf2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d9b","mniswId":"13993","title":"Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing","issn":"1369-8001","eissn":"1873-4081","documentHash":"fb0fe70e-110b-4ebc-a6ae-f219459f0965"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"680f10d6fdbe83659c8158a7","year":"2025","volume":"194","documentHash":"c26c849b-4911-4e29-ab28-2e54a6025eaa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747061076961"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d97","name":"Grzegorz D.","lastName":"Sulka","documentHash":"11524535-aae0-4692-a7e8-ad75a0a83d3c"},{"objectId":"681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d96","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Piecha","documentHash":"29d2d7b1-16a0-47f8-b663-8bcc00df57fe"},{"objectId":"681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d95","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Czopor","documentHash":"d5bd4e3d-53fa-4736-bae5-430379c96146"},{"objectId":"681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d94","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Szczerba","documentHash":"a1b46491-89b2-4db7-b126-26101475339c"},{"objectId":"681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d93","name":"Biswaranjan D.","lastName":"Mohapatra","documentHash":"dfc76327-6c79-4ee8-8612-c43ada2070d2"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pisarek","uuid":"394C70A4B68190862754D0C9C71B0CB236E956007955224514CD5CC84EABBD07900FBD9AC8AACDBDD5E542D5CC809EC02A9E49AFFB1DCA527F248F357949EFB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7424-5954","documentHash":"f7a53170-9e7f-4afd-bea7-cb1ef6322bc6"}],"objectId":"681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d91","doi":"10.1021/acsanm.5c00912","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsanm.5c00912","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"FeHf Binary Hydroxide/Oxide Nanostructures as Catalysts for Oxygen Evolution","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present pulsed electrodeposition (PED) of FeHf binary hydroxide/oxide (FeHf-BH) nanocomposites from aqueous electrolyte baths containing NO3 - ions. The deposition was carried out on a graphite foil at room temperature. This study, for the first time, demonstrated a controlled variation of Fe (5.9-49.9 avg. at. %) and Hf (2.4-58.7 avg. at. %) in the deposited materials. We showed the high scalability of FeHf-BH deposition by tuning the PED parameters. The morphology, composition, chemical structure, and oxidation states of metals in the materials were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The deposited materials consist of agglomerated nanoparticles sized 50-150 nm. Thermal annealing studies revealed improved crystallinity, with the appearance of thermodynamically stable oxide phases of Fe3O4, Fe2O3, and HfO2 in the composites. The oxygen evolution activity of the materials was analyzed in an alkaline medium based on the Hf content. The optimized material containing 11.9 avg. at. % Hf demonstrated an OER onset potential of 1.63 V vs RHE, Tafel slope of 47 mV dec-1, and required only 470 mV overpotential to reach a 50 mA cm-2 OER current. These PED strategies of designing FeHf-BH materials may open an avenue for designing other catalytically active and stable multimetallic hydroxides/oxides composites."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"8865-8875","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d93","681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d94","681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d95","681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d96","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d97"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f09c","mniswId":"27715","title":"ACS Applied Nano Materials","issn":"2574-0970","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f73d5a60-05ef-4413-a88f-1f9aa61a0c30"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"681dc223fdbe83601a6f6d92","year":"2025","volume":"8","number":"17","documentHash":"6c21f848-5b08-4164-8b3f-1d87a9dc0e84"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747061077021"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681dc2a0fdbe83601a6f7ba1","name":"Bo","lastName":"Durbeej","documentHash":"87030d51-3f66-42c4-8a61-59f9b2923f86"},{"objectId":"5f51c5c1752340073806a906","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kochman","uuid":"22C16E55321372BBEF58FCBADF8A0A14C565F80F31D6884468A7838112F1AED17FF8F6ECC7574B860680F4FB85CA5D7A8A5160E1A187C8EE2968C7660C489536","orcidId":"0000-0003-2552-9464","documentHash":"a0eedb93-4c63-4fc5-a396-aefeb1288111"}],"objectId":"681dc2a0fdbe83601a6f7b9f","doi":"10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c00634","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5c00634","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Simulating the Energy Capture Process in Push–Pull Norbornadiene-Quadricyclane Photoswitches","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Molecular switches based on the norbornadiene-quadricyclane (NBD-QC) isomer pair are among the most promising candidates for applications in molecular solar thermal energy storage (MOST). In these compounds, solar energy is captured through a photoinduced [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction whose mechanism is only partially understood. This holds true especially for NBD derivatives containing the type of push-pull substitution pattern that was previously proven necessary to attain reasonable photoisomerization quantum yields. In the present contribution, we report a computational investigation of the photochemistry of NBD-QC switches with precisely such a substitution pattern. Static calculations provide information on the structures of the excited electronic states involved in the photoinduced cycloaddition reaction, and the topographies of the relevant ground- and excited-state potential energy surfaces. Furthermore, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations allow an estimation of the reaction time scale and quantum yield. The simulation results paint a detailed picture of the energy capture process: the photoinduced cycloaddition reaction begins in the spectroscopically bright excited state of the molecular switch. In the model compound for which we performed NAMD simulations, ring closing takes place on a time scale of roughly 150 fs, which makes it one of the fastest known photoisomerization reactions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f51c5c1752340073806a906"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"4315-4325","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f51c5c1752340073806a906","681dc2a0fdbe83601a6f7ba1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a3","mniswId":"12287","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters","eissn":"1948-7185","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"868f238f-25e2-43ac-a736-3e6a988a7e56"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"681dc2c3fdbe83601a6f7cae","year":"2025","volume":"16","number":"17","doi":"","documentHash":"a404d26b-a826-4633-8705-457335f03b73"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747061077253"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6821e0d1fdbe8356e57c6f07","name":"O.","lastName":"Patsahan","documentHash":"a1690d49-a738-4330-a533-c05b5a4876b6"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea9","name":"Alina","lastName":"Ciach","uuid":"520AD5EF74AF15FA81FB18147E92D695E358B38A5F90389DF9A11C3C3623C0214250CFB548E34846D53DBA21ED79955D9F88250356F8AFEBD6A696B7263A658B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5556-401X","documentHash":"630645e8-c7ee-4652-a5a0-a0da6ec79d79"}],"objectId":"6821e0d1fdbe8356e57c6f05","doi":"10.1039/d4cp04669b","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2025/CP/D4CP04669B","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Mesoscopic theory for a double layer capacitance in concentrated ionic systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The effect of oscillatory decay in charge density in concentrated ionic solutions and ionic liquids on the double-layer capacitance is studied within the framework of a mesoscopic theory.

We report energy-dependent ion yields for both molecules showing significant differences. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that heavy Br atom migration is energetically more favored than H atom migration in the case of the H atom adjacent to Br. This is enabled by the energetically favorable formation of a noncovalent complex of Br- around the triazole ring. Recently, such complexes have been reported for several other biologically relevant molecules.

Here, we present Ocelli, a lightweight Python package implemented in Ray for scalable visualization and analysis of developmental multimodal single-cell data. The core functionality of Ocelli focuses on diffusion-based modeling of biological processes involving cell state transitions. Ocelli addresses common tasks in single-cell data analysis, such as visualization of cells on a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the continuity of the developmental progression of cells, identification of rare and transient cell states, integration with trajectory inference algorithms, and imputation of undetected feature counts. Extensive benchmarking shows that Ocelli outperforms existing methods regarding computational time and quality of the reconstructed low-dimensional representation of developmental data."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","607e829d9543c73526c48970"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["607e829d9543c73526c48970","5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb839","mniswId":"30122","title":"NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics","eissn":"2631-9268","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"faba65e0-f469-40cc-906f-125d28fa4d50"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68248523fdbe836c41b8da82","year":"2025","volume":"7","number":"2","documentHash":"3b6e4571-a0c4-4b6a-a828-ed0daade84dc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661539"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"682487cafdbe836c41b8fdcb","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Siuzdak","documentHash":"15134853-8186-49ae-9af1-dbc3fe4e5693"},{"objectId":"682487cafdbe836c41b8fdca","name":"Wiktoria","lastName":"Lipińska","documentHash":"e4f7c72d-c059-4b14-8d3c-d07a1f4a8723"},{"objectId":"682487cafdbe836c41b8fdc9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Karbarz","documentHash":"04fd8084-1c1c-4345-89af-7595f5b907c7"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","name":"Anders","lastName":"Jönsson-Niedziółka","uuid":"3394A368CB0E6B611D461246FA8924DA0550D7AF68CD7EBB72456860833F46CDC79A875204939C5A2F631BE36B09951DDC56FAB1B1015A54CDFB0E1A1E128C0B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5642-5946","documentHash":"f675ee5a-f8e9-4d1f-bdd0-4e009824f6ef"},{"objectId":"5e7093a2878c28a0473ae2d9","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"Szot-Karpińska","uuid":"64C4E7C2984017A6B5B044AA9FD692036370E458EC4DD5EFF68B54CCD87AB554206F382A9F40E61AA7BCA8106BFC3AB2B097D435C2E923042BC111145B847A83","orcidId":"0000-0003-3582-941X","documentHash":"c9b8465f-48f4-407d-a902-52537383b3e7"}],"objectId":"682487cafdbe836c41b8fdc7","doi":"10.1007/s10008-025-06297-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10008-025-06297-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Characterisation and application of electrodes with hydrogenated titania nanotubes modified with M13 bacteriophages","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The sponge-like hydrogenated titania nanotubes (S-TiO2-NTs) modified with M13 bacteriophages were investigated for bacterial detection.

Despite various objections to the validity of such a predictor, citations are considered in grant acquisition, recruitment or even journal review processes.

This work presents factors, mostly those related to the authors and manuscript composition, that influence the number of citations gained by scientific articles. The created database collected almost 30 variables and around 50 of their functions or interactions that describe papers published in physicochemical journals related to colloid and interface science. The coarse examination was carried out by comparison of the parameters with respect to the journals. Subsequently, the data was investigated using multivariate analysis-classical linear regression model. The method, usually applied in econometrics, determined significant and insignificant factors. Eventually, a log-linear model is presented, allowing the optimisation of the writing process of a manuscript to increase the utility of a physicochemical article."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c32f759543c72336544028"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c32f759543c72336544028"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796bd","mniswId":"18282","title":"Scientometrics","issn":"0138-9130","eissn":"1588-2861","documentHash":"5369667e-a3b0-4961-826a-92f58eff0951"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67fd008ffdbe831f2f169898","year":"2025","documentHash":"e6ecb368-a7fe-4baf-a93b-21fda54a756e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261664650"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68248621fdbe836c41b8e744","name":"Juliusz","lastName":"Pankowski","documentHash":"d5ac4fc5-dded-478a-b634-598afa2e881b"},{"objectId":"68248621fdbe836c41b8e743","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Chmielewska","documentHash":"0c820bdc-f9b8-4ff5-b47b-0bcf4f435426"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfabb","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"A43E02DD56D97130FB557B1170B3ECC60D6B846F14E17ECAF295B91DD22E0E78EB30FDCEA47C95AA87D5C0B1F534A8439F0A639134D2305C36B7DDB342E7A131","orcidId":"0000-0002-1904-9459","documentHash":"42719eb5-a19e-4150-a61d-d9d457ec8b41"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff54","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Michota-Kamińska","uuid":"4EB7079300C2AFB8708927EEDB21FBD81AEF2FD51FC263E240C99C7038D1005DEC8459DA840507FBA6DE74655F99385CF34A6DC7B3F7B83FA17E470DC416A800","orcidId":"0000-0002-1713-4182","documentHash":"c1786c7a-c1fc-4ac2-aa4a-053360f9fd89"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a7253","name":"Marta","lastName":"Czaplicka","uuid":"D48FF5359202157732E88B5216C25CBCCCF560C1859E8234114A32ABBABF8060CF8C3C43057C906298BA6D24A2927C0D77AC6E9685D7F142074B16A3CB258A6C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3325-1896","documentHash":"5c94814a-f5e5-4144-8e73-839d2172683b"}],"objectId":"68248621fdbe836c41b8e741","doi":"10.1002/jrs.6816","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1002/jrs.6816","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"The Lung Cancer Detection and Type Determination From Plasma and Lung Tissues by Surface‐Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique combined with chemometry can be a potential tool for early discrimination of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from plasma and, as well as from the lung tissue samples. Based on the acquired spectra and the applied algorithm, it is possible to distinguish between the two types of SCLC and NSCLC associated with smoking and also to differentiate between subtypes of NSCLC in a very fast mode in comparison to standard histopathology. The applied chemometry in the form of the partial least squares regression (PLSR) and the partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) method allows, for the first time, to discriminate against tumor samples and determine between SCLC, NSCLC, and NSCLC types. The presented data clearly indicate that plasma samples are enough to discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC samples and NSCLC subtypes efficiently, which significantly facilitates the cancer diagnosis in terms of time and costs of analysis.

It examines students' attitudes through survey data, including their self-reported interest in STEM disciplines, career aspirations, and reflections on the role of hands-on experience in shaping their educational choices.SampleThe study involved high school students who participated in a series of experimental workshops focused on the synthesis of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.Design and methodsWe analyze the relationship between popular science projects carried out by high school students on the choice of field of study and further professional path, i.e. their attitude towards choosing a career path, and participation in workshops popularizing science into account exact STEM. To achieve this goal, we designed a series of experiments tailored to high school students.ResultsStudents had the opportunity to study the 3D virtual representations of molecular geometry. Seventy-five percent of participants connected their professional path with the field of chemistry, and 35% declared interest in following an academic career.ConclusionThese findings indicate that science popularization workshops can significantly influence students' perceptions of STEM education and career paths. Engaging in laboratory activities, collaborative problem-solving, and direct interactions with scientists fostered a heightened interest in chemistry and related fields. Based on the Social Cognitive Career Theory, self-efficacy and outcome expectations play a pivotal role in career choices. Our results support this perspective, as students with positive workshop experiences were more inclined to consider STEM studies. Moreover, the hands-on approach bridged the gap between theoretical learning and real-world scientific applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","uid":"bL0dXXB9qN74NNNOmYDF46Q","uuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","name":"Instytut Podstawowych Problemów Techniki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709431878c28a0473b7e90","6821df90fdbe8356e57c5f91"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","parentUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debf","rootUuid":"b419f7cc-c27c-4b8a-82f8-82278caa29cf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6705eaa8ece39845a342ab52"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-24","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6821df90fdbe8356e57c5f91","6821df90fdbe8356e57c5f92","6821df90fdbe8356e57c5f93","6821df90fdbe8356e57c5f94","5e709431878c28a0473b7e90","6705eaa8ece39845a342ab52"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547951e","mniswId":"17246","title":"Research in Science & Technological Education","issn":"0263-5143","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"73dfc269-59ab-49f5-8fde-e04863f732ea"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6821df90fdbe8356e57c5f90","year":"2025","documentHash":"cd25aa81-ea27-4123-81eb-240f535c6b58"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747347499850"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53d3c","name":"Cassia","lastName":"Corso Silva","uuid":"A9AE5E8F1F8392E871012E670AB834442192BD595496DEF45F87107284C484EF5D98A585325E4EAB2DF8ED713EBD76DF50CCBFE1DB5EE88B63DE6576CFD0CBDA","documentHash":"b64c8962-2a24-463c-9f5d-5d458a6b5491"},{"objectId":"60c2fe839543c72336543828","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Pielach","uuid":"E060F0C13AA2A9E4D92F5FE0A9940220C1433A865A0FFC4E7EA776D9427BE30895DFC20A20B173679C837B679E5D7899F6136654328947FA96A1F4B0439074F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6849-1980","documentHash":"b2f527ea-9a6e-4f11-8786-677ced7c0873"},{"objectId":"6030b6229543c7410626f8bc","name":"Milena ","lastName":"Królikowska","uuid":"F8202A69FA09FA3B0C204C403D3CC4914B810C425E70A50DCB3AD3B87CFD94315C9FE1C80D50CC8AE5FD09F8E1FC33A4D67E3E00BBF81D8DC7CEAC31E440EFBE","documentHash":"bd9df7cb-b92b-4491-9dbe-a775b70f9ebd"},{"objectId":"6023a78a9543c7744e88f335","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Zinkiewicz","uuid":"5B40D1120FC72C7EEF8DEEAF8AD174743397265633C1ABE3FFA2A81A00C1C14A0F79C01F889F90DC774EF13B9B79F6281A3F6591E1C35EC2601B05F6FC80A7BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5687-9080","documentHash":"ee0f88e4-0bb3-44fc-9be8-4a67b282b38b"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde7c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jamrozik","uuid":"437CA3BEB502139FD0C881A453568CB4404A5C6E74A22D982D920DA3EECBD7AF9C0CCAF48D389B847F5DF5C1ED1428D094567071B4ACBDE5B0F5E64423E2C9D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-0188-8668","documentHash":"955cc5e1-1aa8-4521-a49a-2005a5ae6301"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8bfd","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Purzycka","uuid":"03330C8F3086C0EDCEF2F26C7DE810931214C25E7ECF37A618D83BEE1F9F7B8536CE2C1685C0D39EFA14CA5FD70CA99DD9482139AD43ECB7DC3D8F8145EBF6A6","orcidId":"0000-0001-8742-5279","documentHash":"4af0279c-eb0a-41e8-854d-d75c9f0d5be2"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Stepanenko","uuid":"BF57EE64971811A251374C75A08A64C7DC048997A86A87460BCC2CC8BC9E96C9DFF7EC1C40B0754A465BB2A8216565AC2EACDC66EAAA2EAAD983E233DEA89728","orcidId":"0000-0001-9919-4447","documentHash":"5f260202-2f2b-402d-83ac-ff29415a756b"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":"5FFECF2E5A62709C63A8D260B40C0CD90CF8BD0DCCB7FA27183145DDA5B5CBF16812F71E9EEBA4A8B79058C3D3533F3A261B5BDE1ED8D1DEAD6581D3C27C7140","orcidId":"0000-0001-7885-7395","documentHash":"c2d231ae-c19c-4fa0-aa50-7b4f82f3ffa2"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7c94","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wasylczyk","uuid":"1EBE446CED8F5493196A17298BD4FF982EF9DD073F8AA42D61B2FC0977DD8DA44F51E6EEABDEE845ACE9F8B27404851D7CC70637A2209748331078660F961F36","orcidId":"0000-0003-0851-9838","documentHash":"04a9636d-1a0d-4d97-a82d-31a13f19d196"}],"objectId":"65d4b3854097074f286a549b","doi":"10.1117/12.2647013","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2647013","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Stimulated Raman scattering microscope for leukemic cell imaging","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscope integrated with a novel fiber-based light source.

At the end of the last century, this star-shaped structure was recognized mostly in liquid crystals. However, the development of optoelectronics resulted in a revolution in truxenes. Stable, fast, easily processed and cheap optoelectronic devices are desirable in many areas of industry and science. Consequently, the contribution of truxenes to these fields is manifold, ranging from D–A emitters, semiconductors, and complexes to sensors. They attract attention because of their relatively low mass and expanded π-electron system. Symmetric molecules give rise to dendrimers, bowl-shape molecules and fullerenes. Further advantages are shown by the recently discovered non-symmetric truxenes obtained via one- or two-heteroatom displacement.

More recently, a new technique called optoretinography (ORG) has been developed. In one form of this technique, the physiological response of retinal photoreceptors to visible light, resulting in a nanometric photoreceptor optical path length change, is measured by phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography (OCT). To date, a limited number of studies with phase-based ORG measured the retinal response to a flickering light stimulation. In this work, we use a spatio-temporal optical coherence tomography (STOC-T) system to capture optoretinograms with a flickering stimulus over a 1.7 x 0.85 mm(2) area of a light-adapted retina located between the fovea and the optic nerve. We show that we can detect statistically-significant differences in the photoreceptor optical path length (OPL) modulation amplitudes in response to different flicker frequencies and with better signal to noise ratios (SNRs) than for a dark-adapted eye. We also demonstrate the ability to spatially map such response to a patterned stimulus with light stripes flickering at different frequencies, highlighting the prospect of characterizing the spatially-resolved temporal-frequency response of the retina with ORG.

The relations derived by Bruno [Phys. Rev. B 39, 865 (1989)] and van der Laan [J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 10, 3239 (1998)], including the AOM of Co only, are found to give largely incorrect mean values of the MCA energy but reproduce its oscillatory variation versus the Co thickness, with scaling factors needed for the bilayers. The presently proposed extension of the Bruno relation, with the AOM of both Co and Pd or Pt included, predicts the correct sign of the MCA energy for both bilayers and reproduces its magnitude and oscillation pattern very well, without extra scaling, for the Co/Pd bilayer, though this relation is not satisfied locally, by the MCA and AOM layer terms. A similarly extended van der Laan relation fails to reproduce the MCA energy, its sign, and the oscillation pattern, and largely overestimates its magnitude. For all investigated systems, the Co orbital moment oscillates versus the Co thickness with the 2 monolayer (ML) period for the out-of-plane direction of magnetization and the 5 ML period for the in-plane direction while the oscillations of the Pd and Pt orbital moments are more complex and similar for both magnetization directions. The exact and approximate MCA energies obtained with the force theorem and the perturbation theory (PT), respectively, are close to each other for the Co film and the Co/Pd bilayer. For the Co/Pt bilayer, only the mean value of the MCA energy is well approximated by the PT while its oscillation amplitude is overestimated a few times due to the large SOC in Pt. It is also shown that the MCA energy includes the intraband term, usually neglected, but, in fact, finite and vital for systems without the inversion symmetry as its magnitude is comparable to that of the interband term for the Co/Pd bilayer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff17"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"105","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"104403","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff17"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479265","mniswId":"16088","title":"Physical Review B","issn":"2469-9950","documentHash":"4f3c70f9-6d98-4157-9484-705c9f5fa489"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e913a04097075a21dba145","year":"2022","volume":"105","number":"10","documentHash":"f223478b-4fce-495c-b244-fb88b6590c26"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654636464"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62ec133a4097071dc17d96c0","name":"Przemyslaw","lastName":"Data","documentHash":"7ac48a39-93f8-416d-bf5c-469b75b63fca"},{"objectId":"62ec133a4097071dc17d96be","name":"Dharmendra","lastName":"Kumar","documentHash":"6ef69ca6-a8b0-4b18-8b03-1027e658d68e"},{"objectId":"62ec133a4097071dc17d96bc","name":"Paola Zimmermann","lastName":"Crocomo","documentHash":"b06db249-5dd4-4b4f-aee3-fe92d44879ef"},{"objectId":"5f51c5c1752340073806a906","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kochman","uuid":"22C16E55321372BBEF58FCBADF8A0A14C565F80F31D6884468A7838112F1AED17FF8F6ECC7574B860680F4FB85CA5D7A8A5160E1A187C8EE2968C7660C489536","orcidId":"0000-0003-2552-9464","documentHash":"a0eedb93-4c63-4fc5-a396-aefeb1288111"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kubas","uuid":"5502D7BBD854811ACE4A362AACF7E8E88D472EBF744D8A7CA3375962360A19B8C994FD5882E9191B79B6745D5F7A3AB2529D5A4D64C8AFBB3B7204C8694C6382","orcidId":"0000-0002-5508-0533","documentHash":"9f31decc-1aaa-47ff-8296-c27349c11c1e"},{"objectId":"5e7093ca878c28a0473b0cb3","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bartkowski","uuid":"11C89C6B2E31DD3DC6F8C26F426E8F5A634CD022B565F1351C10A3AF4948533BA7547C46AF07B5D682137510E899445326CEDC1864CA3FCE980493AFA6909FAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-0137-507X","documentHash":"7be159e6-cd03-42fe-8991-6a20c3eb0b98"},{"objectId":"5e70938e878c28a0473acae9","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Lindner","uuid":"EA31DC15F7060354624DF95EF003E2C066CF457AAE01FD6030EA87A57DDBBBDB43434D6DACCA187CFECBFD80B8EACF0DD23448C6AD6863A0BCF5E30D431E8A7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5514-674X","documentHash":"27b617a7-fe9a-4b55-880d-383c5aa9d6d1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-07-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62ec133a4097071dc17d96b9","doi":"10.1039/d2sc03342a","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/SC/D2SC03342A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Tandem rigidification and π-extension as a key tool for the development of a narrow linewidth yellow hyperfluorescent OLED system.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hyperfluorescence (HF), a relatively new phenomenon utilizeing excitones transfer between two luminophores, requires careful pairwise tuning of molecular energy levels and is proposed to be the crucial step towards the development of new, highly effective OLED systems. A few HF yellow OLED devices with only Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) characteristic leading to moderate external quantum efficiency (EQE <20%), with the desired narrowband emission have been reported. However, a systematic strategy embracing both, FRET and triplet to singlet (TTS) transition as complementary mechanism for effective excitones transfer has not yet been proposed. Herein, we present a rational approach, which allows to through subtle structural modification, a pair of compounds built from the same donor and acceptor subunits, but with varied communication between these ambipolar fragments, to be obtained. The TADF-active dopant is based on a naphthalimide scaffold linked to the nitrogen of a carbazole moiety, which through introduction of an additional bond leads not only to π-cloud enlargement, but also rigidifies and inhibits rotation of the donor. This structural change prevents TADF, and allow to guide bandgaps and excited states energies to simoultenously pursue FRET and TTS process. New OLED devices utilizing the presented emitters show excellent external quantum efficiency (up to 27%) and narrow full width at half maximum (40nm), which is a consequence of fine-tuned alignment of energy levels. The presented design principles prove that only a minor structural modification is needed to obtain commercially applicable dyes for HF OLED devices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938e878c28a0473acae9","5e7093ca878c28a0473b0cb3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f51c5c1752340073806a906","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"34","pagesFromTo":"10119-10128","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ca878c28a0473b0cb3","62ec133a4097071dc17d96bc","5f51c5c1752340073806a906","62ec133a4097071dc17d96be","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","62ec133a4097071dc17d96c0","5e70938e878c28a0473acae9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775d9","mniswId":"3488","title":"Chemical Science","issn":"2041-6520","eissn":"2041-6539","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ad57ac0a-0cb9-4c6a-a8cf-496fe553b301"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"638754f840970727ca808bae","year":"2022","volume":"13","number":"34","doi":"","documentHash":"e425afe7-e4e6-4c38-b463-b9111c93e90a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654636648"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62fb735b4097077a00d12b8f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Palczewski","documentHash":"29c12978-f3b8-481b-b784-27308ec9f42d"},{"objectId":"62fb735b4097077a00d12b8e","name":"David C.","lastName":"Lyon","documentHash":"59074a22-88f3-4781-8e1b-190e0866726b"},{"objectId":"62fb735b4097077a00d12b8d","name":"Henri","lastName":"Leinonen","documentHash":"5c2f63e0-7489-44ff-9c1a-e4da64a9c2ff"},{"objectId":"5f505f00752340073806a8ca","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Foik","uuid":"920777744AE28A5DDAB9F1CE4CE386158926640B4996491C47ACB5D4F5DE6FD1F8EA9296334C2DC6F74B2CDC57F4705E23004E7F0D80EE5BD7CCFEC56E05824F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1110-9223","documentHash":"d6ab11c7-e957-4d1b-aa7c-f7c42d4fb5d6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-14","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62fb735b4097077a00d12b8b","doi":"10.1523/eneuro.0107-22.2022","publicUri":"https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1523/ENEURO.0107-22.2022","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Visual System Hyperexcitability and Compromised V1 Receptive Field Properties in Early-Stage Retinitis Pigmentosa in Mice","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Inherited retinal degenerative diseases are a prominent cause of blindness. Although mutations causing death of photoreceptors are mostly known, the pathophysiology downstream in the inner retina and along the visual pathway is incompletely characterized in the earliest disease stages. Here, we investigated retinal, midbrain and cortical visual function using electroretinography (ERG), the optomotor response (OMR), visual evoked potentials (VEPs), respectively, and single unit electrophysiology at the primary visual cortex (V1) in light-adapted juvenile (approximately one-month-old) and young adult (three-month-old) Rho(P23)(H/WT) mice, representative of early-stage retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Photopic ERG revealed up to similar to 30% hypersensitivity to light in Rho(P23)(H/WT) mice, as measured by the light intensity required to generate half-maximal b-wave (I(50 )parameter). Rho(P23)(H/WT) mice also showed increased OMRs toward low spatial frequency (SF) drifting gratings, indicative of visual overexcitation at the midbrain level. At the V1 level, VEPs and single-cell recordings revealed prominent hyperexcitability in the juvenile Rho(P23)(H/WT) mice. Mean VEP amplitudes for light ON stimuli were nearly doubled in one-month-old Rho(P23)(H/WT) mice compared with controls, and more than doubled for light OFF. Single-cell recordings showed a significantly increased spontaneous V1 neuron firing in the Rho(P23)(H/WT) mice, and persistent contrast and temporal sensitivities. In contrast, direction selectivity was severely compromised. Our data suggest that during early RP, the visual pathway becomes hyperexcited. This could have both compensatory and deleterious consequences for visual behavior. Further studies on the mechanisms of hyperexcitability are warranted as this could lead to therapeutic interventions for RP."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f505f00752340073806a8ca"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"ENEURO.0107-22.2022","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62fb735b4097077a00d12b8d","62fb735b4097077a00d12b8e","62fb735b4097077a00d12b8f","5f505f00752340073806a8ca"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c021","mniswId":"5697","title":"eNeuro","issn":"2373-2822","eissn":"2373-2822","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"802710cb-d9c9-4ff9-a02a-a33e26742b7a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62fb735b4097077a00d12b8c","year":"2022","volume":"9","number":"3","documentHash":"00d42566-a3d8-4ea7-b71b-0ccfa924f069"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654639683"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb067","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Żuk","uuid":"A2CF96DA8DBC0F0EC756C6ABC4425D960DE3CE0ABBAA543C816DF4A24FDC838930FFB8FDCE1B3C5232CB0C3FD9D93CDDF5F6336061F13F18AC43F6C77E9DD4F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0555-5913","documentHash":"323764fb-47c8-4632-b36c-1a2615cfd8d2"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maciołek","uuid":"E3E9BCC7397B929B2C469D73E68AE44FB2E6F4892A7DC44C238F904FE76F9D470FD528254865B02108CA8B9311A7A421914ADC30598B3516CDD6CB7BF0F07C81","orcidId":"0000-0002-2371-4183","documentHash":"d2f0a437-c8a3-4dc0-9358-3f2e9c4648e4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","name":"Karol","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"30216860D4FCF71F80CCF2F14F9FA6358B5A0632271ACE53CD62EC8265F97928E335571E5A301CC0BA9C252A21169DB64AF4E27EC652B74805AD01BFF7BDF4DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9769-7646","documentHash":"3ea17df7-ffc6-4937-bb72-a24f676f97e3"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hołyst","uuid":"E92F295C3CC2CB6B18C450B2AB735CDA75E1B176DB096D3C43CB9E6E23F05E2B3448297032B471C71265740E595D30DAA6BA0B89CC0DB4589E73DB45075B7008","orcidId":"0000-0002-3211-4286","documentHash":"cbe7625d-9b95-4888-b28d-a8e3f921d07f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"633c276b4097074f73529128","doi":"10.1103/physreve.105.054133","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevE.105.054133","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Transient dynamics in the outflow of energy from a system in a nonequilibrium stationary state","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate the thermal relaxation of an ideal gas from a nonequilibrium stationary state. The gas is enclosed between two walls, which initially have different temperatures. After making one of the walls adiabatic, the system returns to equilibrium. We notice two distinct modes of heat transport and associated timescales: one connected with a traveling heat front and the other with internal energy diffusion. At the heat front, which moves at the speed of sound, pressure, temperature, and density change abruptly, leaving lower values behind. This is unlike a shock wave, a sound wave, or a thermal wave. The front moves multiple times between the walls and is the dominant heat transport mode until surpassed by diffusion. We found that it can constitute an order 1 factor in shaping the dynamics of the outflow of internal energy. We found that cooling such a system is quicker than heating, and that hotter bodies cool down quicker than colder ones.

These constraints are especially relevant for applications that require a long working distance, high resolution, and/or minimal probe diameter. Through detailed analysis based on ABCD matrix modelling, we show that side-viewing probes combining a graded-index (GRIN) fiber with a ball lens - GRIN-ball-lens probes (GBLPs) - offer superior performance over a range of numerical apertures and pave the way for a broader range of imaging applications. The performance of side-viewing GBLPs designed for 1300-nm optical coherence tomography imaging is compared against commonly used single-focusing-element all-fiber side-viewing probe designs, namely, ball-lens probes (BLPs) and GRIN-fiber probes (GFPs). All possible realizations of this novel probe design and their impact on the requisite design tradeoffs are investigated, including the impact on probe performance of fabrication error and the refractive index of the surrounding medium. Applications of GBLPs, including ultra-high-resolution (sub-2 micrometer) miniature probes for micro-endomicroscopy, are discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b5291"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709408878c28a0473b5291","63d116b640970711f8f9380c","63d116b640970711f8f9380d","63d116b640970711f8f9380e","63d116b640970711f8f9380f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fca","mniswId":"7924","title":"IEEE Photonics Journal","issn":"1943-0655","eissn":"1943-0647","documentHash":"447146c6-6a94-4c94-86d3-83c9fa7b99be"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d116b640970711f8f9380b","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"5","documentHash":"29b78a12-7403-47c0-82ab-853486bb86dd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654702336"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc4cb6d085dcb1e6ae0b8ff","name":"Idaresit","lastName":"Mbakara","orcidId":"0000-0001-8442-0181","documentHash":"6c59b87b-eee2-447b-83cb-dc46fa40a31f"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba5cc","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gajewska","uuid":"1005F4C75920A67E89812EFB931A6C15E977606A8589710FBD390688173D421220C9975F6ADF04E485CCFFDB555B5BBCB2449087AB0E40DBAD40F747E8B637DB","documentHash":"a277c0a8-b020-45d7-be67-ab0d7dbf5399"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Waluk","uuid":"587A78D077C4375A4C980253E3D29FB2074174FC88F6A7341BDCBF8F80F6764FDE1461139B4C2337F132A7A1787A14076B55E79D57654F32E1BE17E03941A875","orcidId":"0000-0001-5745-583X","documentHash":"f8893a20-d629-4008-9c8c-d34c0e171106"}],"objectId":"6437b7af4097076ac7d558e0","doi":"10.1142/s1088424623500360","publicUri":"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S1088424623500360","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"2-nitro-7,12,17-tri-<i>tert</i>-butylporphycene: Spectroscopy, photophysics, and tautomerism","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nitration of 2,7,12,17-tert-butylporphycene, leading mainly to meso-substituted 9-nitro- and 9,20-nitro- derivatives, also yielded a small amount of porphycene bearing three tert-butyl moieties and the nitro group at the beta position. The electronic absorption spectra of 2-nitro and 9-nitroporphycenes are similar, but the photophysical characteristics strongly differ. Unlike the meso-substituted derivative, 2-nitroporphycene emits intense, long-lived (ns) fluorescence. Strong enhancement of fluorescence intensity is due to the absence of steric interactions between tert-butyl and nitro moieties. The two porphycenes also differ in their tautomeric properties. 2-nitroporphycene exists in one trans-tautomeric form, whereas two trans-tautomers of similar energies coexist in the meso derivative. These results are well reproduced by quantum-chemical calculations. The possibility of changing photophysics and tautomerism by shifting the position of the substituent may be exploited while designing porphycenes targeted for specific applications, such as photodynamic therapy or building molecular switches."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cb6d085dcb1e6ae0b8ff","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","5e709450878c28a0473ba5cc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"A-F","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709450878c28a0473ba5cc","5fc4cb6d085dcb1e6ae0b8ff","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789dd","mniswId":"12367","title":"JOURNAL OF PORPHYRINS AND PHTHALOCYANINES","issn":"1088-4246","eissn":"1099-1409","documentHash":"5a008caf-20b6-4f86-8c57-f99e948e2d51"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6437b7af4097076ac7d558e1","year":"2023","documentHash":"0b4e514d-0a85-4ea3-9c03-faa06588f874"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["porphyrin isomers","porphycenes","electronic spectra","hydrogen bond","tautomerism","MCD"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654708629"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6389fc4d40970711474f8a17","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Wabnitz","documentHash":"a1c65762-4534-4480-a08c-9ee282f85d26"},{"objectId":"6389fc4d40970711474f8a16","name":"Vincent","lastName":"Couderc","documentHash":"9c0032d4-3ffd-470d-829f-ed5f2eb6a488"},{"objectId":"6389fc4d40970711474f8a15","name":"Annamaria","lastName":"Cucinotta","documentHash":"afba13e7-4173-4750-b8b0-cf89dcf42a7f"},{"objectId":"6389fc4d40970711474f8a14","name":"Daniele","lastName":"Modotto","documentHash":"e84a8261-7187-4ee7-a7c6-0d6fbcaa49c8"},{"objectId":"6389fc4d40970711474f8a13","name":"Tigran","lastName":"Mansuryan","documentHash":"a622c2a4-b805-4509-ae19-b01e4ea675b3"},{"objectId":"6389fc4d40970711474f8a12","name":"Alioune","lastName":"Niang","documentHash":"120b82f1-e86c-4213-9496-d712b37807e9"},{"objectId":"6389fc4d40970711474f8a11","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Tonello","documentHash":"b99842a7-ea15-4577-94c9-b2de341b7afc"},{"objectId":"6389fc4d40970711474f8a10","name":"Mesay Addisu","lastName":"Jima","documentHash":"b1718193-4ee7-468b-8870-c092f97cac13"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":"5FFECF2E5A62709C63A8D260B40C0CD90CF8BD0DCCB7FA27183145DDA5B5CBF16812F71E9EEBA4A8B79058C3D3533F3A261B5BDE1ED8D1DEAD6581D3C27C7140","orcidId":"0000-0001-7885-7395","documentHash":"c2d231ae-c19c-4fa0-aa50-7b4f82f3ffa2"}],"objectId":"6389fc4d40970711474f8a0e","doi":"10.1364/josab.463473","publicUri":"https://opg.optica.org/viewmedia.cfm?URI=josab-39-8-2172&seq=0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Numerical analysis of beam self-cleaning in multimode fiber amplifiers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recent experimental results have reported the observation of beam self-cleaning or, more generally, nonlinear beam reshaping in active multimode fibers.

Simulations confirmthat beam cleaning of the signal may take place even in amplifying fibers, in the absence of beam power conservation. Moreover, we show how the local signal intensity maxima, which are periodically generated by the self-imaging process, may influence the population inversion of the doping atoms, and locally saturate the amplifier gain.

The molecule consists of a linear backbone with two branching points at both ends, with functionalities f1 and f2. Here, the main attention is concentrated on studying the impact of the central backbone length on the configura-tional charactersitics of complex molecule, such as size and shape ratios. We apply both a direct polymer renor-malization scheme based on continuous chain model and the alternative Wei's method to analyze a set of size and shape properties of pom-pom polymers in dilute solution. The size ratio of a pom-pom and a chain polymer of the same total molecular mass is calculated with an excluded volume interaction taken into account, and es-timates for asphericity are found in Gaussian approximation, whereas for the size ratio we found a monotonous dependence of the length of backbone at different functionalities of side arms.

So far, such approaches have been limited to models with nearest-neighbor interactions. This assumption is seemingly justified due to a strong screening of inter-ionic interactions in narrow conducting pores. However, how important is the extent of these interactions? Does it affect the energy storage and phase behavior of confined ionic liquids? Herein, we address these questions using a two-dimensional lattice model with next-nearest and further neighbor interactions developed to describe ionic liquids in conducting slit confinements. With simulations and analytical calculations, we find that next-nearest interactions enhance capacitance and stored energy densities and may considerably affect the phase behavior. In particular, in some range of voltages, we reveal the emergence of large-scale mesophases that have not been reported before but may play an important role in energy storage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"26","pagesFromTo":"26LT01","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62cd28774097073c6e2cad21","62cd28774097073c6e2cad22","62cd28774097073c6e2cad23","62cd28774097073c6e2cad24","5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789ac","mniswId":"12298","title":"JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER","issn":"0953-8984","eissn":"1361-648X","documentHash":"2a293787-7022-45c0-a116-0aa025486b44"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cd28784097073c6e2cad27","year":"2022","volume":"34","number":"26","documentHash":"05e290b0-9075-4813-a4c1-3b41a3a30f3b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654740012"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62cd646e4097073c6e307eae","name":"Sauro","lastName":"Succi","documentHash":"a505b97b-6024-4d6a-ac9f-88faf79e2443"},{"objectId":"62cd646e4097073c6e307ead","name":"Leon","lastName":"Jurkiewicz","documentHash":"d7f31bba-0fb9-4edd-a443-6d087854e797"},{"objectId":"62cd646e4097073c6e307eac","name":"Marco","lastName":"Lauricella","documentHash":"b50647f9-509d-4c6e-9360-a9c65e84f11f"},{"objectId":"62cd646e4097073c6e307eab","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Bonaccorso","orcidId":"0000-0003-4043-3743","documentHash":"0e80971e-5c58-4cd2-a9ac-1a7f6525efbe"},{"objectId":"62cd646e4097073c6e307eaa","name":"Adriano","lastName":"Tiribocchi","documentHash":"4411c886-1805-41e7-a8e0-1ae7aa9ea279"},{"objectId":"62cd646e4097073c6e307ea9","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Montessori","orcidId":"0000-0002-4469-0344","documentHash":"51deba33-83e5-47e3-b762-3634b9c1f5ae"},{"objectId":"5f6b1d34752340073806aa62","name":"Michał","lastName":"Bogdan","uuid":"F2D6A8CEC51CD514B9FCBBA3F723191CB96DDEBFDC5211668CA7FCC963848D2262CA4411F5D5CD2FE39ACF801D739752FC4901EF728811052FF583F1FB98810E","documentHash":"6f6ce6b4-455b-4ad2-9d49-cfe32d2f5914"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","name":"Jan","lastName":"Guzowski","uuid":"A8B48F7F745AC2DFDED086903CA20E4647AA2D07E044454CCFF949079D1455DCCD7E7BE0AE516AAB19C1A06B1B84EFEE24846B3ABD004DE97B9592C2E299FDDC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8070-3747","documentHash":"ce9af7d5-565c-439c-8f22-2a02a87f3ca4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62cd646e4097073c6e307ea6","doi":"10.1103/physrevlett.128.128001","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.128001","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Stochastic Jetting and Dripping in Confined Soft Granular Flows","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We report new dynamical modes in confined soft granular flows, such as stochastic jetting and dripping, with no counterpart in continuum viscous fluids.

We observe avalanching dynamics and the formation of remarkably stable jets-single-file granular chains-which occasionally break, resulting in a non-Gaussian distribution of cluster sizes.

The dynamics is controlled by the temperature gradient formed around the heated particle. Our results show that the relaxation is asymmetric: The approach to a nonequilibrium steady state is much slower than the return to thermal equilibrium. Approaching a nonequilibrium steady state after a sudden temperature change is a two-step process that overshoots the response of spatial variance of the concentration field. The initial growth of concentration fluctuations after switching on illumination follows a power law in agreement with the hydrodynamic and purely diffusive model. The energy outflow from the system after switching off illumination is well described by a stretched exponential function of time with characteristic time proportional to the ratio of the energy stored in the steady state to the total energy flux in this state."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"105","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"14123","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62f0fbf140970731f3ebe3c1","62f0fbf140970731f3ebe3c2","5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479268","mniswId":"16091","title":"PHYSICAL REVIEW E","issn":"2470-0045","eissn":"2470-0053","documentHash":"9221fb24-c550-45c2-81cb-e582ef7978a9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f0fbf140970731f3ebe3c0","year":"2022","volume":"105","number":"1","documentHash":"a5ae4cd8-c82a-445a-b1a6-ae49afe49990"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654743228"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656f294940970720e100f900","name":"S.","lastName":"Février","documentHash":"352b3f9c-bebc-4ad4-ae10-830ee41860f6"},{"objectId":"656f294940970720e100f8ff","name":"V.","lastName":"Couderc","documentHash":"fc06f2b1-261e-42fa-ae67-8ef688f3820c"},{"objectId":"656f294940970720e100f8fe","name":"A.","lastName":"Tonello","documentHash":"d10e7247-6d47-42fb-8d14-ecf8780697fd"},{"objectId":"656f294940970720e100f8fd","name":"I.","lastName":"Tilouine","documentHash":"7d0a3ec9-73cc-4e31-97ba-775f90b26090"},{"objectId":"656f294940970720e100f8fc","name":"Y.","lastName":"Arosa","documentHash":"2e4991d5-df07-4e2f-b86e-61ec53b762ec"},{"objectId":"656f294940970720e100f8fb","name":"G.","lastName":"Granger","documentHash":"f6cbd130-10e1-4f54-8e91-af7306366a1b"},{"objectId":"656f294940970720e100f8fa","name":"Y.","lastName":"Leventoux","documentHash":"eda76b20-f54c-416c-aae5-ef58b99a0da4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":"5FFECF2E5A62709C63A8D260B40C0CD90CF8BD0DCCB7FA27183145DDA5B5CBF16812F71E9EEBA4A8B79058C3D3533F3A261B5BDE1ED8D1DEAD6581D3C27C7140","orcidId":"0000-0001-7885-7395","documentHash":"c2d231ae-c19c-4fa0-aa50-7b4f82f3ffa2"}],"objectId":"656f294940970720e100f8f8","doi":"10.1364/ol.497678","publicUri":"https://opg.optica.org/viewmedia.cfm?URI=ol-48-17-4582&seq=0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Three octave visible to mid-infrared supercontinuum generation seeded by multimode silica fiber pumped at 1064 nm","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hyperspectral spectroscopy requires light sources with wide spectral ranges from the visible to the mid-infrared.

We illustrate the potential of this light source by recording mid-infrared absorption spectra of organic com-pounds. & COPY; 2023 Optica Publishing Group"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"48","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"4582","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656f294940970720e100f8fa","656f294940970720e100f8fb","656f294940970720e100f8fc","656f294940970720e100f8fd","656f294940970720e100f8fe","656f294940970720e100f8ff","656f294940970720e100f900","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479116","mniswId":"15494","title":"Optics Letters","issn":"0146-9592","eissn":"1539-4794","documentHash":"e0dc24e8-ce6e-4b28-9028-125131008c9c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656f294940970720e100f8f9","year":"2023","volume":"48","number":"17","documentHash":"bd134cb6-d92f-4cdb-ace9-1ecaca0638f2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654768337"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"643d3cc5409707219a509312","name":"A.","lastName":"Picozzi","documentHash":"eb3f754c-33f0-43b1-9c36-8d6f8661334f"},{"objectId":"643d3cc5409707219a509311","name":"G.","lastName":"Millot","documentHash":"ce1b4451-2980-435c-b14c-2216c1f4cbe0"},{"objectId":"643d3cc5409707219a509310","name":"C.","lastName":"Michel","documentHash":"434c9312-2882-46c2-8b1e-0cf5b6ec10b5"},{"objectId":"643d3cc5409707219a50930f","name":"N.","lastName":"Berti","documentHash":"7704b69e-0213-40eb-8692-55f77fd9d101"},{"objectId":"643d3cc5409707219a50930e","name":"A.","lastName":"Fusaro","documentHash":"986aa11a-1dc6-4fee-8447-91f87dd33098"},{"objectId":"643d3cc5409707219a50930d","name":"J.","lastName":"Garnier","documentHash":"7a3ab4aa-a367-49a4-9da3-ba9af8ad3a94"},{"objectId":"643d3cc5409707219a50930c","name":"K.","lastName":"Baudin","documentHash":"729d2a2f-70d5-4fec-ab6c-69936a46287a"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":"5FFECF2E5A62709C63A8D260B40C0CD90CF8BD0DCCB7FA27183145DDA5B5CBF16812F71E9EEBA4A8B79058C3D3533F3A261B5BDE1ED8D1DEAD6581D3C27C7140","orcidId":"0000-0001-7885-7395","documentHash":"c2d231ae-c19c-4fa0-aa50-7b4f82f3ffa2"}],"objectId":"643d3cc5409707219a50930a","doi":"10.1103/physrevlett.130.063801","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.063801","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Observation of Light Thermalization to Negative-Temperature Rayleigh-Jeans Equilibrium States in Multimode Optical Fibers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although the temperature of a thermodynamic system is usually believed to be a positive quantity, under particular conditions, negative-temperature equilibrium states are also possible. Negative-temperature equilibriums have been observed with spin systems, cold atoms in optical lattices, and two-dimensional quantum superfluids. Here we report the observation of Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization of light waves to negative-temperature equilibrium states. The optical wave relaxes to the equilibrium state through its propagation in a multimode optical fiber-i.e., in a conservative Hamiltonian system. The bounded energy spectrum of the optical fiber enables negative-temperature equilibriums with high energy levels (high-order fiber modes) more populated than low energy levels (low-order modes). Our experiments show that negative-temperature speckle beams are featured, in average, by a nonmonotonic radial intensity profile. The experimental results are in quantitative agreement with the Rayleigh-Jeans theory without free parameters. Bringing negative temperatures to the field of optics opens the door to the investigation of fundamental issues of negative-temperature states in a flexible experimental environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"130","issue":"6","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["643d3cc5409707219a50930c","643d3cc5409707219a50930d","643d3cc5409707219a50930e","643d3cc5409707219a50930f","643d3cc5409707219a509310","643d3cc5409707219a509311","643d3cc5409707219a509312","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479269","mniswId":"16093","title":"Physical Review Letters","issn":"0031-9007","websiteLink":"http://journals.aps.org/prl/","documentHash":"a3d4c1a8-c752-4904-89f0-273f0b713632"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"643d3d6a409707219a509a07","year":"2023","volume":"130","number":"6","doi":"","documentHash":"838d0aa5-17a4-4f69-ac22-fdf9d3f4b1ea"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654768626"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6398699840970708596a2ce4","name":"Eric","lastName":"Vauthey","documentHash":"d473758d-c826-457d-ae3a-48449d4f692e"},{"objectId":"6398699840970708596a2ce3","name":"Tatu","lastName":"Kumpulainen","documentHash":"b6aea719-0765-43af-a2ce-1c0e35793c1e"},{"objectId":"5fc4cb6d085dcb1e6ae0b8ff","name":"Idaresit","lastName":"Mbakara","orcidId":"0000-0001-8442-0181","documentHash":"6c59b87b-eee2-447b-83cb-dc46fa40a31f"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba5cc","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gajewska","uuid":"1005F4C75920A67E89812EFB931A6C15E977606A8589710FBD390688173D421220C9975F6ADF04E485CCFFDB555B5BBCB2449087AB0E40DBAD40F747E8B637DB","documentHash":"a277c0a8-b020-45d7-be67-ab0d7dbf5399"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7799","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nawara","uuid":"90910E82ACD24C3FB83E13AEC3A51E8BEB42647B236ED54FB2C1F9F805C49708DDF0F9AFDE8E5AB9B279A7067E26E76A47807D1546D1C5B01335BCA23734F0B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3847-4856","documentHash":"b1af826e-0f16-4b14-ae14-6c4a302e51a6"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff86","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kijak","uuid":"6D0014D1FB60F4B89A96CE61DE56724016FBC175221013305BD94E0861B3F0C0C44F716CE81502D6E5110D5F3FDA7FFD057DEA890CBD72FE691600CA3C5405A0","orcidId":"0000-0001-9340-583X","documentHash":"443a4505-4b1d-43bb-8fd7-f883335ca686"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Waluk","uuid":"587A78D077C4375A4C980253E3D29FB2074174FC88F6A7341BDCBF8F80F6764FDE1461139B4C2337F132A7A1787A14076B55E79D57654F32E1BE17E03941A875","orcidId":"0000-0001-5745-583X","documentHash":"f8893a20-d629-4008-9c8c-d34c0e171106"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0fa","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Listkowski","uuid":"F7878645DABD740AC23FBC4DB8D3D0B1EC1E5E9AEC4FBC4CDFC96FD20F30B521008A54987060AE79E5970D51D8C805FA17083024B5514294A07F1B8738B23383","orcidId":"0000-0002-6108-9964","documentHash":"ee7e4052-27e2-4611-8cb1-09de9f4b0489"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-11-28","releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"6398699840970708596a2cde","doi":"10.1039/d2cp04555a","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/CP/D2CP04555A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Spectroscopic investigation of photophysics and tautomerism of amino- and nitroporphycenes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Parent, unsubstituted porphycene and its two derivatives: 2,7,12,17-tetra-n-propylporphycene and 2,7,12,17-tetra-t-butylporphycene were substituted at the meso position with amino and nitro groups. These two families of porphycenes were characterized in detail with respect to their spectral, photophysical, and tautomeric properties. Two trans tautomers of similar energies coexist in the ground electronic state, but only one form dominates in the lowest excited singlet state. Absorption, magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), and emission anisotropy combined with quantum-chemical calculations led to the assignment of S-1 and S-2 transitions in both tautomers. Compared with the parent porphycene, the S-1-S-2 energy gap significantly increases; for one tautomeric form, the effect is twice as large as for the other. Both amino- and nitroporphycenes emit single fluorescence; previously reported dual emission of aminoporphycenes is attributed to a degradation product. Introduction of bulky t-butyl groups leads to a huge decrease in fluorescence intensity; this effect, arising from the interaction of the meso substituent with the adjacent t-butyl moiety, is particularly strong in the nitro derivative."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e14d","uid":"bmdKVDpdRKl1usGhQUipgpQ","uuid":"5bb2b585-b070-41eb-866a-c34942735c79","name":"Wydział Matematyczno-Przyrodniczy.Szkoła Nauk Ścisłych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942a878c28a0473b7799","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0fa"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cb6d085dcb1e6ae0b8ff","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff86","5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","5e709450878c28a0473ba5cc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"29655 -

Our results provide indirect evidence of periodic nonlinear mode coupling occurring in graded-index multimode fibers thanks to the modal four-wave-mixing phase-matched via Kerr-induced dynamic index grating."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7a75","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1d","5e709457878c28a0473bad86","644617e84097070d1f4ff695","5e709358878c28a0473a7a33"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","uid":"b6BkjFeIM7Ot5q0lVE0xCWg","uuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Mikroelektroniki i Fotoniki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fd0"],"parentId":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","parentUuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","rootId":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","rootUuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"31","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"13269","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["644617e84097070d1f4ff695","5e709457878c28a0473bad86","644617e84097070d1f4ff697","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fd0","5e709358878c28a0473a7a33","5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e709358878c28a0473a7a75","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479115","mniswId":"15493","title":"Optics Express","issn":"1094-4087","eissn":"1094-4087","websiteLink":"https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/home.cfm","documentHash":"98761133-87bf-4f63-9956-b6628d3829da"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"644617e84097070d1f4ff694","year":"2023","volume":"31","number":"8","documentHash":"41cf715e-965b-44fe-abd7-36b10118e946"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654771871"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61dcf9b97523403b69b16a29","name":"Saeed","lastName":"Samaei","uuid":"A5DAB7069D8FBD29374974DB3C19B58257FFC1D73E1EE4822EC84755B0E01ED24D72A23E5863B19908367F6538773631C119B2FF08035C9C859EAEDC3970AB98","documentHash":"ce6b67cf-13da-4762-b701-8c09ebccfe41"},{"objectId":"5ebee4f2752340254fc447c1","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Nowacka-Pieszak","uuid":"3431C7DF82F5E84379F996CDE05544B270F60C473D473E82E5C4C48C7674D0D50DDAD0459AD5AAD34BB20A2002BA54BF3CAED0B07171A040C6738A5110E4B884","documentHash":"0e18b331-74aa-438a-bb85-be04f2d1fa99"},{"objectId":"5e7094ac878c28a0473c15a6","name":"Żanna","lastName":"Pastuszak-Stępień","uuid":"96F07414D7364B11950C90A267764A9030723FF45549515FE891350B663B508B5BF43542A427116BEF5E54FD58453E3176E427231808579CCA4FF05785AA2577","orcidId":"0000-0002-1806-1587","documentHash":"d2458b91-9228-45c0-b7da-0828c22d409f"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c372","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Borycki","uuid":"8FFFCAE436E598237AF17388C1DC0BEE0B7EBBEFE8098349D95C1CA962C751C11B87DB46A4DFFEBA4F8D9C404FC7EC7EB98000D6EFED8DE01F21FEA352394D85","orcidId":"0000-0002-1235-889X","documentHash":"8c9b1d19-6c92-441e-8e4e-379e92d77c25"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a0473959be","name":"Ganna","lastName":"Gerega","uuid":"535DD843500D466058A8E5031C963602086895BE7B0279D60229F19C21A0BABE1C194BC7F2B95831EC554101907232A96B6269845D44111FF3B358923E8C34F7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9809-6041","documentHash":"8c735b95-a8c9-4329-8442-cd68a4de8c8a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63c00c7040970702a66cec72","doi":"10.1364/boe.472643","publicUri":"https://opg.optica.org/viewmedia.cfm?URI=boe-13-11-5753&seq=0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Continuous-wave parallel interferometric near-infrared spectroscopy (CW πNIRS) with a fast two-dimensional camera","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Interferometric near-infrared spectroscopy (iNIRS) is an optical method that noninvasively measures the optical and dynamic properties of the human brain in vivo. However, the original iNIRS technique uses single-mode fibers for light collection, which reduces the detected light throughput. The reduced light throughput is compensated by the relatively long measurement or integration times (∼1 sec), which preclude monitoring of rapid blood flow changes that could be linked to neural activation. Here, we propose parallel interferometric near-infrared spectroscopy (πNIRS) to overcome this limitation. In πNIRS we use multi-mode fibers for light collection and a high-speed, two-dimensional camera for light detection. Each camera pixel acts effectively as a single iNIRS channel. So, the processed signals from each pixel are spatially averaged to reduce the overall integration time. Moreover, interferometric detection provides us with the unique capability of accessing complex information (amplitude and phase) about the light remitted from the sample, which with more than 8000 parallel channels, enabled us to sense the cerebral blood flow with only a 10 msec integration time (∼100x faster than conventional iNIRS). In this report, we have described the theoretical foundations and possible ways to implement πNIRS. Then, we developed a prototype continuous wave (CW) πNIRS system and validated it in liquid phantoms. We used our CW πNIRS to monitor the pulsatile blood flow in a human forearm in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that CW πNIRS could monitor activation of the prefrontal cortex by recording the change in blood flow in the forehead of the subject while he was reading an unknown text."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebee4f2752340254fc447c1","5e7092c3878c28a04739c372"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We estimate the nuclear spin–rotation, spin–spin, and quadrupole coupling constants for bialkali four-atom complexes using ab initio quantum-chemical methods and model the reaction kinetics using an extended rate equation approach. We also reveal that the interaction-induced variation of the electron spin–nuclear spin couplings may explain the recently observed long lifetime of alkali-metal three-atom complexes formed in atom-molecule collisions.

In a previous work we described a novel method for the representation of the full shape of the ex vivo crystalline lens called eigenlenses , which proved more compact and accurate than compared state-of-the art methods of crystalline lens shape quantification. Here we demonstrate the use of eigenlenses to estimate the full shape of the crystalline lens in vivo from optical coherence tomography images, where only the information visible through the pupil is available. We compare the performance of eigenlenses with previous methods of full crystalline lens shape estimation, and demonstrate an improvement in repeatability, robustness and use of computational resources.

Despite this, we observe only moderate differences in the period of oscillations of the pressure with the slit width and virtually coinciding decay lengths as functions of the scaling variable sigma ion=lambda D, where sigma ion is the ion diameter and lambda D the Debye length. Moreover, in the electrostatic-dominated regime, this scaling behavior is practically independent of the relative permittivity and its dependence on the ion concentration. In contrast, the crossover to the hard-core-dominated regime depends sensitively on all three factors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"131","issue":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6569cb524097077c04787dde","5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","6569cb524097077c04787ddf","6569cb524097077c04787de0","6569cb524097077c04787de1","6569cb524097077c04787de2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479269","mniswId":"16093","title":"PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS","issn":"0031-9007","documentHash":"284fd6de-6530-44df-86dc-9540c25bb082"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6569cb524097077c04787ddd","year":"2023","volume":"131","number":"11","documentHash":"142553d5-af40-4617-8df1-2816cc0ee1dc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654889411"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"653902d240970744d5b4999b","name":"Andreas","lastName":"Carlson","documentHash":"069b5aad-e783-4e4e-9cc2-3d836b50493f"},{"objectId":"653902d240970744d5b4999a","name":"Mathijs","lastName":"Janssen","documentHash":"a59e5f9c-d4f0-42b8-910a-9007b8bd0fbd"},{"objectId":"5fc4cda1085dcb1e6ae0b90d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Kondrat","uuid":"4C8E231D76FA1FF9DEBFB40938EB36AF89D302A9BF4FB4483D4EB2BD2B36DFFFCE516493C98DF050048768547005AB2F2AB230D9F072ED3FD77064BDE749E112","orcidId":"0000-0003-4448-0686","documentHash":"22911df0-6857-4e43-8285-ca3bbbff21b2"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0d09","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Skóra","uuid":"46B2F11BE21F55C65DC8D9F4984C451AF491A8DC67693D0E6239C9EDF030297E46D57E58955BA52B46C1E06476A07B8CEE52AAACB9DAF0F91C3D9EE6C0D4B187","orcidId":"0000-0003-4394-4928","documentHash":"1a9391b4-5767-42d2-9283-1f530abb6d3a"}],"objectId":"653902d240970744d5b49999","doi":"10.1103/physrevlett.130.258401","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.258401","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Crowding-Regulated Binding of Divalent Biomolecules","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Macromolecular crowding affects biophysical processes as diverse as diffusion, gene expression, cell growth, and senescence. Yet, there is no comprehensive understanding of how crowding affects reactions, particularly multivalent binding. Herein, we use scaled particle theory and develop a molecular simulation method to investigate the binding of monovalent to divalent biomolecules. We find that crowding can increase or reduce cooperativity—the extent to which the binding of a second molecule is enhanced after binding a first molecule—by orders of magnitude, depending on the sizes of the involved molecular complexes. Cooperativity generally increases when a divalent molecule swells and then shrinks upon binding two ligands. Our calculations also reveal that, in some cases, crowding enables binding that does not occur otherwise. As an immunological example, we consider immunoglobulin G-antigen binding and show that crowding enhances its cooperativity in bulk but reduces it when an immunoglobulin G binds antigens on a surface."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii

N,N-donor ligands: 2-di(pyridyl)ketone (Py2CO), 2,2′-biimidazole (H2biim) and 2-(2′-pyridyl)benzimidazole (PyBIm). In the obtained complexes, SC-X-ray analysis revealed that Ir(III) has an octahedral coordination sphere with chromophores of the type {IrN2C2Cl2} (1) or {IrN4C2} (2–4). The complexes obtained, which have been fully characterised by physicochemical methods (CHN, TG, FTIR, UV-Vis, PL and 1H, 13C, 15N NMR), were used to continue our studies on the factors influencing the cytotoxic properties of potential chemotherapeutic agents (in vitro). To this end, the following studies are presented: (i) comparative analysis of the effects on the biological properties of N,N-donor ligands and C,N-donor ligands in the studied complexes, (ii) studies of the interactions of the compounds with the selected molecular target: DNA and BSA (UV-Vis, CD and PL methods), (iii) and the reactivity towards redox molecules: GSH, NADH (UV-Vis and/or ESI-MS methods), (iv) cytotoxic activity (IC50) of potential chemotherapeutics against MCF-7, K-562 and CCRF-CEM cell lines."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397cb0","65333a5e40e3ff51d51ed8c0","653337aa40e3ff51d51ed1d5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a047398467"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","uid":"b21X69XXr6O_0TDjOCQ3WhA","uuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","name":"Narodowy Instytut Leków","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b22"],"parentId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","parentUuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","rootId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc1","rootUuid":"8b0d7c21-1910-4cfc-be64-151bb01ed2be","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397cef","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"53","issue":"34","pagesFromTo":"14438-14450","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397cb0","65333a5e40e3ff51d51ed8c0","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","66d81374fdbe833705ad1d41","66d81374fdbe833705ad1d42","5e70928e878c28a047397cef","653337aa40e3ff51d51ed1d5","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b22","5e709294878c28a047398467","66d81374fdbe833705ad1d46","66d81374fdbe833705ad1d47"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778f6","mniswId":"4868","title":"Dalton Transactions","doi":"10.1039/c5dt","issn":"1477-9226","eissn":"1477-9234","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/dt","documentHash":"36c7053d-ce23-4ec3-9b37-3552e1f9c3ba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d81374fdbe833705ad1d3f","year":"2024","volume":"53","number":"34","documentHash":"7600a9a6-c7cd-42d1-923f-a158054953df"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cyclometalated Ir(iii) complexes","3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazole","Cytotoxic properties","Chemotherapeutic agents"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654893121"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc4cb6d085dcb1e6ae0b8ff","name":"Idaresit","lastName":"Mbakara","orcidId":"0000-0001-8442-0181","documentHash":"6c59b87b-eee2-447b-83cb-dc46fa40a31f"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba5cc","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gajewska","uuid":"1005F4C75920A67E89812EFB931A6C15E977606A8589710FBD390688173D421220C9975F6ADF04E485CCFFDB555B5BBCB2449087AB0E40DBAD40F747E8B637DB","documentHash":"a277c0a8-b020-45d7-be67-ab0d7dbf5399"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7799","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nawara","uuid":"90910E82ACD24C3FB83E13AEC3A51E8BEB42647B236ED54FB2C1F9F805C49708DDF0F9AFDE8E5AB9B279A7067E26E76A47807D1546D1C5B01335BCA23734F0B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3847-4856","documentHash":"b1af826e-0f16-4b14-ae14-6c4a302e51a6"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b232","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Waluk","uuid":"587A78D077C4375A4C980253E3D29FB2074174FC88F6A7341BDCBF8F80F6764FDE1461139B4C2337F132A7A1787A14076B55E79D57654F32E1BE17E03941A875","orcidId":"0000-0001-5745-583X","documentHash":"f8893a20-d629-4008-9c8c-d34c0e171106"}],"objectId":"655ddc9a40970728e32dc0e7","doi":"10.1142/s1088424623501122","publicUri":"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S1088424623501122","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Instability of 9-aminoporphycenes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"9-aminoporphycenes degrade over time, yielding products that emit in a similar spectral region as the parent compounds.

Most experimental and theoretical studies of beam self-cleaning have neglected the role of the state of polarization of light. In this work, we fill this gap by reporting extensive experimental investigations of beam self-cleaning in multimode fibers, for beams with different input states of light polarization. We found that the state of polarization undergoes a complex evolution, which may lead either to full conservation of the input state of polarization, or to nearly complete light depolarization at the fiber output. The former outcome is compelling for applications based on the beam self-cleaning effect, such as multimode mode-locked fiber lasers for micromachining, and multimode devices for microscopy and endoscopy. The latter result, instead, permits to test the limits of validity of current purely scalar theoretical approaches for describing nonlinear propagation in multimode fibers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1-6","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656da48840970718551bbc55","656da48840970718551bbc56","656da48840970718551bbc57","656da48840970718551bbc58","656da48840970718551bbc59","656da48840970718551bbc5a","656da48840970718551bbc5b","656da48840970718551bbc5c","656da48840970718551bbc5d","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fca","mniswId":"7924","title":"IEEE Photonics Journal","issn":"1943-0655","eissn":"1943-0647","documentHash":"e305a9e6-2f84-4eef-89be-8f31c02d221e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656da48840970718551bbc54","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"5","documentHash":"7cf3f6ac-e614-458d-b448-0129a0d4693f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654910517"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afac3","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ochab-Marcinek","uuid":"7C0104EEE330B2CBBA3F6D9EE86214C6019BE44A4327775A8F3416F019D42ACB42FCAAAF4EE8C334B58DBA3CA7F94F127893A9E4187D690113AE66A66A17308D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2462-0656","documentHash":"4e2de1ed-89ac-4842-b68e-dfa4dbcf3b25"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9a4d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Rubin","uuid":"13324027C627B39585F3C2B810CF7EAFF495CDA71C3F7EFCE826D7C69C37C8D9D4DC700EE328E59D82C9F032D5A05171EEF344B72AAEBBB37B8E5F505C3047E9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8565-0894","documentHash":"88446ef2-02f1-498c-a57e-6edf21a7f444"},{"objectId":"5e70927b878c28a047396813","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Jędrak","uuid":"1D65E908B6021B676CD8347F654FABBE2B33137A296E0DA975C7D9EE74AD96266AD76E9EE787A21283B7F9472E1D96E9AA2AF9475B02F7AACB7128CA493DD57F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7192-628X","documentHash":"f5184939-e4b9-4ee9-b1e2-d91ce65f43f7"}],"objectId":"6777b982fdbe833ec1c95348","doi":"10.1103/physreve.108.024405","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevE.108.024405","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Generalization of Powell's results to population out of steady state","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Since the seminal work of Powell, the relationships between the population growth rate, the probability distributions of generation time, and the distribution of cell age have been known for the bacterial population in a steady state of exponential growth.

In particular, we derive a time-dependent Euler-Lotka equation (relating the generation-time distributions to the population growth rate) and a generalization of the inequality between the mean generation time and the population doubling time. To do this, we use a model proposed by Lebowitz and Rubinow, in which each cell is described by its age and generation time. We show that our results remain valid for a class of more complex models that use other state variables in addition to cell age and generation time, as long as the integration of these additional variables reduces the model to Lebowitz-Rubinow form. As an application of this formalism, we calculate the fitness landscapes for phenotypic traits (cell age, generation time) in a population that is not growing exponentially. We clarify that the known fitness landscape formula for the cell age as a phenotypic trait is an approximation to the exact time-dependent formula."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709371878c28a0473a9a4d","5e70927b878c28a047396813","5e7093b7878c28a0473afac3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"108","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927b878c28a047396813","5e709371878c28a0473a9a4d","5e7093b7878c28a0473afac3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479268","mniswId":"16091","title":"Physical review.

However, due to their high cost and reduced transportability, access to them for screening and surgical planning is still limited in low-resource and remote settings. To increase patients' access to optical biometry we propose a novel low-cost frequency-domain optical delay line (FD-ODL) based on an inexpensive stepper motor spinning a tilted mirror, for integration into a time-domain (TD)-biometer, amenable to a compact footprint. In the proposed FD-ODL, the axial scan range and the A-scan rate are decoupled from one another, as the former only depends on the spinning mirror tilt angle, while the A-scan rate only depends on the motor shaft rotational speed. We characterized the scanning performance and specifications for two spinning mirror tilt angles, and compared them to those of the standard, more expensive FD-ODL implementation, employing a galvanometric scanner for group delay generation. A prototype of the low-cost FD-ODL with a 1.5 deg tilt angle, resulting in an axial scan range of 6.61 mm and an A-scan rate of 10 Hz was experimentally implemented and integrated in a dual sample beam optical low-coherence reflectometry (OLCR) setup with a detour unit to replicate the measurement window around the anterior segment and the retina. The intraocular distances of a model eye were measured with the proposed low-cost biometer and found to be in good agreement with those acquired by a custom swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) system and two commercial biometers, validating our novel design.

The phenomenon is based on visual perception of pulsed infrared lasers (800-1300 nm) due to the isomerization of visual pigments caused by two-photon absorption, with color perception corresponding to a wavelength about one-half of the stimulating wavelength in the near-infrared spectral range. Future applications of this effect, both in medical diagnostics and in virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), require the ability to determine the luminance of the two-photon stimuli. However, the luminous efficiency function V(λ) outside of the visible range is unknown, requiring a non-standard approach to quantifying the luminance of two-photon stimuli. This study proposes a brightness adjustment method to determine the subjective luminance of two-photon infrared stimuli using photometric units. The repeatability of the proposed method with the background on was approximately equal to 407 td, more than twice as good as with the background off. In this report, we present the relationship between the luminance of two-photon stimuli and a physical quantity proposed for the first time: two-photon retinal illuminance. This relationship enables the prediction of stimulus luminance that could achieve nearly 670 cd/m2 within the safe range of laser power for the eye."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","634f612a752340623bbe647b","5e7092c3878c28a04739c396"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["634f612a752340623bbe647b","5e709358878c28a0473a7af7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"5818-5830","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["634f612a752340623bbe647b","67877e81fdbe8374ef29e59a","5e709358878c28a0473a7af7","5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","5e7092c3878c28a04739c396"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477370","mniswId":"2493","title":"Biomedical Optics Express","issn":"2156-7085","eissn":"2156-7085","documentHash":"ad33cf3a-a459-48a7-9538-b9faa1d30caa"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654951757"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6023ab1c9543c7744e88f338","name":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Everts","uuid":"E02DE9E94AC1344B4297CD389B04020818F0DD7687F20293A8707839A26A90EF215970AF7A7F699751362408153D4AE984238BCA887577B6A0607CBE2FC4F82E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6289-3252","documentHash":"f1be3ee8-6e70-4de5-a5ab-acfed683e0c0"},{"objectId":"5e709353878c28a0473a7544","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Cichocki","uuid":"96C768B2E3DB2A4C4951FB3250F9D2D850893B6FF7E38458FD5B81A496218CE7E5A3AE5D0111EE2CB6C88B41628520DC18F799FDB45C6ACE3E80A4B86464573D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3059-4172","documentHash":"899b4ee8-fa8b-4998-acea-1f867db589e2"}],"objectId":"6662d4824097075bc10e20a2","doi":"10.1103/physrevlett.132.218303","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.218303","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Dissipative Effects in Odd Viscous Stokes Flow around a Single Sphere","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Odd viscosity (OV) is a transport coefficient in, for example, fluids of self-spinning (active) particles or electrons in an external magnetic field. The key feature of OV is that it does not contribute to dissipation in two spatial dimensions.

We quantify the dissipation rate of a single spherical particle moving through a fluid with OV via an exact analytical solution of the generalized stationary creeping flow equations. Our results provide a novel way to quantify the effects of OV by measuring the solid-body motion of a single spherical particle. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate how complex fluids can be designed in terms of their rheological properties by mixing passive particles with self-spinning active particles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709353878c28a0473a7544"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6023ab1c9543c7744e88f338"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"132","issue":"218303","pagesFromTo":"1-7","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6023ab1c9543c7744e88f338","5e709353878c28a0473a7544"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479269","mniswId":"16093","title":"PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS","issn":"0031-9007","documentHash":"284fd6de-6530-44df-86dc-9540c25bb082"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6662d4824097075bc10e20a3","year":"2024","volume":"132","number":"21","documentHash":"c2bd6c76-a1aa-456c-a800-ba2dbf6cf248"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654951766"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db7b","name":"Vincent","lastName":"Couderc","documentHash":"a29db41e-db09-41d5-bdc4-797fb09cf157"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db7a","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Wabnitz","documentHash":"3312ef08-759e-4494-89f1-8ed47faa2a86"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db79","name":"Denis","lastName":"Kharenko","documentHash":"257b86e9-913a-4ca3-bf0a-1365d1adbe8d"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db78","name":"Sebastien","lastName":"Fevrier","documentHash":"c8a6f272-eb1d-41ce-8a43-a9d145b0cd93"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db77","name":"Yifan","lastName":"Sun","documentHash":"f189446c-38ad-4f90-a8fe-0d827679369f"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db76","name":"Tigran","lastName":"Mansuryan","documentHash":"f320a5df-57dc-41f6-80a3-c0ad38900610"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db75","name":"Mario","lastName":"Zitelli","documentHash":"b915f8fb-fb72-4e01-82fb-0739eaede6b9"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db74","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Tonello","documentHash":"ae8ab3ae-d6b0-49df-bf0e-10e998661923"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db73","name":"Yann","lastName":"Leventoux","documentHash":"7ac62e3c-72c2-4d01-9991-c4bd976ab848"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db72","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Mangini","documentHash":"b803dbb4-1b4c-45aa-8b5a-e8c11c35830d"},{"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db71","name":"Mario","lastName":"Ferraro","documentHash":"dcc27fc7-e314-4f05-9a3f-65134b303cb5"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":"5FFECF2E5A62709C63A8D260B40C0CD90CF8BD0DCCB7FA27183145DDA5B5CBF16812F71E9EEBA4A8B79058C3D3533F3A261B5BDE1ED8D1DEAD6581D3C27C7140","orcidId":"0000-0001-7885-7395","documentHash":"c2d231ae-c19c-4fa0-aa50-7b4f82f3ffa2"}],"objectId":"666ae11b409707241900db6f","doi":"10.1109/jlt.2023.3239385","publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/50/10121488/10025387.pdf?arnumber=10025387","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Multimode Optical Fiber Beam-By-Beam Cleanup","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We introduce and experimentally demonstrate the concept of all-optical beam switching in graded-index multimode optical fibers.

Therefore, it is important to develop affordable and large-scale deployable sensors for quick screening to detect contamination in honey. In this article, a flexible electrochemical biosensor modified with graphene oxide + poly (3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (GO+PEDOT:PSS) for detecting glucose adulteration in honey has been demonstrated. The contemplated sensor has been examined for synthetic glucose samples in the range of 1-30 mM and for honey samples spiked with glucose with an equivalent adulteration range of 0.05%-10% (w/w). The electrodes are modified by adding GO with PEDOT:PSS (1:1 v/v) on silver electrodes over the flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate. A 0.08-mM limit of detection (LOD) for glucose is achieved with a considerably high linearity of (R-2 = 0.99165) in synthetic glucose and honey samples spiked with glucose (R-2 = 0.973) with a sensitivity value of 117.6 mu A Cm(-2)mM(-1). The dynamic range was calculated to be 0.29-26.06 mM/L. Moreover, the flexibility of the sensor was tested and it was found to be stable for more than 250 bending cycles. The method described in this work is facile, quick, and label-free.

This work presents an all-polarization-maintaining Yb-doped fiber laser oscillator that operates in a dispersion-managed dissipative soliton regime, thanks to incorporating a chirped fiber Bragg grating. The oscillator, mode-locked via a nonlinear optical loop mirror, has an unconventional semi-linear cavity of net anomalous dispersion. Unlike in standard ring resonators, the ultrashort pulse undergoes amplification twice per cavity roundtrip. Additionally, we report a duality of pulsed operation states depending on the pumping power. Strikingly, the oscillator can work in a subregime similar to the standard dissipative soliton, facilitating further energy scaling at anomalous dispersion. We characterize the low-noise setup capable of delivering pulse energy as high as 6.4 nJ using standard single-mode polarization-maintaining optical fibers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","5e709479878c28a0473bde7c","60c2fe839543c72336543828"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"42","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"386-393","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fe839543c72336543828","5e709479878c28a0473bde7c","5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478812","mniswId":"11667","title":"JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY","issn":"0733-8724","documentHash":"e20254c9-7115-4c4d-baf3-bfcd6328b40d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66828cc5fdbe832502427be4","year":"2024","volume":"42","number":"1","documentHash":"5a506494-4180-46cd-9214-ff0d5b68b59a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fiber Laser","Anomalous Dispersion","Yb-doped Fiber","Net Dispersion","Net Anomalous Dispersion","Optical Fiber","Energy Scale","Pulse Energy","Pump Power","Ring Resonator","Fiber Bragg Grating","Polarization-maintaining Fiber","Pulsed Operation","Frequency Band","Self-phase Modulation","Spectral Filtering"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654961927"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66191510409707089193d0da","name":"V.","lastName":"Couderc","documentHash":"27a02d01-97f1-4a60-9007-6ff54bf8c367"},{"objectId":"66191510409707089193d0d9","name":"S.","lastName":"Wabnitz","documentHash":"f50c6ec7-cb42-4073-b62d-96e16f217bf9"},{"objectId":"66191510409707089193d0d8","name":"B.","lastName":"Wetzel","documentHash":"ca3434ba-fad7-4de1-97af-88e0940581a9"},{"objectId":"66191510409707089193d0d7","name":"Y.

The first mode carries most of the input pump energy, and experiences spectral broadening. Whereas the second mode preserves the narrow bandwidth of the remaining part of the pump. Bimodal propagation, with a power unbalance strongly in favor of the fundamental mode, is naturally obtained by maximizing coupling into the fundamental mode of the fiber. At the fiber output, the nearly monochromatic beam and the supercontinuum carried by the two different modes are combined by a microscope objective, and used as a pump and a Stokes wave for self-referenced multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering micro-spectroscopy. The spectral resolution, the signal-to-noise-ratio, and the possible amplification of the remaining pump beam are discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii

Microcirculation and neurovascular coupling are important parameters to study in neurological and neuro-ophthalmic conditions. As the retina shares many similarities with the cerebral cortex and is optically accessible, a special focus is directed to assessing the chorioretinal structure, microvasculature, and hemodynamics of mice, a vital animal model for vision and neuroscience research. Aim We aim to introduce an optical imaging tool enabling in vivo volumetric mouse retinal monitoring of vascular hemodynamics with high temporal resolution. Approach We translated the spatio-temporal optical coherence tomography (STOC-T) technique into the field of small animal imaging by designing a new optical system that could compensate for the mouse eye refractive error. We also developed post-processing algorithms, notably for the assessment of (i) localized hemodynamics from the analysis of pulse wave-induced Doppler artifact modulation and (ii) retinal tissue displacement from phase-sensitive measurements. Results We acquired high-quality, in vivo volumetric mouse retina images at a rate of 113 Hz over a lateral field of view of similar to 500 mu m. We presented high-resolution en face images of the retinal and choroidal structure and microvasculature from various layers, after digital aberration correction. We were able to measure the pulse wave velocity in capillaries of the outer plexiform layer with a mean speed of 0.35 mm/s and identified venous and arterial pulsation frequency and phase delay. We quantified the modulation amplitudes of tissue displacement near major vessels (with peaks of 150 nm), potentially carrying information about the biomechanical properties of the retinal layers involved. Last, we identified the delays between retinal displacements due to the passing of venous and arterial pulse waves. Conclusions The developed STOC-T system provides insights into the hemodynamics of the mouse retina and choroid that could be beneficial in the study of neurovascular coupling and vasculature and flow speed anomalies in neurological and neuro-ophthalmic conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","61c3ed387523404d4a922e4a","61f211b875234061bbd6b6b2","5e709373878c28a0473a9ddb","5e709469878c28a0473bc8e4","5e70947a878c28a0473be087","60c2fc059543c723365432f1","5e709433878c28a0473b80d4","5e7092c3878c28a04739c372","5f505f00752340073806a8ca","616a392975234017e05459e5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"4","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947a878c28a0473be087","61c3ed387523404d4a922e4a","5e709469878c28a0473bc8e4","616a392975234017e05459e5","60c2fc059543c723365432f1","5e709373878c28a0473a9ddb","5e709433878c28a0473b80d4","5f505f00752340073806a8ca","67c6e96dfdbe835704255d7c","5e7092c3878c28a04739c372","5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","61f211b875234061bbd6b6b2","67c6e96dfdbe835704255d7d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5b878c28514547cd8a","mniswId":"14978","title":"Neurophotonics","issn":"2329-423X","eissn":"2329-4248","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"711b6548-88df-4d8e-9872-a94ca58900d1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6772a85ffdbe831015cb5cd1","year":"2024","volume":"11","number":"4","documentHash":"421e6aaa-1258-452e-baa9-39aa1a41d1e8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654968990"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66702bff4097073d0017499d","name":"Susana","lastName":"Marcos","documentHash":"00179d23-ea9f-4bb6-9c13-7bdb7a4875f9"},{"objectId":"66702bff4097073d0017499c","name":"Álvaro","lastName":"de la Peña","documentHash":"4adad2fa-d017-4fb8-a20e-f8e22be3895e"},{"objectId":"66702bff4097073d0017499b","name":"Alberto","lastName":"de Castro","documentHash":"fac81e47-9728-43a5-a6d7-6d021cc48d54"},{"objectId":"66702bff4097073d0017499a","name":"Enrique","lastName":"Gambra","documentHash":"fd3e2ea6-587f-48cb-a6bb-8855965a6a11"},{"objectId":"66702bff4097073d00174999","name":"María Pilar","lastName":"Urizar","documentHash":"3f767ae6-d0f2-42c1-b746-8f5425367544"},{"objectId":"61f211b875234061bbd6b6b2","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Curatolo","uuid":"C2E422BBF43A0B3FD7D1D5287285F431B82D13ACADCAC1D41BACF6A4F2AAE256D06C1CEFB3B4D02976533D79FAE501B3F9F565E5E2C5D538273E9E5D47FFCA6B","documentHash":"a0a23bb2-739a-4329-98b9-b4ee4d21f57a"},{"objectId":"61a59ab87523402fabe16eb2","name":"Onur","lastName":"Cetinkaya","uuid":"F59E4185FF04EFAFB51E0BC1A00CDEC1F097DD6925ED3ED1D6C970D6C2FA91084261EFDB8705C12D38CF1D776C217CBDF5779E466E497445FB54EE73E362C0C8","documentHash":"01d68a15-7912-4add-8132-aed6a79c8852"}],"objectId":"66702bff4097073d00174997","doi":"10.1364/boe.493917","publicUri":"https://opg.optica.org/viewmedia.cfm?URI=boe-14-9-4468&seq=0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Optical beam scanner with reconfigurable non-mechanical control of beam position, angle, and focus for low-cost whole-eye OCT imaging","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Whole-eye optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging is a promising tool in ocular biometry for cataract surgery planning, glaucoma diagnostics and myopia progression studies. However, conventional OCT systems are set up to perform either anterior or posterior eye segment scans and cannot easily switch between the two scan configurations without adding or exchanging optical components to account for the refraction of the eye's optics. Even in state-of-the-art whole-eye OCT systems, the scan configurations are pre-selected and cannot be dynamically reconfigured. In this work, we present the design, optimization and experimental validation of a reconfigurable and low-cost optical beam scanner based on three electro-tunable lenses, capable of non-mechanically controlling the beam position, angle and focus. We derive the analytical theory behind its control. We demonstrate its use in performing alternate anterior and posterior segment imaging by seamlessly switching between a telecentric focused beam scan to an angular collimated beam scan. We characterize the corresponding beam profiles and record whole-eye OCT images in a model eye and in an ex vivo rabbit eye, observing features comparable to those obtained with conventional anterior and posterior OCT scanners. The proposed beam scanner reduces the complexity and cost of other whole-eye scanners and is well suited for 2-D ocular biometry. Additionally, with the added versatility of seamless scan reconfiguration, its use can be easily expanded to other ophthalmic applications and beyond.

Utilizing a hybrid design incorporating a W-shaped double-clad Nd-doped fiber and a single-clad Nd-doped fiber together with filtering out parasitic 1.06 mu m beam, we developed an oscillator capable of delivering ultrashort pulses at the central wavelength of 929 nm. Here, we transferred the crucial components of the technology from the well-developed Yb-doped systems to build an all-polarization-maintaining Nd-doped fiber laser oscillator. The ultrashort pulsed operation is obtained through the passive mode-locking via a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror based on a 3x3 fiber coupler. The self-starting system has a figure-of-8 all-normal-dispersion cavity design and operates in a dissipative soliton regime. The oscillator, generating pulses with energy exceeding 1 nJ, delivers chirped 14.3 ps pulses, which can be compressed to 313 fs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819","5e709479878c28a0473bde7c","60c2fe839543c72336543828"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"31672","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c2fe839543c72336543828","5e709479878c28a0473bde7c","5e7093d0878c28a0473b12c8","5e7093b5878c28a0473af819"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479115","mniswId":"15493","title":"Optics Express","issn":"1094-4087","eissn":"1094-4087","documentHash":"9ea64e06-cc25-4e00-92d2-452ce30d1b16"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67dc18abfdbe831d89b2fa1f","year":"2024","volume":"32","number":"18","documentHash":"64add0cc-3f8e-409b-b092-c3c51f6e00ec"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654979231"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff17","name":"Marek","lastName":"Cinal","uuid":"E59F8F7835B5A91DD6D6B19866A4BE8055CC8AFB9DDC39D25AF22DA4FD37549DB94836E6FF91E20FB76A8F5869E3EF096A3B591B9553E8AA911A34221282088F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1048-2288","documentHash":"d9314671-b978-42c4-bfbb-c92c750e65a7"}],"objectId":"66cdc4adfdbe8324384b953e","doi":"10.1103/physrevb.109.024424","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.024424","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Intraband terms of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy in layered systems without inversion symmetry","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The origin of the intraband term of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) energy, which has been shown to be present for layered systems without the inversion symmetry and be of similar magnitude as the interband term [M. Cinal, Phys. Rev. B 105, 104403 (2022)], is investigated by considering a layered magnetic system perturbed by the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at zero temperature. It is revealed that the second-order intraband contributions to the system band energy (the sum of the energies of occupied electron states), which are determined by the squares of the first-order corrections to electron energies at the Fermi surface (FS), actually result from small shifts of the FS sheets due to the SOC, the sheets being curves in the two-dimensional Brillouin zone. Thus, the intraband contributions to the band energy of the perturbed system, and, consequently, to the MCA energy defined as the difference of the band energies for two magnetization directions, come from the narrow stripelike regions of the Brillouin zone between the perturbed and unperturbed FS sheets for consecutive energy bands. In addition, the representation of the MCA energy as half the difference of the SOC energies for two magnetization directions, often used for spatial decomposition of this energy, is reexamined. It is shown that such an alternative representation, previously derived from the standard second-order perturbation-theory (PT) formula for the MCA energy which does not contain intraband terms [V. Antropov, L. Ke, and D. angstrom berg, Solid State Commun. 194, 35 (2014)], is also valid in the absence of the inversion symmetry since the PT expansion of this representation includes, in fact, the intraband terms, and exactly reproduces the present extended second-order PT formula for the MCA energy. The theoretical findings are illustrated with the exemplary results for Co-based layered systems with and without the inversion symmetry: the Co film, the Co/Cu and Cu/Pd bilayers, as well as the Pd/Co/Pd trilayer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff17"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"109","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff17"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479265","mniswId":"16088","title":"Physical Review B","issn":"2469-9950","documentHash":"4f3c70f9-6d98-4157-9484-705c9f5fa489"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ca292c4097071d9487b186","year":"2024","volume":"109","number":"2","documentHash":"56165187-6494-4f9f-8a1d-3efd70d33f7f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654979245"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67dc1913fdbe831d89b2fccf","name":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Kitahata","documentHash":"32f29655-1f17-4deb-a8ab-0ee647290c06"},{"objectId":"67dc1913fdbe831d89b2fcce","name":"Masanori","lastName":"Fujinami","documentHash":"a787f12d-4701-4ad3-b084-e5588cab6a1e"},{"objectId":"67dc1913fdbe831d89b2fccd","name":"Tomonori","lastName":"Nomoto","documentHash":"a13c4918-f1c7-4c52-b411-caee90ed4c03"},{"objectId":"67dc1913fdbe831d89b2fccc","name":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Ito","documentHash":"392c8375-19de-4d76-89fd-f43fe1687274"},{"objectId":"67dc1913fdbe831d89b2fccb","name":"Sayaka","lastName":"Otani","documentHash":"b8c25181-5559-48de-9808-d11eec39585d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b050","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Górecki","uuid":"5C1C88BEF5066E9C3874BDB6264294C1392BD86C12A9F48FB84DCDF91ECC0D7892866EA7D364E14630DDA5138F0746E07B789269886028DCDB2ABF6BD86EA9B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4574-0083","documentHash":"95958b83-8129-419e-8027-969462b967a4"}],"objectId":"67dc1913fdbe831d89b2fcc9","doi":"10.1103/physreve.110.044602","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.044602","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Deformation dynamics of an oil droplet into a crescent shape during intermittent motion","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A paraffin droplet containing camphor and oil red O (dye) floating on the water surface shows spontaneous motion and deformation generated by the surface tension gradient around the droplet.

However, the recovery result depends on factors such as the instrument response function (IRF), analyzed TOF gate start time, gate width and the source-detector separation (SDS). In this research we evaluate the performance of the td-DCS technique at three SDSs of 1.5, 2 and 2.5 cm to recover cerebral blood flow (CBF). To do that we presented comprehensive characterization of the td-DCS system through a series of phantom experiments. First by quality metrices such as coefficient of variation and contrast-to-noise ratios, we identified optimal time gate(s) of the TOF to extract dynamics of particles. Then using sensitivity metrices, each SDS ability to detect dynamics of particles in superficial and deeper layer was evaluated. Finally, td-DCS at each SDS was tested on healthy volunteers during cuff occlusion test and breathing tasks. According to phantom measurements, the sensitivity to estimate perfusion within the deep layer located at depth of 1.5 cm from the surface can be increased more than two times when the SDS increases from 1.5 cm to 2.5 cm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Here, we demonstrate that lethal mutations actually accelerate adaptation on rugged fitness landscapes with multiple peaks and valleys in the presence of competition for resources. We investigate a modified stochastic version of the quasispecies model, incorporating two types of genotypes-viable and lethal-and show that higher rates of lethal mutations result in shorter evolution times towards the best-fit genotype.

Whereas bulk rheology of such materials has been thoroughly investigated, the internal structural mechanics of finite soft-granular structures with free interfaces is still poorly understood. Here, we report the spontaneous crystallization and melting inside a model soft granular cluster-a densely packed aggregate of N similar to 30-40 droplets engulfed by a fluid film-subject to a varying external flow. We develop machine learning tools to track the internal rearrangements in the quasi-two-dimensional cluster as it transits a sequence of constrictions. As the cluster relaxes from a state of strong mechanical deformations, we find differences in the dynamics of the grains within the interior of the cluster and those at its rim, with the latter experiencing larger deformations and less frequent rearrangements, effectively acting as an elastic membrane around a fluidlike core. We conclude that the observed structural-dynamical heterogeneity results from an interplay of the topological constrains, due to the presence of a closed interface, and the internal solid-fluid transitions. We discuss the universality of such behavior in various types of finite soft granular structures, including biological tissues."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f6b1d34752340073806aa62","6528abab40e3ff51d51c4aa6","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"3","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f6b1d34752340073806aa62","673b2b86fdbe831377a273c5","673b2b86fdbe831377a273c6","6528abab40e3ff51d51c4aa6","673b2b86fdbe831377a273c7","673b2b86fdbe831377a273c8","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb849","mniswId":"30138","title":"Physical Review Research","eissn":"2643-1564","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6a2098e0-4cc5-4ccd-ba3f-adf656e0c1d6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66cd7946fdbe83243847edde","year":"2024","volume":"6","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"f77a3582-57ca-4b31-b35e-d7047cfbf156"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655033880"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67653338fdbe832d0ce210c4","name":"Silke","lastName":"Henkes","documentHash":"ed9ad9fc-7c16-4c7f-8d94-20d058ee1164"},{"objectId":"67653338fdbe832d0ce210c3","name":"Cornelis","lastName":"Weijer","documentHash":"6ca6d3c6-8c15-4c23-a010-49235830f06f"},{"objectId":"67653338fdbe832d0ce210c2","name":"Manli","lastName":"Chuai","documentHash":"07337117-2beb-4996-91dc-a18a83440c38"},{"objectId":"67653338fdbe832d0ce210c1","name":"Rastko","lastName":"Sknepnek","documentHash":"1398f5d7-163c-4e65-b7e0-74dfe2e818fa"},{"objectId":"605d9dc69543c745d80e5a9b","name":"Ilyas","lastName":"Djafer-Cherif","uuid":"7C40BE08A6BF9DF09DD1FEC64F3FF9D79D03C016C66CC6F2A0BEC1B78050FF0382430071DAACA4F2E191D92DA9447557FEF15BA6E874351ECDA17AC229DD9867","documentHash":"03356950-89c2-4f09-88fc-41258c7d3d88"}],"objectId":"67653338fdbe832d0ce210c0","doi":"10.7554/elife.79862","publicUri":"https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/79862/elife-79862-v4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Generating active T1 transitions through mechanochemical feedback","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Convergence-extension in embryos is controlled by chemical and mechanical signalling. A key cellular process is the exchange of neighbours via T1 transitions. We propose and analyse a model with positive feedback between recruitment of myosin motors and mechanical tension in cell junctions. The model produces active T1 events, which act to elongate the tissue perpendicular to the main direction of tissue stress. Using an idealised tissue patch comprising several active cells embedded in a matrix of passive hexagonal cells, we identified an optimal range of mechanical stresses to trigger an active T1 event. We show that directed stresses also generate tension chains in a realistic patch made entirely of active cells of random shapes and leads to convergence-extension over a range of parameters. Our findings show that active intercalations can generate stress that activates T1 events in neighbouring cells, resulting in tension-dependent tissue reorganisation, in qualitative agreement with experiments on gastrulation in chick embryos."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["605d9dc69543c745d80e5a9b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67653338fdbe832d0ce210c1","605d9dc69543c745d80e5a9b","67653338fdbe832d0ce210c2","67653338fdbe832d0ce210c3","67653338fdbe832d0ce210c4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a80","mniswId":"5596","title":"eLife","issn":"2050-084X","eissn":"2050-084X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"99150904-dcfe-4ce3-b2a2-0b7aef04496d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64b7be31409707177e32fe3c","year":"2023","volume":"12","documentHash":"ba13fba7-9914-4a8f-9f5a-e6dd398618a7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655048256"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed010","name":"Stanislav","lastName":"Savvin","documentHash":"af2e3e1c-e8a6-4c92-9078-2b43dbf286d7"},{"objectId":"67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00f","name":"Valery I.","lastName":"Kulakov","documentHash":"59e4abd2-1054-4243-9a1c-8551d17d7b38"},{"objectId":"67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00e","name":"Alexander I.","lastName":"Kolesnikov","documentHash":"63e85b32-be50-4a3a-9f0d-ec270bda4211"},{"objectId":"67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00d","name":"Alexandre S.","lastName":"Ivanov","documentHash":"700ba9ed-f6ff-42db-a8fb-4752c3f3b97c"},{"objectId":"67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00c","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Hansen","documentHash":"a74ab6d4-37dd-40bf-bfaf-2f8c310bd289"},{"objectId":"67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00b","name":"Mikhail A.","lastName":"Kuzovnikov","documentHash":"dd37f285-1efe-4c4b-b94b-8b8ceded4a4f"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900de","name":"Marek","lastName":"Tkacz","uuid":"8B70F4141E0385F6F13B5919BEC00024E494D0625AD8AA2A3E966F7088F2D35E44E033B1909D3397A00C865227FEB19AACA655CD14AC27B01BA3C5807FA8E907","orcidId":"0000-0002-7253-7005","documentHash":"5f7aec6d-d5d0-4116-aed7-d415144a9473"}],"objectId":"67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00a","doi":"10.1103/physrevb.110.184113","publicUri":"https://link.aps.org/article/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.184113","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"High-pressure synthesis and neutron scattering study of tantalum hydride \n<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>TaH</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1.23</mml:mn><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>\n and a tantalum polymorph with A15-type structure","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A unique type of tantalum hydride was synthesized by exposing tantalum dihydride to the high hydrogen pressure of 9 GPa and a temperature of 580 degrees C using toroid-type high-pressure chambers. The samples of this hydride were cooled down to 100 K, recovered to ambient pressure, and studied in a metastable state by hot extraction, powder x-ray and neutron diffraction, and inelastic neutron scattering. X-ray diffraction demonstrated that this hydride had an A15-type crystal structure of metal lattice (space group Pm-3n, Ta atoms at the 2a and 6c Wyckoff positions) and a lattice parameter of a = 5.510(5) & Aring; at T = 85 K. The hydrogen content determined by hot extraction was H/Ta = 1.23(5). Hydrogen desorption during heating the sample in vacuum proceeded in two steps-first, AH/Ta = 0.2 was desorbed at around -70 degrees C, and then the rest of the hydrogen was desorbed between 100 degrees C and 390 degrees C. The A15-type metal lattice was preserved upon hydrogen removal, leaving a unique polymorph of tantalum. Neutron diffraction of A15-TaH1.23(5) demonstrated that hydrogen atoms occupy the 24k and 16i Wyckoff sites in the crystal structure, and annealing at 250 K resulted in a decrease of the 24k and an increase of the 16i site occupancies. Inelastic neutron scattering revealed four vibrational modes in the fundamental band of A15-TaH1.23(5) at 72, 135, 145, and 166 meV, the first three and the last one of which were tentatively assigned to the vibrations of H atoms at the 24k and 16i sites, respectively. No superconductivity was found in A15-TaH1.1 and hydrogen-free A15-Ta at temperatures down to 1.5 K."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921c878c28a0473900de"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"110","issue":"18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00b","67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00c","67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00d","67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00e","67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed00f","67c99ef8fdbe834e2a5ed010","5e70921c878c28a0473900de"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479265","mniswId":"16088","title":"Physical Review B","issn":"2469-9950","documentHash":"4f3c70f9-6d98-4157-9484-705c9f5fa489"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674878d3fdbe8326827bd769","year":"2024","volume":"110","number":"18","documentHash":"cf9aa6af-e7f3-4f81-a213-9a3311ecc18c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747655066987"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67f77455fdbe83209ce26250","name":"Renata","lastName":"Solarska","documentHash":"a5d646f0-46bb-4c6b-8143-cfe3a89953c0"},{"objectId":"67f77455fdbe83209ce2624f","name":"Sudhagar","lastName":"Pitchaimuthu","documentHash":"8cc8101a-db7a-4249-88aa-90c86f1e93be"},{"objectId":"67f77455fdbe83209ce2624e","name":"Shankar","lastName":"Prabhakaran","documentHash":"60892577-a7cd-4e65-a54c-5d2922169040"},{"objectId":"67f77455fdbe83209ce2624c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bieńkowski","documentHash":"667dca01-7dbf-46b9-8b15-e9350fe0b1d3"},{"objectId":"67f77455fdbe83209ce2624b","name":"Karthick","lastName":"Ramalingam","documentHash":"f6304c7f-682e-4ad9-943b-29d1a7a2b633"},{"objectId":"67f77455fdbe83209ce2624a","name":"Saira","lastName":"Perveen","documentHash":"eac39919-1968-4994-9609-38023c1d09c1"},{"objectId":"67f77455fdbe83209ce26249","name":"Nabila","lastName":"Nawaz","documentHash":"ce86dc69-099c-4c61-a3fc-08080c49328f"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pisarek","uuid":"394C70A4B68190862754D0C9C71B0CB236E956007955224514CD5CC84EABBD07900FBD9AC8AACDBDD5E542D5CC809EC02A9E49AFFB1DCA527F248F357949EFB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7424-5954","documentHash":"f7a53170-9e7f-4afd-bea7-cb1ef6322bc6"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aeccc","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"4C5357AD84D0C166355C58D5DB7F65858C60A5B81895FDB3FFC96B71BD494D185EFD9DCC6D46B50D7CE0E6F04F91EABA3D668E46821EED10DC2AE408E6D2B044","orcidId":"0000-0003-1975-2117","documentHash":"e7423a6c-5003-4ccf-beb9-75c8598a2f57"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7b96","name":"Nevill","lastName":"Gonzalez Szwacki","uuid":"4ED2A1C4D8FAEF523F36EB7B3178DEF1B14130617D90CC2C899274C3ABFBD138490EBB3BFC72D3422FBF99DB2EC35CE57444CD03132443070876EDA01E86B257","orcidId":"0000-0002-0518-844X","documentHash":"7bfbd6e7-86a8-477d-bd2e-5f1ce91f9cb4"}],"objectId":"67f77455fdbe83209ce26248","doi":"10.1016/j.cej.2025.162272","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1385894725030980?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Insights of Cu2O/Zn5(OH)8Cl2 photocathode architecture for an efficient photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction to multi-carbon products","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction is a critical and sustainable method for significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions while producing renewable fuels and chemicals. Copper(I) oxide (Cu2O) is a significant photocathode material for CO2 reduction; however, poor stability and low catalytic efficiency hinder its practical implementation. In this groundbreaking study, we introduce and rigorously investigate a novel photocathode architecture comprising Cu2O and Zn5(OH)8Cl2 (ZHC) that enhances the efficiency of PEC CO2 reduction. The integration of ZHC effectively functions as a selectivity layer for CO* adsorption, driving the transformation into multi-carbon products, including methanol, ethanol, propylene, and butadiene. This transformation occurs at a compelling potential of 0.78 V vs. RHE, achieving a current density of approximately −1.2 mA/cm2. Furthermore, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to investigate CO2 reduction on Cu2O(100), ZHC, and the Cu2O/ZHC (CZHC) heterostructure. This heterojunction architecture demonstrates enhanced CO2 adsorption due to orbital delocalisation, which significantly improves the adsorption energy and promotes the formation of C2 products. Our research decisively contributes valuable insights into the design of highly efficient copper-based photoelectrodes, ensuring improved selectivity in photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction and ultimately producing high-value carbon products."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","name":"Wydział Fizyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7b96","5e7093ab878c28a0473aeccc","67f77455fdbe83209ce2624a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"511","pagesFromTo":"162272","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67f77455fdbe83209ce26249","67f77455fdbe83209ce2624a","67f77455fdbe83209ce2624b","67f77455fdbe83209ce2624c","5e7093ab878c28a0473aeccc","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","67f77455fdbe83209ce2624e","5e709358878c28a0473a7b96","67f77455fdbe83209ce2624f","67f77455fdbe83209ce26250"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775cb","mniswId":"3472","title":"Chemical Engineering Journal","issn":"1385-8947","eissn":"1873-3212","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/chemical-engineering-journal/","documentHash":"7d4b9146-29b5-4fe4-bcc5-50e8e8446fb8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Photoelectrochemical CO2RR","Copper(I)oxide","Multi-carbon products","Photocatalyst High-value carbon"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747695253023"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c52d","name":"Sergei G.","lastName":"Kazarian","documentHash":"803a8e49-0ac3-45ef-9a53-16fb3ffddfb6"},{"objectId":"67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c52c","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Podleśny","documentHash":"7a7a525e-f2d0-483b-b057-13806c5e5a6e"},{"objectId":"67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c52a","name":"Artur","lastName":"Zdunek","documentHash":"28bb2a69-b4e7-4f3a-adb8-2cdfc703edce"},{"objectId":"67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c529","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szymańska-Chargot","documentHash":"de70d144-9aea-4c5e-8367-9ef9fad9445f"},{"objectId":"67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c528","name":"Cai Li","lastName":"Song","documentHash":"cead2001-9669-4a2d-9bb9-2e51dd1b68a9"},{"objectId":"603621619543c7410626fc14","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Krysa","uuid":"FA6A1DF1102E063950511625EE51C3EE637DEE6E2EC93417CFF75D1499DB8B1AC44480A05006EC8CA4217DC1D71C187229EB05DA8580ADF94E1FD3C4CCAE426B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6853-5528","documentHash":"392daf51-fde1-4dd9-aa98-0c001d5d66fc"},{"objectId":"5e7094a7878c28a0473c114e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sroka-Bartnicka","uuid":"75FA152511095E49996BD4F7ACBEA2312457A004B59AE93EE310FFC79ED88AEB97E49A4E18C9C16CA09C3F1C48FE4FD9CB8D33F8162B8F4AB33D0B38EEE310D9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0739-3567","documentHash":"a536dd6b-3877-4711-af4f-d3d934f2b8f2"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b89bd","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Stefanowicz-Pięta","uuid":"6E27C46C4C91C81FF98F2FC97573CC85B8AA42A80775D3AA4947A54D4405A05BDB4AB43D74337EBD7F7DE7BABF348CD37E8E094ED52CB51DC83043F27AD76011","orcidId":"0000-0002-3394-7116","documentHash":"1e0771b4-c4b2-4e37-a4b8-eb26f9247e84"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66f4","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Suśniak","uuid":"1E6A21A4F40EE76B264329B536A64CE4158171124BDDD8CECDFD06A0E4BDFDA003473BAC3194AD92849C6710B73C15B6E6487E2D2C8088AB9401E73E783CE524","orcidId":"0000-0002-1360-5901","documentHash":"de85acb9-dc6b-4fc2-b1a7-8ec86a91b768"}],"objectId":"66211b8940970763236b95a2","doi":"10.1177/00037028241239358","publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00037028241239358","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Multimodal spectroscopic studies to evaluate the effect of nod-factor-based fertilizer on the maize (Zea mays) stem.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Maize (Zea mays) is one of the most cultivated plants in the world. Due to the large area, the scale of its production, and the demand to increase the yield, there is a need for new environmentally friendly fertilizers. One group of such candidates is bacteria-produced nodulation (or nod) factors. Limited research has explored the impact of nodulation, factors on maize within field conditions, with most studies restricted to greenhouse settings and early developmental stages. Additionally, there is a scarcity of investigations that elucidate the metabolic alterations in the maize stem due to nod-factor exposure. It was therefore the aim of this study. Maize stem's metabolites and fibers were analyzed with various imaging analytical techniques: matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), Raman spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR FT-IR), and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. Moreover, the biochemical analyses were used to evaluate the proteins and soluble carbohydrates concentration and total phenolic content. These techniques were used to evaluate the influence of nod factor-based biofertilizer on the growth of a non-symbiotic plant, maize. The biofertilizer increased the grain yield and the stem mass. Moreover, the spectroscopic and biochemical investigation proved the appreciable biochemical changes in the stems of the maize in biofertilizer-treated plants. Noticeable changes were found in the spatial distribution and the increase in the concentration of flavonoids such as maysin, quercetin, and rutin. Moreover, the concentration of cell wall components (fibers) increased. Furthermore, it was shown that the use of untargeted analyses (such as Raman and ATR FT-IR, spectroscopic imaging, and MALDI-MSI) is useful for the investigation of the biochemical changes in plants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b66f4","5e7094a7878c28a0473c114e","603621619543c7410626fc14"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943c878c28a0473b89bd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"78","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"591-604","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["603621619543c7410626fc14","5e70941c878c28a0473b66f4","67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c528","67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c529","67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c52a","67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c52c","5e7094a7878c28a0473c114e","67b5ba50fdbe8362a576c52d","5e70943c878c28a0473b89bd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477153","mniswId":"1522","title":"Applied Spectroscopy","issn":"0003-7028","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3d0cf7f7-9bd0-4fdf-9ab4-7a210fa2d810"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747865979165"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67e142bffdbe831b5981f1a4","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Hajduk","documentHash":"408f3921-3646-4e86-a15d-0ba54b8561bb"},{"objectId":"67e142bffdbe831b5981f1a3","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Moździerski","documentHash":"aa32b3f5-b5f5-438b-b174-f0c3ed8ff6d2"},{"objectId":"67e142bffdbe831b5981f1a2","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Morawska","documentHash":"6776ff97-dacb-4f4c-8b27-d5dabc16cfb3"},{"objectId":"67e142bffdbe831b5981f19f","name":"Robert","lastName":"Marczyński","documentHash":"dd594ef3-76ae-49d6-be63-dd689ffdcd69"},{"objectId":"67e142bffdbe831b5981f19e","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Bańcerowski","documentHash":"ed97a168-990d-4183-8123-d734b8a41291"},{"objectId":"637ee538752340568b020caf","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rudzińska","uuid":"029AA795163C0976FD1422A747838433C30FF0641D54DCBA9F08CF22132E0659218F7AC19C6EB3281BCF98B2412C05EAAB3AD3A637572B22B16D3986406F708C","documentHash":"9ff9b5ca-3dc4-416c-b4ec-45d3a23604bc"},{"objectId":"60c346589543c7233654434d","name":"Debjita","lastName":"Mukherjee","uuid":"6C7B4DBC35B02CED7320BEF932C1B146DEFE78AC7F37CFC621BC7A6E45CE4E5392A6A6AA9F837B48218D5D80DAC83C9DB9E220BFC6DEF4E3E262CD1BABA59FB5","documentHash":"ee504d67-d1c2-49c8-8245-0142465dd77c"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b8208","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sikora","uuid":"D3ADFB2CC1BB90600468D4C99A77F5F2B37A31DA9A7BD7D3677469322F0B968582CBA36DC6F1160CF3353D4D65D284861F36613544272AEC57767EDBFF0B8186","orcidId":"0000-0003-0770-1267","documentHash":"e3607791-89c4-40ae-be9a-cded30f2d7ca"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b454a","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kotowicz","uuid":"7507C69890EADB741613ED8D5FA45446A033DF4E6B10C3158416ADEB4690671CD07913E936CB6D06FC87D0699B8E2AA0185BEA00CE63DB29AE55D7C84A539416","orcidId":"0000-0001-6790-3413","documentHash":"2d005b50-a098-4936-960b-022ab50f4af1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d4af","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Mielczarek","uuid":"AD742F124AFED7BFD8303785BF9F77202EB042BBED39BC691B34E5A416FAA5216875F9E82E286849AA9EE59AACC457F8BD2B17E152B40B462AE13716965A6C37","documentHash":"166429ce-5ed9-4afa-ba62-2561d3163c04"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66dae9e0fdbe832cfa8ee455","doi":"10.3390/biomedicines12061206","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/12/6/1206/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Evaluation of Salivary Biomarkers and Spirometry for Diagnosing COPD in Non-Smokers and Smokers of Polish Origin","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a prevalent respiratory condition with global implications. Accurate and timely diagnosis is critical; however, traditional diagnostic methods (based on spirometry) show limitations, prompting the search for predictive biomarkers and modern diagnostic techniques. This study explored the validation of COPD-related biomarkers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, neutrophil elastase, and alpha-1 antitrypsin) in saliva. A diverse cohort, including healthy non-smokers, healthy smokers, and COPD patients of Polish origin, underwent spirometry and marker analysis. The data correlated with clinical factors, revealing noteworthy relations. Firstly, salivary biomarker levels were compared with serum concentrations, demonstrating notable positive or negative correlations, depending on the factor. Further analysis within healthy individuals revealed associations between biomarker levels, spirometry, and clinical characteristics such as age, sex, and BMI. Next, COPD patients exhibited an enhanced concentration of biomarkers compared to healthy groups. Finally, the study introduced a breathing assessment survey, unveiling significant associations between self-perceived breathing and spirometric and tested parameters.

The Metopimazine sulfoxide derivative (MPZO) is formed quickly and quantitatively at room temperature by adding potassium caroate solution. Well-defined cathodic waves were obtained for MPZO in 0.02 mol/L HCl using the differential-pulse mode at the hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE). It is shown that the limiting stage of the MPZO reduction process is the adsorption of MPZO on the electrode surface. Factors affecting the peak current were studied and optimised. The current-concentration relationship was linear over the 0.4-2.7 mu g/mL ranges for MPZ, respectively. The technique has been developed and the possibility of quantitative determination of Metopimazine in Vogalene Lyoc 7.5 mg tablets by an indirect voltammetric method using potassium caroate (Oxone) as an oxidising agent has been shown. RSD was <= 1.63% (delta = - 0.40 -1.07%), where delta = (x-mu)100%/mu, and mu is the average value of the quantitative determination by reference spectrophotometric method. According to the data of the linear part of the calibration graph, the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were calculated, which are 0.1 mu g/mL and 0.4 mu g/mL, respectively.

While plasmonic waveguides can be used as building blocks in novel nanodevices, for efficient energy transmission, the distance between the plasmonic nanostructures must not exceed a few nanometers due to the rapidly decreasing coupling. Here, we study a system of two silver nanowires positioned precisely in order to control the separation between their ends. In such a structure, any measurable energy propagation between the nanowires is possible upon direct contact, as when the ends of the nanowires are away, they are also isolated optically from each other. We show that by combining precise positioning of the nanowires with the deposition of aqueous microdroplets, the coupling between two silver nanowires can be restored using colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as an interfacing medium. This effect is observed even if the QD-interfaced nanowires are separated by over a micrometer. The energy transfer between QDs in the microdroplet, as evidenced by shortening of the decay time of the QD fluorescence, is efficient enough to consider extending this method to facilitate and control the coupling between any type of nanostructure in nanophotonic devices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c3504a9543c723365444c5","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","5e70941f878c28a0473b6924","5e709349878c28a0473a66f9","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"129","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1260-1269","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c3504a9543c723365444c5","67dc0038fdbe831d89b1f7d3","67dc0038fdbe831d89b1f7d4","5e70941f878c28a0473b6924","5e709349878c28a0473a66f9","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","67dc0038fdbe831d89b1f7d8","67dc0038fdbe831d89b1f7d9","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a2","mniswId":"12286","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry C","issn":"1932-7447","eissn":"1932-7455","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c69a966f-fba3-41b9-8902-e029fec3f1ca"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748039398776"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c346589543c7233654434d","name":"Debjita","lastName":"Mukherjee","uuid":"6C7B4DBC35B02CED7320BEF932C1B146DEFE78AC7F37CFC621BC7A6E45CE4E5392A6A6AA9F837B48218D5D80DAC83C9DB9E220BFC6DEF4E3E262CD1BABA59FB5","documentHash":"ee504d67-d1c2-49c8-8245-0142465dd77c"},{"objectId":"5e709426878c28a0473b7396","name":"Laura","lastName":"Turos-Korgul","uuid":"0ECEBBE6CF2BC378F23422405160E5D1CDFBAAC51FB1315B9591F5ED0B992355F5231A5FE17C4FE5B52FC69BE97D77E6B628C388007A1D894EC8FF2D3E20DA55","orcidId":"0000-0002-1732-3397","documentHash":"cb7cf9eb-e43d-403f-ad27-fbbfb761238c"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a51","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Radecka","uuid":"56D2B30A2881E7CCA06DD1716969CA273A700024A53CF6938E93BDFA9DFEC2342337A4A16201FA797C4C1B385C54B565BC195350315E78F8B9E1626A93E67563","orcidId":"0000-0001-9912-2128","documentHash":"e429e0ae-db65-4cb8-8364-1b35837f11f1"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5a","name":"Jan","lastName":"Guzowski","uuid":"A8B48F7F745AC2DFDED086903CA20E4647AA2D07E044454CCFF949079D1455DCCD7E7BE0AE516AAB19C1A06B1B84EFEE24846B3ABD004DE97B9592C2E299FDDC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8070-3747","documentHash":"ce9af7d5-565c-439c-8f22-2a02a87f3ca4"},{"objectId":"5e70930b878c28a0473a1c2c","name":"PAULINA","lastName":"PODSZYWAŁOW - BARTNICKA","uuid":"806B7A755D411AF484AB21F3EA1DA3555F13147D7581270F68AFBEA82E45BDF84BDA12E9D93C936162BF43B5DE922702D026A77E41C04E3D4E1F38C6766C08EB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4965-828X","documentHash":"122e4cbd-9ae2-447b-9cde-2b61181cf23c"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1b2f","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"PIWOCKA","uuid":"F59433CC3F306A70E17351103C7E891002FBD14D7C99C9A6DA3BCB7C5EF697FAFCC7CCC9FBB1FEB8529D75F61B9B2CF0B3B4C587007B3997D8076CF2B25C7649","orcidId":"0000-0001-6676-5282","documentHash":"9b8094a1-da8a-49af-ac81-6d2315dc1ac9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67a5cf99fdbe834dc96e265e","doi":"10.1088/1758-5090/ad998d","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1758-5090/ad998d","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"High-throughput formulation of reproducible 3D cancer microenvironments for drug testing in myeloid leukemia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

However, it is known that fast generation of Ni3+OOH-type catalytic centers that are sustained and resilient during the overall catalytic process is crucial. Towards this, we report how we optimized and compared operating conditions and structural tuning of poly[NP-Ni(OH)2SaltMe] and poly[meso-NP-Ni(OH)2SaldMe] electrocatalysts active in alkaline media towards UOR. We started with studies of morphological differences evoked by the use of different NaOHaq concentrations for catalyst fabrication by SEM and TEM. Then, we distinguished the most promising molecular structures of fabricated catalysts featuring the highest poisoning resistance and in situ generation of poly(NP-Ni3+OOHsalen) electrocatalytic centers for UOR. Furthermore, we found the best conditions for operation of both structured UOR catalysts using a comprehensive electrochemical approach. This approach involved multiple scan rate, Tafel slope, and activation energy (Eac) analysis to finally compare which structured poly[NP-Ni(OH)2salen] catalyst produces catalytic current more efficiently in response to a change in applied potential. Ultimately, we performed a longevity/durability test under real-system mimicking conditions. The fabricated catalysts constituted good platforms for studying the surface-remaining and bulk-remaining types of catalytically active sites of poly[NP-Ni(OH)2salen]s for UOR activity. Our findings point to the bulk-structure-reactivity requirements of poly[NP-Ni(OH)2salen]s, emphasizing their catalytic durability and effectiveness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","60c31d079543c72336543d93","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad","5e709409878c28a0473b5395"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"794-807","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709409878c28a0473b5395","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","60c31d079543c72336543d93","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477565","mniswId":"3329","title":"Catalysis Science and Technology","issn":"2044-4753","eissn":"2044-4761","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"cabc062a-8772-49a6-a0c9-9904a2a851a0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68306350fdbe8312e61d6a0f","year":"2025","volume":"15","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"187f54ca-0389-4af8-8dc5-ff8ea69e55e7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748039404857"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb067","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Żuk","uuid":"A2CF96DA8DBC0F0EC756C6ABC4425D960DE3CE0ABBAA543C816DF4A24FDC838930FFB8FDCE1B3C5232CB0C3FD9D93CDDF5F6336061F13F18AC43F6C77E9DD4F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0555-5913","documentHash":"323764fb-47c8-4632-b36c-1a2615cfd8d2"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Giżyński","uuid":"7AEDD73DD5B1257841075AC646D7AF5FC2472AC6E46D6B167FA3D962FDEFA3E257CD7B398C64DC6A04810369674D2DCA9ABA0C97270D398AA0B697F0E2F788ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-3547-1174","documentHash":"1424e1a0-06b3-460a-9b83-8855874b6421"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maciołek","uuid":"E3E9BCC7397B929B2C469D73E68AE44FB2E6F4892A7DC44C238F904FE76F9D470FD528254865B02108CA8B9311A7A421914ADC30598B3516CDD6CB7BF0F07C81","orcidId":"0000-0002-2371-4183","documentHash":"d2f0a437-c8a3-4dc0-9358-3f2e9c4648e4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","name":"Karol","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"30216860D4FCF71F80CCF2F14F9FA6358B5A0632271ACE53CD62EC8265F97928E335571E5A301CC0BA9C252A21169DB64AF4E27EC652B74805AD01BFF7BDF4DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9769-7646","documentHash":"3ea17df7-ffc6-4937-bb72-a24f676f97e3"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bafc","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"1395184D69CCCC696555BA9258DB8C71C4BCB4AD9AC9EF749DA29945881BBCBBB439A1227FD44F6D4A86CB72EDEF242A8FEE5AEDC024BACF4495BD0A4870F4B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1762-9131","documentHash":"35a8ef1f-36a0-4082-bbf5-6e22763bd1b6"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hołyst","uuid":"E92F295C3CC2CB6B18C450B2AB735CDA75E1B176DB096D3C43CB9E6E23F05E2B3448297032B471C71265740E595D30DAA6BA0B89CC0DB4589E73DB45075B7008","orcidId":"0000-0002-3211-4286","documentHash":"cbe7625d-9b95-4888-b28d-a8e3f921d07f"}],"objectId":"68306e3bfdbe8312e61de457","doi":"10.1209/0295-5075/ada182","publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/ada182","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Global non-equilibrium thermodynamics for steady states like never before","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this Perspective article, we introduce a new framework for the global non- equilibrium thermodynamics of stationary states. This theory uses the spatial distributions of temperature, density, velocity, and other variables in stationary states as its input. It outputs the global state parameters to describe the system's energy exchange with the environment. The number of state parameters is determined solely by the type of substance in the system and external potentials, regardless of the number of boundary conditions, fluxes within the system, or its specific geometry. The theory offers a second law of non-equilibrium thermodynamics for stationary states, predicting the direction of spontaneous processes between them. When all macroscopic fluxes reach zero, the theory reduces to equilibrium thermodynamics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","5e709459878c28a0473bb067","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"149","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"30001","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942a878c28a0473b7770","5e7093bd878c28a0473b00b4","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa36","5e7092bc878c28a04739bafc","5e709459878c28a0473bb067","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b35","mniswId":"5896","title":"Europhysics Letters","issn":"0295-5075","eissn":"1286-4854","documentHash":"6f3f413d-8e6e-4fa8-98a8-cb4710ebb0d1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68306e3bfdbe8312e61de458","year":"2025","volume":"149","number":"3","documentHash":"c6d3b0fe-2e7b-4a1f-82eb-48c7ba9ef2ad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748039404899"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"683043a1fdbe836a4614f9d2","name":"Marta","lastName":"Zych","documentHash":"c681b5f4-00a9-42bd-ad0d-58588070a08e"},{"objectId":"683043a1fdbe836a4614f9d0","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Gondek","documentHash":"e59491fb-909c-4786-8ade-fce6db2fc2ce"},{"objectId":"683043a1fdbe836a4614f9cf","name":"Lifeng","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"01308e34-88a0-46ed-a1ab-539456ffef05"},{"objectId":"60409cca9543c711bc6ea704","name":"Renata","lastName":"Palowska","uuid":"DA3C69B90D210C99192F6A1EC2F8C2CB003059A175EBDE142CA8A445263A1995820A4A4351F061517E524E6EE591E470591D862E192094C83057DCBEB02872DB","documentHash":"e6515f13-60f5-4aaf-bdec-359fcde765b5"},{"objectId":"602e326c9543c7410626ee4e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gurgul","uuid":"7E4181ADA4B04C2228F357DA46F7466EA1ACA51683982F36F6E489C4DEC17BD1B07959525DEEDA3ABDDB81146461B7E2E2F72D41EB9DCD22CFC287AEE7CCF517","documentHash":"7e666d35-7828-4257-890b-7a3319302f56"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff45","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pisarek","uuid":"394C70A4B68190862754D0C9C71B0CB236E956007955224514CD5CC84EABBD07900FBD9AC8AACDBDD5E542D5CC809EC02A9E49AFFB1DCA527F248F357949EFB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7424-5954","documentHash":"f7a53170-9e7f-4afd-bea7-cb1ef6322bc6"},{"objectId":"5e709315878c28a0473a28d7","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Sulka","uuid":"48380297D9C92854575FBD8967D81043979AF54D54B8387A7B0BCCE23208AC6BF6D585247A85B72B6FE8629C8BDC658A8BCFFFC4FC587D78C619FB7AD0F60644","orcidId":"0000-0001-7431-617X","documentHash":"41a3ce1d-de43-46d1-9d37-32efeb8fd63e"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d0fa","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Syrek","uuid":"EFC7223B86529657D1295505AD6804A70CF48C10DF323BEAD99D021E4EE3EB12AE3FA5704F42E409CD161EFFDEA87F6D2843287C256B32518B39615D420C8FF1","documentHash":"0e0136f0-2868-43c5-870a-7d0dbc9b8748"}],"objectId":"683043a1fdbe836a4614f9ce","doi":"10.1016/j.jpowsour.2025.236656","publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/handle/item/551212","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Novel anodic $WO_3-SeO_2-CuO$ photoelectrode operating under solar illumination for water-splitting applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Anodic tungsten oxide-based materials were tested as photoanodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting experiments.

For this purpose, monolayers of these dimers were deposited on an HOPG substrate from their solutions in hexane by drop-casting and imaged at nanometer resolution after drying. A detailed discussion of two possible different supramolecular organizations is presented. In the case of the first one, termed the \"lamellar structure\", the molecules in each layer are arranged in parallel molecular rows. Comparative analysis of the monolayer structure with already reported XRD data on 3D organization of the same molecules in a single crystal revealed significant differences resulting from (i) different ordering preferences in 2D and 3D systems and (ii) effects of the interactions of the deposited molecules with the graphite substrate. A small extension of the linker by two methylene groups does not change the type of ordering in the monolayer but causes an extension of the unit cell in one direction, indicating that the lamellar structure is stabilized by rows of densely packed large aromatic pyrene units. Studies of the derivative with a longer linker (containing eight -CH2- units) also showed the possibility of the occurrence of an alternative type of its monolayer organization, termed here \"aggregate structure\". In this case, the monolayer consists of ordered aggregates of two molecules. According to the authors' knowledge, this type of structural organization has not yet been reported for this family of compounds. It is, however, qualitatively consistent with the already described supramolecular ordering in CBO5O.Py (CCDC 2019485), a compound closely resembling the dimers studied in this research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff48","5e709491878c28a0473bfac8","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb5d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"41","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"9508-9519","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709491878c28a0473bfac8","68342e58fdbe8360ebc23cb4","68342e58fdbe8360ebc23cb5","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff48","68342e58fdbe8360ebc23cb6","68342e58fdbe8360ebc23cb7","68342e58fdbe8360ebc23cb8","68342e58fdbe8360ebc23cb9","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb5d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c83","mniswId":"13449","title":"Langmuir","doi":"","issn":"0743-7463","eissn":"1520-5827","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/langd5","documentHash":"938b0bae-be9b-4804-98af-56db6cab0931"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68342e58fdbe8360ebc23cb3","year":"2025","volume":"41","number":"14","documentHash":"34d5e4f6-e149-442f-861e-eb4cce96033e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748297900917"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"683433d9fdbe8360ebc285eb","name":"Egidijus","lastName":"Auksorius","documentHash":"4ce0e8ab-28e4-4e4c-9639-d27f1a4f4811"},{"objectId":"683433d9fdbe8360ebc285ea","name":"Karolis","lastName":"Adomavičius","documentHash":"e73bf978-0657-4850-bc1e-d12015de5996"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be087","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Węgrzyn","uuid":"5BAE6FD3E0A6779218C7D02AD9D0D4159AEED56C46C1CB4DA823F9F58F41A44F78A5C4DD054A302222B60589D66857BA128D977BFC39BC4E4B5EF1560174AC96","orcidId":"0000-0002-3269-6722","documentHash":"b89df386-b698-4a14-9f8d-1781dda6169c"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9a1e","name":"Marta","lastName":"Mikuła-Zdańkowska","uuid":"9F93111FEBE3CD7265472BD399D4104302597D369DBC2259D4992A47CF33A7804477FFC9F53DD2F44F9094A51DF3301008408707B1D33A696156BA88C6D93842","orcidId":"0000-0002-4451-2492","documentHash":"320d0189-e389-40ba-a241-492583194d66"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c372","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Borycki","uuid":"8FFFCAE436E598237AF17388C1DC0BEE0B7EBBEFE8098349D95C1CA962C751C11B87DB46A4DFFEBA4F8D9C404FC7EC7EB98000D6EFED8DE01F21FEA352394D85","orcidId":"0000-0002-1235-889X","documentHash":"8c9b1d19-6c92-441e-8e4e-379e92d77c25"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bf74","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Wojtkowski","uuid":"72C7EFD6AE3C0FF6AB46F559605ACE983360A4E4C03769BB1C4D0D72A5671C8A9CF4B7F1DF377F7E2D985ACB38C7A2EE1DA60B3BE1A843F188600A590E526E53","orcidId":"0000-0003-0599-0878","documentHash":"380243f1-4e56-4426-bead-5a7a8a484819"}],"objectId":"683433d9fdbe8360ebc285e8","doi":"10.1016/j.bbe.2025.01.001","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0208521625000014?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Imaging of retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors using Spatio-Temporal Optical Coherence Tomography (STOC-T) without hardware-based adaptive optics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We demonstrate an experimental Spatio-Temporal Optical Coherence Tomography (STOC-T) system featuring optimized illumination and an increased lateral resolution of approximately 3 mu m.

nanocrystal (NC) growth is essential for uncovering and understanding nanomaterial formation, which typically involves a complex sequence of precursor reactions, nucleation, and growth processes. Herein, as part of the continuous development of the self-supporting organometallic approach for the preparation of quantum-sized colloidal zinc oxide (ZnO) NCs, we selected a series of [EtZn(X)]-type carboxylate precursors, where X = methoxyacetate, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetate, or 2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]acetate, as model self-supporting systems with varying carboxylate tail lengths. The controlled exposure of a [EtZn(X)]-type precursor solution to air afforded colloidal ZnO NCs with a narrow unimodal size distribution and coated with strongly anchored X-type ligands. Employing optical spectroscopy techniques, we investigate how the growth dynamics of NCs depend on the length of the carboxylate tail. Moreover, leveraging analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), we meticulously examined the behavior of NCs in solution under centrifugal forces to gain valuable insights into their stability and aggregation tendencies. This study not only enhances understanding of the underlying 'living growth' of organometallic-derived nanostructures that leads to the formation of thermodynamically stable and monodispersed ZnO NCs but also significantly contributes to the ongoing development of more effective methods for synthesizing colloidal ZnO NCs, thereby advancing the field of materials science."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","5e7093ea878c28a0473b3267"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"2677-2685","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68343316fdbe8360ebc27fea","68343316fdbe8360ebc27feb","68343316fdbe8360ebc27fec","5e7093ea878c28a0473b3267","68343316fdbe8360ebc27fed","5e709328878c28a0473a3f18"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f137","mniswId":"27874","title":"Nanoscale Advances","issn":"2516-0230","eissn":"2516-0230","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"570db27f-5279-4051-a072-5b0db028519c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68343316fdbe8360ebc27fe9","year":"2025","volume":"7","number":"9","documentHash":"6a10dfc9-0055-428a-b922-c879eb8099fa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748297900943"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68343d9cfdbe8360ebc3752f","name":"N.","lastName":"Baran","documentHash":"d979567b-1a86-48c3-9da1-628b5de3919a"},{"objectId":"5f7fe1bf085dcb410a25ec01","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Piekarski","uuid":"F5E5FF3A1CB51FD4777481F2CA371F5634ADD22BE871796D8307482FB0308E27466B3E2B140F852481D5E1CE107FCDA3D209FE62D7107653F16582C8944B0EFF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1220-1902","documentHash":"c3744f05-548e-438a-9713-94d5cf27c6e4"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kubas","uuid":"5502D7BBD854811ACE4A362AACF7E8E88D472EBF744D8A7CA3375962360A19B8C994FD5882E9191B79B6745D5F7A3AB2529D5A4D64C8AFBB3B7204C8694C6382","orcidId":"0000-0002-5508-0533","documentHash":"9f31decc-1aaa-47ff-8296-c27349c11c1e"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","name":"Anders","lastName":"Jönsson-Niedziółka","uuid":"3394A368CB0E6B611D461246FA8924DA0550D7AF68CD7EBB72456860833F46CDC79A875204939C5A2F631BE36B09951DDC56FAB1B1015A54CDFB0E1A1E128C0B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5642-5946","documentHash":"f675ee5a-f8e9-4d1f-bdd0-4e009824f6ef"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6fb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wiloch","uuid":"80493E92B20FDF4BB85E08FD70302E0545F70959E6FBB9CC01FF8576C1A08C8CC864AF5E8D8F2A2B74CDE695CD710143C649FCF56AFE8A60087F46FFD7C71CB2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8331-8572","documentHash":"35deba9a-f120-4bca-b1e1-d0f72f31177a"}],"objectId":"68343d9cfdbe8360ebc3752d","doi":"10.1007/s10008-025-06267-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10008-025-06267-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Spectroelectrochemical properties of 8-aminoquinoline: voltammetric and computational studies","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"8-Aminoquinoline (8AQ) is the building block for many medicinal molecules.

Thus, mapping the spatial distribution of activity towards hydrogen peroxide decomposition is essential for validating immobilization procedures and analyzing heterogeneous activity. For imaging the activity of immobilized catalase, we propose the use of mercury deposited on platinum (Hg@Pt) and mercury-gold amalgam microelectrodes as tips for scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Hg@Pt or Hg-Au amalgam microelectrodes allow for the selective determination of local concentrations of dissolved oxygen in solutions containing hydrogen peroxide. These SECM tips can also locally deliver H2O2 via a 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Asymmetric loop feedback mode (FB) and substrate generation/tip collection mode (SG/TC) were applied to image samples of catalase immobilized on glutaraldehyde-modified glass slides and spots of adsorbed enzyme on polystyrene Petri dishes delivered by means of a micropipette.

DCR provides information on corneal biomechanics, thus allowing for more precise intraocular pressure measurement, which is important in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Moreover, DCR helps identify the eyes at risk of ectatic diseases such as keratoconus.Abstract This study demonstrates the use of a dual-sample arm swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) instrument coupled with air-puff stimulation to assess corneal displacement in an ex vivo porcine eye model. The air-puff SS-OCT system enables correction of corneal deformation for eye globe retraction, providing a comprehensive quantitative analysis of corneal apex deformation dynamics under varying intraocular pressure (IOP) levels and air-puff stimulus strengths. Spatio-temporal characterization of those stimuli was performed. The results showed that the cornea stiffened with increased IOP, and reducing the stimulus amplitude decreased the correlation between parameters describing corneal dynamics and IOP. However, maximum displacement and corneal response time exhibited very strong correlations regardless of the strength of the applied air-puff. These findings suggest that softening air-puff stimulation may impact the accuracy of non-contact tonometers in measuring IOP and corneal biomechanical properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b5291"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"3291","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["683430fdfdbe8360ebc26675","683430fdfdbe8360ebc26676","683430fdfdbe8360ebc26677","683430fdfdbe8360ebc26678","5e709408878c28a0473b5291","683430fdfdbe8360ebc26679"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8a20a31f-8131-4357-899d-7b8f694df717"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67d02ec4fdbe83617c62ae99","year":"2025","publishedYear":2025,"volume":"15","number":"6","documentHash":"2d8ba5c7-4923-43f9-a74f-0f0096d2c5d1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748297901506"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68343e7cfdbe8360ebc37d4e","name":"François","lastName":"Jérôme","documentHash":"9bb86771-c341-4c73-a0b7-09f035186721"},{"objectId":"68343e7cfdbe8360ebc37d4d","name":"Hsien‐Yi","lastName":"Hsu","documentHash":"f102d947-b718-4cbe-b960-3948ca877279"},{"objectId":"68343e7cfdbe8360ebc37d4c","name":"Hanggara","lastName":"Sudrajat","documentHash":"1add03f4-aa8b-490b-bb4f-7474541d0b80"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"objectId":"68343e7cfdbe8360ebc37d4a","doi":"10.1002/cctc.202401814","publicUri":"https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/cctc.202401814","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Mechanoredox‐Catalyzed Organic Synthesis with Piezoelectric Materials: <i>Quo Vadis</i>?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Piezoelectric materials offer great promise due to their ability to generate electric fields under mechanical stress, producing surface charges that drive otherwise kinetically sluggish redox reactions. The strained surfaces of these materials provide a unique advantage in controlling product selectivity and enabling reaction pathways that are unattainable with conventional methods. This perspective highlights advancements, challenges, and the future potential of piezoelectric materials in synthetic organic chemistry, with a focus on designing materials optimized for piezocatalyzed organic synthesis. Piezocatalysis is industrially relevant because of its operational simplicity, enabling mild, gram scale synthesis with reusable catalysts, minimal solvent use, and air tolerant conditions. It involves redox cycles that facilitate one electron redox events without requiring light exposure or electrical bias. Despite significant progress, many fundamental aspects are yet to be fully understood. One example is the correlation between piezoelectricity and catalytic activity, which is not always linear, as demonstrated by the comparison between tetragonal and cubic BaTiO3. While cubic BaTiO3 is not piezoelectric, it shows excellent catalytic activity in certain redox reactions such as arylation, dicarbonylation, and cyclization under mechanochemical conditions comparable to that of piezoelectric tetragonal BaTiO3. Considering all these aspects, this perspective aims to stimulate discussion to advance this promising field in the right direction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"6","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68343e7cfdbe8360ebc37d4c","68343e7cfdbe8360ebc37d4d","68343e7cfdbe8360ebc37d4e","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775bf","mniswId":"3459","title":"ChemCatChem","issn":"1867-3880","eissn":"1867-3899","documentHash":"d492892e-cede-4274-bf05-d6591746816c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68343e7cfdbe8360ebc37d4b","year":"2025","volume":"17","number":"6","documentHash":"77cf13cb-39b4-452a-9e77-bc1a1177eb60"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748297901508"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"683443d5fdbe8360ebc3df5e","name":"Rima","lastName":"Budvytyte","documentHash":"e45a9063-ee95-4dba-9c88-02775b2b716b"},{"objectId":"683443d5fdbe8360ebc3df5d","name":"Milda","lastName":"Pleckaityte","documentHash":"bd0b93b2-a707-4725-bfe9-c3778adadb3b"},{"objectId":"683443d5fdbe8360ebc3df5c","name":"Tomas","lastName":"Sabirovas","documentHash":"1e8b7333-bdd1-46a0-98cb-2a020f12cc8e"},{"objectId":"659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","name":"Vaishali","lastName":"Shrivastav","uuid":"72EF0A9A2F1F1D0FDA23FA779E2BAEC74C87EFB7A5BB4FA60CF45CFB2429D9644EC13498E252AAA787939A6FFB04B078F1763848379CAFBE5614F2C602DDB02F","documentHash":"923bb0db-1204-40b7-9692-95d01a661e5c"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"}],"objectId":"683443d5fdbe8360ebc3df5a","doi":"10.1016/j.bioelechem.2025.108953","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1567539425000568?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Imaging functional bacterial pore-forming toxins in tethered bilayer lipid membranes using scanning electrochemical microscopy","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study demonstrates the straightforward application of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for characterizing pneumolysin-induced pores in tethered bilayer lipid membranes (tBLMs). Carbon-based nanoelectrodes with a tip radius of approximately 20 nm produced distinct feedback responses during approach curves to the sample. A positive feedback response was observed when approaching the self-assembled monolayer, while the few nanometers thick tBLMs exhibited characteristics of insulating layers, yielding a negative feedback response. Based on the computational calculations, the reconstitution of functional pneumolysin was further confirmed through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, with a concentration of 5 nM pneumolysin resulting in an average pore density of 0.64 mu m-2. Finally, we demonstrated the practical utility of SECM for visualizing pneumolysin pores within the tBLM system. These experiments highlight the versatility and costeffectiveness of electrochemical techniques for investigating membrane integrity, toxin activity, and biomolecular interactions at the nanoscale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"165","pagesFromTo":"108953","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["683443d5fdbe8360ebc3df5c","683443d5fdbe8360ebc3df5d","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","659e0f3840e3ff6b129bb95f","683443d5fdbe8360ebc3df5e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547732a","mniswId":"2403","title":"Bioelectrochemistry","issn":"1567-5394","eissn":"1878-562X","documentHash":"d781482b-3513-4a19-85bf-213a05c8f64c"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"683443d5fdbe8360ebc3df5b","year":"2025","volume":"165","documentHash":"1cfb4f29-73a8-4f35-bddc-2d8aeec0a453"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748297901514"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68343aeefdbe8360ebc323e9","name":"Muhamed Aydin","lastName":"Abbas","documentHash":"84de56e3-73f8-4b9a-95c8-6cb962505c6c"},{"objectId":"68343aeefdbe8360ebc323e8","name":"Meysam","lastName":"Safari","documentHash":"2b75d560-15b1-4d29-af28-a0c4dc03e67b"},{"objectId":"68343aeefdbe8360ebc323e7","name":"Farhad","lastName":"Golmohammadi","documentHash":"6d8f20ac-a203-4383-8030-72144db3e7f1"},{"objectId":"68343aeefdbe8360ebc323e6","name":"Masoud","lastName":"Amiri","documentHash":"5927c6f5-dae7-439e-bf73-4861b7ad3dd1"},{"objectId":"6747e3b8ece3984d1d482e88","name":"Ali","lastName":"Ebrahimi Pure","uuid":"B1D05929DCF362442688AABB8935E7E0E43464F80D0BFE9C3004137DB57A021B669086BEC736BEE900876BD4E1E3EDA118835F1215D33B47716D0A330B69A0E7","documentHash":"bceb7590-027f-41d1-a3e2-cc50cd3f01b7"}],"objectId":"68343aeefdbe8360ebc323e4","doi":"10.1016/j.jpcs.2025.112699","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022369725001507?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Engineering iron–nickel nanostructures on the surface of functionalized nitrogen-doped graphene composite for high-performance supercapacitors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study presents the development of a novel three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene/iron-nickel (3DNG/ FeNi) composite as a high-performance electrode material for supercapacitors.

A deeper investigation into the influence of the matrix can expectedly improve the rational design of TADF emitters. Under these circumstances, we report two D–A–D regioisomers that comprise an acenaphthenequinone (ACQ) core. Although both structures differ solely in the substitution position of the carbazole (Cz), which is attached at position 9 in F1 and at position 10 in F3, this study explores the mixed emission behavior of regioisomeric TADF emitters. Electrochemical and photophysical analyses revealed distinct redox behavior, emission properties, and performance of the OLED device between the two isomers. While both emitters show promising potential for OLED applications, the differences in their structural arrangement significantly influence their charge-transfer characteristics and device efficiency, which is manifested by their distinct external quantum efficiency (EQE) performance. The highest EQE of 12.6% was denoted for F3 (3,10), while the dye with TBCz attached in position 3,9 (F1) disclosed considerably lower performance of 7.4%. These results shed light on the critical role of the position of substituents along with the matrix environment toward efficient design of TADF OLED emitters. These results will provide a better understanding of the influence of the host matrix and adopt the structure of the emitter in a way that allows the development of highly efficient OLED devices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3ee1","64c479a840e3ff494b554705","5e7094e7878c28a0473c694a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"129","pagesFromTo":"2176-2185","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64c479a840e3ff494b554705","5e7094e7878c28a0473c694a","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3ee1","6810ca33fdbe8359b3f8a9d1","6810ca33fdbe8359b3f8a9d2","6810ca33fdbe8359b3f8a9d3","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","6810ca33fdbe8359b3f8a9d5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a2","mniswId":"12286","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry C","issn":"1932-7447","eissn":"1932-7455","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"c69a966f-fba3-41b9-8902-e029fec3f1ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ea3356fdbe831b59785401","year":"2025","publishedYear":2025,"volume":"129","number":"4","documentHash":"ab4d0ee6-edf4-4f02-a38e-1c7e0dfd0f2f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748386605903"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67f384bbfdbe837d21256a54","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Koba","documentHash":"f70550c3-6421-42d1-8810-f67513439343"},{"objectId":"67f384bbfdbe837d21256a51","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bartnik","documentHash":"89026dfb-b3a7-4511-91ec-738daa3fccbd"},{"objectId":"6528abaa40e3ff51d51c49a5","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Musolf","uuid":"E702A31AC15039D7662B01046C65AFA4B7CAF967813921C0F934A2AF0BF2681C58CC3299211CAAE31582CAE8B90CAAD0D659E6248CF7F179EB007819E41C657B","documentHash":"cf7ed0b5-a6f6-40eb-a46f-55a2eb51aa0f"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b80c5","name":"Norbert","lastName":"Kwietniewski","uuid":"AE4AABF2FD4BE0178844F08138A197BD161FEAC8F359858D7F84D0E9A6CCB7A92B7C6C7F6B8456A0E291C1C0097F689B49DE7D12545B6FF7788389A1F3BE4E84","orcidId":"0000-0002-5672-9744","documentHash":"74945eb1-abb7-48ae-8514-c647e2e9386c"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6e34","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Martychowiec","uuid":"0117D87AA19F40C7DC6785D3DF5E44BB5A1DF2741D769CF15856626FA3D1BB12EEB9BF0B338A4B8E3262189BF2DE42EDB446FDCFE6A52AA2748FDE1CB39D22E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2769-2505","documentHash":"9bf82237-bd74-4836-864c-ea67a3f7d7d0"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Niedziółka-Jönsson","uuid":"87A188D17120D3F4F55C5E1B0AA008499E9DC902A95D1C123E357F1DA1F7A976DFE69FEB7E38B942004B483B0B7F470AC78009BB04046308074F5705022474FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-9508-1373","documentHash":"3f269ce4-2f3f-4dd5-8a01-0de3a5a94550"},{"objectId":"5e70930f878c28a0473a2275","name":"MATEUSZ","lastName":"ŚMIETANA","uuid":"618BEFE7510B909210E4BFBBD547FC0388673A67AD6122ED025838E8ED599DEE019B912425310A7A9F00E236C29AA86B6F8C208F4DEFBE753106DD2646303C68","orcidId":"0000-0002-6774-2426","documentHash":"099c984d-1655-49a6-85ec-a03adc651c14"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-10-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673af629fdbe8313779b1021","doi":"10.1109/tbme.2024.3479910","publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10719676","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Thin-film-based optical fiber interferometric sensor on the fiber tip for endovascular surgical procedures","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective: Endovascular surgery requires accurate measurement of parameters such as pressure, temperature, and biomarkers within vessels for real-time tissue response monitoring and ensuring targeted therapeutic interventions. However, the availability of small tip-based sensors capable of precise application, for example, navigating an aneurysm's lumen, is limited. With their capabilities for real-time analysis, flexibility, and biocompatibility, optical fiber sensors (OFS) hold promise in addressing this need. This proof-of-concept study investigates the feasibility of OFS in endovascular surgery scenarios. Methods: The sensor is based on a single-mode silica fiber with an interferometric forward-facing thin-film tip. The thin-film materials may be tailored for detecting various physical parameters and, when functionalized, also specific analytes. Materials applied in this sensor are thin metal oxides deposited using magnetron sputtering. A full-scale 3D-printed vascular model was employed to simulate endovascular setup. Results: The experiments showed the high mechanical robustness of the approach, i.e., the sensor maintained functionality while being maneuvered through the endovascular model. The forward-facing tip remained intact and worked adequately, ensuring consistent and stable readouts. Moreover, the fiber showed sufficient flexibility, with no significant bending loss observed during simulations. Finally, the performance of the OFS in bovine serum samples was assessed. The sensor performed well in serum, and the results suggest that low-concentration serum may be used to reduce nonspecific surface interactions. Conclusion: Overall, this OFS system offers a promising solution for endovascular surgery and other biomedical applications, allowing for precise and on-the-spot analysis. Significance: Our study pioneers the feasibility of thin-film interferometric label-free OFS with a forward-facing sensitive area for sensing during endovascular procedures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709422878c28a0473b6e34","5e70930f878c28a0473a2275","5e709433878c28a0473b80c5"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6528abaa40e3ff51d51c49a5","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"72","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"930 - 939","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67f384bbfdbe837d21256a51","5e709422878c28a0473b6e34","5e709433878c28a0473b80c5","6528abaa40e3ff51d51c49a5","67f384bbfdbe837d21256a54","5e70930f878c28a0473a2275","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff55"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477fe0","mniswId":"7949","title":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issn":"0018-9294","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"53554592-261f-4d01-82dc-110a2b26ae57"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748386605957"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67d9962ffdbe830c19f25f8c","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Górski","documentHash":"866ecc80-5865-44b8-bc51-a32030a5ddb7"},{"objectId":"67d9962ffdbe830c19f25f8a","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Peret","documentHash":"c9a70fe2-96a9-4767-bf56-9cc222c184d3"},{"objectId":"6250efa87523402df09eaff9","name":"Marta","lastName":"Zaleskaya-Hernik","uuid":"70F05F46D80FA57801AC961CA96BCCAB9026EB9F9631663A78CDF9DBD10E71C5A53C3CD5D2364D4BA83FC65C7BAF858262E8DC3309313AEFC7E292D2D8316B27","documentHash":"16b633eb-999b-4bc6-8723-2b4f89753299"},{"objectId":"616a392975234017e05459dc","name":"Julia","lastName":"Maciejewska-Komorowska","uuid":"C5128351F12057AA0D2517684A4BDBF05CB800441FB9E291BBB2B091CE1AC006BB8EFE933B986DEE73D3220ECA05BC76F7FD05F4B849246356FA54AEFAD6FC61","orcidId":"0000-0002-4318-380X","documentHash":"e9da4adf-a222-42dc-bf13-63a404da068a"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kubas","uuid":"5502D7BBD854811ACE4A362AACF7E8E88D472EBF744D8A7CA3375962360A19B8C994FD5882E9191B79B6745D5F7A3AB2529D5A4D64C8AFBB3B7204C8694C6382","orcidId":"0000-0002-5508-0533","documentHash":"9f31decc-1aaa-47ff-8296-c27349c11c1e"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","name":"Anders","lastName":"Jönsson-Niedziółka","uuid":"3394A368CB0E6B611D461246FA8924DA0550D7AF68CD7EBB72456860833F46CDC79A875204939C5A2F631BE36B09951DDC56FAB1B1015A54CDFB0E1A1E128C0B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5642-5946","documentHash":"f675ee5a-f8e9-4d1f-bdd0-4e009824f6ef"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7dad","name":"Jan","lastName":"Romański","uuid":"BD5B4D98E70BC685E0FDEEB41266874DBB2403EC16EFA618D3A9BF21E3F14251F209E8A8681D2C3E26A4A8F6F4D58FC015BA2B32F87D8A49D8FC4A586A55CC30","orcidId":"0000-0002-7675-885X","documentHash":"35680b06-7b78-4b5f-95da-74234db89cc1"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d7f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Karbarz","uuid":"118363E187D0019CFEBD4BEEDEEAC60BFC135D719A20DDBD9B1427FAEB8AB4FB005D09F9BD85F823EDB65EDD28CBDEF3885BD2419D9EA7F36934FEF72E0B299D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7813-0513","documentHash":"f5a2e2a3-4a45-461a-8c36-1d28aa08b09a"}],"objectId":"67d9962ffdbe830c19f25f88","doi":"10.1016/j.electacta.2025.145778","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013468625001410?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Transfer of highly hydrophilic ions between immiscible liquids at the three-phase junction using a squaramide-based ion pair receptor","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although many redox probes have been used for anion transfer studies in three-phase junction setups, no known molecule would enable the transfer of highly hydrophilic anions. In recent years, research has been emerging on ion pair receptors consisting of a crown ether cation binding site and a squaramide anion binding domain, which offer the ability to extract extremely hydrophilic sulphate salts. In this paper, we show that we can induce the transfer of sulphate and fluoride anions at a three-phase electrode setup using the oxidation of a squaramide-based compound in the organic phase. We evaluate the compound for the transfer of sulphate and fluoride ions and its selectivity towards other anions. We performed measurements of the transfer of ions in regular electrochemical cells, with a small organic drop deposited onto the surface of a glassy carbon electrode. These measurements demonstrate the potential of applying ion-transfer voltammetry in the characterization of organic compounds and sensing"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6250efa87523402df09eaff9","5e709359878c28a0473a7d7f","5e709359878c28a0473a7dad"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","616a392975234017e05459dc"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"517","pagesFromTo":"145778","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["616a392975234017e05459dc","67d9962ffdbe830c19f25f8a","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","6250efa87523402df09eaff9","5e709359878c28a0473a7dad","5e709359878c28a0473a7d7f","67d9962ffdbe830c19f25f8c","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a67","mniswId":"5553","title":"Electrochimica Acta","issn":"0013-4686","eissn":"1873-3859","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/electrochimica-acta/","documentHash":"9acc56c7-cbf9-4da3-b4ef-7d0a9cfd7d71"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67b843fbfdbe83514c8102be","year":"2025","volume":"517","documentHash":"386f05a2-634e-44f8-b0cd-ec3b3ecc4601"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748386606263"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67b5b164fdbe835419de40ce","name":"Daria","lastName":"Kępińska","documentHash":"939e06a0-bfac-47bf-a8df-9fd386aba6e9"},{"objectId":"67b5b164fdbe835419de40cd","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Żelechowska-Matysiak","documentHash":"3ec579aa-4ca2-4898-ab86-a6ad5f292b88"},{"objectId":"656aa4b840e3ff4ef3fd5039","name":"Jan","lastName":"Taudul","uuid":"DD384D3E692E4DDA7F71E38D849BFC6F9A8028863B7537AC995955F6C8F9853F33BAD28E558269AF205C5669DA2B937BE6E60F4EC304B722819D087746B4BCBC","orcidId":"0009-0006-5686-490X","documentHash":"0b8575e8-6865-418b-8e4c-30bf389a564f"},{"objectId":"60c2fdcf9543c72336543753","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Celej","uuid":"9F7D4DE58F01E2796C72454EACF9E3C7935FA4FEF54703BA87899DDB81D739F8FF058BCC347CF719BFDE4A90DC73079BE9FD4F41E298BB5F35F97A1DDCEB16B1","documentHash":"db540b5c-de0e-4007-97ab-3e3a690377ad"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be26d","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Nieciecka","uuid":"F405B638EA576615A03240F1FDA02FD2E6DAF1E6FF9695D6F1EA9D1EDB13D9934621378D8233562364985F48FFCD714808EF6B3B4159559A76BF246A09F4F681","documentHash":"4f841b77-c1f0-44a9-887d-e28a48bbd7e3"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba4a2","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Majkowska-Pilip","uuid":"5AFCAB141349FA8F4405236A33A446D1CB05F3619857E40837B6B0B15AB93F3C5675CCD396F8023A49EDA2BBE11E964192E3BCCAF51F8679D28DB6D3300BFE6B","orcidId":"0000-0001-9449-6411","documentHash":"d6f39feb-02b6-48a6-a2a2-6b2f7bb01f70"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b183c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krysiński","uuid":"4F9309BA67DD7B36952E3171A30C1D2B6E92BC39ADA418B0DABCF8BEC4D1913DF1F80E9224FF406C5101A69BC9A765AF8A3F6DB26530F898ECB7A8AC99B8C2CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-7941-1077","documentHash":"1cd9e2e8-5522-4129-95ca-5a47487734db"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7e22","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Strawski","uuid":"DC51FFD2EB652095A17095D334308E26F05E7B25407CA5EAD48005F0882D08E5C1D84FF4ABECB9AD4FFF6188DEF1BB290EC2E888353E04B24380C0BD14964014","orcidId":"0000-0002-8253-0878","documentHash":"a9f6906c-a6ca-4beb-a7da-dc89a67e3fea"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67b5b164fdbe835419de40ca","doi":"10.3390/biom15020230","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/15/2/230/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Tailored Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as Potential Cannabinoid Carriers for Anti-Cancer Treatment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a novel, multicomponent nanoparticulate carrier system based on superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with a designed hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance based on oleic acid and TWEEN 80 to incorporate hydrophobic cannabinoids—cannabigerol and cannabidiol—as well as the hydrophilic anthracycline drug epirubicin, forming a conjugate anticancer system. Additionally, the superparamagnetic iron oxide-based nanoparticles formed the core of the system, thus providing it with magnetic hyperthermia capabilities with a specific absorption rate comparable to the corresponding systems in the literature. The interaction of the conjugate with the cell membrane was studied using the Langmuir monolayers at the air/water interface formed of selected lipids modeling the healthy and cancerous cell membranes. Finally, cytotoxicity tests were carried out against the SKOV-3 cell line in vitro.

Here, we leverage ultrafast X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to directly capture hot carrier dynamics with sub-50 fs temporal resolution, providing clear evidence of plasmon decay mechanisms. We observe the sequential processes of Landau damping (~25 fs) and hot carrier thermalization (~1.5 ps), identifying hot carrier formation as a significant decay pathway. Energy distribution measurements reveal carriers in non-Fermi-Dirac states persisting beyond 500 fs and observe electron populations exceeding single-photon excitation energy, indicating the role of an Auger heating mechanism alongside traditional impact excitation. These findings deepen the understanding of hot carrier behavior under localized surface plasmon resonance, offering valuable implications for applications in photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and phototherapy. This work establishes a methodological framework for studying hot carrier dynamics, opening avenues for optimizing energy transfer processes in nanoscale plasmonic

industrialisation. Using limitless solar energy, photocatalysis may be used to address environmental issues. Whilst, the incorporation of ultrasonic cavitation in various processes such as the Fenton-like process, electrochemical process, and especially sono-photocatalysis offer ideal conditions for increasing biomass fragmentation and conversion into target products and green hydrogen within a lesser reaction time. The scientific community and industry have taken a serious interest in the intensification of ultrasonic processes for a variety of applications, as well as the resulting synergistic effects based on conventional comparisons in literature. In light of this, the purpose of this review is to summarize the current research in the field, provide an overview of the recent studies on ultrasound-assisted different catalytic processes for hydrogen production and discuss their limits and validity, comparing them to conventional techniques. Finally, a few future perspectives in the form of suggestions on ultrasound-assisted photocatalysis for hydrogen production from various biomass models and different wastes, and highlighting the role and recent evolution of carbon-based materials in this field, are presented together with current issues and challenges to clarify future attitudes in the hopes of exploring this ideal combination for large-scale H2 production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","63574a29752340623bc01cc7","65fcfb3a40e3ff2524a0c3e4","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"101","pagesFromTo":"797-814","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65fcfb3a40e3ff2524a0c3e4","63574a29752340623bc01cc7","6835a34afdbe834f489d6350","5e709491878c28a0473bfac9","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547821b","mniswId":"8998","title":"International Journal of Hydrogen Energy","eissn":"0360-3199","documentHash":"1352c74f-d26e-475a-a22c-a82d5d0e41dd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d3238fdbe833088aebd00","year":"2025","volume":"101","documentHash":"9ba56e33-6c95-4697-a8a8-5db2bf5567f1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748386607304"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da751","name":"Claudia","lastName":"Bearzi","documentHash":"69b2668a-20ac-476e-81aa-7d8581231f1c"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da750","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Rizzi","documentHash":"71269877-f36d-4383-8334-75f46ea82d0a"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74f","name":"Tommaso","lastName":"Sciarra","documentHash":"54394968-a22d-4725-997b-fc60e0153a80"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74e","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Scala","documentHash":"e5034ac7-1301-4682-86f8-a8941c43962a"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74d","name":"Anna Maria","lastName":"Ferretti","documentHash":"b026c4a7-d050-4c58-b1f0-655ea2c60963"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74c","name":"Sandro","lastName":"Recchia","documentHash":"0f2cbc68-b41e-4f21-b30b-f6b97963395a"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74b","name":"Klajdi","lastName":"Gega","documentHash":"f0ce9784-01e5-4361-8db0-27f1b44807cf"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74a","name":"Nicole","lastName":"Fratini","documentHash":"e4192021-c74b-4ef5-97b4-10ee0fecfa67"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da749","name":"Salma","lastName":"Bousselmi","documentHash":"44f88467-5569-4885-abcd-bd000c9f218e"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da748","name":"Maria Grazia","lastName":"Ceraolo","documentHash":"b5ebcec2-1aac-4c9d-b662-0843dde3a2aa"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da747","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Maiullari","documentHash":"1fd049eb-d976-4efc-9a5c-f157be5355f0"},{"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da746","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Galbiati","documentHash":"5f2f994f-b324-4dde-a266-3fb6532525db"},{"objectId":"5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","name":"Marco","lastName":"Costantini","uuid":"39AF91D3BD887DDA9D7064C2EEA4EC3EA3433737B56F1680E3899FD57F4B56CF80C6CBF0037AABC256FFEBAA40368FC799B344097649E00467A4677CD64AE0F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2756-5872","documentHash":"cb8eda43-6975-486d-98a0-48f4cabbf744"}],"objectId":"6835a6b3fdbe834f489da745","doi":"10.3390/pharmaceutics17020162","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/17/2/162/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Bioactive Hydrogel Supplemented with Stromal Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Enhance Wound Healing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background/Objectives: Skin regeneration is a rapidly advancing field with significant implications for regenerative medicine, particularly in treating wounds and burns. This study explores the potential of hydrogels functionalized with fibroblast-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to enhance skin regeneration in vivo. Being immunoprivileged, EVs minimize immune rejection, offering an attractive alternative to whole-cell therapies by replicating fibroblasts' key roles in tissue repair. Methods: To promote EVs' versatility and effective application across different conditions, a lyophilization method with lyoprotectants was optimized. Then, EVs were used to functionalize a hydrogel to perform experiments on murine cutaneous wound models. Results: Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) was selected as the polymeric hydrogel due to its biocompatibility, tunable mechanical properties, and ability to support wound healing. Mechanical tests confirmed GelMA's strength and elasticity for this application. Fibroblast-derived EVs were characterized using Western blot, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and NanoSight analysis, proving their integrity, size distribution, and stability. miRNome profiling identified enriched biological pathways related to cell migration, differentiation, and angiogenesis, emphasizing the critical role of EV cargo in promoting wound repair. In a murine model, hydrogels loaded with fibroblast-derived EVs significantly accelerated wound healing compared to controls (mean wound area 0.62 mm2 and 4.4 mm2, respectively), with faster closure, enhanced epithelialization, increased vascularization, and reduced fibrosis. Notably, the lyoprotectants successfully preserved the EVs' structure and bioactivity during freeze-drying, reducing EVs loss by 35% compared to the control group and underscoring the feasibility of this approach for long-term storage and clinical application. Conclusions: This study introduces a novel scalable and adaptable strategy for regenerative medicine by combining fibroblast-derived EVs with GelMA, optimizing EVs' stability and functionality for enhanced wound healing in clinical settings, even in challenging contexts such as combat zones or large-scale natural disasters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"162","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6835a6b3fdbe834f489da746","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da747","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da748","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da749","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74a","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74b","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74c","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74d","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74e","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da74f","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da750","6835a6b3fdbe834f489da751"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceee","mniswId":"15948","title":"Pharmaceutics","issn":"1999-4923","eissn":"1999-4923","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"640fbe9a-6905-4a12-ae21-1faaade61778"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67cadc6dfdbe831bcce09342","year":"2025","volume":"17","number":"2","documentHash":"1ac8b0ff-e857-45c4-9de9-385f152ee06f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748386607637"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68358bc1fdbe834f489a804f","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Siwiec","documentHash":"4adcf29b-cc3b-4251-a4ca-d249f18bdeb8"},{"objectId":"60c2fd859543c723365436a5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dusiło","uuid":"39B0D6E76B70F7168320D3265772A117770C2B5094291BC4EA306A9CA945B941AF71218E83FCFC84B062457F9179CCBFE65929F7499EE4F418051CF43D52C54C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6847-063X","documentHash":"c03e16a4-90ad-4d2d-aa48-130a48f446e8"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b002d","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Warczak","uuid":"9A73BBBF00AAFCF8C63902944899F5A1C8054299458227BE62C6D27338E9ACD2289E811817AD8956483A39DDB83C64ADCED24D1C994D5F57A2A452DC19840BFD","orcidId":"0000-0002-4589-4701","documentHash":"adc964fc-323f-43a3-8a4a-9916a69df006"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff48","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pięta","uuid":"AAC33876BE4017A0BF483155E0138F3F608C83D6AA39C4ABF3134DC6948009F7901870AB03A378CEB5BF302B02D88DD03E3E66A2026415822996C783589F4040","orcidId":"0000-0003-0341-2310","documentHash":"c4d620f7-3216-4b62-817e-b4330092a1a0"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b167","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Opałło","uuid":"ECB569ECB4125066F1DCDB9F48064E76F971F64BACACA1AFD7DBBBE80107D088337CBD1844ADDF79163AEED6F4FB8E817D076BC1662EF431F114EA1356D7929A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5872-7059","documentHash":"71cabfc4-5832-4f70-97cb-7c9b9abea0ef"}],"objectId":"68358bc1fdbe834f489a804e","doi":"10.1007/s10008-025-06222-3","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10008-025-06222-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Biphasic oxygen reduction with electrochemical electron donor regeneration within supported molecular solvent or ionic liquid film","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In recent years, electrochemical 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction became an important research topic because of the quest for a sustainable method of H2O2 production. The biphasic H2O2 generation with electrochemical recycling of the electron donor is one of the possibilities and was earlier studied employing an organic phase as a binder with a carbon paste electrode. Here, we report that H2O2 can be generated at the interface formed by electron donor (decamethylferrocene) solution in supported molecular solvent (2-nitrophenyloctyl ether) or ionic liquid (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) film deposited on an indium tin oxide electrode and acidic aqueous solution. The efficiency of this reaction was estimated on the basis of electrochemical detection of H2O2 at a Pt microelectrode tip approaching the liquid|liquid interface. It was shown that its yield is higher when the electron donor is electrochemically recycled."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii

We employed a imaging method called spatiotemporal optical coherence tomography, which ensures high contrast and phase stability within the strongly we recorded nanometer- scale changes in human cones and rods in response to photopic flicker stimulation and observed length changes in rodent rods under scotopic conditions following a single pulse of light, in the absence or presence of sildenafil, which inhibits the catalytic activity of PDE6. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that during phototransduction conformational changes in PDE6 structure, which occur on an angstrom scale, are amplified to the nanometer scale due to the unique structure of the photoreceptor outer segments and sequential stimulation. This finding opens up possibilities for the informed use of photopic flicker optoretinography measurements as a diagnostic tool, as the observed nanometer- scale changes in rod and cone dimensions as a function of light stimulus can now be directly linked to molecular events involved in the phototransduction pathway."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii

1-methylamine-3,5-dimethylpyrazole. The obtained complexes are the first reported examples of cationic-anionic coordination compounds tested for catecholase activity. Interestingly, only copper complex (1) shows catalytic activity in the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (3,5-DTBC), which turned out to be solvent dependent. Here, experimental UV-vis spectroscopy of 1 shows that essential features of the solid-state spectrum are maintained in DMSO and MeOH solvents. In contrast, the build-up of a new feature around 465 nm for 1 in CH3CN was noted, along with negligible activity. According to quantum chemical calculations, this feature could be attributed to ligand-to-metal excitations within the [CuCl4]2- fragment disturbed by adjacent [CuLCl]+ species. The band shifts to lower energies compared to solid-state measurements as the two charged fragments get closer due to Coulomb interactions. In DMSO, the solvent molecule serves as an inert ligand in a [CuLCl]+ fragment and blocks the catalytic center, disturbing the formation of the [catalyst-substrate] complex and decreasing activity, while in MeOH, the solvent effectively stabilizes [CuCl4]2-via a H-bond network and the free coordination site is accessible, thus allowing a substrate molecule to bind. The critical advantage of the investigated complexes, in the context of their possible catalytic activity, was the fact that their usage would not introduce any unnecessary counterions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e70928e878c28a047397cef","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0046","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0fc","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","5e70943c878c28a0473b8951"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"54","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"5268-5285","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397cef","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0fc","5e70943c878c28a0473b8951","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0046","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","6835a43cfdbe834f489d82fd","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778f6","mniswId":"4868","title":"Dalton Transactions","doi":"10.1039/c5dt","issn":"1477-9226","eissn":"1477-9234","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/dt","documentHash":"c732c991-2fb1-492e-935e-34e08a72105a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6835a43cfdbe834f489d82fc","year":"2025","volume":"54","number":"13","documentHash":"a89b851e-5bdd-4793-b0b0-a54d68db15c5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748386607859"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da101","name":"Zhi","lastName":"Luo","documentHash":"35d350a1-d8e3-4b58-af48-87e712dde250"},{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da100","name":"Yinyin","lastName":"Bao","documentHash":"0648bc62-3180-4e2c-9798-ae6d3753495a"},{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0ff","name":"Yu","lastName":"Xiong","documentHash":"a990196b-397b-40fe-b099-b7c43a129ec3"},{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fe","name":"Qiao","lastName":"Song","documentHash":"829457f5-62fb-49fd-bc97-4e6239d01c98"},{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fd","name":"Wenhui","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"8719630b-de4b-4bfd-92c2-32c94597935e"},{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fc","name":"Xindi","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"2431400c-c8c8-4e51-906f-cc9b621de62d"},{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fb","name":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","documentHash":"5d1533a5-c539-4445-855e-ebce5f0dd434"},{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fa","name":"Weijun","lastName":"Wu","documentHash":"c1e40e32-fc72-4f46-a1ce-a8e23c28d707"},{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0f9","name":"Xiaowo","lastName":"Kang","documentHash":"8acf2b16-3a52-4912-b72c-b86c41c4dd74"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","name":"Jan","lastName":"Paczesny","uuid":"22569BA0D9E03A26F0A64D7FCE396ED2ABE848430876A29510DE2522F2961D44598990961BF4B864621D02EECDE361E0D5D41E3F1FDFCA243A5BC52483EC38B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-3951","documentHash":"6d641bb0-96ee-402e-ac7c-55829c1da4b4"}],"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0f7","doi":"10.1016/j.apmt.2025.102646","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352940725000654?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Unraveling the internal structure of 4D-printed stimuli-responsive materials using a molecular probe","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Stimuli-responsive 4D-printing offers unparalleled potential in various research fields, enabling the combination of complicated mechanical design with programmable functionalities. The switchable polymer network structures, e.g., crystalline domains, free volume, and phase separation, are the key to achieving macroscopic responsiveness. However, despite a growing repertoire of new materials, most studies rely on rudimentary imaging techniques to visualize the materials' shape change under external stimuli. It remained challenging to correlate macroscopic behavior with the nanoscopic structures and dynamics of polymers. Here, leveraging the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomena, we introduce a novel method that can offer direct insights into the network structures and the chain mobility of the printed polymers. We developed a new photo-polymerizable polyurethane with multiple responsive characteristics, including temperature, mechanical strain, and pH, as an example of responsive 4D-printing materials. By embedding aggregate-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) in the polymer matrix, we demonstrated that the emission intensity and wavelength can serve as reporters and correlate the intramolecular motions of the AIEgen with the stimuli-responsive properties of the polymers. These observations were confirmed by small-angle X-ray scattering revealing the underpinning structural evolution. With potential applications for real-time structural monitoring, this study provides a new tool for the characterization of 4D-printed materials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"43","pagesFromTo":"102646","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0f9","6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fa","6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fb","6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fc","6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fd","6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0fe","6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0ff","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","6835a5c1fdbe834f489da100","6835a5c1fdbe834f489da101"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9ef","mniswId":"1479","title":"Applied Materials Today","issn":"2352-9407","eissn":"2352-9407","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"777382ed-49dc-461f-9d6e-758ce130062f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6835a5c1fdbe834f489da0f8","year":"2025","volume":"43","documentHash":"5ef774b1-337d-4c6f-a35b-d0a83d6bd862"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748386607989"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b3a","name":"Sebastián","lastName":"Albericci-Avendaño","documentHash":"27936425-3308-4321-b27c-e8be2d88f29b"},{"objectId":"6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b39","name":"Salvador","lastName":"Villar-Villar","documentHash":"0d86573f-e1d8-4701-b957-c68f36d887ed"},{"objectId":"6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b38","name":"Kim","lastName":"Stansfield","documentHash":"5d147fbc-ae53-4e46-a0a9-e472222a5c45"},{"objectId":"6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b37","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Rojas","documentHash":"39fcc8be-bb5d-4200-a190-f967558b8481"},{"objectId":"6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b36","name":"Ramón","lastName":"Colmenares-Quintero","documentHash":"69dc9f15-5145-4d8b-8a30-31094257755a"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","name":"Juan","lastName":"Colmenares Quintero","uuid":"F67660D7BD17BB972C2DDFFD590CF0157F47CE07A56C0AC3BC096A80FC2DE6703397D983F7D0D4A1BC91D4B41DB7D47862CE44527EF074599DAC89A311983098","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-6340","documentHash":"0c64f219-d827-4b4d-8c6d-2904f6c20a7c"}],"objectId":"6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b35","doi":"10.3390/su17041505","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/4/1505/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Design of an Integral Simulation Model for Solar-Powered Seawater Desalination in Coastal Communities: A Case Study in Manaure, La Guajira, Colombia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The provision of potable water or water with physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics suitable for consumption is essential for human survival. However, numerous communities in the coastal areas of Colombia still lack access to clean and safe water sources. To address this challenge in many communities, desalination emerges as a promising solution. In this regard, this article focuses on the evaluation and proposal of an integrated simulation model for solar-powered water desalination in coastal communities, with particular attention to water quality aspects, as well as potential impacts on health and the environment. To carry out a comprehensive assessment, the intention is to design a simulation model using tools such as Homer Pro, IMSdesign, and MATLAB, leveraging data on living conditions and water quality in La Guajira, as well as publicly available information on the best desalination practices in coastal communities and following current Colombian regulations within the framework of health and environmental care. This model will allow for a detailed analysis of key factors and impacts in the implementation of solar-powered desalination systems, considering the conditions of the case study in Manaure, La Guajira, Colombia. Through this design, it facilitates the understanding of technical and operational aspects, as well as exploring efficient energy solutions through the integration of renewable sources, with the purpose of mitigating the challenges associated with high energy consumption and reducing both costs and the environmental and human health impact inherent in these desalination processes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1505","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b36","6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b37","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db","6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b38","6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b39","6835a54ffdbe834f489d9b3a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67aaf9d5fdbe8362a56dbd50","year":"2025","publishedYear":2025,"volume":"17","number":"4","documentHash":"3a24fc76-78a2-4cda-aca0-fdecaad8881c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748386607996"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678feb5ffdbe835856c15895","name":"Arturo","lastName":"Llamosí","documentHash":"0e3c9fba-a360-4aca-8348-073b8f9b8017"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Danylyuk","uuid":"76C9B1CC8BF786B245E6E064FB1EF762E68427200C6553653512B713F436D343D13A0FB2F4895E1A41BC3AF4C15135CAD6F23994A9FF03CEFCD8BF9C0FB1D1C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3653-2418","documentHash":"f0349659-5182-4ae8-aa50-8a56d0ae53e1"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa96e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"SZUMNA","uuid":"A517DABD36EC5B08BA10DCC47BA90CA25DB28E7571B399994984E57865A738828179A73C992DC45C5F5BABD354509AD84182F2698BD2E1A13C87FECB124C9951","orcidId":"0000-0003-3869-1321","documentHash":"77f1e058-ad48-4110-bdb5-369ad0d0b2fa"}],"objectId":"678feb5ffdbe835856c15893","doi":"10.1002/cssc.202402503","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202402503","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Facile and Versatile Mechanochemical Synthesis of Indigoid Photoswitches","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We demonstrate the application of mechanochemistry in the synthesis of indolone-based photoswitches (hemiindigos, hemithioindigos, and oxindoles) via Knoevenagel condensation reactions.

This self-trapped soliton train is leveraged to implement self-referenced multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (SR-M-CARS) imaging. Simulations and experiments illustrating the filamentation process and the concatenation of focusing-defocusing cycles in ceramic and crystal YAG are presented. In addition, our simulations and experiments further examine the dependence of the filamentation onset location and supercontinuum (SC) generation upon peak input power. Understanding this dependence is key for the implementation of viable CARS imaging techniques, due to the comparatively exceptional ability of YAG to generate supercontinuum that can enable higher-sensitivity imaging without delay lines.

The enzymatic isomerization of at-ROL, crucial for restoring the visual pigments and preparing them to receive new light stimuli, relies on various enzymes found in both the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium cells. To function effectively, retinoids must shuttle between these two cell types. Retinol-binding protein 3 (RBP3), located in the interphotoreceptor matrix, probably plays a pivotal role in this transport mechanism. Comprised of four retinoid-binding modules, RBP3 also binds fatty acids, potentially aiding retinal function by facilitating the loading and unloading of different retinoids at specific cell types thereby directing the cycle. In this study, we present a 3.67 & Aring; cryoEM structure of porcine RBP3, along with molecular docking analysis and corroborative in-solution small-angle X-ray scattering data for titration of RBP3 with relevant ligands, that also give insights on RBP3 conformational

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) underscore the critical role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition in disease progression. Effective in vitro models must replicate the intercellular relationships and physicochemical properties of native ECM to fully capture disease-specific characteristics. Although recent biomaterials support the in vitro biofabrication of pathophysiological environments, they often lack disease-specific ECM features. In this study, DystroGel, a hydrogel derived from the cardiac ECM of a porcine DMD model, replicates the distinct molecular composition of dystrophic cardiac tissue for the first time. The findings indicate that the dystrophic ECM matrix exhibits a unique protein profile, impacting cellular processes critical to DMD pathology. This work demonstrates the importance of using a 3D substrate that recreates intercellular dynamics within a defined pathological environment, enhancing the ability to model genetic disorders and providing a valuable tool for advancing personalized therapeutic strategies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c95","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c96","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c97","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c98","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c99","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c9a","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c9b","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c9c","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c9d","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c9e","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c9f","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205ca0","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205ca1","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205ca2","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205ca3","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205ca4","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205ca5","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205ca6","6836dd71fdbe833b4d205ca7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e85","mniswId":"428","title":"Advanced healthcare materials","issn":"2192-2640","eissn":"2192-2659","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4c9980cf-57d1-4d5d-ae05-6ffc7410ae94"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6836dd71fdbe833b4d205c94","year":"2025","volume":"14","number":"9","documentHash":"80866d9d-b31c-4cea-8478-cc3360c1f736"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748472697935"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab9","name":"Ajeet","lastName":"Kaushik","documentHash":"f5b2d025-c216-4278-bd30-fe6977cf2aa4"},{"objectId":"6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab8","name":"Abdellatif","lastName":"Ait Lahcen","documentHash":"c32ea081-86f2-457e-a686-ea061402b37e"},{"objectId":"6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab7","name":"Duygu","lastName":"Beduk","documentHash":"72c6e20b-bc39-490a-b5c4-df38dd26d6b7"},{"objectId":"6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab6","name":"Amadeo","lastName":"Sena-Torralba","documentHash":"0ce41deb-a7a6-4992-9df0-d2c1f8fd0c33"},{"objectId":"6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab5","name":"Tutku","lastName":"Beduk","documentHash":"5a5efeb4-10cd-44d1-9c59-8f3e9ace10fb"},{"objectId":"6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab4","name":"Fatah","lastName":"Ben Moussa","documentHash":"10645d23-f1bf-4801-ba1d-2d516a528805"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Kutner","uuid":"4DB1E113A4C8683FB6BC69134920B86E44C946E3D21F32F5F6CE1483179976E11B16608F3E02B532633CFF5B5216E4C96C7B94090438FDEA74135F1AE4F3BCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-5170","documentHash":"71f3755a-d420-46be-bb05-d5ea4b0bfa7c"}],"objectId":"6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab2","doi":"10.1016/j.trac.2025.118177","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0165993625000457?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Beyond single-analyte detection: Advancing molecularly imprinted polymers for simultaneous multi-target sensing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Molecular imprinting in polymers is one of the most rapidly growing trends in chemical sensing, offering high stability and selectivity for target analytes. Delving into the synthesis methods and highlighting innovations that enable the simultaneous determination of multiple analytes, we extensively and critically reviewed herein the advancements in multi-analyte molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) sensors applied in various fields. The fundamentals of MIP-based electrochemical and optical sensors featuring hybrid recognition systems, as well as the challenges related to removing templates from MIPs, separation of detection signals, and upscaling for commercialization, are deeply discussed. Moreover, considering the potential of MIPs as efficient platforms for multi-target sensing, we provide insight into the critical aspects that hinder the MIP sensors from crossing laboratory borders. By identifying recent progress and persistent challenges, the current review serves as a guide for advancing MIP-based sensing platforms for multiple target analytes recognizing across medical, pharmaceutical, and environmental domains."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"185","pagesFromTo":"118177","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab4","6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab5","6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab6","6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab7","6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab8","5e7092b4878c28a04739b0e6","6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547997a","mniswId":"19624","title":"TrAC Trends in Analytical Chemistry","issn":"0165-9936","documentHash":"333567f3-a42c-44d8-b866-94a6e672b47b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6836dde0fdbe833b4d207ab3","year":"2025","volume":"185","documentHash":"1922fd14-8386-4ec7-99f0-5df8587177ad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748472697945"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b63","name":"Jerzy Robert","lastName":"Sobiecki","documentHash":"8e060698-2e7b-4c0b-a1a2-bdc4c52fe124"},{"objectId":"67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b62","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kulikowski","documentHash":"29fc4f5d-5e27-4e41-8106-7cd2260a5773"},{"objectId":"67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b61","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Marciniak","documentHash":"3da0a137-d906-4193-ad0f-649ec3840b4d"},{"objectId":"67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b60","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Chodun","documentHash":"559c1806-4cae-48d4-a214-f46d0845ceea"},{"objectId":"67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b5e","name":"Karol","lastName":"Wunsch","documentHash":"4a6a5b69-f3e5-47d8-ac3f-40d2f5ef30ad"},{"objectId":"5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c60","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Skołek","uuid":"87C8712DFBD1688CB993A13F1535AAB168511212529F95272603A69552091AC6B5FE99374E23B99138A82D665AB2660CC12CEB9255BE0E00AA1080626FA01726","orcidId":"0000-0002-0736-9471","documentHash":"0dd8c8f7-4be8-4447-8b55-ddf1611b3d25"},{"objectId":"5e7093d9878c28a0473b1e03","name":"Agata","lastName":"Roguska","uuid":"9C022051902B18A4D49FF0030566FC0CCDE045469CE4657C6BB8F7EB57FCDFF21311456EB3F103705279302463DA7AB76ED80DBFBF525B1131EAB4142FCA1D27","orcidId":"0000-0001-9189-4879","documentHash":"e20eca24-ab1b-4b75-aa0a-7119b2db77d7"}],"objectId":"67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b5d","doi":"10.1016/j.vacuum.2025.114055","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Adhesion and Chemical Composition of Carbon Coatings Produced in Low-Temperature RFCVD Processes on Substrates of 35CrMnSi5-5-4 Steel with Ultra-Fine Grain Bainitic and Martensitic Structure","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this study is to investigate the feasibility of producing a carbon coating through the Radio Frequency Chemical Vapor Deposition (RFCVD) process on steel substrates that have undergone isothermal and martensitic hardening, without significantly altering their structure, which opens the possibility of applying such coatings to ultra-fine grained bainitic substrates. Coating procedures were carried out within a temperature range\nof 50–250 ◦C. Dilatometric measurements confirmed the stability of the ultra-fine grain bainitic structure, whereas the martensitic structure exhibited marginal tempering within this temperature range of coating deposition. Results indicate that the coatings’ nanohardness increases from about 10 GPa in temperature of 50 ◦C to 12 GPa in case of the ultra-fine grain bainitic substrate, and 14 GPa in case of the martensitic substrate in temperature of 230 ◦C. Complete delamination occurs at approximately 9N for the martensitic substrate and 6N\nfor the ultra-fine grain bainitic substrate. As the RFCVD process temperature increases from 50 ◦C to 250 ◦C, the delamination threshold decreases to 0N, resulting in spontaneous delamination upon the first contact with the\nindenter. Analysis using XPS and Raman spectroscopy revealed that the carbon coatings predominantly possess an amorphous structure, comprising approximately 25–37 % sp3-type bonds, which showed an increase with the\nrise in RFCVD process temperature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b5e","67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b63","67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b62","67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b61","67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b60","5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c60"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d9878c28a0473b1e03"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-14","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b5e","5e7093d9878c28a0473b1e03","67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b60","5e7094a3878c28a0473c0c60","67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b61","67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b62","67c0768dfdbe830b4ed43b63"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a46","mniswId":"20031","title":"Vacuum","issn":"0042-207X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"56e2e886-7df4-4704-9213-c07d91a582dd"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Plasma CVD","Amorphous carbon","Ultra-fine grain bainite","Mechanical properties","Adhesion","Thermal stability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748646940832"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67af0d6cfdbe8332768beeaf","name":"Renata","lastName":"Solarska","documentHash":"76180d20-61cf-4531-a875-9e96cdd30f6c"},{"objectId":"67af0d6cfdbe8332768beeae","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bieńkowski","documentHash":"377d1577-f4ec-4a65-b438-6214b65bb8f7"},{"objectId":"67af0d6cfdbe8332768beead","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kaproń","documentHash":"3ce3bb1e-81a2-4069-af0b-e41379d732c9"},{"objectId":"67af0d6cfdbe8332768beeab","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kuder","documentHash":"e5d99bf8-99e3-4cf4-9d28-23ff11aa68ac"},{"objectId":"67af0d6cfdbe8332768beeaa","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Parzuch","documentHash":"751a1d79-69f9-4a26-843c-c4da47ce5f09"},{"objectId":"5e709491878c28a0473bfaf2","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Nikiforow","uuid":"E166453BA6868F48895D87A86E6702843A623A59A84923A7C78B7FFBB992983C7D95FE6E5E79D29AB2127112DC3887B27E8FB1E44DE4688F1367FD5EA5783F74","orcidId":"0000-0001-6135-8514","documentHash":"c96f36f3-357e-4938-9d4c-83e71d392895"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aeccc","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"4C5357AD84D0C166355C58D5DB7F65858C60A5B81895FDB3FFC96B71BD494D185EFD9DCC6D46B50D7CE0E6F04F91EABA3D668E46821EED10DC2AE408E6D2B044","orcidId":"0000-0003-1975-2117","documentHash":"e7423a6c-5003-4ccf-beb9-75c8598a2f57"}],"objectId":"67af0d6cfdbe8332768beea9","doi":"10.3390/ma18030620","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/3/620/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Efficient Photoelectrochemical Reduction of CO2 in Seawater with Cheap and Abundant Cu2O/Al2O3/TiO2 Electrode","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of carbon dioxide to environmentally friendly fuels is a promising strategy to address the challenge of clean energy demand.

Alexidine and pentamidine are FDA-approved drug compounds currently rediscovered as potent membrane-targeting antibiotic adjuvants helping restore antibiotic activity against multidrug resistant bacteria pathogens. We have adopted host-guest and crystal engineering approach to study these drugs with a view of potential supramolecular formulations and/or crystal forms. We focus on the host-guest conformational and structural behaviour of alexidine and pentamidine under macrocyclic confinement conditions benefitting from single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, self-assembly studies in solution by NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy, and ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) analysis complemented by theoretical calculations. Our findings show that the simple bowl-shaped host promotes conformational fixing and crystallization of these guest molecules of high conformational freedom that are otherwise challenging to crystallize. The IM-MS structural studies of p-sulfonato-calix[4]arene complexes with pentamidine and alexidine revealed significant guest reorganization in the solution/gas phase, compared to the binding modes observed in the crystal structures. Despite these changes, the host-guest complexation remained consistent, with new interactions highlighting the increased role of electrostatic forces in the gas phase."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53ca9","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","5fc4accd085dcb1e6ae0b89f","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53ca9","5fc4accd085dcb1e6ae0b89f","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","67a8efddfdbe8328704c6f86","67a8efddfdbe8328704c6f87","67a8efddfdbe8328704c6f88","67a8efddfdbe8328704c6f89","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b16","5e7093bd878c28a0473b003c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f1","mniswId":"3513","title":"Chemistry-A European Journal","doi":"10.1002/chem.","issn":"0947-6539","eissn":"1521-3765","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1521-3765","documentHash":"56606be2-854e-47eb-92eb-2de5acecfa73"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67a8efddfdbe8328704c6f82","year":"2025","documentHash":"a0f118cf-91f5-4af0-85fa-80a564b1e5ab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646940858"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c1df94fdbe830b4ee33df6","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rowinska-Zyrek","documentHash":"f406ae1e-5324-4755-87f4-88760a6e3a32"},{"objectId":"67c1df94fdbe830b4ee33df5","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Valensin","documentHash":"2baaaaed-8a3f-4b09-8b78-91f6175fb103"},{"objectId":"67c1df94fdbe830b4ee33df4","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wątły","documentHash":"f54d9894-fe57-4f10-96e5-2b68c703ff7e"},{"objectId":"67c1df94fdbe830b4ee33df3","name":"Robert","lastName":"Wieczorek","documentHash":"2ded43e5-c50f-4225-8dee-694ce49c66d2"},{"objectId":"67c1df94fdbe830b4ee33df0","name":"Arian","lastName":"Kola","documentHash":"092f327e-6724-457a-86d2-f767f389c3cb"},{"objectId":"67c1df94fdbe830b4ee33def","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Mikołajczyk-Tarnawa","documentHash":"53ec2ea9-b4bf-4b64-8bc1-1d8c86985d56"},{"objectId":"67c1df94fdbe830b4ee33dee","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Miller","documentHash":"a753e7b6-ed4e-4820-8541-de35713a2297"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b003a","name":"Anders","lastName":"Jönsson-Niedziółka","uuid":"3394A368CB0E6B611D461246FA8924DA0550D7AF68CD7EBB72456860833F46CDC79A875204939C5A2F631BE36B09951DDC56FAB1B1015A54CDFB0E1A1E128C0B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5642-5946","documentHash":"f675ee5a-f8e9-4d1f-bdd0-4e009824f6ef"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6fb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wiloch","uuid":"80493E92B20FDF4BB85E08FD70302E0545F70959E6FBB9CC01FF8576C1A08C8CC864AF5E8D8F2A2B74CDE695CD710143C649FCF56AFE8A60087F46FFD7C71CB2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8331-8572","documentHash":"35deba9a-f120-4bca-b1e1-d0f72f31177a"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a14c1","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Matera-Witkiewicz","uuid":"491FD0C786719C1D2E69EEA6CEE52F4C21C340036DA3EEDCF3DB49667ACA9B4138E5A71C54A5C764CEF183DAD977B669D28EEA7C1ED10BED7BBFE4167058671C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1064-1237","documentHash":"f7bbe2ce-2224-4568-aeb4-d8e22825f0c6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67c1df94fdbe830b4ee33ded","doi":"10.1039/d4sc05222f","publicUri":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/sc/d4sc05222f","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Cu(ii) binding to an antimicrobial shrimp peptide - a small step for structural chemistry, a big leap for medicinal applications","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"PvHCt, a 23-amino acid long, histidine-rich peptide derived from shrimp, becomes strongly antimicrobial upon Cu(II) ion binding.

Significant interest is growing in realizing porous functionally graded materials (pFGMs) that can resemble the hierarchical organization of porosity found in bone tissue. This study introduces a method for fabricating porous scaffolds based on the real-time generation of a liquid foam, which is gelled, forming porous fibers that are organized into structured matrixes using a 3D bioprinting system. The primary advantage of this approach is the possibility to adjust bubble size during printing dynamically, modifying the characteristics of the deposited foamed filaments online and in one step. As a result, locally-defined and tailor-made pores can be distributed in 3D structures with high spatial accuracy. Besides the mechanical and morphological characterization of diverse microarchitectures, we also explored the biocompatibility of the proposed approach by directly embedding osteosarcoma cells within the biomaterial. Results demonstrated the biocompatibility of the proposed methodology and revealed the influence of the interior microporosity on cell proliferation, highlighting the potential for creating tailored tissue microenvironments. The findings underscore the versatility of the presented 3D bioprinting system and its potential in fabricating biomimetic scaffolds with tailored morphological gradients, representing a substantial advancement in pFGM synthesis, with direct implications in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cf1","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","5e7094af878c28a0473c1a06","5fc4cd7c085dcb1e6ae0b90c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"13632-13645","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68397ddefdbe836834773286","5fc4cd7c085dcb1e6ae0b90c","654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53cf1","68397ddefdbe836834773287","68397ddefdbe836834773288","68397ddefdbe836834773289","68397ddefdbe83683477328a","68397ddefdbe83683477328b","68397ddefdbe83683477328c","68397ddefdbe83683477328d","68397ddefdbe83683477328e","68397ddefdbe83683477328f","5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","5e7094af878c28a0473c1a06"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dc5","mniswId":"125","title":"ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES","issn":"1944-8244","websiteLink":"http://pubs.acs.org/journal/aamick","documentHash":"27b6e464-7a88-4cfc-a099-7ec8b65dc4b1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68397e12fdbe8368347742fc","year":"2025","volume":"17","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"0e3ab22f-19b5-455d-993d-a6a104039000"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646942468"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68397bb9fdbe836834770266","name":"Mykhailo","lastName":"Gonchar","documentHash":"89517d6d-595e-4612-ad59-8dd20b69e683"},{"objectId":"68397bb9fdbe836834770265","name":"Olha","lastName":"Demkiv","documentHash":"882d3dd9-b069-47d8-a33b-58c2c522afd5"},{"objectId":"68397bb9fdbe836834770264","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Zakalskiy","documentHash":"2359808d-7697-4f26-bc62-fdad8c7dcd5b"},{"objectId":"68397bb9fdbe836834770263","name":"Nataliya","lastName":"Stasyuk","documentHash":"ca8eb160-f746-4f77-947c-3834ea463fc4"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff1d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Nogala","uuid":"B4AF271024798CB3554323174E4D67CA18E7044ADAB5324BEBC9767D2E44DE5B3B0765B12BF62923E5124CF3EC68DA9061CC7589AECA74B9EA3E36A5B310433A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6135-3294","documentHash":"a77ff04b-03c8-4551-be07-7f109efa7780"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af95e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hołdyński","uuid":"E2F1430F44E6F85CF133687ABCA75A8F6D2A73535614539B94BA52FB6141073600A92BBDD9031C0D545698CA6485CE1DC981E9C742A3D072EFDE0D140884663C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0248-8746","documentHash":"421dfc57-27d0-4281-8f34-9bb7a813f2ba"}],"objectId":"68397bb9fdbe836834770261","doi":"10.1016/j.snb.2024.136971","publicUri":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0925400524017015","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Genetically engineered bacterial cells enriched with creatinine deiminase and N-methylhydantoin-sensitive bionanocomposites for self-powered creatinine-selective biosensors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Miniaturized devices powered by biofuel cells for the detection of creatinine will play an important role in clinical settings and personal use. Microbial biosensors based on whole cells, especially in combination with nanomaterials, are efficient and cost-effective tools for a variety of analytical applications. In the current study, the enrichment of recombinant bacterial cells by creatinine deiminase (CDI) was accomplished through the combination of gene engineering and nanotechnology approaches: (1) by overexpression of the corresponding CDI gene in recombinant Corynebacterium glutamicum cells, and (2) via the nanotechnological strategies, such as loading the cells with CDI co-immobilized with N-methylhydantoin-sensitive nanoparticles (nCu). The enriched bacterial cells (CDI-nCu) were successfully used for the construction of a bioanode utilized in the biosensor and biofuel cell construction (MFC).

However, one of the most demanding challenges faced currently is their instability under environmental conditions. One of the popular strategies to overcome this significant drawback is the incorporation of oversized cations into the perovskite lattice. In this study, we focus on the compositional engineering of double-cation A-site DMA x FA1-x PbI3 perovskite materials using solvent-free mechanochemical synthesis along with the examination of their temperature-dependent polytypism through in situ variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) and thermogravimetric analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry. pXRD analysis of as-ground materials confirms complete miscibility across the entire substitution range, leading to the formation of one-dimensional delta-perovskitoid materials. Moreover, we revealed that the processing conditions have a huge impact on the temperature-induced phase transitions and the formation of 3D polytypes within the temperature range of 298-573 K. Specifically, subjecting the samples to rapid heating (5 degrees C/min) supports the coexistence of new different structural phases being formed, while a low heating rate (0.5 degrees C/min) favors the formation of single-phase materials. Interestingly, slow heating results in the formation of a single black alpha-perovskite phase for material compositions up to 10% DMA, while in the fast-heating route, black alpha-perovskite coexists as the secondary phase with the 4H polytype in compositions up to 30% DMA. Thus, this work offers a comprehensive understanding of the effect of composition engineering and processing conditions on the phase transition to a given polytype in double A-cation DMA x FA1-x PbI3 materials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3f18","60c308d19543c72336543a9c","5e709423878c28a0473b6fe2","5e709349878c28a0473a6788","5e709389878c28a0473ac382"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"37","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"897-911","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c308d19543c72336543a9c","5e709349878c28a0473a6788","5e709389878c28a0473ac382","5e709423878c28a0473b6fe2","5e709328878c28a0473a3f18"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775ef","mniswId":"3511","title":"Chemistry of Materials","issn":"0897-4756","eissn":"1520-5002","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"3e916062-bdfd-499c-a6f0-5a66fe527d99"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68397aa3fdbe83683476f4af","year":"2025","volume":"37","number":"3","documentHash":"6c17f2bf-28be-4074-84f4-a8010a9e830c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646943041"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"683999cdfdbe8368347ab313","name":"Jean-Claude","lastName":"Guillemin","documentHash":"a2cd1599-a9c2-4139-b64c-1df026117895"},{"objectId":"654b00ba40e3ff4ef3f53c9f","name":"Elavenil","lastName":"Ganesan","uuid":"5488C5FD6E3537E716A919E97EFBC1AF579F3C7D73F45AC60E09AF3E02BD2DB4FD2C266997CF1ED2D27133E08C33FA02DB8A751401A7E46C156BC96B88D30FED","documentHash":"70129e26-7424-48be-a618-2ed5de189bc5"},{"objectId":"613971a99543c7051ff01bb2","name":"Arunlibertsen","lastName":"Lawzer","uuid":"AC3E1B2488D88AA8CBD8128375C2F2CBD29A48673C3BA859FD09CA82B5603E72764D9B3B796D9A94D3C68BEC368CD269E77E3AA2E47DEC336A3F81198C187045","orcidId":"0000-0002-6020-1256","documentHash":"98140545-41cf-4f0a-ba5d-ce8009930d1b"},{"objectId":"5e7093dd878c28a0473b222b","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Custer","uuid":"6DFEAC92D33F84CFF833BCDE82B54D1BC440A4B074460BCE30A1CEF232E61FA3E9A1BD07EB521B9D97C32E1F673BFA9D6CA88F27C2FA06A0493723A4530E8042","orcidId":"0000-0003-2336-4248","documentHash":"94eddde7-59d4-43b7-9876-02808ea4b3cd"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b0b8","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kołos","uuid":"E2DE2A8BA8BD16D93A25D4877EE859A67941C0EC47371E80CA60E92199FFFECC377E95EDFF1CC401E8C2F35071F13C96BBAE5AE7B820AD1303F166C7896CE394","orcidId":"0000-0001-6103-9660","documentHash":"8841b962-f547-4474-9f81-627b80e2e5a5"}],"objectId":"683999cdfdbe8368347ab311","doi":"10.1039/d4cp04182h","publicUri":"https://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=D4CP04182H","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Isomerisation of phosphabutyne and a photochemical route to phosphabutadiyne (HC<sub>3</sub>P), a phosphorus analogue of cyanoacetylene","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The photochemistry of phosphabut-1-yne, CH3CH2CP, was investigated by means of infrared spectroscopy assisted by theoretical (DFT) predictions.

Among the others, poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) hold significant potential as candidates for FDM since they meet the sustainability and biodegradability standards mentioned above. However, the most utilised PHA, consisting of the poly(hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) homopolymer, has a high degree of crystallinity and low thermal stability near the melting point. As a result, its application in FDM has not yet attained mainstream adoption. Introducing a monomer with higher excluded volume, such as hydroxyvalerate, in the PHB primary structure, as in poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-valerate) (PHBV) copolymers, reduces the degree of crystallinity and the melting temperature, hence improving the PHA printability. Blending amorphous poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with PHBV enhances further PHA printability via FDM. In this work, we investigated the printability of two blends characterised by different PLA and PHBV weight ratios (25:75 and 50:50), revealing the close connection between blend microstructures, melt rheology and 3D printability. For instance, the relaxation time associated with die swelling upon extrusion determines the diameter of the extruded filament, while the viscoelastic properties the range of extrusion speed available. Through thoroughly screening printing parameters such as deposition speed, nozzle diameter, flow percentage and deposition platform temperature, we determined the optimal printing conditions for the two PLA/PHBV blends. It turned out that the blend with a 50:50 weight ratio could be printed faster and with higher accuracy. Such a conclusion was validated by replicating with remarkable fidelity high-complexity objects, such as a patient's cancer-affected iliac crest model."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4b357085dcb1e6ae0b8bb","68397a33fdbe83683476f02a","68397a33fdbe83683476f02b","68397a33fdbe83683476f02c","68397a33fdbe83683476f02d","68397a33fdbe83683476f02e","68397a33fdbe83683476f02f","68397a33fdbe83683476f030","68397a33fdbe83683476f031"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c837","mniswId":"11176","title":"Journal of Functional Biomaterials","issn":"2079-4983","eissn":"2079-4983","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"28044081-d747-4686-ace7-97f466a7e3bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68397a33fdbe83683476f029","year":"2025","volume":"16","number":"1","documentHash":"df3028f9-e0a0-45eb-94cc-9028c8c656ae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646943122"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6839991dfdbe8368347a9d80","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Łoś","documentHash":"35d59461-062d-476a-970a-bbfdd9b20164"},{"objectId":"6577d3b840e3ff4ef3006306","name":"Sada","lastName":"Raza","uuid":"053FD2BBFA6CCF8515284797876547235C045EC78EDAD802CD97FDCAFC6FC687C3E40D946129B76F2B25BFFEFCFAEEC100CC524DDF82FDF5128C92510FEF22A4","documentHash":"c105e911-1529-45a1-aedb-791bd1c3f46f"},{"objectId":"6243c0a87523402df099a308","name":"Nataliia","lastName":"Atamas","uuid":"03CD2867E8CCC8FAC838A62395D2ADDE5A54E233FDBCB7A58C63161C9CFCE49C5AA2A88C768A33AAF4F1A0942207762DAAD3A0A73D6261964659936F2F8BE4B2","documentHash":"c1d44c5a-e9c0-4d79-9e3d-3a5121275f1e"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a94","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Karpińska-Zaleska","uuid":"81CE23ABE6E6B3C70C3D39E431F226997968E7643F724CC1D0F8AE7F5F28608F23CC60878C1FC50834A79B6306B9656DB0365A522C5E610F0D69621CF600E777","documentHash":"e2957bda-e96d-4173-93a7-193cfb68e168"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","name":"Jan","lastName":"Paczesny","uuid":"22569BA0D9E03A26F0A64D7FCE396ED2ABE848430876A29510DE2522F2961D44598990961BF4B864621D02EECDE361E0D5D41E3F1FDFCA243A5BC52483EC38B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3758-3951","documentHash":"6d641bb0-96ee-402e-ac7c-55829c1da4b4"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ratajczyk","uuid":"D7BF159D17AA3F44A08389A461C0C453E3CFA0D80BDD70361E3C3FDAABAB66937DFBCBEDC5E928A5269A3370C62BD41F00F01DF11D10C408342FED73975BA671","orcidId":"0000-0003-1613-6933","documentHash":"aafca08f-0cdd-4319-8133-314824720e0a"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Bończak","uuid":"C9CF64DD69F437F68ADC88042449758EDAB0FBFED5919D083B81D041CD3175B9BC73BF8CE3BD3EED7552EAC50D2AF5BA1D0980E854B77D4C1C7A5C1D2261D966","orcidId":"0000-0002-6581-7420","documentHash":"21268306-0066-4e34-8b95-4b97a81ec913"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hołyst","uuid":"E92F295C3CC2CB6B18C450B2AB735CDA75E1B176DB096D3C43CB9E6E23F05E2B3448297032B471C71265740E595D30DAA6BA0B89CC0DB4589E73DB45075B7008","orcidId":"0000-0002-3211-4286","documentHash":"cbe7625d-9b95-4888-b28d-a8e3f921d07f"}],"objectId":"6839991dfdbe8368347a9d7f","doi":"10.1007/s00253-025-13414-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00253-025-13414-4","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"The activity of indigo carmine against bacteriophages: an edible antiphage agent","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bacteriophage infections in bacterial cultures pose a significant challenge to industrial bioprocesses, necessitating the development of innovative antiphage solutions.

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) revealed that IC selectively binds to dsDNA, demonstrated by a significant reduction in the diffusion coefficient, whereas no binding was observed with ssDNA or RNA. Mechanistically, IC permeates the phage capsid, leading to genome ejection and capsid deformation, as confirmed by TEM imaging. Under optimal conditions (50 degrees C, 220 rpm), IC achieved up to a 7-log reduction in phage titer, with kinetic theory supporting the enhanced collision frequency induced by agitation. Additionally, IC protected E. coli cultures from phage-induced lysis without affecting bacterial growth or protein production, as demonstrated by GFP expression assays. IC's effectiveness and environmental safety, combined with its FDA approval and cost-effectiveness, make it a promising antiphage agent for industrial applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4a94","6577d3b840e3ff4ef3006306","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","6243c0a87523402df099a308"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"109","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6577d3b840e3ff4ef3006306","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","6243c0a87523402df099a308","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff41","6839991dfdbe8368347a9d80","5e7092b4878c28a04739b069","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0033","5e709400878c28a0473b4a94"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477137","mniswId":"1489","title":"APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY","issn":"0175-7598","eissn":"1432-0614","documentHash":"eafe96ee-907e-42ad-9729-0f39c1e0a4d5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67d8161efdbe83275d1fb7b7","year":"2025","volume":"109","number":"1","documentHash":"bce49b60-bdab-414b-baa0-34315072638c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646943271"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6839981efdbe8368347a8916","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bulska","documentHash":"a30c2c58-4a2f-468d-aa14-ebae2dc4ab11"},{"objectId":"6839981efdbe8368347a8915","name":"Julio","lastName":"Torres","documentHash":"d440c415-3c39-4deb-96d7-ce5c652d3084"},{"objectId":"6839981efdbe8368347a8914","name":"Tadeusz E.","lastName":"Kleindienst","documentHash":"b3b25b1b-496b-422f-9bf9-2f708e303b08"},{"objectId":"6839981efdbe8368347a8913","name":"Michael","lastName":"Lewandowski","documentHash":"e62e4078-eee2-4373-a461-2a91243d8236"},{"objectId":"6839981efdbe8368347a8912","name":"Mohammed","lastName":"Jaoui","documentHash":"79ca982c-194f-4605-9f35-fd84b62d7fc1"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5974","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rudziński","uuid":"3D506125510B3BBBBC100FED79F7B850A30F8D8147B86F25C7B7C88D7EE86B7DABC6B2827FC4B337FD7C25E356AF6293D4516CDEF0F0B5BB30FD46F7CBC466B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5785-9751","documentHash":"7412096e-82dd-41fd-a947-0b5456249825"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Szmigielski","uuid":"8BA441832175E89B21F79F78CE35C01EAE6DA9568D355F2A4BFC7D823AB2D6D5C83D7B8E06C8BBC3896462D090D1BFEEFF6AC20665089B7B419A5802C9DAD013","orcidId":"0000-0003-3389-9318","documentHash":"b9e87d98-9f5d-4922-852b-1896bf4792e3"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abeff","name":"Klara","lastName":"Nestorowicz","uuid":"03CE110605628DDBCD2B7ED6AD24CC00D7A45FE4EE4C3AB4CC1D6737579AF086BCBA0F83F2207DB648C2C2146DB43761190D6C44A28CF01FFF8789E1845DA6B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2709-373X","documentHash":"9e60ad04-7ea1-4aa1-9cb7-8e9e04bcd7ce"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa962","name":"Witold","lastName":"DANIKIEWICZ","uuid":"4144C54101211FBFA430D2C641D6E8601A26E75AB20091C988767B01DC9623C56A8F3E2F687F68F7BC4D9FA413AA618C60DCDB64ED03FF23177A94C80873371D","orcidId":"0000-0003-0484-2689","documentHash":"66795042-9335-4541-8700-d2f1c91c8685"}],"objectId":"6839981efdbe8368347a8910","doi":"10.5194/acp-25-1401-2025","publicUri":"https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/25/1401/2025/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Atmospheric oxidation of 1,3-butadiene: influence of seed aerosol acidity and relative humidity on SOA composition and the production of air toxic compounds","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigated the effect of relative humidity (RH) on the chemical composition of gas and particle phases formed from the photooxidation of 1,3-butadiene (13BD) in the presence of NOx under acidified and non-acidified seed aerosol. The experiments were conducted in a 14.5 m3 smog chamber operated in a steady-state mode. Products were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. More than 50 oxygenated products were identified, including 33 oxygenated organics, 10 organosulfates (OSs), PAN, APAN, glyoxal, formaldehyde, and acrolein. Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass and reaction products formed depended on RH and on the acidity of the seed aerosol. Based on the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM), the seed aerosol originated from the acidified and non-acidified solutions was found to exist under aqueous and solid phases, respectively. Although the terms \"acidified\" and \"non-acidified\" are true for the solutions from which the seeds were atomized, there are far more fundamental differences between the phase states in which species partition to or from (aqueous/solid), which considerably affects their partitioning and formation mechanisms. SOA mass and most SOA products (i) were higher under acidified seed conditions, where the aerosol particles were deliquescent, than under non-acidified seed conditions, where the aerosol particles did not contain any aqueous phase; (ii) increased with the acidity of the aerosol aqueous phase in the experiments under acidified seed conditions; and (iii) decreased with increasing RH. Glyceric acid, threitols, threonic acids, four dimers, three unknowns, and four organosulfates were among the main species measured under either acidified or non-acidified conditions across all RH levels. Total secondary organic carbon and carbon yield decreased with increasing RH under both acidified and non-acidified seed conditions. The photochemical reactivity of 13BD in our systems decreased with increasing RH and was faster under non-acidified than acidified seed conditions. To determine the contribution of 13BD products to ambient aerosol, we analyzed PM2.5 samples collected at three European monitoring stations located in Poland. The occurrence of several 13BD SOA products (e.g., glyceric acid, tartronic acid, threonic acid, tartaric acid, and OSs) in the field samples suggests that 13BD could contribute to ambient aerosol formation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abeff","5e70937a878c28a0473aa962","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1401-1432","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6839981efdbe8368347a8912","5e709386878c28a0473abeff","6839981efdbe8368347a8913","6839981efdbe8368347a8914","6839981efdbe8368347a8915","6839981efdbe8368347a8916","5e70937a878c28a0473aa962","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724d","mniswId":"2026","title":"Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics","issn":"1680-7316","eissn":"1680-7324","documentHash":"767f0fa0-a1ba-4887-b209-a40652902fe4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839981efdbe8368347a8911","year":"2025","volume":"25","number":"2","documentHash":"f5aa362f-04a8-4ad9-97a5-d16a23d77d6c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646943326"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f9","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Szunerits","documentHash":"b8fe10b4-c23e-4971-8cdd-fe566f414c25"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f8","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Corradini","documentHash":"8d8fe775-3349-4812-b448-1a0fb2021d74"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f7","name":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Knoll","documentHash":"ef7401a4-1a0f-4cf8-8eea-df0adbd895cd"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f6","name":"Rabah","lastName":"Boukherroub","documentHash":"5724828a-dfee-4bdf-8e97-69b7b7813ca8"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f5","name":"Christophe","lastName":"Kleber","documentHash":"af71ca5d-563e-49c6-a5a7-04ecd23b70fa"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f4","name":"Henri","lastName":"Happy","documentHash":"331ae38a-791a-4c2e-9799-cbffb49c229b"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f3","name":"Christophe","lastName":"Ritzenthaler","documentHash":"ffbb02ef-ec79-45c8-a6cf-e4f1a4c259cb"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f2","name":"David","lastName":"Montaigne","documentHash":"35ef43ad-7e1a-4a54-9b85-1d7c87f2c8ea"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f1","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Basini","documentHash":"f5a41efe-914f-4b25-b4ce-0501ae26074b"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f0","name":"Subhankar","lastName":"Sahu","documentHash":"b5245965-eab9-421b-a1e8-0c1688adde3c"},{"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1ef","name":"Rupali","lastName":"Bagale","documentHash":"2da2810c-10fb-4de3-9f33-5b4f1e2b4b90"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cd","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Filipiak","uuid":"4A3EFAC077913881A21620F3BD3883D3D9CAE1BFB7452E1E95B12CE8907CA40ED8499A8B93799913834723BCB4E6F633EF10BD901F0C860A247932364C7921F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7649-4890","documentHash":"b6ccfa28-36a3-4554-8b06-c496eb856933"}],"objectId":"68399b8afdbe8368347ac1ee","doi":"10.1007/s10008-025-06225-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10008-025-06225-0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Making field effect transistor measurements accessible to electrochemists and biologists","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Field effect transistors (FETs), originally developed in the field of electronic engineering, have gained increasing prominence in biosensing due to their versatile operation characteristics, ranging from recording simple electrical transfer curves to performing chronoamperometric measurements. Commonly known as bioFETs, these devices typically feature low gate voltage operation characteristics, can be made highly selective/sensitive through bioreceptor integration, label-free and do not rely on redox mediators or enzymatic product detection, and are easy to interface with microfluidic or flow cell devices. Despite their advantages, electrochemists and biologists remain still hesitant to explore the possibilities of bioFETs, owing to concerns about investment costs and the complexity of the read-out tools. In this study, we demonstrate the use of a simple, cost-effective bipotentiostat platform, providing an accessible solution for those interested in electronic biosensing without the need to delve into complex electronics. As a proof-of-concept, we showcase the working principle of a graphene-based bioFET for sensing a cardiac biomarker using a peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-aptamer-modified gFET platform. This article focuses on how to easily develop/operate FETs for biosensing measurements using the bipotentiostat-setup and discloses its simplicity over the conventional approaches."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"2385-2394","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68399b8afdbe8368347ac1ef","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f0","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f1","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f2","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f3","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f4","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f5","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f6","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f7","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f8","68399b8afdbe8368347ac1f9","5e70938b878c28a0473ac6cd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a8b","mniswId":"12673","title":"Journal of Solid State Electrochemistry","issn":"1432-8488","eissn":"1433-0768","documentHash":"ee44a083-0fb3-4ee3-b7dc-2f36525cc775"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68343d9cfdbe8360ebc3752e","year":"2025","volume":"29","number":"6","documentHash":"034257f7-3c67-4ab4-9ea5-09df01190e4a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646943376"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbed","name":"Pankaj","lastName":"Yadav","documentHash":"f42fc2e2-00e0-4e81-be9a-b83e0ff4feda"},{"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbec","name":"Seckin","lastName":"Akin","documentHash":"627e592d-e329-43d2-8057-6e9566ba99ec"},{"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbeb","name":"Abul","lastName":"Kalam","documentHash":"db2766b8-b67b-4fa2-a527-11b0a6ae9e06"},{"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbea","name":"Siddhi Vinayak","lastName":"Pandey","documentHash":"5663e893-8a40-451b-acbc-19eb232e01e5"},{"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbe9","name":"Raj Dashrath","lastName":"Patel","documentHash":"e136b4df-5d5f-462a-a6cd-65f0c016b5c9"},{"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbe8","name":"Kushal","lastName":"Unjiya","documentHash":"ecd2c722-e830-48ce-9021-5abdd8f38f08"},{"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbe7","name":"Kunjrani","lastName":"Sorathia","documentHash":"6c82ba2d-5ee0-45ca-ae58-6d95ef0439f9"},{"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbe6","name":"Vimi","lastName":"Patel","documentHash":"ea9d1209-9dbb-4a11-b793-8b6d0ab6cebd"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Prochowicz","uuid":"B14FDD15DC4D332629639D31EA8EC0E29B3D1824618BFEA90C1BDE304B430F6B7C706DF88C27F8B9B218857B2123970FC9B31438C1818BAC1070B650A42E8051","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-5637","documentHash":"7be76402-39d9-4097-9064-4d80a1a9dce8"}],"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbe4","doi":"10.1039/d4dt03123g","publicUri":"https://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=D4DT03123G","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Machine learning-driven analysis of activation energy for metal halide perovskites","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Metal halide perovskite single crystals (MHPSCs) are highly promising materials for optoelectronic applications, but their stability is hindered by ion migration, thereby impacting their performance. A key factor to understand this issue is calculating the activation energy. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful technique for separating ionic and electronic processes, yet traditional analysis is labour-intensive, involving extensive measurements, circuit fitting, and manual data interpretation. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML)-driven approach to fully automate EIS analysis. EIS data, collected for MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 across temperatures from 263 K to 343 K, enabled the creation of a large database. The developed ML model predicts EIS spectra at unknown temperatures, fits the appropriate electrical circuit, and automatically extracts passive component values to calculate the activation energy via an Arrhenius plot. This automated workflow streamlines the calculation process, offering fast and reliable activation energy predictions even when temperature data are incomplete or missing. Our approach enhances the efficiency of EIS analysis, providing valuable insights into the stability and performance of MHP SCs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"54","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"4637-4644","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68399d46fdbe8368347adbe6","68399d46fdbe8368347adbe7","68399d46fdbe8368347adbe8","68399d46fdbe8368347adbe9","68399d46fdbe8368347adbea","68399d46fdbe8368347adbeb","5e709411878c28a0473b5bf4","68399d46fdbe8368347adbec","68399d46fdbe8368347adbed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778f6","mniswId":"4868","title":"Dalton Transactions","doi":"10.1039/c5dt","issn":"1477-9226","eissn":"1477-9234","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/dt","documentHash":"36c7053d-ce23-4ec3-9b37-3552e1f9c3ba"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68399d46fdbe8368347adbe5","year":"2025","volume":"54","number":"11","documentHash":"5a5cb8af-6dd5-4939-91a1-2c6c72c10495"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646943391"}]
